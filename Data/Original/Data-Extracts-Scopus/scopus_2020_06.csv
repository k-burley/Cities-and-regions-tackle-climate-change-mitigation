EVs are key infrastructure for achieving a sustainable energy future since EV usage can support in achieving CO2 reduction. However, the deployment of EVs for eMobility is highly dependent on data integration of mobility solutions from different stakeholders involved in urban transportation. Respectively, data integration from different mobility services will result to cost reduction and create valued added services to citizens. Therefore, there is need to achieve data integration not only for physical systems but for all domains in providing mobility related services that can be synergically applied to citizens and stakeholders in order to develop innovative solutions at district and urban level. Therefore, this study adopts Enterprise Architecture (EA) for digital transformations of eMobility services for sustainable transportation. Action research methodology was employed and secondary data from the literature was presented in the industrial data space reference architecture to initially validate digital transformation of electro mobility. Findings from this study reveal that EA support digital transformation of eMobility in managing data integration to support cities to implement sustainable transportation services. © 2020 ACM.","Data integration; Digital transformation; Electric vehicles; Emobility; Energy informatics; Enterprise architecture; Sustainable transportation","Cost reduction; Industrial research; Metadata; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Digital transformation; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Enterprise Architecture; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovative solutions; Reference architecture; Sustainable transportation; Valued added services; Data integration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088597665

The ratio of the oxygen and carbon cross sections is also provided to help validate various models' ability to extrapolate between carbon and oxygen nuclear targets, as is required in T2K oscillation analyses. The data are taken using a neutrino beam with an energy spectrum peaked at 0.6 GeV. The extracted measurement is compared with the prediction from different Monte Carlo neutrino-nucleus interaction event generators, showing particular model separation for very forward-going muons.

In systems that are coherently driven, so-called blockades can give rise to strong correlations according to two scenarios based on level repulsion (conventional blockade) or interferences (unconventional blockade). Here, we show how these two approaches relate to the admixing of a coherent state with a quantum state such as a squeezed state for the simplest and most recurrent case. The emission from a variety of systems, such as resonance fluorescence, the Jaynes-Cummings model, or microcavity polaritons, as a few examples of a large family of quantum optical sources, are shown to be particular cases of such admixtures, that can further be doctored up externally by adding an amplitude- and phase-controlled coherent field with the effect of tuning the photon statistics from exactly zero to infinity. We show how such an understanding also allows to classify photon statistics throughout platforms according to conventional and unconventional features, with the effect of optimizing the correlations and with possible spectroscopic applications. In particular, we show how configurations that can realize simultaneously conventional and unconventional antibunching bring the best of both worlds: huge antibunching (unconventional) with large populations and being robust to dephasing (conventional). © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Jaynes-Cummings model; Coherence function; Micro-cavity polaritons; Photon correlation; Photon statistics; Resonance fluorescences; Spectroscopic application; Strong correlation; Unconventional features; Photons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087155112

It is of great practical importance in the basin to allocate water resources for ensuring the security of food production, and to formulate effective science-based agro-ecological management policies to address climate change impacts due to the probable effects of future changing environment on regional ET. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were first driven by the downscaled climate data from three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that have been projected by five General circulation models (GCMs) in the Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) and the water-saving irrigation scenario to project ET per unit area, we then added to the model the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale that considered the ecological health to simulate the behaviour of total ET for the period 2021–2050. Finally 12 case study scenarios were used to separate the effects of climate change and human activity on total ET. The results showed that total ET can be significantly decreased by &gt;1.22 × 108 m3 when the RCP-water-saving irrigation scenarios were combined with the appropriate agricultural scale. The results suggest that the best set of strategies to reduce agricultural water consumption is to reduce the area of arable land through consideration of ecosystem health and aggressively utilize water-saving agricultural technology to counter the increased ET brought about by future climate change in the Heihe agricultural region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Appropriate agricultural scale; Evapotranspiration; Heihe agricultural region; RCP scenarios; SWAT model; Water-saving irrigation","Climate models; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Water conservation; Water supply; Appropriate agricultural scale; Heihe agricultural region; RCP scenarios; SWAT model; Water-saving irrigation; Climate change; climate change; CMIP; ecosystem health; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; human activity; hydrological cycle; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075339595

The emission properties of RE-doped glasses depend on their chemical composition, but they can also be tailored by modifying the surrounding active ions. Typically, this is achieved through heat treatment (including continuous-wave and pulsed lasers) after establishing the ordering mechanisms in the particular glass–RE system. Within the known systems, silicate glasses predominate, while much less work relates to materials with lower energy phonons, which allow more efficient radiation sources to be constructed for photonic applications. In the present work, the luminescent and structural properties of germanate glasses modified with phosphate oxide doped with Eu3+ ions were investigated. Europium dopant was used as a “spectroscopic probe” in order to analyze the luminescence spectra, which characterizes the changes in the local site symmetries of Eu3+ ions. Based on the spectroscopic results, a strong influence of P2 O5 content was observed on the excitation and luminescence spectra. The luminescence study of the most intense5 D0 →7 F2 (electric dipole) transition revealed that the increase in the P2 O5 content leads to the linewidth reduction (from 15 nm to 10 nm) and the blue shift (~2 nm) of the emission peak. According to the crystal field theory, the introduction of P2 O5 into the glass structure changes the splitting number of sublevels of the5 D0 →7 F1 (magnetic dipole) transition, confirming the higher polymerization of fabricated glass. The slightly different local environment of Eu3+ centers the results in a number of sites and causes inhomogeneous broadening of spectral lines. It was found that the local asymmetry ratio estimated by the relation of (5 D0 →7 F2 )/(5 D0 →7 F1 ) transitions also confirms greater changes in local symmetry around Eu3+ ions. Our results indicate that modification of germanate glass by P2 O5 allows control of their structural properties in order to functionalize the emissions for application as luminescent light sources and sensors. © 2020 by the authors.

The study drew from a partner station population of 1705 stations - a significantly larger pool than was available for prior studies. Data indicated that whole gas emission rates from components on gathering stations were comparable to or higher than emission factors utilized by the EPA's greenhouse gas reporting program (GHGRP) but less than emission factors used for similar components on transmission compressor stations. Field data also indicated that the national population of stations likely has a higher fraction of smaller stations, operating at lower throughput per station, than the data used to develop the per-station emission factor used in EPA's greenhouse gas inventory (GHGI). This was the first national study to incorporate extensive activity data reported to the GHGRP, including 319 basin-level reports, covering 15,895 reported compressors. Combining study emission data with 2017 GHGRP activity data, the study indicated statistically lower national emissions of 1290 [1246-1342] Gg methane per year or 66% [64-69%] of current GHGI estimates, despite estimating 17% [12-22%] more stations than the 2017 GHGI (95% confidence interval).

The carbon dioxide in the biogas can be converted into methane using hydrogen generated from water electrolysis through an approach referred to as power-to-gas. Recently, hydrogen has been added to digesters as an in-situ or ex-situ biogas upgrade to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide. Biogas production systems consist of microbial complexes with highly organized microorganisms in different niches, which can either produce or consume hydrogen. However, the produced endogenous hydrogen should be constantly consumed to maintain a low hydrogen partial pressure. This review addresses the biochemical processes of anaerobic digestion and hydrogen-related microorganisms, including fermentative acid-producing bacteria, syntrophic organic acid degrading bacteria, syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, homoacetogens, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and newly reported hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogens. This study also investigates (1) the role of endogenous hydrogen as an intermediate metabolite and of interspecies electron transfer in anaerobic digestion, (2) effects of exogenous hydrogen addition on microbial community structure and metabolic processes, and (3) recent developments regarding in-situ and ex-situ biogas upgrading systems via hydrogen addition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas upgrading; Endogenous hydrogen; Exogenous hydrogen; Microbiology","Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Metabolites; Methanogens; Wastewater treatment; Acid producing bacterium; Biogas production systems; Clean energy sources; Hydrogen partial pressures; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Intermediate metabolites; Microbial community structures; Organic solid wastes; Hydrogen production; biofuel; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; methane; anaerobic growth; bacterium; bioreactor; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Hydrogen; Methane; Microbiota",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085261968

The effects of the NO3−:NH4+ ratio (0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0) in the nutrient solution on growth, pigment content, photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll (Chl) precursor content, and chloroplast mitochondrial ultrastructure of lettuce leaves were evaluated to determine the appropriate N ratio for the growth of lettuce. The results showed that a ratio of nitrate to ammonium of 75:25 compared with the single N form resulted in significantly higher fresh weights in the shoots and the lower parts of the lettuce. The growth rate, as indicated by the CO2 response curve, was increased because of the carboxylation efficiency and dark respiration rate (Rday) of the lettuce seedlings, and the difference between the light compensation point and CO2 compensation point was reduced under single nitrate N treatment. The contents of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen, uroporphyrinogen III, protoporphyrin IX, and Mg-protoporphyrin IX in seedlings at 75:25 nitrate:ammonium were higher than those in seedlings under the other treatments. The contents of Chl a and b were also the highest when the ratio of nitrate ammonium was 75:25. The chloroplast structure of lettuce leaves was intact, the cell membrane was completely closed to the cell wall, and the organelles were closely arranged on the cell membrane. The chloroplast was spindle-shaped and full of vesicles. The whole mitochondria were rich, the base particles were rich, the base granules were clear and rich, and the mitochondria exhibited the overall best state with a complete structure, rich sputum, and dense inclusions. The above results show that the nutrient solution with a ratio of nitrate to ammonium of 75:25 was more conducive to Chl synthesis and the promotion of photosynthesis and root growth in lettuce seedlings than the other treatments. The single nitrate N nutrient solution reduced Chl synthesis and photosynthesis in lettuce seedlings, while the single ammonium N nutrient solution affected the growth of lettuce seedlings, resulting in lower growth of lettuce shoots and roots. Therefore, the nutrient solution ratio of nitrate to ammonium of 75:25 is the most suitable for the lettuce seedling growth. © 2020, Korean Society for Horticultural Science.","Chl precursor; Chlorophyll (Chl); Lettuce; Nitrogen (N) ratio; Photosynthetic parameters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083460379

To provide fundamental information on future temperature extremes over Southeast Asia (SEA), projected changes in temperature extreme indices are evaluated for different seasons at 1.5 °C and 2 °C GWLs against the historical reference period of 1976–2005 based on the ensemble of CORDEX simulations. Results show that the temperature indices increase significantly across the Indochina Peninsula and Maritime Continent at both GWLs except for decreasing daily temperature range (DTR) in the dry season, with more pronounced magnitudes at 2 °C GWL. Moreover, the regionally averaged ensemble medians of the indices show various changes over different subregions. At 1.5 °C and 2 °C GWLs, most pronounced increases of threshold indices. i.e. summer days (SU) and tropical nights (TR), are projected in Sumatra and Sulawesi for both wet and dry seasons. The warm spell duration (WSDI) increases generally, with strongest magnitudes for Sumatra and Sulawesi (Philippines and Sulawesi) in the wet (dry) season. On the other hand, significant increases of warm days and nights can also be observed at 2 °C GWL compared to 1.5 °C, particularly in the dry season, suggesting the high sensitivity of temperature extremes over the SEA. The projected potentially conspicuous temperature extremes under global warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C primarily concentrate on the densely populated coastal regions of the main islands, showing the necessity of restricting global warming to 1.5 °C aiming at the eradication and reduction of regional climate stress for the human system in the developing countries over the SEA. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Extreme temperature; Paris Agreement; Seasonal variation; Southeast Asia","Developing countries; Drought; Daily temperature ranges; Extreme temperatures; Indochina Peninsula; Maritime Continent; Seasonal variation; Southeast Asia; Temperature extremes; Wet and dry seasons; Global warming; dry season; environmental risk; extreme event; global warming; high temperature; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; international agreement; seasonal variation; temperature effect; Asia; Greater Sunda Islands; Indochina; Philippines; Sulawesi; Sumatra; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078034728

In this research, both experimental and numerical studies were conducted on an aerogel glazing system. In order to provide climate adaptive designs on the aerogel glazing system with optimal geometric and operating parameters, a generic optimization methodology was developed by flexibly integrating supervised machine learning and advanced teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization methodology was thereafter used for optimal system designs in different climate regions. Results indicate that the proposed surrogate model can intelligently and accurately learn and update the optimization function with straightforward mathematical associations between multivariables and objectives. In addition, within optimal cases, total heat gain and heat flux are dominated by the extinction coefficient in southern cities, whereas the total heat gain is dominated by the thermal conductivity in the northern city, LanZhou. By adopting the proposed technique in this study, compared to optimal results following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array, the total heat gain can be reduced by 62.5% to 36.27 kWh/m2 in LanZhou, and by 5.9% to 267.18 kWh/m2 in GuangZhou, respectively.

Simultaneously, meeting the growing consumer demand is one of the reasons for the increase in energy use. This study investigates the impacts of household consumption on energy use and CO2 emissions from the perspective of the lifestyle of Chinese residents. On the basis of the input–output model of 30 provinces, we analyze the current situation of energy use and CO2 emissions in different regions (spatial scale) with economic development and income improvement (time scale), investigate the pulling effect of household consumption in different provinces on industrial sectors, examine the influencing factors of indirect CO2 emissions from food, clothing, housing, and transportation in key regions, and explore the policy implications of the transition to a low-carbon lifestyle in different provinces. Results show that the fuel structure of Chinese residents should be optimized further. Total household energy consumption and total CO2 emissions considerably increased. In 2012, total household energy consumption accounted for nearly 30% of total energy consumption, while indirect CO2 emissions accounted for 66.3% of total household emissions. With regard to the structures of indirect household energy consumption, the housing sector accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 23.4% in indirect energy consumption in 2012. The pulling effect of the housing sector on industrial sectors was also evident. The decomposition analysis showed that the rapid increase in indirect household CO2 emissions was primarily due to the increase in per capita living expenditure. The consumption structures in different provinces produced various impacts, and the energy intensity effect was identified as an important factor for reducing indirect household CO2 emissions. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","CO2 emissions; Household living consumption; Input–output model; Logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition; Regional differences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087947460

Predicting natural gas consumption therefore is becoming crucial in such situations. In order to obtain accurate forecasts of natural gas consumption, this study has designed a novel discrete grey model considering nonlinearity and fluctuation, which can overcome the inherent drawbacks of the traditional discrete grey model and its optimized variants. Besides, to further enhance the forecasting performance of this proposed model, the Cultural Algorithm (CA) is employed to optimally determine the emerging parameters of this model. Subsequently, two empirical examples are provided for verifying the efficacy and reliability of the new model by comparing with other existing grey models and statistical models. Lastly, based on the original observations from 2005 to 2017, the novel model is built for predicting the total natural gas demand in Jiangsu province in China. The results indicate that the new model is much superior to other competitors, offering more accurate and reliable performances in the aspect of lower errors in both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Then, based on the above projections, several main reasons for low gas consumption and reasonable suggestions are put forward for Jiangsu's government, which has high potential to boost gas demand in the coming future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural algorithm; Grey prediction model; Natural gas consumption prediction","Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Cultural algorithms; Discrete grey models; Forecasting natural gas consumption; Forecasting performance; Low carbon energies; Natural gas consumption; Out-of-sample forecast; Reliable performance; Natural gas; algorithm; government; greenhouse gas; model; natural gas; observational method; China; Jiangsu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082749527

Previous studies use multivariate regression or panel models to explore the impact of the industrial structure on regional carbon emissions differences based on time series data or panel data from the perspective of one-dimensional continuous variables. However, there are also regional differences in the factors affecting regional carbon emission differences, such as the economic development level, the industrial structure, and urbanization. The regional carbon emission difference matrix and the influencing factor difference matrix are relational variables, and it is difficult for traditional multiple regression analysis to study the relationship between relational variables. Thus, this paper proposes the perspective of two-dimensional difference relations for studying the influencing factors of regional carbon emission differences based on Quadratic Assignment Procedure model. Energy consumption and the value added by industrial processes in various industries from 30 regions in China are taken as the sample. The results of this study are as follows: carbon emissions are increasing and the differences in carbon emissions between regions are also increasing. There are obvious regional differences in the industrial structure, economic growth, population and urbanization in China. The influence and magnitude of the impact of regional industrial structure differences on regional carbon emission differences vary from year to year. Interregional differences in industry, construction and transportation and warehousing industries had a significantly positive impact on interregional differences in carbon emissions from 2007 to 2016. By analyzing the impact of the influence mechanism of regional industrial structure differences on carbon emissions, the findings of this study can identify some suggestions for regionally balanced emission reduction policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Influencing factors; QAP model; Regional carbon emission differences; Regional industrial structure differences","Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Matrix algebra; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Continuous variables; Emission reduction policies; Evolutionary perspective; Industrial structures; Influencing factors; Multiple regression analysis; Multivariate regression; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079357166

For this dual-emission characteristic, the short-wavelength emission reveals unique excitation-dependent fluorescence behavior, during which the long-wavelength emission remains unshifted regardless of the excitation. Consequently, such excitation-dependent ratiometric dual emission can be applied into a fluorescent tint control of this material between the cold and warm white-light regions. This unique property allows the CDs to be further translated into film sheets for visual detection of the irradiation source, and to also be conjugated with calf thymus DNA for multichannel bioimaging.

However, few studies have used an approach of vegetation indices for estimating methane emissions in paddy fields from ground-based hyperspectral data. Therefore, this study systematically analyzed the quantitative relationship of methane emissions from rice fields to hyperspectral vegetation indices based on hyperspectral reflectance data of rice canopy. A field experiment was designed with two nighttime warming levels, that is, nighttime warming and control (ambient temperature), and two irrigation levels, that is, flooding (control, with 5 cm depth of water layer) and wetting (water saving irrigation, without water layer). Results showed that the newly developed three-band index (R1139 − R960)/(R1139 + R960 − 2R944) (Rλ is the reflectance value at wavelength λ) was recommended as the optimal index for monitoring methane emission from paddy field, generated coefficients of determination, root mean square error, and residual prediction deviation values between the measured and predicted values of 0.687, 1.424 mg m−2 h−1, and 1.83, respectively.

Here, we use ground-level observations and model simulations to examine the nationwide spatial-temporal variations of six air pollutants before and after the initiation of First-Level Public Health Emergency Response. The level of ambient NO2 declined significantly, and in most cities, the decline was dominated by reduced emissions. Meanwhile, the level of O3 increased significantly during this period, and the nonmeteorological factors explained the increase. For the other air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, and CO), the observed declines on the national scale were obviously affected by the meteorological conditions. In Wuhan, significant declines were found for air pollutants except O3 and emissions dominated the changes, while in Beijing during the same period, only the level of NO2 significantly declined. This study clearly shows that the meteorological changes contributed substantially to the observed changes in most air pollutants, and this must be considered in evaluating the impacts of pollutant source changes on air quality during the specific event and in assessing source-oriented risks.

Nevertheless, there are many shortcomings, such as high photogenerated electron-hole recombination rate and poor light stability, that hinder the further development of artificial photosynthesis. Thus, inspired by the natural photosynthesis of green plants, a 3D spatial reticulation all-solid-state artificial direct Z-scheme photocatalyst is manufactured to solve the above problems by using a graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) shell encapsulating Cu2O nanowire arrays/Cu mesh (g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs/CM). Consequently, the CH3OH formation rate and the selectivity of g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs reached 22.6 ppm cm-2 h-1 and 94.9% under solar light irradiation, respectively. More importantly, the material retained 94.7% of its primary catalytic activity after 60 h test (ten reaction cycles). It is attributed to the protective g-C3N4 layer and the synergetic effect between interface carrier separation modulation and relatively short radial transmission channel design. This strategy provides unique insights into the design and preparation of efficient practical photocatalysts for energy synthesis. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","carbon dioxide; energy conversion; g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs/CM; photoreduction; Z-scheme photocatalysts","Artificial graphite; Carbon dioxide; Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Copper oxides; Nanowires; Oxide minerals; Carrier separation; Light stability; Nano-engineering; Photocatalytic reduction; Photogenerated electrons; Solar light irradiation; Synergetic effect; Transmission channels; Artificial photosynthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087700889

It reflects the hydrological consequences caused by topographic, land cover, and climatic factors, and is an important tool to characterize and predict the hydrological responses to climate and landscape change. In the Loess Plateau region, a large number of reservoirs have been constructed to trap sediment and storage water for drinking, irrigation, and industries. The land cover has been significantly reshaped in the past decades. These changes may alter the watershed hydrological connectivity. In this study, we mapped the spatial pattern of hydrological connectivity with consideration of reservoir impedances, mitigation of climate, and land cover in the Yan River watershed on the Loess Plateau by using the network index (NI) approach that is based on topographical wetness index. Three wetness indices were used, i.e., topographical wetness index (TWI), SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) wetness index (WIS), and wetness index adopted aridity index (AI) determined by precipitation and evapotranspiration (WIPE). In addition, the effective catchment area (ECA) was also employed to reveal the connectivity of reservoirs and river networks to water source areas. Results show that ECA of reservoirs and rivers account for 35% and 65%, respectively; the hydrological connectivity to the reservoir was lower than that to the river networks. The normalized hydrological connectivity revealed that the connectivity to river channels maintained the same distribution pattern but with a decreased range after construction of reservoirs. As revealed by comparing the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity quantified by NI based on WIS and WIPE respectively, vegetation cover patterns had significantly alternated watershed hydrological connectivity. These results imply a decreased volume of flow in river channels after reservoir construction, but with same temporal period of flow dynamic.

The main purpose of this study is to explore the relation of financial development to CO2 emissions at the provincial level in China by static and dynamic analysis, which is rarely investigated. The Principal Component Analysis is applied to avoid the indicator correlation problem that usually exited in prior studies, and generate a provincial financial development index in China since 2001. Through the static panel analysis, it is found that one standard increment in provincial financial development level will reduce CO2 emissions by 4%–5% on average, nevertheless, it increases the CO2 emissions of Zhejiang, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi and Xinjiang. In the long term, it exists that the two-way causality between regional financial development and CO2 emissions, whereas it's not true for the short term. The dynamic analysis results demonstrate that the regional financial development has significantly lagged inhibitory effects on CO2 emissions. Examining the effects of financial development on CO2 emissions at reginal level in China yields strong recommendation that China should put far focus on developing her financial sector, and also may provide some references for the provincial policymaker regarding CO2 emissions reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese province; CO2 emissions; Financial development index; Principal component analysis","Emission control; Finance; Principal component analysis; CO2 emissions; Financial development; Financial development level; Financial sectors; Inhibitory effect; Short term; Static and dynamic analysis; Zhejiang; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; correlation; development level; dynamic analysis; economic development; principal component analysis; regional development; China; Fujian; Shaanxi; Sichuan; Yunnan; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083064911

Density functional calculations have been carried out to explore the reaction mechanism and the origin of selectivity. The porphyrin ligand was found to be redox noninnocent and accept two electrons and one proton, while the ferrous ion keeps its oxidation state as +2 during the reduction. The FeII-porphyrin diradical intermediate then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2, coupled with two electron transfers from the porphyrin ligand to the CO2 moiety. Subsequently, an intramolecular proton transfer takes place from the porphyrin nitrogen to the carboxylate oxygen, affording an FeII-COOH intermediate. An alternative pathway to form the critical FeII-COOH intermediate, involving the attack on CO2 by an unprotonated two-electron reduced FeII-porphyrin diradical species followed by protonation, was found to be possible as well. Finally, proton transfer from the carbonic acid in the aqueous solution to the hydroxyl moiety results in the cleavage of the C-O bond and the production of a CO molecule. The formation of an FeII-hydride species, a critical intermediate for the production of H2 and formic acid, was found to be kinetically much less favorable than the protonation of the porphyrin nitrogen, even though it is thermodynamically more favorable. The prevention of this metal-hydride formation pathway explains why this catalyst is highly selective for the reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution.

Traffic emissions are among the important anthropogenic CH4 emission sources in megacities, yet CH4 emissions from on-road vehicles are less characterized and not well addressed. Based on tunnel tests in an urban tunnel in south China, a real-world emission factor (EF) of CH4 was measured to be 0.26±0.03 g·km−1 (mean ±95% C.I.) for on-road vehicle fleet which including gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles, with an average CH4/CO2 mass ratio of 40.6E-5 g·g−1, and CH4 could account for 1.3% of vehicle CO2-equivalent emissions. Using the measured CH4/CO2 ratio and available automobile CO2 emission estimates, trafficCH4 emissions in 2014 could have reached 333 Gg and represented 0.6% of total anthropogenic CH4 emissions in China, approximately four times the previous reported value of 79 Gg. Our results indicate that improving energy efficiency would have co-benefits for reducing traffic emissions of CH4, as observed EFs of CH4 are positively correlated with that of CO2, and over 90% of trafficCH4 emissions in China could be avoided if the trafficCH4/CO2 ratio can be an order of magnitude lower as previously observed in a tunnel in Switzerland. © 2020 The Author(s).

Herein, nickel cobalt phosphate (NiCo-Pi) was introduced into graphitic carbon nitride layers (g-C3N4)viaa sonication-assisted ion intercalation method as a substitute for noble metal co-catalysts. Under visible light irradiation, NiCo-Pi/g-C3N4(Ni/Co molar ratio of 4 : 5) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (ca.10 184 μmol h−1g−1) and stability for H2evolution. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicated that NiCo-Pi is closely bound to g-C3N4viacovalent binding, which accelerates electron transport. Moreover, the unoccupied d-orbital in NiCo-Pi causes the surface to strongly adsorb atomic hydrogen (*H). Theoretically, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the d-band center position of NiCo-Pi is relocated upon adjusting the Ni/Co molar ratio, which changes the adsorption energy of NiCo-Pi toward intermediate state *H.

To support climate preparedness and resilience planning for the electric sector, this study (1) proposes a framework for assessing the vulnerability of electricity systems in the remainder of this century using the Washington metro area as a case study, (2) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of deploying rooftop photovoltaic (PV) technology, and (3) employs quantitative probabilistic risk analysis in order to enhance adaptation planning and decision making. The results indicate that by the end of the century, the probability of power outages could increase 70-fold in the Washington metro area under the business-as-usual scenario. If the peak load on the electrical grid is cut by three quarters, the probability of outages could rise 20-fold. This reduction is achievable by installing solar panels on building roofs. There is about 136.45 m2 of suitable roof area for solar PV in the Washington metro area, which could add a generation capacity of 13.02 GW to the existing power system. The benefits of using rooftop PV to reduce the peak load on the power grid by 25%, 50%, and 75% are significantly greater than the costs when environmental impacts are considered. The cost-effectiveness of PV strategies may increase in the future because of declining material and installation prices and because of increased social cost of carbon emission. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Roofs; Global climate changes; Increasing temperatures; Photovoltaic technology; Probabilistic risk analysis; Probability of outage; Rising temperatures; Social cost of carbon; Urban Heat Island Effects; Outages; climate change; decision making; electricity generation; energy efficiency; metropolitan area; photovoltaic system; temperature anomaly; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083517555

To better understand the interaction between haze pollution and climate, we performed direct CCN measurements in the winter of 2018 at the Gucheng site, a typical polluted suburban site in North China Plain (NCP). The results show that the average CCN concentrations were 3.81 × 103 cm−3, 5.35 × 103 cm−3, 9.74 × 103 cm−3, 1.27 × 104 cm−3, 1.44 × 104 cm−3 at measured supersaturation levels of 0.114%, 0.148%, 0.273%, 0.492% and 0.864%, respectively. Based on these observational data, we have further investigated two methods of calculating NCCN from: (1) bulk aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution; (2) bulk aerosol chemical composition and aerosol optical properties. Our results showed that both methods could well reproduce the observed concentration (R2 &gt; 0.88) and variability of NCCN with a 9% to 23% difference in the mean value. Further error analysis shows that the estimated NCCN tends to be underestimated by about 20% during the daytime while overestimated by &lt;10% at night compared with the measured NCCN. These results provide quantitative instructions for the NCCN prediction based on conventional aerosol measurements in the NCP. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol optical properties; Cloud condensation nuclei; Particle number size distribution","Aerosols; Condensation; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol measurement; Aerosol optical property; Cloud condensation nuclei; Conventional measurements; Formation and evolutions; Number concentration; Particle number size distribution; Optical properties; aerosol; aerosol composition; aerosol property; cloud condensation nucleus; cloud droplet; particle size; prediction; size distribution; aerosol; article; China; climate; concentration (parameter); haze; night; prediction; quantitative analysis; winter; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080058261

Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.), a native and fast growing species with high quality timber, is widely planted in southern China. Yet the mechanisms leading to tree mortality of Chinese fir plantations under climate change conditions is still not clearly understood. A long-term spacing trial including 60 permanent plots located in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces in southern China were used to explore tree mortality in relation to competition, age, structural diversity, and climatic variables using a logistic mixed effects model. Results showed that tree mortality increased with increasing LnN (natural logarithm of number of trees per ha), tree density index (TN), Gini coefficient, age (A), LnAP (natural logarithm of annual precipitation), and mean warmest month temperature, and decreased with increasing relative density (RD), inverse of diameter (1/D), and mean annual temperature. The relative contributions of competition, age and structure variables to mortality were 88.82%, much larger than climate variables 11.18%. In addition, in view of the contributions of stand factors, competition indices including RD, LnN, TN were 50.57%, much larger than age (A, 1/D) contribution of 37.45%, and structural diversity contribution of 0.80%, which indicated that competition was the main driver of tree mortality. Our findings highlight the mechanisms of tree mortality of Chinese fir in southern China under climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Age; Chinese fir; Climate; Competition; Stand structure; Tree mortality","Climate change; Competition; Ecosystems; Chinese fir; Climate; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Logistic mixed-effects models; Mean annual temperatures; Relative contribution; Stand structures; Tree mortality; Forestry; age structure; climate effect; coniferous forest; diameter; forest management; interspecific competition; mortality; plantation forestry; spacing; stand structure; Abies; Age; Chinese; Competition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Mortality; Trees; China; Fujian; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Jiangxi; Sichuan; Cunninghamia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082746031

Although the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) from tea plantations may be substantially influenced by soil pH reduction and intensive nitrogen fertilization, process model-based studies on this issue are still rare. In this study, the process-oriented biogeochemical model, Catchment Nutrient Management Model-DeNitrification-DeComposition (CNMM-DNDC), was modified by adding tea-growth-related processes that may induce a soil pH reduction. Using a dataset for intensively managed tea plantations at a subtropical site, the performances of the original and modified models for simulating the emissions of both gases subject to different fertilization alternatives and stand ages were evaluated. Compared with the observations in the early stage of a tea plantation, the original and modified models showed comparable performances for simulating the daily gas fluxes (with a Nash-Sutcliffe index (NSI) of 0.10 versus 0.18 for N2O and 0.32 versus 0.33 for NO), annual emissions (with an NSI of 0.81 versus 0.94 for N2O and 0.92 versus 0.94 for NO) and annual direct emission factors (EFds). For the modified model, the observations and simulations demonstrated that the short-term replacement of urea with oil cake stimulated N2O emissions by ∼ 62% and ∼ 36% and mitigated NO emissions by ∼ 25% and ∼ 14%, respectively. The model simulations resulted in a positive dependence of EFds of either gas on nitrogen doses, implicating the importance of model-based quantification of this key parameter for inventory purposes. In addition, the modified model with pH-related scientific processes showed overall inhibitory effects on the gases' emissions in the middle to late stages during a full tea plant lifetime. In conclusion, the modified CNMM-DNDC exhibits the potential for quantifying N2O and NO emissions from tea plantations under various conditions. Nevertheless, wider validation is still required for simulation of long-term soil pH variations and emissions of both gases from tea plantations. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Participants: Patients younger than 6 months with VSDs. Interventions: End-tidal carbon dioxide was increased by decreasing tidal volume or respiratory rate. Measurements and Main Results: The infants were randomly assigned to receive either sevoflurane (SA group) or midazolam-sufentanil based intravenous anesthesia (IA group). PETCO2 levels of 30 mmHg (T1), 35 mmHg (T2), 40 mmHg (T3), or 45 mmHg (T4) were obtained by adjusting the tidal volume and respiratory rate. There were no significant intergroup differences in rSO2. In the SA group, as PETCO2 increased from T1 to T4, rSO2 increased significantly from 68.8% ± 5.9% to 76.4% ± 6.0% (p &lt; 0.001). CBFV increased linearly, whereas the pulsatility index and resistance index decreased linearly from T1 to T4 (p &lt; 0.001).

In terms of CO2 emissions from energy consumption per unit of employment, central and western industrial cities are above the average level of all industrial cities and cities of chemical and petrochemical, metallurgy and building materials see the same pattern; in terms of CO2 emissions from energy consumption per unit of output, northeast industrial cities are all above the average level of all industrial cities, and it is the same for metallurgy and building materials industrial cities, chemical and petrochemical industrial cities.

Monoterpenes are the main components contributing to its fragrance, and terpene synthase (TPS) genes play critical roles in the biosynthesis of monoterpenoids. To understand the function of TPS and to explore the molecular mechanism of floral scent in cultivar Lilium ‘Siberia’, transcriptomes of petal at different flowering stages and leaf were obtained by RNA sequencing and three unigenes related to TPS genes were selected for further validation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the expression level of LiTPS2 was greater than that of the other two TPS genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that LiTPS2 belonged to the TPSb subfamily, which was responsible for monoterpenes synthesis. Subcellular localization demonstrated that LiTPS2 was located in the chloroplasts. Furthermore, functional characterization showed that LiTPS2 utilized both geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to produce monoterpenoids such as linalool and sesquiterpenes like trans-nerolidol, respectively. Ectopic expression in transgenic tobacco plants suggested that the amount of linalool from the flowers of transgenic plants was 2–3 fold higher than that of wild-type plants. And the emissions of myrcene and (E)-β-ocimene were also accumulated from the flowers of LiTPS2 transgenic lines. Surprisingly, these three compounds were the main fragrance components of oriental lily hybrids. Our results indicated that LiTPS2 contributed to the production of monoterpenes and could effectively regulate the aroma of Lilium cultivars, laying the foundation for biotechnological modification of floral scent profiles. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Biochemical characterization; Lilium; LiTPS2; Monoterpenoids biosynthesis; Transcriptome; Transgenic","terpene synthase; transferase; chemistry; classification; flower; gene expression; genetics; lily; metabolism; phylogeny; tobacco; Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Flowers; Gene Expression; Lilium; Phylogeny; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082766699

While studies have revealed the importance of microbiota for plant growth and stress tolerance in temperate climates, the role that plant-associated microbes play in the colonization of ice-free lands remains unknown. Consequently, we used high-throughput DNA sequence analyses to explore the composition, predicted functions, and interactive networks of plant-associated microbial communities among the rhizosphere, endosphere, and phyllosphere niches of D. antarctica and C. quitensis. Here we report a greater number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity, and richness in the microbial communities from the rhizosphere, relative to endosphere and phyllosphere. While taxonomic assignments showed greater relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria in plant niches, principal coordinate analysis revealed differences among the bacterial communities from the other compartments examined. More importantly, however, our results showed that most of OTUs were exclusively found in each plant niche. Major predicted functional groups of these microbiota were attributed to heterotrophy, aerobic heterotrophy, fermentation, and nitrate reduction, independent of plant niches or plant species. Co-occurrences network analyses identified 5 (e.g., Microbacteriaceae, Pseudomonaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Corynebacteriaceae), 23 (e.g., Chitinophagaceae and Sphingomonadaceae) and 7 (e.g., Rhodospirillaceae) putative keystone taxa present in endosphere, phyllosphere, and rhizosphere, respectively.

Reforestation and deforestation have been critical aspects of LUCC over the past two centuries and are widely studied for their potential to perturb the global carbon cycle. More recently, there has been keen interest in understanding the extent to which reforestation affects terrestrial energy cycling and thus surface temperature directly by altering surface physical properties (e.g., albedo and emissivity) and land–atmosphere energy exchange. The impacts of reforestation on land surface temperature and their mechanisms are relatively well understood in tropical and boreal climates, but the effects of reforestation on warming and/or cooling in temperate zones are less certain. This study is designed to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms that link land cover and surface temperature in temperate ecosystems. To achieve this goal, we used data from six paired eddy-covariance towers over co-located forests and grasslands in the temperate eastern United States, where radiation components, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and meteorological conditions were measured. The results show that, at the annual time scale, the surface of the forests is 1–2°C cooler than grasslands, indicating a substantial cooling effect of reforestation. The enhanced latent and sensible heat fluxes of forests have an average cooling effect of −2.5°C, which offsets the net warming effect (+1.5°C) of albedo warming (+2.3°C) and emissivity cooling effect (−0.8°C) associated with surface properties. Additional daytime cooling over forests is driven by local feedbacks to incoming radiation. We further show that the forest cooling effect is most pronounced when land surface temperature is higher, often exceeding −5°C. Our results contribute important observational evidence that reforestation in the temperate zone offers opportunities for local climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","albedo; energy balance; reforestation; temperature; turbulent fluxes","carbon cycle; climate change; cooling; deforestation; global change; land cover; land use change; reforestation; temperate environment; United States; atmosphere; climate change; ecosystem; forest; temperature; Atmosphere; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082969256

Specifically, we are focused on the policy impact of the listed key environmental protection (KEP) prefectures which subject to more stringent environmental regulations than non-KEP prefectures. Our empirical results show that the PM2.5 intensity, environmental performance, and TFP of the KEP prefectures are significantly lower than the non-KEP prefectures. The environmental policy also affects the factor structure of KEP cites. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the policy significantly lowered the PM2.5 for central and western cities while it is unclear for eastern cities. Our findings also document that the policy effects are unclear in the long term. Various robustness checks confirm the internal validity. These estimation results are instructive to the policymakers. We suggest that the central government should measure the effectiveness of policies within 5 years of policy formulation. Governments at all levels should make targeted adjustments based on actual impact effects. The central government should be granted local governments more speaking power and flexibility in policy implementation when formulating environmental regulatory policies. Otherwise, the central government also needs to improve the communication medium with provincial governments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Difference-in-differences; Environmental regulation; Key environmental protection policy; Total factor productivity","environmental policy; environmental protection; local government; particulate matter; policy implementation; policy making; regulatory framework; spatiotemporal analysis; total factor productivity; urban area; China; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental policy; environmental protection; particulate matter; pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084677013

The development of zero-carbon energy or low-carbon energy has thus become an accelerating global trend. This work develops a systematic integrated framework to support carbon reduction for an urban transport system. Firstly, a transport metabolism model is proposed. Secondly, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) carbon accounting approach, carbon emissions of passenger transport systems are calculated. According to carbon emissions reduction policies and the transport metabolism, four hypothetical scenarios are investigated. Under the constraints of carbon emissions targets and transport demands, the carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA) method is used to determine the minimum demand for zero-carbon energy and optimize the energy mix of transport modes. Passenger transport in Urumqi, China is analyzed as an illustrative case study. For the optimal scenario, the zero-carbon energy (electricity) demand is 1.07×109 kWh. The optimal energy mix for private cars is that electricity, gasoline, and compressed natural gas usage accounting for 14.5%, 25.5%, and 60%, respectively. The unit emission reduction cost of policies is evaluated for the specific policies. The implementation priority of the policies is then determined. The potential transport mode shift is determined by a marginal cost diagram. The transport–energy nexus is also considered. Results show that the most effective measure of carbon emissions reduction in the transport sector is fuel switching. General policy implications of these results for other urban centers are then discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Pinch analysis; Sustainability; Transport sector; Urban metabolism","Carbon dioxide; Compressed natural gas; Emission control; Global warming; Metabolism; Public policy; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Passenger transport systems; Pinch analysis; Transport sectors; Urban metabolisms; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081052480

This work demonstrates that the introduction of Sn promoters into BaFe1-xSnxO3-δ perovskite oxides significantly restrains coke formation and improves the syngas yield to above 19.2 mmol/g with a H2/CO ratio of 2, which is 2.9-fold in comparison to BaFeO3-δ. Characterization results suggest that Sn cations are well-confined in the perovskite matrix by substitution of Fe. The Fe cations serve as main active sites for C-H bond activation with Sn cations as an oxygen reservoir, which donate the neighboring lattice oxygen to active Fe for selective methane oxidation. Besides, an intimate Fe-Sn interaction induces the formation of the FeSn alloy rather than metallic Fe0 under a reducing atmosphere, which restrains methane pyrolysis and notably improves the coke resistance. When Sn loading (x) increases to above 0.6, all Fe cations can be deeply reduced to the metallic state without coke accumulation and oxygen storage capacity reaches as high as ca. 6.5 mmol/g with nearly 100% syngas selectivity, which breaks the ""seesaw""effect between oxygen supply and syngas selectivity for traditional iron-based materials.

By taking Hangzhou, a low-carbon metropolitan city in China, as an illustrative example, green transport policies have been proactively implemented in order to turn the metropolitan city into an ecologically livable city. However, citizens' acceptance of comprehensive green transport policies has seldom been studied and explored, which is actually quite valuable information for implementing and assessing the effectiveness of green transport policies. This study presents a new integrated framework by extending the value belief norm (VBN) theory in order to explore the internal factors for predicting citizens' acceptance of comprehensive green transport policies and other pro-environmental behaviors in the transport field. A survey on car use reduction was conducted among citizens in Hangzhou and a quantitative analysis was performed using a structural equation model (SEM) method. Results show that personal norms can successfully predict citizens' acceptance of pull policies for reducing car use, while is less capable of predicting that of push ones. The theoretical implications of different pro-environmental behaviors are explained. This analysis may inspire policy makers to implement appropriate policies to encourage the public to use low-carbon transport in daily life. © 2020 by the authors.","Personal norms; Pull policies; Push policies; Structural equation model; Value belief norm theory","metropolitan area; policy implementation; policy making; transportation policy; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086907834

This research examines the decoupling relationship between economic outputs and carbon emissions of 11 provinces in 2000–2016 by focusing on Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), which is the densest traffic and economic corridor in China. Although many studies have focused on the decoupling state and its driving forces between economic outputs and carbon emissions, few studies further addressed the microscale analysis for decoupling drivers. This paper reveals the characteristic, inequality contribution ratio, and dynamic evolution of the drivers by integrating Dagum’s Gini ratio with kernel density estimation in YREB. Results are as follows: (1) The decoupling states presented weak decoupling state at the whole belt in the majority of the latter observed sub-periods. The decoupling states at the provincial level turned more satisfactory during the four observed sub-periods, especially for Shanghai and Zhejiang. (2) The energy intensity (EI) effect is the predominant driver for promoting the decoupling state in the vast majority of provinces, whereas value added per capita effect is the major role for inhibiting the decoupling state. (3) During the four observed sub-periods, the Gini inequality and transvariation intensity of the EI effect between sub-regions are the main sources of the provincial differences in YREB. The driving force of EI effect is increasing, but the provincial differences are expanding in the upstream and downstream regions by analyzing its dynamic evolution. Understanding the temporal and spatial microscale inequality of the decoupling drivers provides governments with differentiated and forward-looking suggestions towards coordinating regional economic growth and carbon emissions reduction. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Dynamic evolution; Gini ratio; LMDI model; Tapio decoupling; Transportation","carbon emission; economic conditions; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; equity; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation system; China; Shanghai; Yangtze River; Zhejiang; carbon; China; economic development; river; socioeconomics; Carbon; China; Economic Development; Rivers; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083366594

Electrolytes in different pH environment is desirable for each half electrochemical reaction to optimize the electrode kinetics and reduce the cost of noble metal catalysts. The bipolar membrane provides excellent opportunities to enable pH-differential operation. However, the effect of the bipolar membrane on electrochemical performance is not clarified yet. Here, a numerical modeling framework for bipolar membrane-based cells for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications was presented to study the viability of using bipolar membrane in the aspect of energy loss. The model for the first time successfully integrates the water dissociation at the bipolar membrane with the rest electrode kinetics and mass transfer, by treating the interfacial layer as a virtual electrode. Based on the model, the activation loss involved in the bipolar membrane devices were identified and compared with the ones with conventional monopolar membranes. A critical current density was identified for bipolar membranes, which is determined by the water dissociation performance of the membrane. Based on the critical current, the viable operation regions of using the bipolar membrane can be clarified for the electrochemical device.

In this study, taking the Fenghe River watershed (FRW) as a case, based on the status and the change trend of the supply–demand ratio of ES, and the ES supply change trend, the supply–demand risk level of food provision (FP), water yield (WY), soil retention (SR), and climate regulation (CR) are evaluated, and the risk management zones of the FRW are divided using spatial superposition. The results show that: (1) The supply and demand of SR are spatially matched, while the other three ES are spatially mismatched. (2) From 2000 to 2015, the supply amount of FP, WY, and SR increases by 11.59%, 1.25% and 55%, respectively, while the supply amount of CR decreases by 5.15%. At the same time, the demand amount of FP, WY, SR and CR increases by 39.97%, 53.88%, 36.3% and 215.5%, respectively. (3) The supply–demand ratio means of four ES in the FRW are all greater than 0, but there are some areas within that are less than 0. (4) In terms of sub-watershed scale, except for SR, there are critically endangered areas for the other three ES. Moreover, the FRW is divided into 11 supply–demand risk management zones, such as FS-WY-CR critically endangered zone, WY-CR critically endangered and FS vulnerable zone. The supply–demand risk management zones based on multiple ES can identify the risk level of each ES in each zone. These results and conclusions can provide the basis for rational allocation of resources and sustainable management of ES. © 2020 by the authors.

With charging power increasing to more than 100 kW for light duty vehicles, electromagnetic field (EMF) emission becomes a critical challenge. Due to the high costs of ferrite materials, this paper proposes an active shielding solution with multiple canceling coils installed on the ground side to supplement ferrite passive shielding to ensure electromagnetic safety. Two canceling coils are designed on two sides of the ground side coil. The canceling coils are small in size and 180 degree opposite in phase to the ground coil. Simulation and modeling shows that the canceling coils can reduce EMF emission from 37.2 μT to 1S.2 μT at 0. Sm during 100 kW operation with only 2.5% of ground side current flowing in the canceling coils. These results have been preliminarily verified by inductance measurements and magnetic field measurement at 1.1 m distance without canceling coils. By further increasing the canceling coils' currents to 4%, EMF emission can also be mitigated at 200 kW, although the canceling coils' shape, position, and phase angle can be further optimized to improve the threedimensional field distribution. © 2020 IEEE.","active shielding; dynamic wireless power transfer; electric vehicle; electromagnetic field; inductive power transfer","Electric utilities; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic shielding; Ferrite; Light weight vehicles; Magnetic field measurement; Shielding; Critical challenges; Electromagnetic safety; Ferrite materials; Field distribution; Light duty vehicles; Passive shielding; Potential capability; Simulation and modeling; Wireless charging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096543926

Bayesian belief network (BBN) is often used in complicated system modelling. Using a BBN to construct a network framework of ecosystem services under climate and policy scenarios for exploring the total suitability distribution of ecosystem services is of great significance. In this study, we develop BBN for the total suitability of water yield and carbon sequestration based on hydro-biogeochemical process. And then we predict the probabilities of the total suitability in 2050 through the BBN under multi-scenario simulations accounting for climate change, birth control and carbon tax policies. Finally, total suitability priority regions are mapped, which are synergy development, water yield suitability, carbon sequestration suitability and non-suitability, respectively. Our results indicate forest, cropland, urban area, and grassland have the largest areas under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The abolition of the one-child policy has led to a significant expansion of urban areas, and the implementation of the carbon tax policy has greatly increased forest areas. Additionally, temperature, Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation and land use are the key driving factors that influence suitability.

The static chamber technique was utilized to measure CH4 emission fluxes from the inlet and outlet of the biogas digesters. For the 100 m3 biogas digester, CH4 emission fluxes from the inlet, outlet, and the biogas digester were 1.043 g/(m2·h), 2.328 g/(m2·h), and 52.669 g/(m3·d); while those for the 8 m3 biogas digester were 0.156 g/(m2·h), 0.083 g/(m2·h), and 23.580 g/(m3·d), respectively. The diurnal and monthly variation of CH4 emission fluxes were further analyzed from the 100 m3 biogas digester. Among the environmental factors, the fermentation temperature and feeding quantity had significant effects on the CH4 emission fluxes. Especially, CH4 leakage from the digesters was evaluated, which would help identify and adjust the methane conversion factor for the typical biogas fermentation ecosystem used in China. For the hydraulic biogas digesters of 8 m3 and 100 m3, the respective leakage ratios were 3.01% and 14.56%.

Besides the increase in gas is also derived from household waste. The amount of carbon emissions in an area depends on the number of vehicles operating such as main roads, residential ro ads, roads that are planted with green plants and terminals. One that can reduce carbon dioxide gas is greening, by planting plants that can absorb a lot of carbon emissions. Greening can be done by planting green plants or vegetation on highways and housing. The existence of Green Open Space (RTH) will result in the assimilation of carbon by vegetation which will reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The research objective is to measure the concentration of carbon emissions from motor vehicles, modeling the relationship between carbon emissions and the number of motor vehicles and knowing the need for green space in Jember Regency for CO2 absorption for 5 years.

Existing methods are either too narrow or simplified to assess the economic effects associated with technical improvement in absorbent performance and/or process development for the CO2 capture-integrated process. In this study, a techno-economic assessment (TEA) methodology is developed, based on the multiple-parameter scaling method (MPSM), which enables the systematic and confident evaluation of the economic impacts of the CO2 capture-integrated process. Potential benefits of process integration between CO2 capture and CO2-emitting systems were fully investigated, as synergetic advantages can be gained by facilitating system-wide heat and power recovery in a holistic manner. The TEA method proposed in this study is validated by comparing that of the DOE/NETL. The TEA is then applied for CO2 capture processes based on monoethanolamine (MEA) and a novel absorbent, both of which are energetically integrated with a power plant. The CO2 capture cost localized under plant engineering environment of the Republic of Korea is estimated at 35.5 USD2015/tCO2 for the MEA-based process, where 3.5 GJ/tCO2 is consumed as regeneration energy. Meanwhile, use of the novel absorbent, requiring 2.17 GJ/tCO2 for solvent regeneration, results in a 25.7 USD2015/tCO2 CO2 capture cost, which is approximately 15% lower than CANSOLV®-based capture process. The sensitivity of key economic and process design parameters is studied, including the carbon emission penalty, changes in absorbent performance, and impact of location-dependent parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-fired power plant; Post-combustion CO2 capture; Process design; Process integration; Tecno-economic assessment","Absorption; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Cost engineering; Ethanolamines; Fossil fuel power plants; Process design; Tea; Coal-fired power plant; Location dependents; Process design parameters; Process development; Regeneration energy; Solvent regenerations; Technical improvement; Techno-economic assessment; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic analysis; numerical model; performance assessment; power plant; technological development; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083460672

All of these factors have triggered global warming, which is one of the biggest problems in recent years. For this reason, the climate has become one of the most important factors in urban design works. The purpose of the present study is to determine the microclimatic contribution of urban open spaces to the city in the context of climate-balanced physical planning criteria, and to propose an analytical model, which may constitute a basis for planning and design works. Firstly, the climatic requirements of the city of Gaziantep were examined by creating bioclimatic comfort maps. In the following stage, monthly wind roses were created by determining the dominant wind directions for the summer and winter seasons. Optimum location and directions that were balanced with climate were determined and slope and aspect maps of the area, land use types and area selection criteria were also created. In light of these data, ecological compatibility and feasibility maps were prepared. In the feasibility map, the temperature and humidity maps were created with ENVI-met, which is a climatic simulation software, for the most extreme days in an area where there were residential areas and educational institutions, multi-storey residential areas, working areas, social and open green areas, and afforestation areas. The results that were obtained with the simulations were subjected to Regression Analysis to determine the relationship among the climate parameters and the design criteria. As a result, the increase in the quantity of urban green spaces and equality on the spatial distribution of these areas will improve bioclimatic comfort (the warmest hour of the hottest period regression analysis’ result is β= -0.384). It has been determined that planning high-density plantation in green spaces and selecting dense and broad-leaved plants will provide a cooling effect (on average 2−3 °C less). Furthermore, adding more green spaces in cities will increase the thermal comfort within city blocks, especially where high-rise buildings are common. It is confirmed that high-rise buildings cause thermal stress (the warmest hour of the hottest period regression analysis’ result is β = 0.472). Hardscapes have a negative effect on the temperature (the warmest hour of the hottest period regression analysis’ result is β = 0.425). In addition to these data, it was found that the mean radiant temperature values, instead of temperature values, would yield more accurate results in microclimate analyses and interpretations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic comfort; Design with climate; Envi-met; Gaziantep","air temperature; analytical method; greenspace; humidity; land use; microclimate; modeling; spatial distribution; urban design; urban planning; Gaziantep; Turkey; Rosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083091250

A simple and efficient approach was developed to co-combust SBE and coal in the company inner power plant, and synergetic effect was observed in SO2 and NOx reduction in flue gas and energy recycling of waste oil. The full-cycle combustion process was investigated in details under different mixing ratio of the two substances from 0 to 1000 °C. According to the TG/DSC-MS results, it was found that the introduction of SBE could reduce the decomposition temperature of coal from 475-931 °C to 450–815 °C, since the dehydrogenation and decarboxylation effects of metallic oxides and the high contacting area with oxygen provided by the porous structures of SBE. The tubular electric heating furnace-FTIR results showed that the concentration of typical pollutants in flue gas decreased obviously at the coal/SBE mixing ratio 5:1, among them, the maximum SO2 emissions reduction reached 32%. The chemical adsorption effect of alkaline earth metals and transition metal oxides and oxidation-reduction reaction between NO+NO3 − and SO3 2− were proved as the main fixation mechanisms. The regenerated porous structures in SBE provide new adsorption site after the volatilization of adsorbed oils, so as to further enhance the fixation capacity. Co-combustion process of SBE and coal offered a promising way for simultaneous in-situ gaseous pollutant control in flue gas and energy recycling from SBE. © 2020","Co-combustion; Decomposition temperature reduction; Emission reduction; Fixation mechanism; Spent bleaching earth","Alkalinity; Bleaching; Carboxylation; Cleaning; Coal; Coal combustion; Emission control; Flue gases; Flues; Fog; Gas emissions; Jet fuel; Mixing; Petroleum refining; Porosity; Recycling; Redox reactions; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Waste incineration; Cocombustion; Decomposition temperature; Emission reduction; Fixation mechanisms; Spent bleaching earth; In situ coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080080206

Eco-driving aims to reduce energy consumption without affecting safety and passenger comfort. Estimates of energy savings from train eco-driving are typically based on theoretical speed trajectory optimization models. However, achievable energy savings from eco-driving should be assessed based on realistic trajectories. A Markov chain speed trajectory simulator calibrated to measured trajectories was used to simulate realistic inter-run variability in 1 Hz trajectories. The simulator was calibrated and applied to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail system. Estimated energy consumption for each trajectory includes auxiliary loads and tractive effort to overcome resistive forces. Inter-run variability in estimated energy consumption implies opportunities for energy savings via eco-driving. Energy savings was quantified by comparing the lowest and average segment energy consumption. A segment is the one-way rail track between adjacent stations of each line. Simulated trajectories are similar to measured trajectories based on mean absolute error and coefficient of determination (R2) for the same operation mode sequence. Based on 100 simulations per segment, energy savings ranging from 5% to 50% among segments and from 14% to 18% at the system level can be achieved without modifying travel time. Energy savings lead to reduced electricity consumption and, therefore, reduced power generation emissions. The method demonstrated here to quantify opportunities for metro train energy conservation and emissions mitigation is broadly applicable to electric metro and commuter trains and rail segments. Implications for energy-efficient passenger rail planning and operation are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic train operation; Eco-driving; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Markov chain; Public transport","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Markov chains; Travel time; Coefficient of determination; Electricity-consumption; Emissions mitigation; Emissions reduction; Mean absolute error; Reduce energy consumption; Simulated trajectories; Washington metropolitan area transit authorities; Trajectories; electricity generation; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; Markov chain; optimization; power generation; simulator; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083432807

This study proposes a new framework of an evaluation system to assess the ISID for 30 provinces in China (2011–2016). As there does not exist a generally accepted evaluation system of ISID, this study proposes a dual-formulation of ISID to rationalize the trade-offs among externalities brought by industrialization: (i) ISID represents the aspiration of countries to promote industrialization and consequently sustain economic growth by reducing the adverse environmental and social effects which manifest in the overall economy (ii) ISIDsdg9 considers the same aspects of ISID but limits the externalities within the industrial sector. This study applied two newly developed efficiency evaluation approaches, Multi-Directional Efficiency Analysis (MEA) and Range-Adjusted Measure (RAM), to evaluate and analyze the ISID for China. This study finds that: Among the 30 provinces, (i) Beijing and Tianjin are the benchmark provinces for promoting ISID and ISIDsdg9 regimes, respectively. (ii) Throughout the 2011–2016, the overall performance of China on ISID and ISIDsdg9 regimes has improved modestly. (iii) Based on the analysis of the barrel effect, SO2 emission is the key binding constraint to achieving the frontier status of ISID and ISIDsd9 regimes (v) Under the evaluation of ISID and ISIDsdg9 regimes, the average annual growth potentials of industrial value added (IVA) is 280.52 billion CNY and 927.54 billion CNY, respectively.

Stagnated airflow due to closely packed tall buildings causes weak dilution and removal of anthropogenic heat. Consequently, research is critically needed to investigate the effect of urban morphology on anthropogenic heat dispersion and provide effective planning strategies to reduce UHI intensity, especially at the extreme scenarios, such as with very low wind speed and high heat emission. This study provides scientific understanding and develops a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based modelling tool to support decision-making in urban planning practice. We start from a computational parametric study at the neighbourhood scale to investigate the impact of urban morphology on heat dispersion. Site coverage ratio and frontal area density are two urban morphological parameters. Ten parametric cases with two heat emission scenarios are designed to study representative urban areas. Furthermore, based on the energy conservation within urban canopy layers, we develop a semi-empirical model to estimate spatially-averaged in-canopy air temperature increment, in which the exchange velocity between street canyons and overlaying atmosphere is estimated by the Bentham and Britter model. The performance of new model is validated by cross-comparing with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results from the parametric study. By applying this new model, the impact of anthropogenic heat on air temperature is mapped in residential areas of Singapore for both long-term annually averaged and short-term extreme low wind speed to improve urban climate sustainability and resilience. © 2020","Anthropogenic heat dispersion; CFD simulation; GIS mapping; Semi-empirical model; Urban planning","Air; Behavioral research; Climate models; Computational fluid dynamics; Decision making; Dispersions; Morphology; Tall buildings; Urban growth; Wind; Anthropogenic heat; Effective planning; Exchange velocity; Morphological parameters; Residential areas; Semi-empirical modeling; Urban canopy layers; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; computational fluid dynamics; energy conservation; extreme event; GIS; heat island; heat transfer; human activity; strategic approach; urban morphology; urban planning; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083251810

Different micro-aeration rates, 0, 5, 10, 50, and 150 mg O2/L-reactor/cycle, and their effect on the hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis of blackwater were evaluated and compared at ambient temperature. Source-diverted blackwater (toilet water) contains high organic contents which can be recovered as biogas. Previous studies have found that anaerobic digestion of blackwater without micro-aeration can only recover upwards of less than 40% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to methane at room temperature due to the low hydrolysis rate of biomass content in blackwater. This study achieved increases in blackwater hydrolysis (from 34.7% to 48.7%) and methane production (from 39.6% to 50.7%) with controlled micro-aeration (5 mg O2/L-reactor/cycle). The microbial analysis results showed that hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens (e.g. Methanosaeta) were in higher abundances in low-dose micro-aeration reactors (5 and 10 mg O2/L-reactor/cycle), which facilitated syntrophic interactions between microorganisms. The relative abundance of oxygen-tolerant methanogen such as Methanosarcina greatly increased (from 1.5% to 11.4%) after oxygen injection. High oxygen dosages (50 and 150 mg O2/L-reactor/cycle) led to reduced methane production and higher accumulation of volatile fatty acids, largely due to the oxygen inhibition on methanogens and degradation of organic matters by aerobic growth and respiration, as indicated by the predicted metagenome functions. By combining reactor performance results and microbial community analyses, this study demonstrated that low-dose micro-aeration improves blackwater biomethane recovery by enhancing hydrolysis efficiency and promoting the development of a functional microbial population, while medium to high-dose micro-aeration reduced the activities of certain anaerobes. It was also observed that medium-dose micro-aeration maximizes VFA accumulation, which may be used in two-stage anaerobic digesters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Blackwater; Methanogenesis; Micro-aeration; Microbial community","Anaerobic digestion; Batch reactors; Hydrolysis; Methane; Methanogens; Oxygen; Recovery; Volatile fatty acids; Acetoclastic methanogens; Anaerobic sequencing batch reactors; Microbial analysis; Microbial community analysis; Microbial populations; Reactor performance; Relative abundance; Syntrophic interactions; Chemical oxygen demand; biogas; methane; organic matter; oxygen; volatile fatty acid; abundance; aeration; ambient air; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; organic matter; wastewater; acidogenesis; aeration; anaerobic digestion; Article; bacterial growth; chemical oxygen demand; degradation; fermentation; hydrolysis; metagenome; methanogen; methanogenesis; Methanosarcina; microaeration; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; sewage; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanosaeta; Methanosarcina; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Methane; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082859221

Mitigation requires information about sources and sinks on the regional and global scales. Isotopic composition of N2O in the atmosphere could contribute valuable constraints. However, isotopic records of N2O in the unpolluted atmosphere remain too scarce for large-scale N2O models. Here, we report the results of discrete air samples collected weekly to biweekly over a 5-year period at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch, located in central Switzerland. High-precision N2O isotopic measurements were made using a recently developed preconcentration and laser spectroscopy technique. The measurements of discrete samples were accompanied by in situ continuous measurements of N2O mixing ratios. Our results indicate a pronounced seasonal pattern with minimum N2O mixing ratios in late summer, associated with a maximum in δ15Nbulk and a minimum in intramolecular 15N site preference (δ15NSP). This pattern is most likely due to stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), which delivers N2O-depleted but 15N-enriched air from the stratosphere into the troposphere. Variability in δ15NSP induced by changes in STE may be masked by biogeochemical N2O production processes in late summer, which are possibly dominated by a low-δ15NSP pathway of N2O production (denitrification), providing an explanation for the observed seasonality of δ15NSP. Footprint analyses and atmospheric transport simulations of N2O for Jungfraujoch suggest that regional emissions from the planetary boundary layer contribute to seasonal variations of atmospheric N2O isotopic composition at Jungfraujoch, albeit more clearly for δ15NSP and δ18O than for δ15Nbulk. With the time series of 5 years, we obtained a significant interannual trend for δ15Nbulk after deseasonalization (-0.052±0.012%a-1), indicating that the atmospheric N2O increase is due to isotopically depleted N2O sources. We estimated the average isotopic signature of anthropogenic N2O sources with a two-box model to be -8.6±0.6% for δ15Nbulk, 34.8±3% for δ18O and 10.7±4% for δ15NSP. Our study demonstrates that seasonal variation of N2O isotopic composition in the background atmosphere is important when determining interannual trends. More frequent, highprecision and interlaboratory-compatible measurements of atmospheric N2O isotopocules, especially for δ15NSP, are needed to better constrain anthropogenic N2O sources and thus the contribution of biogeochemical processes to N2O growth on the global scale. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Wuhan, a metropolis in the Yangtze River middle basin (YRMB) of central China, experienced heavy air pollution characterized by hourly PM2.5 concentrations reaching 471.1 μg m- in January 2016. To investigate the regional transport of PM2.5 over central eastern China (CEC) and the meteorological impact on wintertime air pollution in the YRMB area, observed meteorological and other relevant environmental data from January 2016 were analyzed. Our analysis presented noteworthy cases of heavy PM2.5 pollution in the YRMB area with unique ""non-stagnant""meteorological conditions of strong northerly winds, no temperature inversion, and additional unstable structures in the atmospheric boundary layer. This unique set of conditions differed from the stagnant meteorological conditions characterized by near-surface weak winds, air temperature inversion, and stable structure in the boundary layer that are typically observed in heavy air pollution over most regions in China. The regional transport of PM2.5 over CEC aggravated PM2.5 levels, thus creating heavy air pollution in the YRMB area. This demonstrates a source-receptor relationship between the originating air pollution regions in CEC and the receiving YRMB region. Furthermore, a backward trajectory simulation using a Flexible Particle dispersion (FLEXPART) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to integrate the air pollutant emission inventory over China was used to explore the patterns of regional transport of PM2.5 governed by the strong northerly winds in the cold air activity of the East Asian winter monsoon season. It was estimated that the regional transport of PM2.5 from non-local air pollutant emissions contributes more than 65 % of the PM2.5 concentrations to the heavy air pollution in the YRMB region during the study period, revealing the importance of the regional transport of air pollutants over China as a causative factor of heavy air pollution over the YRMB area.. © Author(s) 2020.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; carbon emission; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution monitoring; solute transport; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087161308

Under the CORDEX-EA project, the precipitation and temperature projections (2020–2045) for the economically and socially important region of Northwestern China were derived from high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, and compared against a historical period or baseline of 1980–2005. Drawing data from four key RCMs [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF); Regional Spectral Model (RSM); Regional Climate Model version 4.0 (RegCM4); Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5)], reliable local-scale projections were generated by applying suitable bias correction that accords with the multivariate bias correction (MBC) approach. To validate this approach and then evaluate climate change impacts, the adjusted precipitation and temperature estimated from bias-corrected models for the historical period were compared to the observed data. The results showed that the simulated spatiotemporal distribution of multiyear average precipitation and temperature appear to fit relatively well with the observations, however, the wet-cold and dry-warm climate-related biases were still evident for the high altitude regions. Bias-corrected future projections of RCMs indicated spatially averaged annual precipitation is expected to rise by about 23.6 and 35.3 mm under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, while spatially averaged annual temperature is expected to rise by about 1.95 and 1.10°C. Precipitation is projected to increase in all seasons, albeit, more so in the cold season (i.e., boreal winter and spring) than the warm season (i.e., boreal summer and autumn). The annual increase is expected to be about 56.7% under the RCP 4.5 scenario, compared to 67.6% under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The changes of mean temperature in winter are expected to be significant, −37.8% under both RCP scenarios. For spring, the mean temperature will rise by 23.1% (28.9%) under the RCP 4.5 (8.5) scenario. A MBC approach was found to be effective in yielding reliable projected changes in precipitation and temperature variables. The proposed approach has important implications for climatological studies and evaluation of climate change impacts on localized regions, not only in China, but also in other similar areas of the world, where decisions for managing climate risk must be implemented by policy makers, government, industry and stakeholders. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; CORDEX-EA; northwestern China; precipitation and temperature projection; regional climate models","Climate change; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Global warming; Risk perception; Weather forecasting; CORDEX-EA; Northwestern China; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Regional climate models; Spatiotemporal distributions; Temperature projection; Weather research and forecasting; Climate models; air temperature; climate modeling; climate prediction; climatology; global warming; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial variation; weather forecasting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076889849

Environmental disasters, natural and human-made activities raise risk factors that indirectly facilitate infectious disease outbreaks. Subsequently, changes in habitat, displaced populations, and environmental stresses that affect the survival of species are amplified over time. The recurrence and spread of vector-borne (e.g., mosquito, tick, aphid) human, animal, and plant pathogens to new geographic locations are also influenced by climate change. The distribution and range of humans, agricultural animals and plants, wildlife and native plants, as well as vectors, parasites, and microbes that cause neglected diseases of the tropics as well as other global regions are also impacted. In addition, genomic sequencing can now be applied to detect signatures of infectious pathogens as they move into new regions. Molecular detection assays complement metagenomic sequencing to help us understand the microbial community found within the microbiomes of hosts and vectors, and help us uncover mechanistic relationships between climate variability and pathogen transmission. Our understanding of, and responses to, such complex dynamics and their impacts can be enhanced through effective, multi-sectoral One Health engagement coupled with applications of both traditional and novel technologies.

Single-serving bottles, made by polyethylene terephthalate mainly, have caused great damages to the harmonious development of human beings, animals and environment. Hence, this paper measures the impacts of single-serving water bottles ban quantitively by constructing sets of models. This project uses AR(p) model to predict the single-serving water bottles usage in future. The result shows that restrictions or bans on single-serving bottles are essential for our earth's future. There are two major impacts of water bottles: one is the positive impacts (including reducing environmental pollution, reducing energy cost); the other is the negative impacts (including more soft drinks, health cost, and construction cost). The substitution effect model developed by the authors illustrates the influences of the ban on soft drinks as well as tap water. Moreover, the model was applied in the cases of towns, cities and airport, the biggest difference of which is the population density. Due to the limits of tap water, residents in those area with low density are facing high costs to obtain pure water, which causes much bigger inconvenience comparatively. Besides, this paper builds multi-objective model to find the approximate purifier facilities density from the perspective of maximizing carbon dioxide emissions reduction and minimizing costs. The result shows reducing the substitution effect for soft drinks is a good choice of the optimal condition. Besides, enhancing the price of soft drinks is a better method to reduce the negative impacts of a ban on bottled water. In the end, some suggestions are given regarding the water bottle ban, including enhancing soft drinks' price, advertising the negative impacts of PET bottles to public. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air purification; Beverages; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Emission control; Global warming; Plastic bottles; Population statistics; Water pollution; Carbon dioxide emissions; Construction costs; Environmental pollutions; Harmonious development; Multi-objective modeling; Optimal conditions; Population densities; Substitution effect; Bottles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087623871

The two coastal megacities studied in this paper, Shanghai and Istanbul, have the potential for low-carbon urban transitions that can destabilize existing regimes. The destabilization is brought about by the disruptive business model innovations of the sharing economy in Shanghai’s mobility sector and by the energy-efficient practices developed alongside the intensification of the building sector through the process of urban renewal in Istanbul. However, the emergence of such urban transitions through the actions of agents relies on the existence of enabling environments for regime destabilization. In a comparative case study of Shanghai and Istanbul, we assess the challenges of realizing regime destabilization opportunities through an enabling environment framework. We find that without adequate enabling environments for regime destabilization, urban transitions to sustainability may fail to achieve effective low-carbon action and make progress towards meeting the sustainable development goals. We also show that while deliberate and collective efforts are underway from multiple agents within and beyond the two megacities, the environments for regime destabilization in the building and transport sectors considered remain insufficient primarily due to conflicting priorities among key agents in the underlying urban systems. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agency; Enabling environment; Istanbul; Megacity; Regime destabilization; Shanghai; Urban sustainable transitions","Carbon; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Multi agent systems; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic climate changes; Building sectors; Business model innovation; Energy efficient; Low-carbon urban; Multiple agents; Transport sectors; Urban systems; Urban transportation; emission control; environmental planning; environmental protection; megacity; sustainable development; transportation development; urban renewal; urban transport; China; Istanbul [Turkey]; Shanghai; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084660238

California's Sierra Nevada Mountains are situated east, and downwind of, the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), which has some of the worst air quality in the US. This work reports surface and vertical O3 observations over the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the SJV from 1998 to 2018. Over this period, the O3 concentrations observed on highly polluted days (95th percentile) decreased, primarily because of summertime emission reductions. Analysis of surface site diurnal data highlights the impacts that the SJV has on the Sierra Nevada Mountains, particularly at lower elevations. O3 typically remains higher overnight at mountain sites, compared to SJV sites, and as a result mountain sites can have high cumulative exposure to O3. Evidence of local and transport effects on O3 trends across the Sierra Nevada Mountains is presented through examining of the timing of O3 exceedances and correlations with different surface sites and with O3 aloft. The data indicate a strong regional influence of emissions from the SJV over the Sierra Nevada Mountains and aloft up to 3 km. © 2020","MDA8; Ozone; Production; Sierra Nevada; Tranport","Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Topography; Cumulative exposures; Emission reduction; National ambient air quality standards; Non-attainment; San Joaquin Valley; Sierra Nevada; Surface sites; Transport effects; Landforms; ozone; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ozone; standard (reference); air pollution; air quality standard; ambient air; Article; California; climate; concentration (parameter); Nevada; priority journal; topography; wind; California; San Joaquin Valley; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083321899

X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are utilized to track the evolution of the crystal structure and oxidation states during the reaction, and the results reveal that Cu2+ions are rapidly reduced to Cu+and then slowly to Cu0, resulting in a Cu@CuxO core@shell structure. The tensile strain caused by the distorted grain is beneficial for the activation of CO2. Cu+/Cu0interfaces formed through stabilized Cu+facilitate *CO-CO dimerization, promoting conversion to C2+products and suppressing conversion to C1products.

Improving the energy efficiency of the existing buildings is the key to address climate change mitigation and adaptation. This paper considers different climate scenarios using different series of future climate in four different European cities, namely, Kiruna, Stockholm, Valencia and Madrid. The study adopts the TABULA database to get access to basic construction information. Energy simulation and data analysis using IDA ICE and MATLAB are performed. Based on climate change, an overall retrofitting plan was developed by combining energy-saving retrofit solutions. The results show that in Madrid and Valencia, future heating demand will decrease and cooling demand will increase. In Kiruna and Stockholm, with the increase of the insulation material, the heating demand of the house has decreased, but the cooling demand has shown a downward trend compared with the cases of Madrid and Valencia. The first reason is the introduction of hybrid cooling, and the second is that the average indoor temperature has been maintained at 21 degrees Celsius due to the low outdoor temperature in summer. The findings indicate that in Kiruna, Stockholm, and Madrid it is better to insulate façades to lower the heating demand in winter. In Valencia, it is possible to have relatively low heating and cooling demand without façades insulation as insulated façades require more cooling demand during summer. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Energy efficiency; MATLAB; Retrofitting; Space heating; Climate change mitigation; Construction information; Energy performance; Heating and cooling; Impact assessments; Indoor temperature; Insulation materials; Outdoor temperature; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088478818

Here we employed a novel approach, two-dimensional Si fingerprints, including stable Si isotopic composition (δ30Si and Si abundance (Si%), to investigate the annual variations in both primary and secondary sources of PM2.5 in Beijing during the APPCAP period (2013-2017). The δ30Si and Si% values were used as tracers to reflect the variations in primary and secondary sources, respectively. For primary sources, the mean δ30Si value of PM2.5 in 2015-2017 (>-0.5‰) was significantly more positive than that of 2013 (-1.24‰), indicating a dramatic decline in the contribution of 30Si-depleted sources (i.e., coal burning and industrial emission). For secondary sources, the mean Si% of PM2.5 increased from 1.2% in 2013 to 4.6% in 2017, suggesting a large decrease in the secondary aerosol contribution from 83% to 42%. It is worth noting that we found the 30Si-depleted sources showed a rebound trend during 2015-2017. This study reveals the responses of anthropogenic emission sources under strong regulation policies and provides a reference for future policymaking in Beijing and other polluted regions and countries.

Additionally, urban spatial patterns and architectural layouts make near-surface urban air pollutants difficult to disperse. Thus, they accumulate at human height level, affecting people's health. This study performs a three-dimensional simulation of features of spatial forms such as the site coverage, average height, plot ratio or floor area ratio, degree of enclosure, and height difference. The study makes use of a typical high-density built-up area as an example for empirical analysis. The research results show that the factors of three-dimensional forms of urban space, and the urban near-surface wind environment affected by it, have apparent effects on the flow of near-surface urban air pollutants. In particular, site coverage, average height, and degree of enclosure are the key indexes affecting the flow of near-surface air pollutants, while average height shows the most significant impact. Based on these findings, the study proposes mitigation strategies to optimize main urban form indexes from the above three aspects, in order to promote near-surface urban air pollutant dispersion and reduce the impact of air pollution on human health. © 2019","Mitigation strategy; Near-surface space; Urban form index; Wind environment","Enclosures; Industrial emissions; Solid wastes; Empirical analysis; Floor area ratios; Mitigation strategy; Near surfaces; Near-surface winds; Three dimensional simulations; Urban form; Wind environment; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077704912

In this study, an ensemble structure-based neural network model (NNEnsemble) is proposed to analyze the nonlinear relationship between the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data, and province-scale statistical data on carbon emissions. Given the challenge of obtaining urban-scale carbon emission data, a weighted coefficient strategy by using the NSL data were employed to analyze the carbon emissions at the urban scale. The performance of the proposed method was found to be superior to that of comparable methods with respect to various evaluation indices. Under these circumstances, a hot spot and Standard deviational ellipse analysis of three northeast provinces in China was conducted from 1998 to 2013. The results can promote a better understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of carbon emissions in three northeastern Chinese provinces. Moreover, the developed application software based on NNEnsemble can serve as a basis for the development of carbon emission mitigation policies for other provinces. © 2020","DMSP-OLS; Ensemble- learning structure; Greenhouse gas; Nighttime light data; Spatio-temporal","Application programs; Emission control; Food supply; Health risks; Satellite imagery; Scales (weighing instruments); Carbon emission reductions; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Developed applications; Nighttime stable lights; Non-linear relationships; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Standard Deviational Ellipse; Carbon; carbon emission; ensemble forecasting; global warming; satellite imagery; software; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083483667

Present study aims to quantify and separate the impacts of two main abiotic stresses (drought & heat) on potentially attainable wheat yields, in a typical Mediterranean environment of southern Portugal (Alentejo) over 1986—2015. We also evaluate how possible adaptation options could mitigate potential yield losses (reduce the gap between actual and potential yield). Previously calibrated STICS soil-crop model is used for these purposes, which has been satisfactorily evaluated herein for yield simulations using additional field data before running at regional level. By coupling with high-resolution gridded soil and climate datasets, STICS simulations reliably reproduce the inter-annual variability of 30-year regional yield statistics, together with reasonable estimations of experimental potential yields. Therefore, the model is useful to explore the source of yield gap in the region. The quantified impacts, though with some uncertainties, identify the prolonged terminal drought stress as the major cause of yield gap, causing 40–70% mean potential yield losses. In contrast, a short-duration of crop heat stress (≥38 °C) during late grain-filling phase only results in small-to-moderate reductions (up to 20%). Supplemental Irrigation (SI) during reproductive stages provides good adaptive gains to recover potential yield losses by 15–30%, while the proposed early-flowering cultivar is more useful in escaping the terminal heat stress (5–15% adaptive gains) than avoiding prolonged drought stress. In addition, advancing sowing date generally favours wheat production with a robust spatial-temporal pattern. Therefore, combined options based on application of SI, using balanced early-flowering cultivar and early sowing date, may contribute to considerably reduce local yield gap, where current yields can account for 60% of potential yields (26–32% without adaptation). Regional impact assessment and adaptation modelling studies are essential to support agricultural policy development under climate change and variability. The recommended combined adaptation may also represent a promising adaptation strategy for rainfed wheat cropping system in other regions with similar Mediterranean conditions. However, the existing spatial-temporal variability of adaptation response highlights the need to address adaptation strategies at a more detailed local scale with better flexible design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategy; Regional crop modelling; STICS; Terminal abiotic stress; Winter wheat; Yield gap","abiotic factor; adaptive management; agricultural policy; climate change; crop yield; cultivar; drought stress; Mediterranean environment; rainfed agriculture; sowing date; wheat; Alentejo; Portugal; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083835453

It enables an institution to measure progress toward desired goals, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, setting standards, and creating time lines to measure progress. GHG emissions are categorized in three different scopes based on the source of origin. Measuring faculty, staff, and student commuting emissions pertains to Scope 3 of a GHG inventory. One method to track the impact of transportation initiatives that reduce GHG emissions caused by commuting is to conduct periodic surveys of commuting activities. This must be done in a consistent manner so comparisons can be made year to year. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Office of Sustainability (OS) has conducted a campus-wide survey every two to four years asking respondents to discuss their UIC-related commuting habits. The OS developed a tool that uses a multimodal analysis to convert the results of the campus commuting survey into an output that can calculate the emitted GHGs for each mode. The goal of this case study was to formalize and narrow the process of deriving valid data for the calculation of GHG emissions created by the traveling and commuting activities in a campus community by sector (students, faculty, and staff). The case study provides a quality assurance/quality improvement (QA/QI) process that is applicable to other entities that desire to track and report commuting emissions. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","commuting; emissions; greenhouse gases; survey; sustainable university campus; transportation","action plan; emission; emission control; emission inventory; estimation method; greenhouse gas; pollutant source",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089584195

To study the regional hydroclimatic history beyond instrumental records, the first tree-ring hydroclimate reconstruction, based on Pinus tabuliformis, was conducted in the southern Min Mountains, which is situated close to the areas affected by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. The reconstruction, spanning from 1684 to 2017, explained 59% of the variance for May–August standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a 12-month scale during 1962–2017. The recent drought, which occurred from 1992 to 2017 was the longest in duration, largest in magnitude, and had the second highest intensity. The most severe single year drought occurred in 1824, which was lower than the long-term mean by 4σ and affected several regions in and around the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The drought reconstruction was consistent with other moisture reconstructions, but dissimilar were also exist during some periods. There was a significant correlation between drought reconstruction and sea surface temperature over many oceans. However, the correlations were unstable over time. This study suggests the importance of developing a density tree-ring network to identify the spatial and temporal drought variability, as well as long-term record for understanding regional climate dynamics. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","drought variability; reconstruction; southern Min Mountains; SPEI; tree-ring","Earth (planet); Earthquakes; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Landforms; Moisture; Oceanography; Surface waters; Earth surface process; Moisture variability; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Sea surface temperature (SST); southern Min Mountains; SPEI; Tree ring networks; Tree rings; Drought; atmospheric moisture; drought; evapotranspiration; hydrometeorology; mountain region; reconstruction; regional climate; temporal variation; tree ring; China; Min Mountains; Sichuan; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076147984

To reduce this emerging climate-related threat, we applied ArcGIS and the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) to analyse the consequences of climate change on the distribution of G. macrophylla and the vulnerability of this species in China. The modelling results indicate the following: (1) the suitable range of G. macrophylla in China is mainly located in the Loess Plateau hinterland, including the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Ningxia, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, under the current climate conditions; (2) the unsuitable habitats for G. macrophylla in China would increase by 11.92% under the moderate greenhouse gas emissions/climate scenario (RCP4.5) by the 2050s, while significant losses of suitable habitat are predicted to occur; (3) the current suitable habitat mainly located in the Loess Plateau, Great Xingan Mountains, Changbai Mountains and Hengduan Mountains (with a total area of 135.09×104 km2) is predicted to be vulnerable. Climate change will further accelerate the speed of the fragmentation of the vast majority of G. macrophylla suitable habitat, threatening the survival and reproduction of this species in this region. Therefore, some proactive conservation measures should be undertaken to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Our findings can be used to provide background information related to the long-term conservation of G. macrophylla. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Gentiana macrophylla; MaxEnt; Suitable habitat; Vulnerability evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078753192

In this work, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been averaged and gridded for Shanghai and surrounding areas with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01°. The pollution maps have been used to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in NO2 and SO2 from 2008 to 2017. The averaged tropospheric NO2 and planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 columns in Shanghai are on average 1.40 × 1016 molec·cm−2 and 1.21 × 1016 molec·cm−2, respectively. As the government has put a lot of effort to improve the air quality, both the NO2 and SO2 columns reveal a significant decline in Shanghai during the past decade, with a reduction of ∼24% and ∼56%, respectively, which is also confirmed by the good agreement between satellite observations and ground-based in-situ measurements. The NO2 and SO2 time series also show distinct seasonal characteristics with higher pollution level during winter and lower in the summer. Due to the impact of ship and industrial emissions, the hotspots of NO2 and SO2 are concentrated in the northern part of Shanghai, while the pollution level is lower in the southern and eastern regions. Decreasing trends in NO2 and SO2 are found for most areas of Shanghai during the past decade, though the strongest decrease in the northern part of the city (1.4 × 1015 molec·cm−2·year−1 for NO2 and 3.0 × 1015 molec·cm−2·year−1 for SO2). Comparisons with the China Multi-Resolution Emissions Inventory (MEIC) indicate that the driving factors for the decline of NO2 and SO2 are mainly denitration and desulfurization in the power sector, and the reduction of emissions in the industry sector. We also use aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the relationship between gas phase pollutants and formation of secondary aerosol. Compared to SO2, the contribution of NO2 to secondary aerosol formation increased in the central part of Shanghai. Although Chongming Eco-Island has developed rapidly in recent years, both the SO2 and NO2 levels decreased significantly. This is mainly related to the strict emission control policy and improved urban planning, and indicates that ecological development is achievable under the guidance of policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Aerosols; Air quality; Boundary layers; Emission control; Nitrogen removal; Ozone; Radiometers; Sulfur dioxide; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Ecological development; High resolution satellites; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Ozone monitoring instruments; Planetary boundary layers; Reduction of emissions; Seasonal characteristics; Spatio-temporal variation; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079643759

A suitable band structure, good conductivity, high electron mobility and low trap state density are preferred for the desired ETL to maximize the electricity generation and minimize the charge recombination. Herein, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of antimony (Sb) dopants into the lattice of low-temperature processed TiO2 nanocrystals can effectively suppress the formation of under-coordinated Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies, leading to improved electronic conductivity and mobility. When assembling into all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbBr3 planar perovskite solar cells free of noble metal electrodes, an enhanced efficiency of 8.91% with an ultra-high open-circuit voltage of 1.654 V and reduced hysteresis from 32% to 15% is achieved based on the Sb-doped TiO2 ETL. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is mainly attributed to the improved perovskite film quality and significantly reduced charge recombination. Taking the advantages of low temperature, low defect state density, high electrical conductivity and mobility into consideration, the Sb-doped TiO2 ETL demonstrates great potential in advanced perovskite solar cells even in flexible devices.

However, CH4 emissions from cold-waterlogged paddy fields, a major type of paddy soil in China, remain unclear. Here we investigated the CH4 emissions and associated influential factors in cold-waterlogged paddy fields at two sites (Yangxin County and Daye City) in Hubei Province, South China. Normal paddy fields matched with parental material and cropping system were used as the controls. The CH4 emissions from cold-waterlogged fields were significantly higher than those from normal fields with (3.0–4.4-fold) or without (3.5–8.6-fold) rice. Rice planting increased CH4 emissions by 59–78% in cold-waterlogged fields and by 85–247% in normal fields. CH4 instantaneous fluxes were positively correlated with soil temperature and methanogen mcrA (methyl coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit) and methanotroph pmoA (methane monooxygenase) copy numbers at the annual scale. Under rice planting, mcrA copy number was higher in cold-waterlogged fields than in normal fields at both sites, whereas pmoA copy number had the same trend at the Daye site only. Soil temperature and water content influenced mcrA and pmoA copy numbers in the normal paddy fields, whereas soil organic matter content was more influential in the cold-waterlogged paddy fields. These findings suggest that perennial waterlogging is a prerequisite for substantial CH4 emissions from cold-waterlogged paddy fields, and it promotes the proliferation of methanogens and methanotrophs under rice planting.

However, the changes in mass spectra of primary emissions from AMS-ACSM with the newly developed capture vaporizer (CV) are poorly understood. Here we conducted 21 cooking, crop straw, wood, and coal burning experiments to characterize the mass spectral features of OA and watersoluble OA (WSOA) using SV-AMS and CV-ACSM. Our results show overall similar spectral characteristics between SV-AMS and CV-ACSM for different primary emissions despite additional thermal decomposition in CV, and the previous spectral features for diagnostics of primary OA factors are generally well retained. However, the mass spectral differences between OA and WSOA can be substantial for both SV-AMS and CV-ACSM. The changes in f55 (fraction of m=z 55 in OA) vs. f57, f44 vs. f60, and f44 vs. f43 in CVACSM are also observed, yet the evolving trends are similar to those of SV-AMS. By applying the source spectral profiles to a winter CV-ACSM study at a highly polluted rural site in the North China Plain, the source apportionment of primary OA was much improved, highlighting the two most important primary sources of biomass burning and coal combustion (32% and 21 %). Considering the rapidly increasing deployments of CV-ACSM and WSOA studies worldwide, the mass spectral characterization has significant implications by providing essential constraints for more accurate source apportionment and making better strategies for air pollution control in regions with diverse primary emissions. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

In this study, the ground operational data derived from the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) dataset are newly utilized to obtain the PVG-specific emission parameters of 10 distinct aircraft-engine combinations during the taxi-in and taxi-out phases of the landing and take-off (LTO) cycle. The resulting emission parameters, together with PVG-specific operational conditions, are applied to quantify the annual emissions in 2017 for main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs) at PVG, emission variations caused by mixing layer height, sensitivity of black carbon (BC) emissions to the estimation method and sensitivity of PM2.5 emissions to the fuel sulfur content (FSC). The results show noticeable discrepancies between the corrected fuel flows and NOx emission indices (EIs) and those certified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The annual emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), CO, NOx, NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, NOy, SO2, SO42−, BC, organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 with corrected emission parameters are 3.82 × 105 kg, 4.35 × 106 kg, 5.36 × 106 kg, 4.40 × 106 kg, 9.58 × 105 kg, 1.03 × 105 kg, 3.83 × 103 kg, 5.47 × 106 kg, 3.56 × 105 kg, 1.31 × 104 kg, 5.43 × 104 kg, 4.73 × 103 kg and 7.22 × 104 kg, respectively, while the application of the maximum height of the mixing layer contributes to emission increases as high as 16.9% (NOx). An alternative estimation of BC emissions leads to an increase of 50% compared with first-order approximation 3 (FOA3), while a reduction in PM2.5 emissions can be expected by minimizing the FSC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Aircraft operational data; Airport; APU; Emissions","Air quality; Aircraft; Aircraft communication; Aircraft engines; Airports; Civil aviation; Electron emission; Engines; Mixing; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Taxicabs; Auxiliary power units; Emission parameters; First-order approximations; International airport; International Civil Aviation Organization; Mixing layer height; Operational conditions; Operational data; Auxiliary power systems; black carbon; carbon monoxide; fuel; hydrocarbon; nitric acid; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous acid; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; air quality; aircraft emission; airport; black carbon; hydrocarbon; organic carbon; particulate matter; air analysis; air quality; aircraft; Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System; aircraft ground operational data; airport; Article; auxiliary power unit; chemical composition; China; communication protocol; controlled study; exhaust gas; information; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; air pollutant; aircraft; exhaust gas; human; China; Shanghai; Air Pollutants; Aircraft; Airports; China; Humans; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078973873

To promote EVs, considerable efforts and measures have been taken. However, the public’s awareness and acceptance of EVs are still low, which has affected the diffusion of EVs in the market. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework, this research aims to explore how consumers’ EV driving experience (S) affects their emotions and cognitions regarding EVs (O: perceived relative advantage, perceived ease of use, and perceived risk of EVs) and then activates their intentions to adopt EVs (R). Based on survey data from 692 respondents, the results suggested that consumers’ EV driving experience has a significantly positive effect on perceived relative advantage and perceived ease of use, and then perceived relative advantage and perceived ease of use positively affect consumers’ intentions to adopt EVs. The EV driving experience negatively affects perceived risk, and perceived risk is also negatively associated with EV adoption intentions. Furthermore, consumers’ EV driving experience also has a significant direct effect on EV adoption intentions. Based on the research results, relevant recommendations and suggestions have been proposed to promote EVs from the government and enterprise perspectives. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adoption intention; Driving experience; Perceived ease of use; Perceived relative advantage; Perceived risk; Stimulus-organism-response framework","consumption behavior; electric vehicle; greenhouse gas; perception; questionnaire survey; shopping activity; state role; sustainability; technology adoption; willingness to pay; behavior; consumer attitude; emotion; questionnaire; Consumer Behavior; Emotions; Intention; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084038576

It represents a toxic inhalation hazard at high concentration and is commonly found in polluted air. However, a series of recent studies have suggested that low concentration of CO can also produce protective functions. This study was performed to investigate the association between ambient CO exposure and vaginitis outpatient visits. Daily baseline outpatient data of vaginitis from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 were obtained from Xi'an, a heavily-polluted metropolis in China. The over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model was applied to discover the relations between short-term ambient CO exposure and the number of vaginitis outpatient visits by adjusting day of the week and weather conditions. A total of 16,825 outpatient hospital visits for vaginitis were recorded. The mean daily concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) was well below Chinese and WHO guidelines. During the study period, increased levels of ambient CO was associated with reduced outpatient-visits through concurrent to lag 5 days, and the most significant association was evidenced at lag 05. A 0.1 mg/m3 increase in daily average CO at lag 05 corresponded to −1.25% (95%CI: −1.85%, −0.65%) change in outpatient-visits for vaginitis. Moreover, the association was more significant in those women aged 20–29 years. After adjustment for PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2, and O3, the negative associations of CO with vaginitis kept significant, suggesting relative stability of effect estimates. In summary, this is the first evidence that increased ambient CO exposure can be related to reduced daily outpatient visits for vaginitis. The results of our study may not only help to establish more comprehensive understanding of the health effects of ambient air on vaginitis and other gynecological diseases, but also provide a clue to new potential interventions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient carbon monoxide; Negative association; Outpatient visits; Short-term exposure; Vaginitis","Hospitals; Generalized additive model; Low concentrations; Out-patient data; Outpatient visits; Protective function; Relative stabilities; Short-term exposure; Vaginitis; Carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); health impact; metropolitan area; urban pollution; womens health; adult; air pollutant; air quality standard; ambient air; Article; China; cohort analysis; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental factor; female; human; major clinical study; particulate matter; practice guideline; priority journal; retrospective study; seasonal variation; vaginitis; air pollution; outpatient; young adult; China; Shaanxi; Xian; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Monoxide; China; Female; Humans; Outpatients; Particulate Matter; Vaginitis; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082116293

However, the characteristic VOC species emitted from different sources are of different ozone formation potentials (OFP). Without an in-depth understanding of the relative OFP contributions from specific sources, the effectiveness of the existing approach for controlling ground-level O3 at the regional scale is limited. This study collected and analyzed five years (2012–2016) of monitoring data for 56 most photochemically reactive VOC species at Port Moody, an industrial city in Metro Vancouver, Canada that has experienced elevated O3 levels in its ambience. Source-specific contributions to OFP were quantified for major VOC emitters to deliberate the underlying causes of elevated O3 recently observed in this populated region. Six sources were identified using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, consisting of fuel production and combustion, fuel evaporation, vehicle exhaust, industrial coatings/solvents, petrochemical source, and other industrial emission. Although the top three contributors to total VOCs are fuel production and combustion (34.5%), fuel evaporation (21.4%), and vehicle exhaust (20.6%), the top three contributors to OFP are fuel production and combustion (27.1%), vehicle exhaust (23.7%), and industrial coatings/solvents (17.2%). Additionally, potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis was conducted to generate the geographical distribution of VOC and OFP sources in different seasons. The results revealed that, in the Metro Vancouver area, the OFP hotspots have been significantly different from the VOC emission hotspots. In general, regional sources, especially those located in the northeastern direction of Metro Vancouver, have greater influence on the VOCs levels. However, OFP has been predominantly affected by transportation and industrial sources at the local scale. Therefore, to formulate effective strategies for reducing ground-level O3, the seasonal and spatial variations of major OFP sources should be assessed by the regulatory authorities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ozone formation potential; PMF; PSCF; Source apportionment; VOCs","Coatings; Combustion; Evaporation; Factorization; Fuels; Geographical distribution; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Petrochemicals; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Ground level ozone formation; In-depth understanding; Ozone formation potentials; Positive matrix factorization models; Potential source contribution function; PSCF; Regulatory authorities; Source apportionment; Industrial emissions; acetylene; benzene; butane; cyclohexane; cyclopentane; decane; ethane; ethylbenzene; ethylene; heptane; hexane; isopentane; meta ethyltoluene; methylcyclohexane; n propylbenzene; nonane; octane; ortho ethyltoluene; ortho xylene; oxygen; ozone; para ethyltoluene; pentane; propane; propylene; solvent; styrene; toluene; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; atmospheric modeling; factor analysis; formation mechanism; geographical distribution; metropolitan area; ozone; seasonal variation; source apportionment; volatile organic compound; Article; biofuel production; Canada; carbon footprint; combustion; controlled study; ecosystem monitoring; environmental change; exhaust gas; fuel evaporation; material coating; ozone layer; petrochemical industry; photochemistry; positive matrix factorization; potential ozone formation; priority journal; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081114048

The Δ14C content of the samples were analyzed using a 3 MV Accelerator Mass Spectrometer, and CO2ff concentrations were calculated based on mass balance equations. The results showed that the CO2ff mixing ratio ranged from 15.9 to 25.0 ppm (part per million, equivalent to µmol mol−1), with an average of 20.5 ppm in 2013. The range of measured values became larger in 2014, from 13.9 ppm to 33.1 ppm, with an average of 23.5 ppm. The differences among the average CO2ff concentrations between the central area and outer urban areas were not statistically significant. Although the year-to-year variation of the CO2ff concentration was significant (P &lt; 0.01), there was a distinctly low CO2ff value observed in the northeast corner of the city. CO2ff emissions from vehicle exhaust and residential sources appeared to be more significant than two thermal power plants, according to our observed CO2ff spatial distribution. The variation of pollution source transport recorded in our observations was likely controlled by southwesterly winds. These results could assist in the optimal placement of regional CO2 monitoring stations, and benefit the local government in the implementation of efficient carbon emission reduction measures. © 2020, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","14C; carbon emissions reduction; fossil fuel CO2; Setaria viridis; Xi’an",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084795784

Because of China's considerable efforts in pollution control, one measure of the most important source of air pollution net SO2 emission intensity (NSEI) of thermal power generation has dropped significantly since 2006. Understanding the reasons behind the decline could help further explore the solution-space for deeper mitigation targets. This study combines multiplicative LMDI with attribution analysis to decompose the decline in national NSEI into four factors (i.e. SO2 treatment or end-of-pipe approaches; SO2 emission factor of coal and coal intensity, which both account for cleaner production measures; and geographical structure effects) for 30 regions. Our results show that end-of-pipe technologies remained the primary way to control air pollution in China. In addition, cleaner production efforts contributed to SO2 mitigation. Attribution results at the province level show that northern provinces increased their efforts in SO2 treatment and reducing coal intensity, while southern provinces have done more on reducing the SO2 intensity of coal. Provinces were classified into four categories (i.e. leading regions, end-of-pipe dependent regions, process-dependent regions and lagging regions) according to their performance in terms of end-of-pipe treatment and cleaner production, to help them choose targeted policy methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","LMDI; Regional attribution analysis; SO2 emission intensity; Thermal power generation","Air pollution; Coal; Geographical regions; Thermal pollution; Air pollution in chinas; Cleaner production; Electricity source; Geographical structure; LMDI; Regional attribution analysis; SO2 emissions; Thermal power generation; Air pollution control; cleaner production; decomposition analysis; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution policy; power generation; sulfur emission; thermal power; air pollution; article; China; decomposition; structure activity relation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081031438

Cities in particular play an important role in the decision-making and implementation processes for the energy transition. However, they often have only limited local energy potential and are heavily dependent on supply regions. We therefore assess how a predominantly renewable power supply can be implemented based on the availability of local or imported renewable resources. We present a case study in which an advanced energy system model is parametrized and applied to address questions which are relevant to the transformation of the energy system in China. The model is capable of simultaneously optimizing investment decisions and hourly power balances of a scenario year, taking into account different storage technologies, regional power exchange and policy constraints such as carbon cap, carbon price and renewable portfolio standards. The study takes the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region with Inner Mongolia as a supply region-considered as exemplary regions characterized by heterogeneous infrastructures, resources and consumption-as its model. Starting from a context-related normative energy scenario, we analyze a possible future electricity system under various assumptions using the Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model developed at the DLR (German Aerospace Center). Depending on the estimated potentials of renewable energies, technology costs and the projected electricity demand, the metropolitan region is mainly supplied with imported wind and solar power. A sensitivity analysis considers installed capacities, annual generation, CO2 emissions and costs. The results indicate that the assumption of storage costs is of great importance for the future total costs of an electricity system. Variations in other parameters led to different generation portfolios with similar system costs. Our results provide insights into future regional infrastructure needs, and underline the importance of regional coordination and governance for the energy transition in China. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy system modeling; Energy transition; Metropolitan region; Power system optimization; Renewable energy; Sensitivity analysis","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Electric power systems; Sensitivity analysis; Advanced energy systems; Generation portfolios; German aerospace centers; Implementation process; Regional coordination; Regional infrastructure; Renewable electricity; Renewable portfolio standard; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090801915

In this study, we proposed an improved bottom-up approach combining Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) model and Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method to estimate the carbon emissions by daily travel. Then, a geographical weighted regression (GWR) model considering the urban residential density (RD) and land use mix level (LML) of urban form as independent variables was employed to explore the relationship between urban form and carbon emissions. A typical working day (June 5th of 2017) of Hangzhou was chosen as a case study in this paper. The results showed that (1) per hour carbon emission in the morning peak period of 6:30 a.m.-9:30 a.m. was higher than that in the evening peak of 22:00–24:00 by 33.34%; and distribution of the highest carbon emissions was in the eastern, northeastern and northwestern parts of Hangzhou; (2) The RD and LML were positively and negatively associated with carbon emissions. and the coefficients for Ln (RD) and (LML) ranged from 0.29 to 0.70 and from −9.01 to −6.06, respectively. (3) The spatial distribution of coefficients demonstrated that the highest effects of RD on carbon emissions were observed in the central parts of Hangzhou, and those of LML on carbon emissions were observed in southern Hangzhou featured by industrial parks.

To better formulate low-carbon transformation measures, we calculated and compared China's production-based carbon emissions (PD-CEs) and consumption-based carbon emissions (CD-CEs) from 2000 to 2014 based on the Multi-Regional Input–Output tables. We also performed a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the factors contributing to changes in China's PD-CEs and CD-CEs. The study's findings are as follows: First, China's PD-CEs are continually larger than its CD-CEs, such that China is a net exporter of emissions. However, China's exported emissions and net exported emissions peaked at 2200 and 1786 Mt., respectively, as of 2007. In 2014, China's net exported emissions were 1371 Mt., down 23.25% compared with 2007. Second, China's PD-CEs mainly serve the domestic final demand, and China's CD-CEs are mainly emitted at home. Production and supply of electric power, steam and hot water is the biggest contributor to China's PD-CEs while Construction the largest contributor to China's CD-CEs. Third, the SDA results show that China's PD-CEs and CD-CEs mainly grew due to changes in China's final demand volume. The significant restraint to the growth of China's PD-CEs and CD-CEs is the effect of changes in the domestic emission intensity. Changes in China's ties with other economies have an important impact on China's carbon emissions. Developing economies are replacing developed economies as major destinations for China's emissions export. Fourth, the growth rate of China's PD-CEs and CD-CEs significantly slowed down and the factors contributing to the changes in China's PD-CEs and PD-CEs have changed after China's economy entered the new normal. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Consumption-based CO2 emissions; Multi-regional input-output model; Production-based CO2 emissions; Structural decomposition analysis","Emission control; Growth rate; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Developed economies; Developing economies; Domestic emissions; Low carbon transformations; Production and consumption; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Carbon; carbon emission; consumption behavior; decomposition analysis; energy use; environmental economics; pollution tax; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086376708

The experiment was conducted in the academic year 2017-2018, in collaboration with the city of Wejherowo. The project's main goal was to solve the city's real problems related to climate change, land development and water management. The project was implemented experimentally as part of two subjects: spatial planning, and monitoring and environmental management to ensure an interdisciplinary approach and cover the scope of the project fully. The results of the experiment confirmed the evidence-based advantages of PjBL. However, several methodological, organisational and technical problems, which need to be resolved before a new edition starts, were encountered during the experimental implementation of the method. The experiment was positively received by students, clients, and tutors. To evaluate the impact of PjBL on spatial planning education, the new edition must include a methodological framework for evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation to climate change; Civil engineering; Project-based learning; Spatial planning; Transversal skills","academic research; adaptive management; climate change; environmental management; environmental monitoring; interdisciplinary approach; knowledge; learning; spatial planning; teaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085753359

This experience is acquired over time and when implanting conventional/non-locked screws in osteopenic cancellous bone the experienced surgeon still strips between 38 and 45%. Technology needs to be investigated to reduce stripping rates. Acoustic-Emission technology has the ability to detect stress wave energy transmitted through a screw during insertion into synthetic bone. Our hypothesis is Acoustic-Emission waves can be detected through standard orthopaedic screwdrivers while advancing screws through purchase and overtightening in cancellous human bone with different bone mineral densities replicating the clinical state. METHODS: 77 non-locking 4 mm and 6.5 mm diameter cancellous bone screws were inserted through to stripping into the lateral condylar area of 6 pairs of embalmed distal femurs. Specimens had varying degrees of bone mineral density determined by quantitative CT. Acoustic-Emission energy and axial force were detected for each test. RESULTS: The tests showed a significant high correlation between bone mineral density and Acoustic-Emission energy with R = 0.74. A linear regression model with the mean stripping load as the dependent variable and mean Acoustic-Emission energy, bone mineral densities and screw size as the independent variables resulted in r2 = 0.94. INTERPRETATION: This experiment succeeded in testing real time Acoustic-Emission monitoring of screw purchase and overtightening in human bone. Acoustic-Emission energy and axial compressive force have positive high correlation to bone mineral density.

With integrated modules for building and envelope simulation these complex models allow the assessment of measures in the building sector on the urban climate, e.g. for mitigation of urban heat island effects or preparing for the effects of climate change. However, the currently existing models do not fulfil the requirements that arise in the field of urban planning, as they lack for example functionality, user-friendliness, are hard to integrate in the municipalities' technical equipment or are not freely available. The German research and development project Urban Climate under Change (2016-2019) developed and validated a new innovative urban climate model called PALM-4U. Aim of the research was to create a model that meets the requirements of users in science as well as practitioners in engineering offices and urban administrations. Therefore, technical features and operational functionalities which the model has to meet to support users in their daily work have been assessed in a first project phase. In total more than 200 requirements were collected which are summed up in the so called ""User and Requirements Catalogue"". They served as the basis for testing and evaluating the model's real-world applicability. To ensure that these complex requirements are met, the whole project follows a transdisciplinary approach integrating science (model development and data assimilation) and practice (user requirements, testing and evaluation) applying a living lab approach: Stakeholders from participating cities and companies took part in on-site workshops, introducing the model with practical use-cases. Afterwards, participants were given tasks covering different features of the model's applications, which they tested in personal use. The model fulfils the majority of the tested requirements and the users appreciated the model's concept and functionality. But further development is necessary to provide the practitioners a tool that is applicable in their daily work: Preparation of input data, a user-friendly graphical user-interface, enhanced interfaces to other software and planning tools, use cases that were prepared from experts as well as guidelines and tools for result assessment and interpretation were main suggestions for improvement.. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Climate change; Graphical user interfaces; Integration testing; Urban growth; Research and development projects; Technical equipments; Technical features; Testing and evaluation; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Urban administrations; Urban climate modeling; Urban Heat Island Effects; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088465816

Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27) of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82% of real-world examples of climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs, highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers, and we discuss how these could be overcome. Our review provides a comprehensive synthesis of planning frameworks, case studies, adaptation strategies and management actions which can inform a more coordinated global effort to adapt existing and future MPA networks to continued climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptive management; biodiversity protection; climate change; connectivity; marine protected area network; marine reserve; systematic conservation planning; vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; environmental conditions; environmental planning; marine park; acclimatization; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; refugium; Acclimatization; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Refugium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084078205

However, the literature that discusses different structures of environmental extensions (EEs), that is, the scope of physical flows and their attribution to sectors in the monetary input–output table (MIOT), remains fragmented. This article investigates the conceptual and empirical implications of applying two different but frequently used designs of EEs, using the case of energy accounting, where one represents energy supply while the other energy use in the economy. We derive both extensions from an official energy supply–use dataset and apply them to the same single-region input–output (SRIO) model of Austria, thereby isolating the effect that stems from the decision for the extension design. We also crosscheck the SRIO results with energy footprints from the global multi-regional input–output (GMRIO) dataset EXIOBASE. Our results show that the ranking of footprints of final demand categories (e.g., household and export) is sensitive to the extension design and that product-level results can vary by several orders of magnitude. The GMRIO-based comparison further reveals that for a few countries the supply-extension result can be twice the size of the use-extension footprint (e.g., Australia and Norway). We propose a graph approach to provide a generalized framework to disclosing the design of EEs. We discuss the conceptual differences between the two extension designs by applying analogies to hybrid life-cycle assessment and conclude that our findings are relevant for monitoring of energy efficiency and emission reduction targets and corporate footprint accounting. © 2019 The Authors.

Following the Permian–Triassic boundary mass extinction (PTBME), the carbon cycle changed profoundly during the following 5.4 Myr, with magnitudes of changes comparable to those of the Precambrian. In pace with the successive cycles of the carbon budget, the recovery of the marine nekton underwent several evolutionary diversification and extinction cycles accompanied by eustatic sea-level changes and profound ecological reorganization of land plants, all indicative of climatic changes. Additional eruptive bursts of the Siberian Large Igneous Province (SLIP) are traditionally called upon as a plausible trigger for these climatic oscillations but firm evidence for coeval SLIP volcanism is still lacking. Based on new precise and accurate U-Pb zircon ages, we establish a high-resolution temporal calibration of the biggest positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) spanning about 600 kyr in the late Smithian. The age of the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB) is established between 249.29 ± 0.06 and 249.11 ± 0.09 Ma. Our oldest U-Pb zircon ages indicate no overlap in time between the middle Smithian onset of the thermal maximum and the youngest available U-Pb zircon ages from SLIP volcanism. The constructed time line also indicates a duration of the global unconformity at the SSB that is compatible with glacio-eustatism. Potential cooling mechanisms such as a volcanic winter, the biological pump and the cessation of volcanism are discussed in the light of this new time line. In the low latitudes, the onset of the positive CIE remarkably predates the temperature drop by some 100 to 125 kyr. However, as long as the magnitude of such offset – if any – is unknown for the high latitudes, relations between the CIE and the cooling will remain an open question associated with largest Triassic extinction of the nekton. © Copyright © 2020 Widmann, Bucher, Leu, Vennemann, Bagherpour, Schneebeli-Hermann, Goudemand and Schaltegger.","Bayesian age-depth model; biochronology; carbon cycle; carbon isotopes; Early Triassic; Smithian-Spathian boundary; U-Pb geochronology","Binary alloys; Budget control; Climate change; Isotopes; Lead alloys; Sea level; Silicate minerals; Zircon; Carbon isotope excursions; Climatic oscillations; Eustatic sea level; Global climate changes; Large igneous provinces; Temperature drops; Temporal calibration; Triassic biotic recoveries; Carbon; age determination; biochronology; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; climate change; Triassic; uranium-lead dating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087010061

This project, funded through the Department of Energy CarbonSAFE initiative, aims to characterize the potential storage capacity and preferential fluid-flow pathways through the Permian White Rim Sandstone on and near the San Rafael Swell, Utah, to assess the formation's viability as a possible CO2 sequestration reservoir. A diverse suite of sedimentological observations and diagenetic analyses was used to assess the White Rim Sandstone's reservoir potential, including detailed outcrop observations, facies descriptions and ichnology, measured stratigraphic sections with associated correlations, permeability measurements, thin-section petrography, and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. Stratigraphically, the White Rim Sandstone has two major units separated by a marine transgressive surface. The lower eolian unit is characterized by decimeter- to meter-scale trough cross-bedded grain-flow and wind-ripple facies. The upper reworked, shallow-marine unit has a consistent set of facies at all three field sites: (1) soft-sediment deformation facies (e.g., contorted bedding or clastic pipes), (2) symmetric ripple laminations, (3) bioturbated (dominantly horizontal), and (4) bioturbated (dominantly vertical). This set of four facies represents the transgression of the Permian Kaibab sea over the Permian White Rim coastal dune field. The outcrop samples and subsurface core samples (~1561-2243 m deep and ~33-50 km away from the outcrop localities) experienced different diagenetic fluid-flow histories that drastically impacted the reservoir properties. Outcrop samples have initial quartz overgrowth cements followed by rim-forming calcite cements, iron oxide cements, and occasional oil staining. In contrast, the core samples show significant compaction, followed by quartz overgrowth cementation and a later stage of patchy, large, pore-filling calcite cement that eliminated the porosity and permeability of the potential reservoir (&lt;0.1 md). Outcrop permeability values tend to reflect textural differences in facies, particularly the presence and spacing of internal laminations and bounding surfaces. Facies with fewer internal laminations, such as the grain-flow facies, have higher permeability values than facies with closely spaced internal laminae, such as the wind-ripple facies. Disruption of original bedding (e.g., soft-sediment deformation or bioturbation) alters original depositional textures and creates preferential flow pathways with the potential to increase permeability. Overall, if the diagenesis and resulting low permeability values of the core samples are representative of the White Rim Sandstone at depth, then the White Rim Sandstone would not make a high-quality storage reservoir despite initial, promising outcrop results. © 2020.

Afforestation will be promoted through a series of incentives, including payments for carbon sequestration linked to New Zealand's Emission Trading Scheme. Given that afforestation will be pursued voluntarily, the identification of future afforestation areas is paramount to assist policy formulation and avoid unintended land-use outcomes. We identified spatially-explicit drivers of forest gain and the locations most likely to experience afforestation in the country using two distinct spatial modelling frameworks: logistic regressions and artificial neural networks (ANN). Five of the eight most significant drivers of forest gain that have influenced past afforestation patterns according to our logistic regressions (i.e., erosion potential, distance from exotic forests, woody grasslands, grassland productivity, and slope) were also ranked among the ten most influential drivers by the ANN model. These results indicate an overall agreement between the two modelling approaches, despite substantial methodological differences.

Solar and wind energy are prominent renewable energy sources, and many countries around the globe are investing in these sources, which makes their installed capacity to overgrow. Both sources present an inherent variable, partly complex and unpredictable nature what imposes challenges to national grid operators to determine the available amount of power at a given moment. The spread use of both solar and wind energy could engender a complementarity behavior reducing their inherent and variable characteristics what would improve predictability and operability of the electrical grid. The study of the combined use of wind and solar power is a fundamental aspect of large-scale grid integration. Therefore, the goal of this work is to make a critical review of the state-of-the-art approaches to understand and assess the complementarity between grid-connected solar and wind power systems through the analysis of different methodologies and locations. The literature survey revealed 41 papers that were analyzed in the manuscript. The combined use of wind and solar in many places results in a smoother power supply, which is crucial for the operability and safety of electrical grids worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Complementarity; Grid-connected system; Solar power; Wind power","Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar energy; Wind power; Alternative solutions; Complementarity; Grid connected systems; Installed capacity; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; State-of-the-art approach; Wind and solar power; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079650595

Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands","Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach to drive green, carbon-free production of hydrogen (H2). In ‘classic’ water splitting, oxygen (O2) is formed at the anode as a by-product. It has been suggested that substitution of anodic O2production with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could increase the financial attractiveness of PEC water splitting. Here, we present a techno-economic analysis of a photoelectrochemical H2/H2O2process. Specifically, we model photoelectrochemical farms with industrially relevant production capacities. Two scenarios are considered: (i) a theoretical scenario with an optimal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 27.55% and (ii) a literature-based state-of-the-art scenario with an STH efficiency of 10.1%. When applying an averaged market value of $0.85 kg−1for H2O2, the analysis reveals a negative levelized cost of hydrogen (LCH) for scenario (i),i.e.$6.45 kg−1, and for scenario (ii) an LCH of $6.19 kg−1. Our results imply that these values are superior to the LCH of ‘classic’ PEC water splitting (ca.$10 kg−1), while the negative value for scenario (i) even outcompetes the LCH of steam methane reforming ($1.4 kg−1). We predict that significant reduction in the LCH can be realized within the PEC community when future research is aimed at enhancing the stability of the photoanode and optimizing the STH efficiency for anodic H2O2formation. This manuscript clearly demonstrates the financial benefits of value-added product formation, such as hydrogen peroxide, over O2formation. In a broader context, our analysis verifies that further research on valuable commodity chemicals at the anode in water splitting and CO2reduction should be stimulated in the future to facilitate implementation of emerging, cost-intensive technologies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Anodes; Chemical plants; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Hydrogen peroxide; Industrial economics; Oxidation; Peroxides; Photoelectrochemical cells; Solar power generation; Steam reforming; Commodity chemicals; Hydrogen peroxide production; Photoelectrochemical water splitting; Photoelectrochemicals; Production capacity; Production of hydrogen; Techno-Economic analysis; Value added products; Hydrogen production; electrochemical method; electrode; feasibility study; hydrogen peroxide; hydrolysis; industrial technology; photodegradation; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085997729

A systematic and complete investigation of the state and evolution of the energy consumption structure (ECS) of global countries is of great importance to figure out the different positions, responsibilities and missions of each country in the global climate change cooperation. Furthermore, such task is of great policy implications to generate a global reference system for different countries, guiding each one to improve, update and optimize its ECS. However, most existing studies regarding the world ECS neglects the evolutionary trends of ECS and their distributional positions in the global picture. Noting the paucity of studies of convergence in ECS across the world countries, this paper aims to explore the evolution of ECS at the national level and the global level to sharpen understandings on the state of global energy transition by employing the distribution dynamics approach. Three major energy sources were investigated, including coal, oil, and natural gas. The dataset was collected from the Global Trade Analysis Project database whose latest version covers the period from 2004 to 2014. In the second part of the analysis, the dataset is further divided into different income groups so as to evaluate the impacts of income on the distribution dynamics. A distribution dynamics approach is used to analyze the data of almost all the countries and regions in the world. The visualization of global ECS provides an insightful and novel understanding on the underlying trends. This study fills an important gap in the literature by providing several important findings which are not available from traditional econometric techniques. First, many countries would reduce their relative coal and oil consumption in the future but oil would remain to be the most common form of energy source. However, great variability can be observed for the distribution of gas consumption. Second, from the ergodic distribution of the gas market, it can be observed convergence clubs may emerge in the long run as the countries would congregate in certain clusters with similar levels of gas consumption. These findings call for further research and policy planning for the development of gas industry. Third, the distribution dynamics is very different for the four income groups (according to the World Bank), and so it is necessary to take a country's income level into consideration in formulating energy policies. Fourth, our findings reflect the issue of global inequality amongst the countries as the energy consumption of the poor countries are much lower than the other countries. Fifth, oil is deemed to be the most popular form of energy sources for the upper-middle-income and high-income countries, while coal is not a preferred energy source for the affluent countries, thereby suggesting the need to provide aid to the poor countries for mitigating the use of coal. Finally, gas consumption seems to have a very high variability and the countries can have very different consumption patterns of gas even if they belong to the same income category, implying that country-specific policies should be formulated for the development of the gas industry. Furthermore, it is observed that for the lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries, the big consumers of gas tend to increase their gas consumption further. The findings derived from this study may prove valuable for the policy makers in formulating energy policies for adapting to market changes, and may assist the design of international aid program on mitigating carbon emissions for the poor countries. © Copyright © 2020 Wei, Chung, Cheong and Chui.","climate change; energy consumption structure (ECS); global energy transition; transitional dynamics; transitional dynamics approach","Climate change; Coal; Coal industry; Dynamics; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Public policy; Consumption patterns; Distribution of gas; Energy consumption structure; Ergodic distribution; Global climate changes; Global reference systems; Middle-income countries; Policy implications; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086372266

There have been many studies on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants embodied in regional trade, but there are insufficient studies analyzing the imbalance between the economic benefits and environmental costs embodied in trade. Electricity-related carbon emissions are the main contributor to global warming, explaining more than 40% of carbon emissions both globally and in China. This study uses the network approach and multiregional input-output (MRIO) model to quantify the electricity-related carbon emissions and value added embodied in China's interprovincial trade from 2007 to 2012 and also applies the regional environmental inequality (REI) index to measure the imbalance of electricity-related carbon emissions and economic benefits embodied in such trade. The results show that 20–80% of the electricity-related carbon emissions and 15–70% of the value added of a province's final demand are outsourced to other provinces. The major directions of the net value added and electricity-related carbon emissions embodied in China's interprovincial trade were from north to south and from the center to the east. Unequal bilateral interprovincial trade mainly occurred between inland provinces and developed provinces, and western provinces (such as Guizhou, Gansu, and Ningxia) suffered economic and environmental losses from interprovincial trade. This study can promote understanding of the distribution impacts of domestic trade on environmental costs and economic benefits and provide a reference for China's cross-provincial carbon emission mitigation policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Electricity; Interprovincial trade; Multiregional input-output model","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic conditions; electricity; environmental economics; input-output analysis; international trade; trade-environment relations; Article; carbon footprint; China; cost benefit analysis; electricity; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; Ningxia; pollutant; China; electricity; socioeconomics; China; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Electricity; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082180902

For this purpose, three scenarios (REF, AEDP2015 and AEDP2018), developed in this paper, represent penetration levels of electricity generated from renewable energy. The implications have been analyzed through the application of LEAP model for the period 2018–2037. The analyses revealed that high penetrations of renewable energy would have positive impacts on the Thai electricity generation from several perspectives including improving the diversification of electricity supply, decreasing fossil fuel imports for generating electricity, less dependency on fossil fuel, environmentally friendly power generation, utilizing agricultural wastes, and build-up of local capabilities in electricity generation. Moreover, the energy transition due to disruptive innovations would make renewable energy more attractive. However, the transition would raise several challenges for the Thai electricity system, for example, capital-intensive investment, centralized electricity system, traditional regulatory framework and a lack of social involvement. In order to address the transitional challenges, the Thai government has initiated a number of policies including the upgrade of the grid to smart grid, the development of energy storage and the revision of the regulations to support local energy business. In addition to the initiation of the government’s policies, this paper suggests that a structural change in the form of a separation between generation and transmission functions of the state electric utility, the development of new infrastructure and network regulation, and collaborations among stakeholders by increasing more participation and governance as well as aligning regulatory arrangement taking into account more on social objectives would provide a robust pathway to efficiently integrate renewable energy into the Thai electricity system. © 2020 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is regarded as a promising way for utilizing CO2 as a feedstock to produce value-added chemicals driven by sustainable solar energy. Efficient photocatalysts are crucially important for achieving high performance CO2RR. Taking the advantages of hollow structure in light harvesting, large surface area and ability to enrich the local CO2 concentration, the hollow photocatalysts have demonstrated their great potential for photocatalytic CO2RR.

However, high content of phosphorus in ISSA distinctly lowers the compressive strength of construction materials. This work presented a new method for phosphorus removal from ISSA with thermo-chemical reduction assisted by calcium chloride (CaCl2) based on carbon reduction reaction and converted phosphate to gas P. It was shown that 82 wt% phosphorus was removed under the addition of 40 wt% CaCl2 and 40 wt% C at 1373 K, and the removal rate of P was significantly enhanced by CaCl2. Results showed that the addition of CaCl2 lowered the treating temperature, increased the reactivity and decreased CO2 production as well. CaCl2 molten salt effectively contributed to both solid-state reaction and Ca5(PO4)3Cl formation, acting both as a flux and chlorine source.

This study proposes, formulates and solves a collaborative two-echelon multicenter vehicle routing problem based on a state–space–time (CTMCVRP-SST) network to facilitate collaboration and resource sharing in a multiperiod state–space–time (SST) logistics network. The CTMCVRP-SST aims to facilitate collaboration in logistics networks by leveraging the spatial-temporal properties of logistics demands and resources to optimize the distribution of logistics resources in space and time to meet logistics demands. A three-component solution framework is proposed to solve CTMCVRP-SST. First, a bi-objective linear programming model based on resource sharing in a multiperiod SST network is formulated to minimize the number of vehicles and the total cost of the collaborative operation. Second, an integrated algorithm consisting of SST-based dynamic programming (DP), improved K-means clustering and improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (Im-NSGAII) is developed to obtain optimal routes. Third, a cost gap allocation model is employed to design a collaborative mechanism that encourages cooperation among logistics service providers. Using this solution framework, the coalition sequences (i.e., the order of each logistics provider joining a collaborative coalition) are designed and the stability of the coalitions based on profit allocations is studied. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in minimizing the total cost with all other constraints being the same. An empirical case study of a logistics network in Chongqing suggests that the proposed collaboration mechanism with SST network representation can reduce costs, improve transportation efficiency, and contribute to efficient and sustainable logistics network operations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost gap allocation; Multicenter vehicle routing problem; Resource sharing; State–space–time network; Synchronization","Dynamic programming; Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Internet service providers; K-means clustering; Linear programming; Network routing; Supersonic aircraft; Synchronization; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Improved k-means clustering; Linear programming models; Logistics service provider; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Resource sharing; Transportation efficiency; Vehicle routing optimization; Vehicle Routing Problems; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079594658

Separate and joint (simultaneous) optimizations of SO2 and NO2 emissions are both conducted and compared. Posterior emissions, compared to the prior, yield improvements in simulating columnar SO2 and NO2, in comparison to measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and OMPS. The posterior SO2 and NOx emissions from separate inversions are 748GgS and 672GgN, which are 36% and 6% smaller than prior MIX emissions (valid for 2010), respectively. In spite of the large reduction of SO2 emissions over the North China Plain, the simulated sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosol optical depth (AOD) only decrease slightly, which can be attributed to (a) nitrate rather than sulfate as the dominant contributor to AOD and (b) replacement of ammonium sulfate with ammonium nitrate as SO2 emissions are reduced. For joint inversions, both data quality control and the weight given to SO2 relative to NO2 observations can affect the spatial distributions of the posterior emissions. When the latter is properly balanced, the posterior emissions from assimilating OMPS SO2 and NO2 jointly yield a difference of -3% to 15% with respect to the separate assimilations for total anthropogenic SO2 emissions and ±2% for total anthropogenic NOx emissions; but the differences can be up to 100% for SO2 and 40% for NO2 in some grid cells. Improvements on SO2 and NO2 simulations from the joint inversions are overall consistent with those from separate inversions. Moreover, the joint assimilations save ∼50% of the computational time compared to assimilating SO2 and NO2 separately in a sequential manner of computation. The sensitivity analysis shows that a perturbation of NH3 to 50% (20%) of the prior emission inventory can (a) have a negligible impact on the separate SO2 inversion but can lead to a decrease in posterior SO2 emissions over China by -2.4% (-7.0%) in total and up to -9.0% (-27.7%) in some grid cells in the joint inversion with NO2 and (b) yield posterior NOx emission decreases over China by -0.7% (-2.8%) for the separate NO2 inversion and by -2.7% (-5.3%) in total and up to -15.2% (-29.4%) in some grid cells for the joint inversion. The large reduction of SO2 between 2010 and 2013, however, only leads to ∼10% decrease in AOD regionally; reducing surface aerosol concentration requires the reduction of emissions of NH3 as well. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Increasing the proportion of renewable energy in energy is a demand for development in the new era and a guarantee for sustainable development. Biomass energy is one of the most extensive renewable energy sources in the world. All energy production stages of this kind of energy can be intervened manually, and can even assist other energy peaking. In contrast, wind energy and solar energy do not have this advantage and power generation must cooperate with peak shaving. Therefore, the main research object of this study is biomass energy in Shandong Province.In this paper, researchers first built a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of renewable energy policy in Shandong Province according to the current development. Then, by simulating the increase of biomass price electricity price subsidies by 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% compared with the base year, researchers analyzed the effects of electricity price subsidies on economic development, energy consumption, and carbon emission reduction.

To investigate the effectiveness of the controls, we deployed an aerosol chemical speciation monitor and collected filter samples at Xianghe, a representative site for the BTH, to characterize the aerosol composition during the implementation of the JAP. Those results were compared with earlier data obtained from a literature survey and reanalysis of studies in the BTH. During several pollution episodes in the control period, the major aerosol types changed relative to the earlier studies from sulfate, oxygenated organic aerosol, and coal combustion organic aerosol to nitrate and biomass burning organic aerosol. The dominant secondary inorganic aerosol species during the JAP changed from sulfate to nitrate, and the main source for primary organic aerosol switched from coal combustion to biomass burning. These changes can be explained by the fact that the JAP controls targeted coal combustion and SO2 but not biomass burning or NOx emissions.

TiO2 was embedded in PVDF nanowire due to the inducement of element F, while the TiO2 nanoparticles on PVDF facilitated transporting the photo-generated electron-hole pairs to the Ti-F groups, which performed as electron-trapping sites due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine. The possible mechanism of CO2 reduction is depicted involving two distinct functional regions – the production regions (TiO2) and the consumption regions (graphene sheets) of the photo-generated electrons. In this photocatalysis system, the photo-generated electrons are quickly captured and transferred in a timely manner, efficiently suppressing the recombination of photo-generated carriers. The electron reservoirs in the graphene sheets can then accelerate the photoreduction reaction and promote the conversion of CO2 to CH4 (methane), leading to a highly efficient photoreduction of CO2 under visible light illumination, which is a promising material in new energy development, mitigating climate change. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Graphene; Photocatalysis; Synergy; Titania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076290478

We conducted an empirical study of the barriers and requirements to adapting to climate change of 539 peasant households in an ecologically vulnerable area of China to enhance their resilience to climate change by improving our understanding of adaptation process and decision-making. Our findings indicated that farmers in the Gannan Plateau face multiple adaptation barriers, of which normative, information and technology barriers were more serious, such as lack of meteorological information service, infrastructure and technology extension in agriculture or animal husbandry. Adaptation requirements are an important way to effectively reduce or eliminate obstacles and improve farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change. The survey found that local households have an urgent requirement for infrastructure, information and production technologies, such as water, electricity, transportation facilities, disaster warning information, employment information and farming or breeding techniques. In addition, due to the influence of economic level, education level, years of farming, gender and other factors, differences exist in the adaptation barriers and requirements faced by farmers in different regions. These findings extend empirical evidence in favor of formulating a reasonable adaptation framework and choosing optimal adaptation strategies, which are essential for enacting well-targeted regional adaptation policies. © 2019","Adaptation requirements; Climate change; Cognitive barriers; Normative barriers; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau","adaptive management; climate change; developing world; environmental policy; policy implementation; strategic approach; China; Gannan; Gansu; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078739044

This paper examined the driving factors of PM2.5 pollution of 26 prefecture-level cities in the YRD from 2006 to 2016, based on the perspective of population development and its three factors: population size, population quality, and population structure. The quantile regression model was applied to systematically investigate the heterogeneity of the causes of urban PM2.5 pollution under different quantile levels. The empirical results showed that the increase of urbanization rate (a representative indicator of population size) and the urban disposable income per capita (a representative indicator of population quality) significantly reduced the PM2.5 pollution. The PM2.5 emissions increased correspondingly with the expansion of population structure indicators. Moreover, the effects of population development on the PM2.5 pollution in YRD cities had both homogeneity and heterogeneity. The homogeneity was supported by the fact that the impacts of most population variables decreased with increasing quantile level. This indicated that the PM2.5 pollution was more sensitive to population development when the pollution level was low. The heterogeneity relied on two aspects: firstly, the key driving factors of PM2.5 pollution differed in cities with same pollution level; secondly, with increasing pollution levels, the impacts of different population development factors on PM2.5 pollution presented different trends. Policy recommendations from the perspective of population development are provided for prefecture-level cities to control PM2.5 pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Heterogeneity; PM2.5 pollution; Population development; Quantile regression model","Pollution control; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Heterogeneity; Metropolitan regions; Pm2.5 pollutions; Policy recommendations; Population development; Population structures; Quantile regression; Urban agglomerations; River pollution; agglomeration; atmospheric pollution; heterogeneity; homogeneity; population structure; urbanization; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079332911

In most countries, climate zoning is based on simplified climate models, and it is difficult to accurately represent the energy demand characteristics of buildings. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel climate subdivision method that tackles the complex relations between climate and building energy-efficient, which move from traditional weather-based approaches to a performance-based approach. Integrate the uncertainty analysis method and the building dynamic performance simulation to extract a novel statistically significant index as the basis for classification. The K-means clustering method and discriminant analysis method are used to obtain and verify the clustering results, respectively. Furthermore, the comparison with clustering results based on degree days confirms the superiority of the new method proposed in this paper in identifying building energy demand. The method is applied to the cold climate zone of China as a showcase. The results show significant differences in building energy demand and the order of key features affecting building performance between each region in the climatic zones. The zone can be further sub-divided into four groups considering the climate factor and building feature uncertainty, and clustering results have been verified by several evaluation indicators. © 2020","Building energy demand; Climatic zoning; Cluster analysis; Discriminant analysis; Uncertainty analysis","Buildings; Climate models; Cluster analysis; Discriminant analysis; Energy management; K-means clustering; Uncertainty analysis; Zoning; Building energy demands; Building performance; Discriminant analysis methods; Evaluation indicators; Feature uncertainty; K-means clustering method; Performance based approach; Subdivision methods; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082595613

This is especially true for China, the United States and India, which produce over half of the world's carbon emissions. China, the United States, and India represent three different types of carbon emissions data. The first data type is typical for China: rapid grows which is thereafter slowing down. The US carbon emissions data show volatile growth and decline. The third data type is common for India's data: accelerated growth. To deal with the volatility of the data and to improve the forecasting accuracy, this paper combines Metabolic Nonlinear Grey Model (MNGM) with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to develop the combined MNGM-ARIMA model, and MNGM with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) to develop the new combined MNGM-BPNN model. In this way, ARIMA and BPNN could correct the modelling residual error of MNGM, to decrease the forecasting error. Through the quantitative data study of the countries in focus, we have made the following findings: First, the mean relative percent errors of the proposed MNGM-ARIMA and MNGM-BPNN models are 1.35% and 1.57%, which are lower than the traditional MNGM, ARIMA, and BPNN models. Besides, it is projected that during the period of 2019–2030, the US′ carbon emissions will keep a downward trend, while carbon emissions in China and India will continue to grow. Finally yet importantly, in the future periods of time, the carbon emissions growth rate in India will be faster than that for China. The above findings have led us to the following conclusions: (1) Error values of those two proposed approaches have proven that the strategy of correcting the forecasting error of the previous models with the latter models can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy. (2) The proposed two combined forecasting techniques have shown sound performance for the three types of data. It is reasonable to believe that new approaches will help to improve insight into better forecasting carbon emissions in other countries and regions of the world. (3) China and India will remain the major sources of global carbon emissions, and should therefore continue their efforts on carbon emission reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ARIMA; Back propagation neural network; Forecasting carbon emissions; Grey forecasting model","Backpropagation; Carbon; Emission control; Errors; Growth rate; Neural networks; Torsional stress; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Back-propagation neural networks; Carbon emissions; Emission data; Forecasting carbon emission; Gray Model; Grey forecasting model; Moving averages; Neural network model; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081654934

A significant positive correlation was found between the NH3 and PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. By examining the relationships between meteorological parameters and the NH3 concentration, both near-surface temperature and relative humidity showed positive correlations with the NH3 concentration. The higher NH3 concentrations were usually associated with the warming of the upper atmosphere. Distinct wind directions were noted during the days of the top and bottom 33.3% NH3 concentrations. The top 33.3% concentrations were primarily related to southwesterly winds, while the bottom ones were associated with westerly and northerly winds. Since there are strong NH3 emissions in the southern plains adjacent to Beijing, the regional transport induced by the southerly prevailing winds would increase the NH3 concentration in Beijing significantly. From 23 to 25 May, more than one third of NH3 in Beijing was contributed by the southerly transport processes. Thus, joint efforts to reduce NH3 emissions in the whole Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are necessary to regulate the NH3 concentration in Beijing. © 2020 by the authors.","Backward trajectory analysis; Regional transport; Thermal stratification; WRF-Chem","Chemical analysis; Upper atmosphere; Wind; Ammonia concentrations; Backward trajectory; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Meteorological parameters; Near surface temperature; Observational analysis; Positive correlations; South-westerly winds; Ammonia; ammonia; concentration (composition); emission; particulate matter; relative humidity; wind direction; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086768222

The purpose of this study is to present the lateral and vertical distribution of underpressure conditions in the Huimin Depression determined using the drill stem tests (DSTs) and the well log data. This paper also provides the origins of the underpressure both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as the effects of the underpressure on the distribution of hydrocarbons. The results show two vertical underpressure units at depths of 1,500–2,500 m and 3,000–4,000 m with a pressure coefficient of 0.8–0.95. Laterally, the underpressure is mainly distributed in the Northern Tectonic Uplift Belt (NTUB) and Southern Slope Belt (SSB). The rock dilation and temperature reduction caused the pressure reductions of 3–4 and 1–3 MPa, respectively. The diffusion of natural gas plays a limited role on the underpressure. An analysis of the lateral seals of faults indicates that the underpressured regions developed in areas with faults with shale gouge ratio (SGR) values larger than 0.6. We propose that the widely distributed underpressure in the Huimin Depression is related to rock dilation, temperature reduction, and fault sealing. An analysis of hydrocarbon migration and reservoirs showed the pumping effect provided by the deficient pressure could make underpressured regions the primary targets for hydrocarbon accumulation, and in the Huimin Depression, underpressure might be more important than overpressure. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Huimin Depression; hydrocarbon accumulation; origin of underpressure; rock dilation; temperature reduction; underpressure characteristics","gas field; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon migration; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; pressure field; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rift zone; tectonic setting; uplift; Bohai Sea; Bohaiwan Basin; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074294914

Environmental taxation is seen as an effective economic tool to help mitigate air pollution. In order to assess the effects of different scenarios of environmental taxation policies, we propose a frontier-based environmentally extended input–output optimization model with explicit emission abatement sectors to reflect the inputs and benefits of abatement. Frontier analysis ensures policy scenarios are assessed under the same technical efficiency benchmark, while input–output analysis depicts the wide range of economic transactions among sectors of an economy. Four scenarios are considered in this study, which are increasing specific tax rates of SO2, NOx, and soot and dust separately and increasing all three tax rates simultaneously. Our estimation results show that: raising tax rates of SO2, NOx, and soot and dust simultaneously would have the highest emission reduction effects, with the SO2 tax rate making the greatest contribution to emission reduction. Raising the soot and dust tax rate is the most environmentally friendly strategy due to its highest abatement to welfare through avoided health costs. The combination of frontier analysis and input–output analysis provides policy makers a comprehensive and sectoral approach to assess costs and benefits of environmental taxation. © 2019 by Yale University","air pollution; data envelopment analysis (DEA); environmental tax; environmentally extended input–output table; frontier analysis; optimization model","Air pollution; Data envelopment analysis; Dust; Dust abatement; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Soot; Taxation; Economic development; Economic transactions; Environmental pollutions; Environmental taxation; Environmental taxes; Frontier analysis; Optimization modeling; Technical efficiency; Cost benefit analysis; benchmarking; cost-benefit analysis; economic development; environmental economics; environmental fate; environmental policy; environmental tax; frontier region; natural resource; optimization; policy making; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073833961

The overall concentrations of the target compounds ranged from 0.15 to 2.75 μg/L in the surface water and from 0.43 to 377 μg/L in the emission sources. Relatively high concentration levels were observed in August, during which the rainy season typically occurred in the study area, indicating seasonal emission sources. The spatial distribution revealed severe phenolic-compound contamination in the northeast part of the study area. According to the relationships between the surface water and emission sources, combined-sewer overflow and surface runoff from agricultural activities were identified as seasonal emission sources that were responsible for the increased concentration levels in wet seasons.

Considering the significant differences of natural and social environments in different regions of China, this paper presents a regional-scale decomposition of energy-related carbon emission and its decoupling from economic growth by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and the Tapio decoupling method. The decoupling results indicate that carbon emissions in all regions show a stable decoupling trend from their economic development, which means that China is now on the right road for achieving a low-carbon economy. However, the decoupling status by the end of 2016 also indicates that most of the regions are still in the states of expansive coupling or weak decoupling, especially in Northwest (NW), which implies that the speed of decarbonization process is still not high enough. The decomposition results show that in all regions except NW, GDP per capita is the most influential factor leading to increasing carbon emissions, while energy intensity is the largest factor in reducing carbon emissions. In NW, both GDP per capita and energy intensity drive the increase in carbon emissions. The results in this paper could benefit China’s regional policy-making and national strategies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Decomposition; Economic growth; LMDI; Regional; Tapio decoupling","carbon emission; decomposition; economic growth; energy intensity; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; pollution control; regional development; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084677639

This study reviews the recent processes about studies on the effects of SM-FT on the climate system over the ASM region. This review has shown that SM-FT in spring plays a dominant role in seasonal and inter-annual variations of surface diabatic heating over TP, which also have a significant relationship with the ASM activity. Moreover, the anomalies of SM-FT over TP significantly affect summer precipitation in Eastern China (EC). SM-FT in spring over TP would be a robust factor in the ASM system. The possible mechanism associated with the impacts of SM-FT on the summer general circulation in East Asia is also discussed. Under the climate change background, variations in regimes of frozen soil and snow have great potential effects on the climate in East Asia and around the globe. However, great uncertainties in the estimation of diabatic heating over TP (especially over the western TP) during spring still confine our understanding about the effects of TP thermal forcing on the ASM activity. It is suggested that improvement in the simulation of the SM-FT process in models is an effective approach for reducing the biases of climate projection in future. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Yang and Zhang.","Asian summer monsoon; diabatic heating; freeze–thaw process; snow melting; Tibetan Plateau","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Frozen soils; Snow; Soil mechanics; Springs (components); Thawing; Asian summer monsoons; Climate projection; Effective approaches; General circulation; Interannual variation; Possible mechanisms; Potential effects; Summer precipitation; Climate models; annual variation; freeze-thaw cycle; future prospect; ground freezing; monsoon; precipitation assessment; seasonal variation; snow; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086508652

Currently, the actual energy and environmental performances of those Photovoltaic-based Targeted Poverty Alleviation Plants (PV-PAPs) remain to be validated. Based on the field survey data from 23 grid-connected PV-PAPs in 7 provinces of China, with a total installed capacity of 51.39 MW, this study evaluated their energy and environmental benefits by adopting the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Net Energy Analysis (NEA) methods. The following indicators of PV-PAPs were calculated: Energy Payback Time (EPBT), Energy Return on Investment (EROIPE-eq), Greenhouse Gas Emission Rate (GHGe-R) and Carbon Payback Time (CPBT). The results show that: (1) The EPBT of 23 power stations would be 0.79–1.94 years, the EROIPE-eq range from 15.48 to 38.15, the range of GHGe-R would be 43.34–106.78 g/kWh, and the CPBT range from 1.88 to 5.11 years. Even in areas with poor solar radiation, PV-PAPs still have good energy efficiency and environmental benefits. (2) The indirect environmental cost incurred by human factors should be highlighted. It might lead to the change of benefits, such as the GHGe-R, which might fluctuate from 0 to 51.44 g/kWh for the power plants with similar technical specifications. (3) Compared with traditional coal-fired electricity generation (EG), the PV EG could reduce carbon emissions by 87.35–94.9%. This study reveals the status and effects of PV-PAPs in China, and provides practical evidence for further large-scale practice of solar PV in China, which could also provide a basis for decision-making of policy makers.

Two of the most important climate-change related factors are increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), and increasing mean global temperature. Although increasing attention is being paid to the biological and ecological effects of ACC, important processes such as interspecific interaction between insect herbivores have been little explored. Here, in a field experiment using the FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) system, we investigated the effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on survival and wing dimorphism of two species of rice planthoppers, Laodelphax striatellus and Nilaparvata lugens under interaction. RESULTS: The two species were grouped into five treatments of relative density (0/50, 13/37, 25/25, and 37/13, 50/0), each of which was allocated to one of a factorial combination of two CO2 concentrations and two temperature treatments (elevated and ambient levels). Our results revealed that climatic treatment has no effects on survivorship of interspecific competing planthoppers. However, climatic treatment affected wing-form of planthoppers under interspecific interaction. For females of N. lugens, in the 37/13 ratio, proportion macropterours form was lower under elevated CO2 + temperature than under the ambient environment or than under elevated temperature. For females of L. striatellus, proportion macropterous form did not differ among climatic treatments at each ratio treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate that climate change-related factors, by affecting the macropetry of interspecific competing planthoppers, may influence planthopper fitness. We provide new information that could assist with forecasting outbreaks of these migratory pests. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","anthropogenic climate change; FACE system; global warming; interspecific interaction; migratory pests; planthoppers","carbon dioxide; climate change; herbivore; interspecific interaction; planthopper; survival; survivorship; wing morphology; Archaeorrhyncha; Delphacidae; Hemiptera; Hexapoda; Laodelphax striatellus; Nilaparvata lugens; carbon dioxide; animal; female; Hemiptera; Oryza; sexual characteristics; temperature; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Hemiptera; Oryza; Sex Characteristics; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078819684

This can be a viable method for reducing CO2 emissions. Given that hydrogen injection into existing natural gas pipeline networks is an economical way to utilise this clean gas, this paper explores its benefits by studying its supply chain optimisation and analysing its reliability. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimise transport and dissatisfaction costs. Material balance, supply and transport of natural gas, operation of pipeline networks, and hydrogen injection are considered as constraints. The operating plans of a regional natural gas supply chain (NGSC), with and without hydrogen injection, are optimised. Then, three types of indicators – economic indices, coal and hydrogen as percentages of total energy consumption, and CO2 emissions – are applied to compare the performance of the NGSC in different situations. A case verifies the proposed model and shows the influence of utilising hydrogen in an NGSC. The optimal operating plans under one standard and two non-standard conditions are calculated, and the reliability of the supply chain is analysed. Results illustrate that injecting hydrogen in the NGSC is beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Hydrogen injection; Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); Natural gas supply chain (NGSC); Operation","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Energy utilization; Fuel injection; Gas supply; Hydrogen fuels; Integer programming; Natural gas pipelines; Operating costs; Supply chains; Gas pipeline networks; Hydrogen injection; Material balance; Mixed integer linear programming model; Pipeline networks; Standard conditions; Supply chain optimisation; Total energy consumption; Reliability analysis; byproduct; coal; energy efficiency; gas pipeline; gas supply; heating; hydrogen; natural gas; optimization; reliability analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083425095

CO2-capture technology is reaching commercial maturity, but it is still necessary to adapt the technology to regional conditions, such as power-plant design and flexible operation in the China context. Slipstream facilities provide valuable field data to support the commercialization of CO2 capture. We have built a slipstream facility at Jiangyou power plant in Sichuan that will allow us to explore China-relevant issues, especially flexible operation, over the next few years. We plan to share our results with the broader CO2-capture and CO2-storage (CCS) community to accelerate the deployment of CCS in China.

However, the negative contribution of these residues in the form of “residue-borne pathogens” is recognized. Here, we aimed to investigate the structure and ecological functions of fungal communities colonizing wheat residues during the early phase of decomposition in a conventional farming system. The experiment was conducted under both ambient conditions and a future climate scenario expected in 50–70 years from now. Using MiSeq Illumina sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), we found that plant pathogenic fungi dominated (~87% of the total sequences) within the wheat residue mycobiome. Destructive wheat fungal pathogens such as Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium tricinctum, and Zymoseptoria tritci were detected under ambient and future climates. Moreover, future climate enhanced the appearance of new plant pathogenic fungi in the plant residues. Our results based on the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunocapture technique demonstrated that almost all detected pathogens are active at the early stage of decomposition under both climate scenarios. In addition, future climate significantly changed both the richness patterns and the community dynamics of the total, plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi in wheat residues as compared with the current ambient climate. We conclude that the return of wheat residues can increase the pathogen load, and therefore have negative consequences for wheat production in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Conventional wisdom is that nanoconfinement effects determine water transport in CNTs. Here, using full-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it is shown that water transport behavior in CNTs strongly correlates with the electronic properties of single-walled CNTs (metallic (met) vs semiconducting (s/c)), which is as dominant as the effect of nanoconfinement. Three pairs of CNTs (i.e., (8,8)met, 10.85 Å vs (9,7)s/c, 10.88 Å; (9,8)s/c, 11.53 Å vs (10,7)met, 11.59 Å; and (9,9)met, 12.20 Å vs (10,8)s/c, 12.23 Å) are used to investigate the roles of diameter and metallicity. Specifically, the (9,8)s/c can restrict the hydrogen-bonding-mediated structuring of water and give the highest reduction in carbon–water interaction energy, providing an extraordinarily high water flux, around 250 times that of the commercial reverse osmosis membranes and approximately fourfold higher than the flux of the state-of-the-art boron nitrate nanotubes. Further, the high performance of (9,8)s/c is also reproducible when embedded in lipid bilayers as synthetic high-water flux porins. Given the increasing availability of high-purity CNTs, these findings provide valuable guides for realizing novel CNT-enhanced nanofluidic systems. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, little is known about how institutional entrepreneurs engage differently in institutional strategies across different dynamic niche contexts. We distinguish between four different niche contexts: market-based niche development, market-based regime transformation, community-based niche development and community-based regime transformation. This typology is then conceptually combined with theory on institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work to examine the diverse agential processes of institutional change through which actors shape and transform their institutional environments. The usefulness of this framework is explored in an analysis of the low-carbon building stock in the Netherlands. The analysis demonstrates that the framework offers a comprehensive approach to examine variety in the arsenal of strategies of institutional work across different contexts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Built environment; Institutional work; Niche innovations; Sustainability transitions; Typology of strategies","conceptual framework; entrepreneur; innovation; institutional framework; strategic approach; sustainability; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082727621

Historical changes in the Athens UHI, spanning 1971-2016, were assessed by contrasting two air temperature records from stable meteorological stations in contrasting urban and rural settings. Subsequently, we used a five-member regional climate model (RCM) sub-ensemble from EURO-CORDEX with a horizontal resolution of 0.11° (~12 x 12 km) to simulate air temperature data, spanning the period 1976-2100, for the two station sites. Three future emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were implanted in the simulations after 2005 covering the period 2006-2100. Two 20-year historical reference periods (1976-1995 and 1996-2015) were selected with contrasting UHI regimes; the second period had a stronger intensity. The daily maximum and minimum air temperature data (Tmax and Tmin) for the two reference periods were perturbed to two future periods, 2046-2065 and 2076-2095, under the three RCPs, by applying the empirical quantile mapping (eqm) bias-adjusting method. This novel approach allows us to assess future temperature developments in Athens under two UHI intensity regimes that are mainly forced by differences in air pollution and heat input. We found that the future frequency of days with Tmax &gt; 37 °C in Athens was only different from rural background values under the intense UHI regime. Thus, the impact of heatwaves on the urban environment of Athens is dependent on UHI intensity. There is a large increase in the future frequency of nights with Tmin &gt; 26 °C in Athens under all UHI regimes and climate scenarios; these events remain comparatively rare at the rural site. This large urban amplification of the frequency of extremely hot nights is likely caused by air pollution. Consequently, local mitigation policies aimed at decreasing urban atmospheric pollution are expected to be highly effective in reducing urban temperatures and extreme heat events in Athens under future climate change scenarios. Such policies directly have multiple benefits, including reduced electricity (energy) needs, improved living quality and strong health advantages (heat-and pollution-related illness/deaths). © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Athens; Climate change; Extremes; Greece; Mitigation; Temperature; Urban heat island","Air pollution; Climate change; Climate models; Atmospheric pollution; Climate change scenarios; Horizontal resolution; Meteorological station; Mitigation policies; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Statistical approach; Temperature development; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; extreme event; heat island; heat wave; regional climate; statistical analysis; temporal variation; trend analysis; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086902072

While the process has been demonstrated to treat wastewater with very high sulfate concentrations resulting from saline water supply, this contribution assesses the potential of sulfide-based denitrification for a broader range of municipal wastewater characteristics. A mass balance-based calculation procedure was presented to determine the optimal recycle ratio and the corresponding effluent nitrogen concentrations in a pre-denitrification system. The calculation procedure was first validated with experimental data from literature and was then applied to various scenarios. The latter showed that legal effluent requirements may be achievable only for specific municipal wastewater streams with a low nitrogen concentration and an elevated sulfate content (&gt;42 g S m−3), e.g. close to the sea, or if a significant amount of biodegradable carbon enters the anoxic reactor to stimulate auxiliary heterotrophic denitrification. A stoichiometric calculation illustrated that even with external carbon addition to supplement the sulfide-based denitrification, the total sludge production and aeration energy could still be reduced compared to a scenario with purely heterotrophic denitrification. Finally, it was shown that a broader range of wastewater types could be treated when applying nitrification-denitrification over nitrite instead of over nitrate, due to the lower sulfide and carbon requirements for the reduction of nitrite. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biological wastewater treatment; Nitrogen removal; Process design; Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081203520

The introduction of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) and Selective Catalytic Reduction for NOx (SCR) systems have decreased the Particle Number (PN) and NOx emissions, respectively, to very low levels. However, there are concerns regarding the emissions released during the periodic DPF regenerations, which are necessary to clean the filters. The absolute emission levels and the frequency of the regenerations determine the contribution of regenerations, but where they happen (city or highway) is also important due to different contributions to human exposure. In this study, we measured regulated and non-regulated emissions of a Euro 6d-temp vehicle both in the laboratory and on the road. PN and NOx emissions were similar in the laboratory and on-the road, ranging around 1010 p/km and 50 mg/km, respectively. Six regeneration events took place during the 1300 km driven, with an average distance between regeneration events of only 200 km. During regeneration events, the laboratory limits for PN and NOx, although not applicable, were exceeded in one of the two measured events. However, the on-road emissions were below the applicable not-to-exceed limits when regenerations occurred. The weighted PN and NOx emissions over the regeneration distance were approximately two times below the applicable limits. The N2O emissions were &lt;14 mg/km and NH3 at instrument background level (&lt;1 ppm), reaching 8 ppm only during regeneration. The results of this study indicate that due to the short interval between regenerations, studies of diesel vehicles should report the emissions during regeneration events. © 2020 by the authors.

Our main focus is Earth’s atmosphere, but we also discuss how these problems might manifest themselves on other planetary bodies, with particular attention to Titan where methane takes on the role of water. Geophysical fluid dynamics has traditionally been concerned with understanding the very basic problems that lie at the foundation of dynamical meteorology and oceanography. Conventionally, and a little ironically, the subject mainly considers ‘dry’ fluids, meaning it does not concern itself overly much with phase changes. The subject is often regarded as dry in another way, because it does not consider problems perceived as relevant to the real world, such as clouds or rainfall, which have typically been the province of complicated numerical models. Those models often rely on parameterizations of unresolved processes, parameterizations that may work very well but that often have a semiempirical basis. The consequent dichotomy between the foundations and the applications prevents progress being made that has both a secure basis in scientific understanding and a relevance to the Earth’s climate, especially where moisture is concerned. The dichotomy also inhibits progress in understanding the climate of other planets, where observations are insufficient to tune the parameterizations that weather and climate models for Earth rely upon, and a more fundamental approach is called for. Here, we discuss four diverse examples of the problems with moisture: the determination of relative humidity and cloudiness; the transport of water vapor and its possible change under global warming; the moist shallow water equations and the Madden–Julian Oscillation; and the hydrology cycle on other planetary bodies. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086111737

By relying on cooperative approaches between different logistics companies, such as sharing and pooling resources for bundling deliveries in the same zone, an increased environmental benefit can be attained. To quantify this benefit we compare the CO2 emissions, fuel consumption and total delivery time resulting from deliveries performed by one cargo truck with two trailers versus by two single-trailer cargo trucks under real conditions in a simulation scenario in the city of Linz in Austria.

Palm oil production has been increasing by 9% every year, mostly due to expanding biofuel markets. However, the oil palm industry has been associated with key environmental issues, such as deforestation, peatland exploitation and biomass burning that release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, leading to climate change. This review therefore aims to discuss the characteristics of oil palm plantations and their impacts, especially CO2 emissions in the Southeast Asian region. The tropical climate and soil in Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, are very suitable for growing oil palm trees. However, due to the scarcity of available plantation areas deforestation occurs, especially in peat swamp areas. Total carbon losses from both biomass and peat due to the conversion of tropical virgin peat swamp forest into oil palm plantations are estimated to be around 427.2 ± 90.7 t C ha-1 and 17.1 ± 3.6 t C ha-1 year-1, respectively. Even though measured CO2 fluxes have shown that overall, oil palm plantation CO2 emissions are about one to two times higher than other major crops, the ability of oil palms to absorb CO2 (a net of 64 tons of CO2 per hectare each year) and produce around 18 tons of oxygen per hectare per year is one of the main advantages of this crop. Since the oil palm industry plays a crucial role in the socio-economic development of Southeast Asian countries, sustainable and environmentally friendly practices would provide economic benefits while minimizing environmental impacts. A comprehensive review of all existing oil plantation procedures is needed to ensure that this high yielding crop has highly competitive environmental benefits. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission; CO2; Flux; Palm oil; Tropical area","biomass; carbon flux; climate change; crop yield; deforestation; economic conditions; environmental issue; swamp forest; Southeast Asia; Elaeis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086927626

In the city of Santiago, Chile, extreme weather that can be associated with a nascent manifestation of climate change has caused high-turbidity events, repeatedly forcing the main water company to interrupt the supply of drinking water, aecting millions of people. This study proposes a transformative response to reduce harm from extreme events due to climate change. The traditional approach of increasing resilience through large infrastructure works can be complemented by one-o reductions in water use during emergencies, in exchange for economic compensation. This alternative seeks to transfer the individual responsibility of water companies to a collective one, where the community is an active agent that reduces damage in the face of extreme events resulting from climate change. In the assessment of this response, we used a choice experiment to estimate the minimum amount users are willing to accept in compensation for water service interruptions. The results show that willingness to accept compensation is significant (close to 0.6 USD/hour) and decreases when users have experienced additional unplanned interruptions. The aggregate cost of the compensation is lower than infrastructure investments required to avoid service interruptions under various future hypothetical hydroclimatic scenarios associated with climate change impacts. Therefore, compensation-based instruments for water service interruptions could be a more flexible and cost-eective alternative to infrastructure-based measures to cope with future climate hazards. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Choice experiment; Climate change; Safe-to-fail; Unplanned water interruptions; Willingness to accept compensation","Costs; Hazards; Investments; Potable water; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Economic compensation; Infrastructure investment; Service interruption; Traditional approaches; Urban water supply; Willingness to accept; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; compensation system; drinking water; experimental study; extreme event; infrastructure; investment; turbidity; urban area; water supply; water use; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087446374

The reactor concept is based on the chemical looping technology where an oxygen carrier (metal oxide) is used to transport O2 from air to the fuel for different redox reactions. Unlike the conventional chemical looping, Gas Switching Technology inherently avoids external circulation of the oxygen carrier by alternating the oxidizing and reducing gases in a single bubbling fluidized bed reactor. This greatly simplifies reactor design leading to easier scale-up of the technology in comparison with the conventional chemical looping. The first experimental demonstration of the GSWS concept was completed at atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging between 700 °C and 900 °C with iron-based oxygen carrier supported on alumina (~35 wt% Fe2O3 on Al2O3). Approximately 99% H2 purity was achieved at ~80% oxygen utilization. Significant fuel slippage was observed especially beyond 33% degree of reduction with some carbon deposition. The deposited carbon was able to combust/gasify completely in the subsequent air stage which makes the concept robust in sustaining oxygen carrier life. However, the gas mixing between the GSWS stages reduced the H2 purity, CO2 purity, and CO2 capture efficiency. To minimize the negative impact of gas mixing, Cu doped Mg(Fe0.9Al0.1)2O4 spinel with 74 wt% active content was developed specifically for the second experimental demonstration. Despite the high stability and reactivity under redox conditions with TGA, this oxygen carrier did not perform optimally in 5 cm ID fluidized bed reactor because of excessive agglomeration at degree of reduction beyond 34%. In general, a range of the active content between 35 and 70 wt% of the oxygen carrier was desired for optimal performance of the GSWS concept. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon capture; cGHG; Chemical looping; Climate change; Fluidization; Gas switching; Hydrogen production; Iron; Natural gas; Oxygen carrier; Production; Splitting; Water; Watersplitting; Zero-emission","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized beds; Gas industry; Gases; Hematite; Metals; Mixing; Redox reactions; Supersaturation; Bubbling fluidized bed reactor; Degree of reduction; Experimental demonstrations; External circulation; Fluidized bed reactors; Optimal performance; Pressure and temperature; Switching technology; Hydrogen production; aluminum oxide; copper oxide; iron oxide; magnesium carbonate; organic matter; Article; atmospheric pressure; biotechnological procedures; climate change; combustion; crystallization; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental impact; fluidization; Gas Switching Water Splitting technology; hydrogen production; oxidation; oxidation reduction state; oxygen consumption; particle size; purification; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; thermodynamics; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084937029

Under average meteorological conditions, the island is water-sufficient (969 mm precipitation; theoretical water potential 3284 hm3; and total water use 610 hm3). Agriculture is by far the greatest user of water (78% of total water use), followed by domestic use (21%). Despite the high average water availability, water scarcity events commonly occur, particularly in the eastern-south part of the island, driven by local climatic conditions and seasonal or geographical mismatches between water availability and demand. Other critical issues in water management include the over-exploitation of groundwater, accounting for 93% of the water used in agriculture; low water use efficiencies in the farms; limited use of non-conventional water sources (effluent reuse); lack of modern frameworks of control and monitoring; and inadequate cooperation among stakeholders. These deficiencies impact adversely water use efficiency, deteriorate quality of water resources, increase competition for water and water pricing, and impair agriculture and environment. Moreover, the water-limited areas may display low adaptation potential to climate variability and face increased risks for the human-managed and natural ecosystems. The development of appropriate water governance frameworks that promote the development of integrated water management plans and allow concurrently flexibility to account for local differentiations in social-economic favors is urgently needed to achieve efficient water management and to improve the adaptation to the changing climatic conditions. Specific corrective actions may include use of alternative water sources (e.g., treated effluent and brackish water), implementation of efficient water use practices, re-formation of pricing policy, efficient control and monitoring, and investment in research and innovation to support the above actions. It is necessary to strengthen the links across stakeholders (e.g., farmers, enterprises, corporations, institutes, universities, agencies, and public authorities), along with an effective and updated governance framework to address the critical issues in water management, facilitate knowledge transfer, and promote the efficient use of non-conventional water resources. © 2020 by the authors.","Circular economy; Climate variability; Sustainability; Water resources management; Water reuse; Water scarcity","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Groundwater; Knowledge management; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water quality; Water treatment; Alternative water sources; Control and monitoring; Integrated water management; Meteorological condition; Non-conventional water resources; South Mediterranean Sea; Sustainable management; Water availability and demand; Effluents; effluent; governance approach; innovation; stakeholder; sustainable development; terrain; water availability; water management; water resource; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece; Mediterranean Sea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086722997

All of these sites have meta-data information containing the type of station such as urban, rural or industrial according to the location of the corresponding station or the characteristic specialty of the surrounding region. The classification of these stations under certain categories is an important process because if the type of station is known, the institutions that provide environmental auditing will transfer the resources appropriate to these regions and adequate control will be provided about the air quality for them. For this purpose, it was aimed in this study to determine to which class to be assigned when a new station is to be set up by taking into account the past pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors.

Changes in surges have exhibited different oscillatory components from the intermonthly (∼3–6-months) to the interannual scales (∼1.5-years, ∼2–4-years, ∼5–8-years) with mean explained variances of ∼40% and ∼25% of the total variability respectively. The correlation between the multiresolution components of surges and 28 exceptional stormy events with different intensities has revealed that energetic events are manifested at all timescales while moderate events are limited to short scales. By considering the two hypotheses of (1) the physical mechanisms of the atmospheric circulation change according to the timescales and (2) their connection with the local variability improves the prediction of the extremes, the multiscale components of the monthly extreme surges have been investigated using four different climate oscillations (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea-Level Pressure (SLP), Zonal Wind (ZW), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)); results show statistically significant correlations with ∼3–6-months, ∼1.5-years, ∼2–4-years, and ∼5–8-years, respectively. Such physical links, from global to local scales, have been considered to model the multiscale monthly extreme surges using a time-dependent Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The incorporation of the climate information in the GEV parameters has considerably improved the fitting of the different timescales of surges with an explained variance higher than 30%. This improvement exhibits their nonlinear relationship with the large-scale atmospheric circulation. © 2020","Climate oscillations; Extreme surges; Multiresolution analysis; Multiscale variability; Sea level; Storms","air-sea interaction; annual variation; climate oscillation; extreme event; general circulation model; image resolution; sea level change; storm surge; English Channel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080047094

We utilize a model that captures three different environmental regulations: (1) emissions tax, (2) emissions permit-trading, and (3) command-and-control. Our results show that if the variable emissions tax, permit price or emissions penalty is nonzero, the firm should always invest in green technology emissions reductions. In general, we observe an all-or-nothing trend regarding end-of-pipe abatement investment. In particular, the firm invests in best available end-of-pipe abatement technology (BACT-EOP) when the variable emissions tax, permit price or emission penalty is greater than the per unit cost of end-of-pipe abatement. Moreover, we show that investments in end-of-pipe abatement can enhance investments in green technology, but that investments in end-of-pipe abatement should be pursued secondarily. Furthermore, we find that while the facility size, and consequently the local and global transportation emissions, are not impacted by an emissions tax regulation, facility size is impacted by an emissions permit trading or command-and-control emissions regulation. With regards to emissions, frequently there is a direct trade-off between local vs. global transportation and production emissions. To illustrate, we show that regulations that yield the lowest local production emissions, i.e. emissions from a single facility, do not always yield the lowest global production, and local and global transportation emissions. In fact, the conditions that yield the lowest local transportation emissions yield the largest global transportation emissions, and vice versa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions abatement; Environmental regulations; Facility location; OR in environment and climate change","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Investments; Supply chains; Taxation; Abatement investment; Abatement technologies; Command and control; Emissions abatements; Emissions reduction; Emissions regulations; Facility locations; Single facilities; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076577186

This integration of agriculture and forestry is frequently seen as an option that can secure food security and co-deliver a range of environmental benefits. However, quantitative studies simultaneously integrating multiple aspects of agroforestry are rare. Focusing on four sustainability goals, namely adaptation to climate change, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and rural development, this study investigated co-benefits and adverse side-effects of shaded agroforests above cocoa, coffee, oil palm, banana and citrus plantations in tropical humid West Africa. Time series of remote sensing land cover datasets were used to quantify and map recent land cover transitions in the region, and a field study in 25 agroforestry plots in Togo provided biomass carbon measurements in over 3000 trees, in addition to local farmers interviews. Estimates of theoretical agroforestry expansion and associated carbon sequestration potential in the region were compared to regional emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. We found that about 1.6 Mha of losses in evergreen forests occurred between 1992 and 2015 (corresponding to 17% of the forest area originally present in 1992), while agricultural areas increased by 2.4 Mha (+5% relative to 1992). On average, trees in the studied agroforestry plots store 83.7 ± 7.0 t C/ha. We found synergies between rural development and adaptation benefits, no clear relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage, and a trade-off between high carbon stocks and crop yields. This trade-off can be minimized with an optimal management of agroforestry by using a mix of tree species that store medium carbon stocks and can enhance yields, soil fertility and climate resilience. In general, plant functional diversity, i.e. a balanced mix of shade trees, fruit trees, palms and bananas, emerged as a key feature of successful agroforestry systems. Besides, agroforestry trees co-products are reported as an additional, diversified source of income for local farmers. A large-scale deployment of agroforestry over seven countries in West Africa can sequester up to 135 Mt CO2/year over two decades, corresponding to about 166% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation in the region. Overall, agroforestry practices in tropical humid West Africa offer multiple-win solutions that are relevant to address major local and global environmental challenges. Increasing cooperation among local farmer communities, national authorities, and international organizations are instrumental to overcome the barriers for a future expansion of agroforestry systems in the region. © 2020 The Authors","Agroforestry; Climate change mitigation; Co-benefits; Sustainable agriculture; West Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078985414

These can cause large-scale vegetation damage, and are therefore among key drivers of declines in biomass and productivity (or “browning”) observed across Arctic regions in recent years. Extreme events which cause browning are driven by multiple interacting climatic variables, and are defined by their ecological impact – most commonly plant mortality. Quantifying the climatic causes of these multivariate, ecologically defined events is challenging, and so existing work has typically determined the climatic causes of browning events on a case-by-case basis in a descriptive, unsystematic manner. While this has allowed development of important qualitative understanding of the mechanisms underlying extreme event driven browning, it cannot definitively link browning to specific climatic variables, or predict how changes in these variables will influence browning severity. It is therefore not yet possible to determine how extreme events will influence ecosystem responses to climate change across Arctic regions. To address this, novel, process-based climate metrics that can be used to quantify the conditions and interactions that drive the ecological responses defining common extreme events were developed using publicly available snow depth and air temperature data (two of the main climate variables implicated in browning). These process-based metrics explained up to 63% of variation in plot-level Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at sites within areas affected by extreme events across boreal and sub-Arctic Norway. This demonstrates potential to use simple metrics to assess the contribution of extreme events to changes in Arctic biomass and productivity at regional scales. In addition, scaling up these metrics across the Norwegian Arctic region resulted in significant correlations with remotely-sensed NDVI, and provided much-needed insights into how climatic variables interact to determine the severity of browning across Arctic regions. © 2020","Arctic; Browning; Climate change; Climate metrics; Ericoid shrubs; Extreme events; Heathland; NDVI; Sub-Arctic; Winter","Digital storage; Ecology; Productivity; Vegetation; Climate variables; Climatic variables; Ecological impacts; Ecological response; Ecosystem response; Normalised difference vegetation index; Rapid climate change; Vegetation damage; Climate change; arctic environment; assessment method; biological production; biomass; climate effect; ecosystem response; extreme event; NDVI; remote sensing; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083326330

The health and wellbeing sector must respond to these growing pressures in order to continue to provide safe, quality care. Adaptation and mitigation policies need to be developed at different scales, including at a regional government level. Numerous challenges exist; for example, the necessity for collaboration between multiple agencies across scales, the tailoring of policies to the health issues specific to regions, and constraints on existing regional and local resources and adaptive capacities, to name a few. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach used to develop a regional scale climate adaptation plan with the health sector. Starting from a scientific understanding of climate change impact on the health sector in Queensland, Australia, the approach used an innovative engagement strategy to a) better understand awareness of relevant stakeholders about current and future climate change impact on the health of the population and on service provision, b) identify on-ground barriers to effective adaptation faced by the sector stakeholders, c) identify opportunities and benefits which would arise from adaptation, and d) identify what conditions or support stakeholders required to overcome those barriers, take advantage of opportunities, and achieve benefits from adaptation. Analysis of these findings guided the development of specific policy directions for the sector. We found direct engagement between various key stakeholders such as health service providers (e.g. hospitals), critical infrastructure providers, academics, local government authorities, and sub-sectors such as aged care and early childhood care facilities, was a critical element of translating scientific evidence of climate change impacts on human health into a regional adaptation policy for the health and wellbeing sector. The resulting policy, grounded in the reality and experience of health and wellbeing sector stakeholders, reflects their insights and concerns, and served to develop a level of sectoral ‘ownership’ (not ‘top-down’ imposition) which will be important for its successful ongoing development and implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Health and wellbeing; Policy; Public health","article; awareness; childhood; climate change; government; human; infant; language; public health; Queensland; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081658721

However, the effects of chitosan with different molecular weights on rumen fermentation, methane production and bacterial community structure are not yet clear. A basal diet without chitosan served as the control (CTL), and the treatment diets were supplemented with chitosan with different molecular weights: 1 000 (1K), 3 000 (3K), 5 000 (5K), 50 000 (5W) and 200 000 (20W) dry matter (DM). Six fermentation units per treatment were established. Gas chromatography was used to measure the concentrations of methane, H2 and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq platform and analysed to reveal the relative abundances of bacterial community taxa. The results showed that the propionate proportion was significantly increased by the addition of chitosan with different molecular weights (P&lt;0.05), while methane production and the acetate proportion were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05). The relative abundances of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 were significantly increased in the 3K chitosan group compared with the CTL group, whereas the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05). Correlation analyses of the relative abundances of the bacterial genera showed that Prevotella was positively related to propionate production (P&lt;0.05).

However, the effects of Fe(III) inputs and of simultaneous increases of saltwater and Fe(III) on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and porewater geochemistry of estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands have not yet been studied. This study applied monthly in-situ experimental manipulations of saltwater and Fe(III) additions within a tidal freshwater wetland (the Min River estuary, southeast China) dominated by Sagittaria trifolia, over two years. We examined changes in porewater geochemistry (i.e., SO4 2–, Cl–, NH4 +, and NO3 –), ecosystem GHG (i.e., CH4, CO2, and N2O) fluxes, and soil denitrification rates. Short-term saltwater intrusions did not cause a large increase in soil salinity but did decrease CH4 fluxes. Fe(III) additions also greatly decreased CH4 fluxes, however, the combined addition of saltwater and Fe(III) did not have a synergistic effect on the reduction of CH4 emissions. Further, CO2 emissions did not significantly change in response to either the individual or the combined saltwater and Fe(III) additions. Most interestingly, we found that the combined addition of saltwater and Fe(III) led to an increase in N2O fluxes of an order of magnitude compared to the control. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models, our findings suggest that short-term pulses of both individual saltwater and the combination of saltwater and Fe(III) caused by storm tides and soil erosion following a typhoon or hurricane event could reduce the CO2-equivalent flux from subtropical estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands, although the effects may be temporary. © 2020","CO2-equivalent flux; Denitrification; Ferric iron; Freshwater tidal wetland; Greenhouse gas flux; Saltwater intrusion; Subtropical estuary","Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Estuaries; Geochemistry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hurricane effects; Salt water intrusion; Soils; Tropics; Water; Wetlands; Denitrification rate; Ferric iron; Freshwater tidal wetlands; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas fluxes; Sub-tropical estuary; Tidal freshwater wetland; Iron compounds; biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; cation; denitrification; estuarine environment; flux measurement; freshwater ecosystem; greenhouse gas; iron; porewater; saline intrusion; subtropical region; Sagittaria trifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082036182

Here, we develop and apply an integrated GI assessment approach to simulate the individual effects of GI along with their combined impact on pollutant concentration reduction under eight GI scenarios. These include current for year 2015 (2015-Base); business-as-usual for year 2039 (2039-BAU); three alternative future scenarios with maximum possible coniferous (2039-Max-Con), deciduous (2039-Max-Dec) trees, and grassland (2039-Max-Grl) over the available land; and another three alternative future scenarios by considering coniferous (2039-NR-Con), deciduous (2039-NR-Dec) trees, and grassland (2039-NR-Grl) around traffic lanes. A typical UK town, Guildford, is chosen as study area where we estimated current and future traffic emissions (NOx, PM10 and PM2.5), annual deposited amount and pollutants concentration reductions and percentage shared by dispersion and deposition effect in concentration reduction under above scenarios. The annual pollutant deposition was found to vary from 0.27–2.77 t·yr−1·km−2 for NOx, 0.46–1.03 t·yr−1·km−2 for PM10 and 0.08–0.23 t·yr−1·km−2 for PM2.5, depending on the percentage share of GI type and traffic emissions. The 2039-Max-Dec showed the aerodynamic effect of GI can reduce the annual pollutant concentration levels up to ~10% in NOx, ~1% in PM10 and ~0.8% in PM2.5. Furthermore, the total reductions can be achieved, via GI's coupled effects of surface deposition and aerodynamic dispersion, up to ~35% in NOx, ~21% in PM10 and ~8% in PM2.5 with ~75% GI cover in modelled domain under 2015-Base scenario. Coniferous trees (2039-Max-Con) were found to promote enhanced turbulence flow and offer more surface for deposition. Moreover, planting coniferous trees near traffic lanes (2039-NR-Con) was found to be a more effective solution to reduce annual pollutant concentration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerodynamic dispersion; Air pollution mitigation; Deposition velocity; iSCAPE project; Traffic emission; Urban air quality","Aerodynamics; Air; Air quality; Deposition; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Aerodynamic dispersions; Deposition velocities; iSCAPE project; Pollution mitigation; Traffic emissions; Urban air quality; Atmospheric movements; aerodynamics; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dispersion; mitigation; particulate matter; traffic emission; urban area; air pollutant; air quality; article; grassland; velocity; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; forecasting; particulate matter; tree; England; Guildford; Surrey [England]; United Kingdom; Coniferales; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Particulate Matter; Trees; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082402234

They are present in all plain and montane biomes, forming natural and secondary (anthropogenic) communities, and occupy forestless spaces in the bounds of both the forest and steppe zones. In the forest zones, they are predominantly anthropogenic, locating in sites naturally occupied by forests (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea grasslands are specifically extensive and diverse here). Conversely, in the steppe zone, they are natural (Festuco-Brometea grasslands prevail). The total area of temperate grasslands is 920,000 km2, of which 680,000 km2 are used as pastures and 240,000 km2 as hay meadows), and they are widely spread in all natural zones of Russia, especially within the forest zone (250,000 km2) and steppe zone (500,000 km2 including steppes in mountain areas). The main distinctive features of their spread are small contour; diffusiveness; a strong anthropogenic transformation (of the steppe); and proneness to fires, desertification, etc. Biogeographically, the regions are so different that zonal-provincial variants can be identified. Grasslands are both zonal (steppes) and intrazonal (floodplain meadows). They are mainly composed of graminoids and forbs in different proportions, the composition and production of which change annually (fluctuations) and in perennial autogenous cycles (for example, ""a year of grasses"" or ""a year of legumes""). A spatially extensive and diverse group comprises post-forest or post-agrarian watershed meadows, representing perennial stages of a progressive succession, which follow the pioneer stages. Their conservation (economically and sustainably optimal maintenance) depends on man, who has included them in the cycle of agrarian use as hay fields or pastures and, less often, uses for recreation and for conserving historical landscapes. A similar picture is observed for shrublands, which form both zonal (at watersheds) and intrazonal complexes with herbaceous vegetation. The most stable and spatially extensive shrublands are represented by two types. The first type are arctic and alpine thickets formed by Siberian dwarf pines (Pinus pumila), dwarf birches (Betula rotundifolia, B. fruticosa and others), and Alnus alnobetula subsp. fruticosa. The second type are steppe shrub thickets dominated by many species of genera such as Caragana, Spiraea, Chamaecytisus and Prunus. Shrublands on floodplains or clearing and burn sites are relatively quickly replaced with other kinds of vegetation during succession. The first inventory of grasslands in Russia was performed back in 1932-1938 by the outstanding vegetation scientist Leonty Ramensky (1884-1953), who was the first in the world to create so-called ecological scales (ecological indicator values), which, using data on the contribution of plant species in a community's composition, make it possible to assess habitat parameters (humidity, soil wealth, salinity, etc.). According to a recent phytosociological overview, the diversity of temperate grasslands and shrublands of Russia's plains comprises 18 classes, 35 orders, and 92 alliances for grassland communities and 4 classes, 5 orders, and 8 alliances for steppe shrublands. We highlight distinctive features of meadow and steppe ecology as well as the contribution of these habitats to the conservation of biodiversity, global climate regulation, and the formation of various ecosystem services, including use as hayfields, pastures, recreation and historical sites. Grassland and shrubland conservation and restoration in Russia are associated with the prospects to create a network of protected areas and with the restoration of steppe and meadow animal husbandry. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Its severity is increasing due to the climate change caused by weather fluctuations. Intensive research on FHB control methods has been initiated more than a decade ago. Since then, the environment has been rapidly changing at regional to global scales due to increasing anthropogenic emissions enhanced fertilizer application and substantial changes in land use. It is known that environmental factors affect both the pathogen virulence as well as plant resistance mechanisms. Changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and water availability can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on pathogen spread depending on the environmental optima of the pathosystem. Hence, there is a need for studies of plant–pathogen interactions in current and future environmental context. Long-term monitoring data are needed in order to understand the complex nature of plants and its microbiome interactions. We suggest an holobiotic approach, integrating plant phyllosphere microbiome research on the ecological background. This will enable the development of efficient strategies based on ecological know-how to fight Fusarium pathogens and maintain sustainable agricultural systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Indeed, urban waterways provide green and blue spaces, which have increasingly been associated with health benefits. The present observational study used a unique 17-year longitudinal natural experiment of canal regeneration from complete closure and dereliction in North Glasgow in Scotland, U.K. to explore the impact of green and blue canal assets on all-cause mortality as a widely used indicator of general health and health inequalities. Official data on deaths and socioeconomic deprivation for small areas (data zones) for the period 2001–2017 were analysed. Distances between data zone population-weighted centroids to the canal were calculated to create three 500 m distance buffers. Spatiotemporal associations between proximity to the canal and mortality were estimated using linear mixed models, unadjusted and adjusted for small-area measures of deprivation. The results showed an overall decrease in mortality over time (β = −0.032, 95% confidence interval (CI) [−0.046, −0.017]) with a closing of the gap in mortality between less and more affluent areas. The annual rate of decrease in mortality rates was largest in the 0–500 m buffer zone closest to the canal (−3.12%, 95% CI [−4.50, −1.73]), with smaller decreases found in buffer zones further removed from the canal (500–1000 m: −3.01%, 95% CI [−6.52, 0.62]), and 1000–1500 m: −1.23%, 95% CI [−5.01, 2.71]). A similar pattern of results was found following adjustment for deprivation. The findings support the notion that regeneration of disused blue and green assets and climate adaptions can have a positive impact on health and health inequalities. Future studies are now needed using larger samples of individual-level data, including environmental, socioeconomic, and health variables to ascertain which specific elements of regeneration are the most effective in promoting health and health equity. © 2020 by the authors.

To detect and characterise bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), a novel real-time bioaerosol sensor, Spectral Intensity Bioaerosol Sensor (SIBS) was employed at a WWTP and a background site. The SIBS records a range of data (size, shape, and fluorescence emission across 16 wavelength bands from 298 to 735 nm for two excitation wavelengths (285 nm and 370 nm)) on single particles in real time. Additionally, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of wastewater samples obtained by a spectrofluorometer was compared with SIBS spectra from WWTP. The results showed that the average number concentrations of total particles (NT) and fluorescence particles (NF) were both higher at the WWTP (NT = 2.01 cm−3, NF = 1.13 cm−3) than the background site (NT = 1.79 cm−3, NF = 1.01 cm−3). The temporal variation of NF and NT was highly variable at the WWTP and the concentration peaks were consistent with on-site activities. Moreover, the time-resolved number-size distribution of fluorescent particles revealed the predominance of fine scale particles (&lt;1 μm) and the time-series channel by channel number concentrations demonstrated the temporal variability of dominant bio-fluorophores. Furthermore, the overall and size-segregated fluorescence spectra at two sites were multimodal. In particular, the fluorescence intensity increases with increasing particle size in WWTP spectra, which is not present in the background spectra. In addition, the highly resolved SIBS fluorescence spectra were broadly similar to EEM of wastewater. These findings confirmed that the spectrally resolved fluorescence detected by SIBS is capable of providing reliable bio-fluorophores information of bioaerosol emissions generated from wastewater, thus holding the potential for better characterisation of bioaerosols in real time. © 2020 The Authors","Bioaerosols; Fluorescence spectra; Real-time monitoring; Spectral Intensity Bioaerosol Sensor; Wastewater treatment plant","Aerosols; Fluorescence; Fluorophores; Particle size; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Signal detection; Water treatment plants; Bioaerosols; Excitation emission matrices; Excitation wavelength; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence spectra; Number size distribution; Real time monitoring; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; aerosol formation; carbon emission; concentration (composition); detection method; pollutant removal; size distribution; wastewater treatment; Article; bioaerosol emission; concentration (parameter); controlled study; particle size; priority journal; spectrofluorometry; United Kingdom; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water pollution; aerosol; environmental monitoring; fluorescence; human; waste water; Aerosols; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorescence; Humans; Particle Size; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080973597

Consensus vegetation refugia – areas retaining suitable climates under both wetter and drier future projections – represent only 14.6% of California's natural vegetation.

This development is ongoing in many urban regions, and it is often part of land use strategies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from transport. However, whether this strategy is efficient has not been investigated much. The study contributes empirical research on two Norwegian regions, where net differences in total CO2 emissions between two scenarios were analysed. In Scenario 1, wholesale warehouses have remained in their central location, and new dwellings and workplaces have been developed in relevant peripheral areas. In Scenario 2, centrally located warehouses have relocated to peripheral areas, and they have been replaced by dwellings and workplaces. The main finding is that relocating warehouses away from central and semi-central urban areas, to make land available for dwellings and workplaces, results in reduced net transport-related CO2 emissions. The effects are stronger when the warehouses were originally more centrally located and the alternative locations of dwellings and workplaces are more peripheral. If warehouse relocations cause detours, the effects are somewhat reduced. © 2020 The Authors","CO2 emissions; Freight facilities; Land use strategies; Net effects; Urban developments","carbon emission; freight transport; land use planning; relocation; storage structure; urban development; urban transport; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082414684

The extent of producers’ control over production processes is approximated by the inverse (function) of the average distance of producers from primary inputs providers along the entire input demand chain. Similarly, the extent of producers’ influence over advertising and sales is approximated by the inverse (function) of the average distance of producers from final users along the output supply chain. Our empirical application of the shared responsibility approaches focuses on CO2 emissions, using the 2005 world IO table available from WIOD. In the empirical tests of aggregation (in)variance of country-level shared responsibilities, it is found that the shared responsibilities are more robust to aggregation when the sharing parameters are pegged to distance rather than to value added or final demand. All in all, our results further substantiate the robustness of the shared responsibility accounting principle, and this is important if the principle is to become standard or alternative (complementary) reporting practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Distance-based shared responsibility; Full responsibility; Multiregional input-output analysis; Shared responsibility; Upstream and downstream responsibilities","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Average Distance; Distance-based; Empirical test; Full responsibility; Input output analysis; Production process; Shared responsibility; Upstream and downstream responsibilities; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079686164

Its economy was dominated by Chemical Valley, the city's petrochemical industry. Chemical Valley firms and executives were civically active, donating to public causes, dominating the local chamber of commerce, and working closely with provincial and municipal officials to ensure a friendly business environment. They also maintained a monopoly on information about local air pollution levels and were not required by government to adhere to clean air regulations. However, like the rest of the chemical industry at the time, Chemical Valley was exposed to an onslaught of negative publicity, raising the threat of regulation and loss of their control over emissions data and production processes. This article illustrates how economic elites in Sarnia prevented the problematization and regulation of air pollution. In doing so, it describes the actors in the policy system and examines its recourse to suppress dissent when activists sought to raise the air pollution issue. © The Author 2020.

Case studies from countries of priority biodiversity (Panama, Peru, India, Republic of Congo and Indonesia) broaden the evidence. Globally IPs and local communities conserve nearly 2 billion hectares of land for diverse reasons (sacred, critical resource areas, water). Much of their contributory effort goes unrecognized and disrespected, even though IPLCs invest significant time and money in forest and land conservation—concentrated in low and middle-income countries of priority biodiversity with spending gaps. While more of these countries endorse IPLC conservation, the rights still remain limited in many countries. Across much of the world, IPLCs have become ‘cornered’ by PA boundaries that overlap their lands while PA policies and neighboring commercial concessions further separate them from land and livelihoods and justify killings and evictions, and livelihood and identity loss. Though IUCN PA governance types embrace IPLC management, the reality is a preponderance of State-owned-and-managed PAs. This does not help meet conservation targets. Globally endorsed principles for grievance and reconciliation exist but have not been applied; meanwhile IPLCs invest heavily in conservation with limited support from governments and donors who play a predominant role in setting global biodiversity targets. © 2020 The Authors","Community Conservation; Conservation finance; Human Rights; Indigenous Peoples; Rights-based Conservation","biodiversity; cost-benefit analysis; econometrics; environmental economics; human rights; indigenous population; local government; United Nations; Ips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080029939

Little is known about the abrasion process that generates and emits particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) or those less than 10 μm (PM10). Both PM2.5 and PM10 are regulated by the US-Environmental Protection Agency as health hazards. We used a laboratory wind tunnel to study the abrasion induced emissions of 15 aggregated soils from across the U.S. We subjected aggregated soils in trays as well as sets of aggregates placed on the wind tunnel floor to abrader sand (0.29 to 0.42 mm diameter) blown at 13 m s−1. PM2.5 and PM10 emissions were found to vary by soil type. Sandy soils had the poorest aggregation as well as lowest primary fine particulate contents and were found to have the greatest abrasion coefficients (AC) and highest emission of PM2.5 and PM10 under abrasion. By contrast, soils higher in clay had lower AC and emissions under abrasion. In addition, five of the soils tested had long-term histories of both conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) management for paired comparisons of emission based on CT and NT managements. CT management tended to show higher AC values and greater abrasion emissions compared to NT management for the same soil, although only three of five management pairs were significant. Dry aggregate stability parameters were found to have an exponential relationship to AC with break force being a better AC predictor (R2 = 0.936) than dry stability (R2 = 0.894). We also developed equations that predict PM2.5 emissions as a fraction of PM10 emissions for aggregated soils (R2 = 0.932) and individual aggregates alone (R2 = 0.854). This research contributes to the understanding and prediction of PM2.5 and PM10 emission through the abrasion process. © 2020","Conventional tillage; Dust emission; No-till; PM2.5/PM10 ratio; Wind tunnel","Abrasion; Aggregates; Agriculture; Air quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Erosion; Health hazards; Soil quality; Wind tunnels; Aerodynamic diameters; Aggregate stability; Agricultural soils; Conventional tillage; Dust emission; No-till; PM2.5/PM10 ratio; US Environmental Protection Agency; Particulate emissions; abrasion; aggregate stability; aggregation; agricultural soil; clay soil; dust; emission; particulate matter; wind erosion; zero tillage; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079898416

In this work, we analyze publicly available information for 458 power plant development projects in 15 representative countries across the BRI regions from eight years prior to BRI (January 2005), to 6 years after BRI (June 2019) in which Chinese engineering contracting companies played a significant role. The data indicate that coal, gas, and solar photovoltaics (PV) activities increased to different degrees after BRI was introduced. We find that 75% of the new generation capacity after October 2013 has gone to fossil fuels, while the rest has gone to hydroelectricity (14%), solar PV (6%), wind (3%), and others (2%). Those numbers have important carbon emissions implications. Based on current trends, the total BRI-associated power development in the 15 countries could generate 37 (range 26–48) gigatonnes (Gt) of committed carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by the end of 2030, corresponding to 4–11% of the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5-degree climate goal. Extrapolation of these results to all BRI countries gives an estimate of 56 (range 40–72) Gt CO2 for cumulative BRI-related committed emissions by 2030, corresponding to 7% to 17% of the remaining 1.5-degree carbon budget. If the projected growth of fossil fuel power generation in BRI slows down prior to 2030, there are commensurate reductions in emissions implications. To provide context for these numbers, we define a “greenness ratio,” which can be used to measure the level of environmental sustainability of BRI in the power sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Belt and Road Initiative; Carbon budget; Committed carbon dioxide emissions; Electric power sector; Engineering contracting company; Projection scenario","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuel power plants; Roads and streets; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electric power development; Energy infrastructures; Environmental sustainability; Large-scale development; New generation capacity; Power plant development; Solar photovoltaics; Fossil fuels; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electrical power; emission control; Africa; Asia; China; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082923417

Over recent decades, land use and land cover changes have threatened the protection of the unique natural, scenic, and historic resources in this region. In this study, we applied a fragmentation model and a set of landscape metrics together with the satellite-derived USDA Cropland Data Layer to examine the shrinkage and fragmentation of grassland in the Bluegrass Region, Kentucky during 2008-2018. Our results showed that recent land use change across the Bluegrass Region is characterized by grassland decline, cropland expansion, forest spread, and suburban sprawl. The grassland area decreased by 14.4%, with an interior (or intact) grassland shrinkage of 5%, during the study period. Land conversion from grassland to other land cover types has been widespread, with major grassland shrinkage occurring in the west and northeast of the Outer Bluegrass Region and relatively minor grassland conversion in the Inner Bluegrass Region. The number of patches increased from 108,338 to 126,874. The effective mesh size, which represents the degree of landscape fragmentation in a system, decreased from 6629.84 to 1816.58 for the entire Bluegrass Region. This study is the first attempt to quantify recent grassland shrinkage and fragmentation in the Bluegrass Region. Therefore, we call for more intensive monitoring and further conservation efforts to preserve the ecosystem services provided by the Bluegrass Region, which has both local and regional implications for climate mitigation, carbon sequestration, diversity conservation, and culture protection. © 2020 by the authors.","Cropland expansion; Fragmentation; Grassland shrinkage; Kentucky; Urban sprawl","Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Carbon sequestration; Climate mitigations; Ecosystem services; Fragmentation models; Land use and land cover change; Land-cover types; Landscape fragmentation; Landscape metrics; Shrinkage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086444321

Many carbon accounting practices in use today provide only regionally aggregated estimates and neglect the spatial variation of pre-disturbance forest conditions and post-disturbance land cover dynamics. Here, we present a spatially explicit carbon bookkeeping model that utilizes a high-resolution map of aboveground biomass and land cover dynamics derived from time series analysis of Landsat data. The model produces estimates of carbon emissions/uptake with model uncertainty at Landsat resolution. In a case study of the Colombian Amazon, an area of 47 million ha, the model estimated total emissions of 3.97 ± 0.71 Tg C yr− 1 and uptake by regenerating forests of 1.11 ± 0.23 Tg C yr− 1 2001–2015, with an additional 45.1 ± 7.99 Tg of carbon remaining in the form of woody products, decomposing slash and charcoal at the end of 2015 (estimates provided with ±95% confidence intervals). Total emissions attributed to the study period (including carbon not yet released) is 6.97 ± 1.24 Tg C yr− 1. The presented model is based on recent technological advancements in the field of remote sensing to achieve spatially explicit modeling of carbon emissions and uptake associated with land surface changes and post-disturbance landscapes that is compliant with international reporting criteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bookkeeping; Carbon; Emission; Landsat; REDD+; Time series","Carbon; Charcoal; Harmonic analysis; Neutron emission; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Above ground biomass; Bookkeeping; International reporting; LANDSAT; REDD; Spatially explicit modeling; Spatiotemporal tracking; Technological advancement; Time series analysis; carbon; charcoal; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; data set; land cover; Landsat; numerical model; reforestation; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis; vegetation dynamics; Article; biomass; calibration; carbon footprint; dynamics; forest; growth curve; land use; landscape; priority journal; woody plant; Amazon River; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080140142

As a result, quantitative means of measuring forest resource carrying capacity are greatly needed, with a view to identifying problem areas and their causes and formulating effective response strategies. This paper puts forward a framework and methodology for constructing a forest resource carrying capacity index (FRCCI). To do this, we first calculate a forest ecological security index (FESI), using an evaluation index system. Ideal FESI values are then simulated by introducing a forest ecological location coefficient (FELC), and the FRCCI is obtained as the difference between the ideal FESI and the FESI. The study considers the 1086 counties that compose the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China, using forest and socioeconomic data for 2015. The resulting FRCCI values indicate that the forests of Yunnan province are generally in a state of “no overload,” while Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces occupied a state of “critical overload” and Anhui and Jiangsu provinces experienced “general overload.” The spatial pattern of the FRCCI in the study region presented significant centralization, with high FRCCI values mainly clustered in areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and low FRCCI values mainly clustered in areas in the midstream and downstream reaches of the River. The study identifies 416 counties identified as forest carrying capacity problem areas (38.31% of the study area); these areas were mainly concentrated in Shanghai and Anhui province. We argue that a number of measures would be helpful in improving FRCCI values, including promoting the forest state index by strengthening reforestation as well as afforestation, reducing the external pressure on forests by means of energy saving and emission reduction strategies, and formulating comprehensive policy measures to promote the carrying capacity of forests in the whole study area and in the problem areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Ecological location coefficient; Forest ecological security index; Forest resource carrying capacity; Spatial correlation analysis; The Yangtze River Economic Belt","carrying capacity; centralization; emission control; energy planning; forest resource; reforestation; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; Anhui; China; Jiangsu; Jiangxi; Shanghai; Sichuan; Yangtze River; Yunnan; Zhejiang; China; environmental protection; forest; human; river; urbanization; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Humans; Rivers; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083368250

This fact has been largely ignored in most of the low-carbon development related literature. Using an augmented Chinese input–output table in which information about firm size (large- and small and medium-sized firms) and ownership (state-, foreign-, and private-owned firms) are explicitly reported, a dynamic computable general equilibrium model is developed in this study to analyze the impact of alternative low-carbon policy designs with different regulatory coverage and financial equalization on heterogeneous firms. Our simulation results show that, with the fully balanced regulation coverage and equalized financial system for heterogeneous firms, the total green investment accounts for 4% of GDP in 2030 for fulfilling China's commitment to reduce carbon emissions, which is the lowest among the various scenarios; about one-third of this investment is made by small and private firms; at the same time, green investment efficiency will be the highest, about 84% higher than that of the business-as-usual level. Therefore, a market-oriented and new technology-driven arrangement and mechanism for sharing emission reduction burden and allocating green investment across heterogeneous firms, especially to small and medium-sized firms, is crucial for China to achieve a more ambitious emission target in the long run. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Chinese economy; CO2 emissions; ETS; Firm heterogeneity; Green finance; Low-carbon; Small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088140398

Here, we design two kinds of Co-adsorbed monolayer WS2 frameworks, i.e. Co1/WS2 and Co2/WS2, and comprehensively explore the dependences of their magnetic properties on injected charge by using first-principles calculations. The value of magnetic moment can be tuned almost linearly through injecting charge due to the modulated interaction and charge transferring between Co atom and monolayer WS2. A transition from ferromagnetism to non-ferromagnetism occurs in Co1/WS2 system when 1 e/unit cell charge is injected. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy can be manipulated by injecting charge as well. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) in Co1/WS2 system sharply increases from-4.16 to 2.47 (0.99) meV when injected charge vary from 0.0 to 0.2 (-0.2) e/unit cell, meaning a transition of the magnetic easy axis from in-plane to out-of-plane direction. Similarly, in Co2/WS2 system, the magnetic easy axis also can be modified to out-of-plane direction through injecting 0.1 e/unit cell charge. It is found that the changes of Co-3d states are responsible for the tunable magnetic anisotropy.

In order to support smart government in decision making, information systems have been developed to monitor and predict CO2 emissions. Most of the existing studies investigate CO2 emission amounts, identify influencing factors of CO2 emission and discuss potential suggestions to mitigate CO2 emission for different industries. They often focus on CO2 emission research of industries in a region or country, while the integration of carbon flow in the neighboring regions is not well studied. Therefore, this paper proposes a system dynamics model to explore an optimal carbon emission reduction path of a regional industry by integrating regional differences, i.e., industrial comparative advantages, technology advantages and the inter-regional context between the neighboring regions. In the case study, we use a key industry in a typical industrial region of Western China, the cement industry in Chongqing, as a scenario to simulate the CO2 emission, possible energy demand and cement production of the cement industry in this region for recent years. Simulation results show that by leveraging the regional differences, especially the collaboration of the industrial chain and production capacity among regions, the cement industry in Chongqing can achieve the low-carbon target. In addition, through the analysis and discussions about the features of our model and Chongqing's cement industry, it reflects that our model using regional differences is applicable to industries with a common demand market at the regional level such as energy, chemical and steel industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Low-carbon development; Regional industry; Scenarios analysis; System dynamics","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Chemical analysis; Decision making; Emission control; Steelmaking; System theory; Carbon emission reductions; CO2 emissions; Comparative advantage; Low energy consumption; Low-carbon development; Scenarios analysis; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079418988

Hydrogen metallurgy has numerous applications, such as H2 reduction ironmaking in Japan, ULCORED and hydrogen-based steelmaking in Europe; hydrogen flash ironmaking technology in the US; HYBRIT in the Nordics; Midrex H2™ by Midrex Technologies, Inc. (United States); H2FUTURE by Voestalpine (Austria); and SAL-COS by Salzgitter AG (Germany). Hydrogen-rich blast furnaces (BFs) with COG injection are common in China. Running BFs have been industrially tested by AnSteel, XuSteel, and BenSteel. In a currently under construction pilot plant of a coal gasification-gas-based shaft furnace with an annual output of 10000 t direct reduction iron (DRI), a reducing gas composed of 57vol% H2 and 38vol% CO is prepared via the Ende method. The life cycle of the coal gasification—gas-based shaft furnace—electric furnace short process (30wt% DRI + 70wt% scrap) is assessed with 1 t of molten steel as a functional unit. This plant has a total energy consumption per ton of steel of 263.67 kg standard coal and a CO2 emission per ton of steel of 829.89 kg, which are superior to those of a traditional BF converter process. Considering domestic materials and fuels, hydrogen production and storage, and hydrogen reduction characteristics, we believe that a hydrogen-rich shaft furnace will be suitable in China.

Most of the research regarding OM turnover in salt marshes in times of global change focuses on effects of rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise, while effects of land-use change have gained little attention. The present work investigates the mechanisms by which livestock grazing can affect OM decomposition in salt marsh soils. In a grazing exclusion experiment at the mouth of the Yangtze estuary, China, we assessed soil microbial exo-enzyme activity (EEA) to gain insight into the microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) demand. Additionally, we studied the decomposition of plant litter in soil using the Tea Bag Index (TBI), a widely used standardized litter bag assay to fingerprint soil decomposition dynamics. Based on EEAs, grazing markedly reduced microbial C acquisition, whereas microbial N acquisition was strongly increased. These opposing grazing effects were also evident in the decomposition of standardized plant litter: The decomposition rate constant (k) and the stabilization (S) of litter were not inversely related, as would be expected, but instead both were reduced by livestock grazing. Our data suggest that gazing effects on EEAs and litter decomposition can just partly be explained by grazing-driven soil compaction and resulting lower oxygen availability, which has previously been hypothesized as a main pathway by which grazing can reduce microbial activity in wetland soils. Instead, grazing effects on microbial nutrient demand occurs to be an at least equally important control on soil decomposition processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Blue carbon; Carbon sequestration; Enzyme stoichiometry; Land-use change; Livestock; Tea Bag Index","Climate change; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Land use; Rate constants; Sea level; Soil mechanics; Wetlands; Accelerated sea-level rise; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Decomposition rate constants; Land-use change; Livestock; Soil microbial activities; Yangtze estuary , China; Soils; carbon; nitrogen; organic matter; oxygen; carbon sequestration; enzyme activity; land use change; litter; livestock; microbial community; numerical model; saltmarsh; soil microorganism; stoichiometry; Article; assay; biomass; China; controlled study; enzyme activity; grazing; litter decomposition; livestock; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; plant litter; priority journal; salt marsh; soil; soil analysis; soil bulk density; soil microflora; Tea Bag Index; microbiology; wetland; China; Yangtze Estuary; Carbon; China; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081019375

However, there will be a long way for the large-scale application of CDM in China, for thermal power is still in the dominant position, while renewable power is far from being competitive. In this study, a mix integer bi-level hierarchical programming model (MIBLHP) is developed to investigate the potential impact of the CDM application on the regional energy-water-carbon nexus optimization in electric power system in China. The model integrates the advantages of bi-level programming and mix integer liner programming in dealing with conflicting objectives with hierarchical and sequential decision making process and help to achieve the optimized strategies with the highest overall system satisfaction degree. Results show that CDM will play an important role in the regional energy-water-carbon nexus optimization, the MIBLHP is able to stabilize the increasing trend of system cost and make better tradeoffs between the economic and environmental goals. Optimal strategies including power generation and capacity expansion path, system cost control, CO2 emissions abatement strategies, water consumption and waste water discharge are presented. The system would reach the supreme satisfaction degrees (λ = 0.934) when the CO2 reduction level is 40%, which means that every part of the system has achieved the best condition.

All the European (E) and National (N) roads in Norway and Sweden were included, while assuming different degrees of electrification in terms of the fraction of the road length with an ERS, prioritizing roads with high-traffic loads. The results show that implementing an ERS already for 25% of the E- and N-road lengths could result in electrification of 70% of the traffic on these roads, as well as 35% of the total vehicle kilometers in Norway and Sweden. The ERS will then connect some of the larger cities with ERS. Installation of ERS on all the E- and N-roads in the two countries would cover more than 60% of the CO2 emissions from all heavy traffic assuming all vehicles run on electricity. For roads with an average daily traffic of &gt;6800 and &gt;1200 vehicles per day, the costs of infrastructure investment are ∼0.03 €2016 per vkm and ∼0.15 €2016 per vkm, respectively.

Recently, increasing interest in the pyrazoline derivatives family of compounds was noticed. In this paper, we report on the constitutional isomerism influence on photophysical properties of low molecular, push-pull type of pyrazole-based organic chromophores. Particularly, we show the ability of optical properties tailoring by changing the substitution of phenyl ring extended by effective electron-accepting moiety in ortho and para positions. Such a structural change in molecule results in a shift of photoluminescence spectra as well as the activation or deactivation of gain mechanism for multimode laser emission. In order to confirm ground state molecular structures for both isomers we performed time-dependent DFT calculations in a solvent environment. In addition, structural analysis of spontaneously grown single crystals was carried out using X-ray spectroscopy. The above-mentioned studies allowed us to define the isomer's molecular geometries and charge distribution in excited and ground states and to distinguish the significant differences in crystallographic structures. Combined experimental and theoretical research have resulted in a hypothesis of the molecular mechanism standing behind observed differences in optical properties of both isomers. Importantly, such an approach can be useful for materials engineering, allowing us to predict the features of novel materials for optoelectronics and photonics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical activation; Chromophores; Ground state; Isomers; Optoelectronic devices; Photoluminescence; Plants (botany); Stereochemistry; Structural properties; X ray spectroscopy; Constitutional isomerism; Crystallographic structure; Materials engineering; Molecular geometries; Organic chromophores; Photoluminescence spectrum; Photophysical properties; Pyrazoline derivative; Optical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086874822

Nationally, 72% of samples with radon-222 (222Rn) concentrations > 4000 pCi/L had 210Pb ≥ 1.0 pCi/L. 210Pb is mobilized by alpha recoil associated with the decay of 222Rn and short-lived progeny. 210Pb concentrations ≥ 1.0 pCi/L occurred most frequently where acidic groundwaters inhibited 210Pb readsorption (felsic-crystalline rocks) and where reducing alkaline conditions favored dissolution of iron-manganese- (Fe-Mn-) oxyhydroxides (which adsorb 210Pb) and formation of lead-carbonate complexes (enhancing lead (Pb) mobility). 210Po concentrations ≥ 0.7 pCi/L occurred almost exclusively in confined Coastal Plain aquifers where old (low percent-modern carbon-14) groundwaters were reducing, with high pH (>7.5) and high sodium/chloride (Na/Cl) ratios resulting from cation exchange.

An analytical review found that the ability of green roofs to retain rainfall varies from 20 to 99.5% depending on climatic conditions (duration and intensity of rains, duration of dry periods, solar radiation, temperature and humidity, wind conditions), the properties of green roof layers (moisture capacity of the substrate and a drainage layer, the substrate thickness), the type of vegetation, the geometry of a green roof (slope and orientation).

High deposition of acid compounds distorted soil chemistry and had negative effects on forest physiology and growth. Since 1994, continuous data on atmospheric deposition and stream runoff fluxes have provided evidence of ecosystem recovery from acidification. In this study, we combined for the first time mass budget data (sulfur deposition and total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export) from the GEOMON monitoring network of headwater catchments with annual trajectories of vegetation indices derived from Landsat remote sensing observations. Time series of selected vegetation indices was constructed from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 using Google Earth Engine. Linear regression between the field data and vegetation indices was analyzed using R software. Biogeochemical responses of the forested catchment to declining acid deposition (driven by SO2 emission reduction) were consistent across all catchments covering various forest stands from different regions of the Czech Republic. Significant correlations were found with total sulfur depositions, suggesting that the forests are continuously and consistently prospering from reductions in acid deposition. Disturbance index (DI) was the only vegetation index that was well-related to changes in forest cover associated with salvage loggings (due to the forest decline) during the 1980s and 1990s. A significant relationship (R2 = 0.82) was found between the change in DI and DIN export in stream water. Regrowth of young forests in these highly affected areas tracks the most pronounced changes in total DIN export, suggesting a prominent role of vegetation in nitrogen retention. With the Landsat-derived DI, we could map decennial changes in forest disturbances beyond the small scale of the catchments to the regional level (demonstrated here for two protected landscape areas). This analysis showed the peak in forest disturbances to have occurred around the mid-1990s, followed by forest recovery and regrowth. Despite the improvement in forest ecosystem functioning over the past three decades in mountainous areas, emerging threats connected to changing climate will shape forest development in the near future. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogeochemistry; Disturbance index; Forest disturbance; GEOMON; Landsat; Time series","Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Budget control; Catchments; Coal industry; Data streams; Deposition; Ecosystems; Emission control; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Recovery; Remote sensing; Runoff; Vegetation; Atmospheric depositions; Biogeochemical response; Central European forests; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Ecosystem recoveries; Forested catchments; Headwater catchment; Protected landscape area; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086987797

Rather than a static assignment of average emission rates to each unit area of the urban domain, the fossil fuel emissions we use are dynamic: they vary in time and space in relation to data that describe or approximate the activity within a sector, such as traffic density, power demand, 2m temperature (as proxy for heating demand), and sunlight and wind speed (as proxies for renewable energy supply). Through inverse modelling, we optimize the relationships between these activity data and the resulting emissions of all species within the dynamic fossil fuel emission model, based on atmospheric mole fraction observations. The advantage of this novel approach is that the optimized parameters (emission factors and emission ratios, N D 44) in this dynamic emission model (a) vary much less over space and time, (b) allow for a physical interpretation of mean and uncertainty, and (c) have better defined uncertainties and covariance structure. This makes them more suited to extrapolate, optimize, and interpret than the gridded emissions themselves. The merits of this approach are investigated using a pseudo-observation-based ensemble Kalman filter inversion set-up for the Dutch Rijnmond area at 1km-1km resolution. We find that the fossil fuel emission model approximates the gridded emissions well (annual mean differences < 2 %, hourly temporal r2 D 0:21-0.95), while reported errors in the underlying parameters allow a full covariance structure to be created readily. Propagating this error structure into atmospheric mole fractions shows a strong dominance of a few large sectors and a few dominant uncertainties, most notably the emission ratios of the various gases considered. If the prior emission ratios are either sufficiently well-known or well constrained from a dense observation network, we find that including observations of co-emitted species improves our ability to estimate emissions per sector relative to using CO2 mole fractions only. Nevertheless, the total CO2 emissions can be well constrained with CO2 as the only tracer in the inversion. Because some sectors are sampled only sparsely over a day, we find that propagating solutions from day-to-day leads to largest uncertainty reduction and smallest CO2 residuals over the 14 consecutive days considered. Although we can technically estimate the temporal distribution of some emission categories like shipping separate from their total magnitude, the controlling parameters are difficult to distinguish. Overall, we conclude that our new system looks promising for application in verification studies, provided that reliable urban atmospheric transport fields and reasonable a priori emission ratios for CO2 and its co-emitted species can be produced. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

The investigation of social vulnerability is a prerequisite for formulating a mitigation plan to environmental hazards. This research applies a GIS-based approach with the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to investigate and quantify the social vulnerability to environmental hazards in Yilan County, Taiwan. In order to construct the SoVI, the literature review was conducted, and 12 variables were selected. Through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the 12 variables were reduced into four principal components. In order to explore the spatial pattern of SoVI, the spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied. The result showed that there were 26.5% of communities in Yilan County with a high level of SoVI, and most of these communities were mainly located in mountain areas. The unfavorable topography features cause the distributions in mountain areas. On the other hand, there were 37.3% communities with a related low level of SoVI, and these communities were located in plain areas. The inaccessibility caused by topography creates an incapability, resource-lacking environment and lead to a high value of SoVI. In addition, this research applied Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to validate SoVI, and the result of the R2 value was 0.769. Also, the standardized residuals showed no spatial autocorrelation, meaning the SoVI had the adequate explanatory ability.

The level of PM2.5 concentrations in Abuja is very high and above the statutory limits; however, the high levels of pollution in Lugbe do not seem to be consistent with local emission sources. This study analyzed the chemical composition of PM2.5 to perform source identification and contributions in Lugbe, Abuja, Nigeria. Sampling in 2016 provided 246 PM2.5 samples at 2 sites across all the four months of sampling. The highest ambient PM2.5 concentration (142 μg m− 3) was recorded in winter while the lowest (84 μg m− 3) was observed in summer. Chemical mass closure suggested that dust (40.5%) contributed most of the PM2.5 mass. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and six sources were identified. They include mineral dust, crustal dust, vehicle exhaust, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, and industrial sources. Crustal dust, vehicle exhaust, and secondary sulfate were the major sources of ambient PM2.5 in Lugbe, contributing 33.3, 29.8, and 18.0%, respectively. The results of 120-h backward trajectories showed that external northeastern region was more dominant in January, while during the remaining three months, southwesterly winds prevailed. The results of bivariate polar plots for most of the factors showed the influence of the southern areas of Lugbe. The study found that there was long-range regional transport of PM2.5 into Lugbe area throughout the four months. Risk assessments revealed that ingestion route was the major exposure pathway for both children and adults. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk levels were below the acceptable threshold limits. Finally, the results of this study have shown that ambient air quality in Lugbe can be substantially improved by reducing the emissions from crustal dust, vehicle exhaust, and secondary sulfate sources in the external southern regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Abuja; Health risks; Heavy metals; PMF; Regional long-range transport; Source apportionment","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Dust; Factorization; Health risks; Heavy metals; Sulfur compounds; Vehicles; Abuja; Chemical characterization; Chemical compositions; Chemical mass closure; Industrial development; Long range transport; Positive matrix factorization models; Source apportionment; Risk assessment; aerosol composition; air quality; carcinogen; chemical analysis; concentration (composition); health risk; heavy metal; long range transport; particulate matter; source apportionment; temporal variation; Abuja [Nigeria]; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077755927

Due to vehicular pollution and industries, the exposure to toxic particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) is alarmingly high in major cities. Silver birch trees are good in absorbing the PM in the air. The characteristics of silver birch trees are briefed in this paper. The present study analyses the air quality standards and compares it with various pollutant parameters and health inferences. The PM values are also analysed globally and nationally. In this paper, we have analysed and then suggested to monitor and minimize air pollution parameter especially particulate matter by planting silver birch trees in urban cities. Reducing emissions of particulate matter not only has an instant effect on air quality, but also moderates climate change. By controlling the environmental pollution, the cities are devoid of health issues and other harmful effects. Further by using the technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, the measured sensor values are suggested to store in cloud storage and communicated to the authorities. Hence, it will be monitored continuously and helps to save the environment. © 2019, The National Academy of Sciences, India.","Air pollution; IoT; Particulate matter; Pollution monitoring; Silver birch trees; Smart city",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086044013

Which is based on the principle of Erhai Lake water ecological environment protection and follows the principle of ecological priority, sanitary water into the lake, double control of total amount and consumption, and water conservation and emission reduction. The results show that agriculture irrigated area of Erhai Basin should be gradually reduced to 472000 mu, and 48200 mu of wetland ecological pool should be increased, which is used as the collection area of basin landscape and irrigation return water. After adjusting the crop planting pattern according to the depth of water saving in Erhai irrigation area, the goal of controlling the agricultural water consumption to be no more than 201 million cubic metre and the total water consumption to be less than 366 million cubic metre should be achieved. The effect of reclaimed water irrigation on water saving and emission reduction is considerable. The application of reclaimed water irrigation can reduce the amount of clean water used in paddy growth period by 46.4%, and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied by 30.2%. The replacement rate of garlic reclaimed water can reach 100%. After the comprehensive allocation of water resources, it can supply 501 million cubic metre of ecological water in the river channels and 359 million cubic metre of water out of the river channels. Through the comprehensive utilization project of farmland drainage water and the construction of ecological regulation and storage belt, all irrigation drainage water should be reused and zero discharge can be realized. TN and TP emissions in irrigated area will be reduced by 39.3% and 46.3% respectively. Compared with the current situation, Erhai Lake water inflow and cleanly water inflow increased by 65 million cubic metre and 134 million cubic metre respectively. The annual average water level of the lake will be 0.15m higher than the current situation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Catchments; Emission control; Irrigation; Lakes; Nitrogen fertilizers; Reclamation; Water conservation; Water levels; Water management; Agricultural water; Comprehensive utilizations; Current situation; Ecological environment protections; Emission reduction; MIKE BASIN Simulation models; Water resource systems; Water resources allocations; Drainage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087833672

Energy renovation provides huge energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential and though policies and measures exist to promote large scale energy renovation, there are still many barriers and the pace of energy renovation is still very slow, especially in new EU member states and former Soviet Union members. These countries have inherited old, energy inefficient residential buildings from their Soviet past, and their inhabitants are locked in energy poverty because of their inability to renovate their apartments. This paper analyzed the current situation in the selected country and presents the results of a case study on willingness to pay (WTP) for energy renovation in Lithuanian residential buildings. The survey of 104 Lithuanian households living in unrenovated multi-flat buildings was conducted. The 39 multiple choice questions were asked in order to define the main barriers and drivers of energy renovation. The main results of this pilot study indicated that there are several important organizational and economic barriers for energy renovation in multi-flat buildings and current policies and support schemes have not addressed them in a proper way. The high heating bills and low heat comfort in apartments were the main drivers of energy renovation decision-making for households, however, inadequate state support, reluctance to take a loan due to low income, and inability to make collective decisions on renovation due to the lack of cooperation and housing association were the main barriers that prevented them from this step. New innovative schemes like the Energy Service Companies ESCO model with consolidated billing can be applied to address the identified barriers. © 2020 by the authors.","Barriers; Energy; Multi-flat buildings; Renovation; State polices; Willingness to pay","Apartment houses; Decision making; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Collective decision; Energy service company; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Housing association; Multi-apartment buildings; Multiple choice questions; Policies and measures; Residential building; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085918831

We developed a framework and taxonomy to identify climate-change refugia potential in the North American boreal region, summarizing current knowledge regarding mechanisms, geographic distribution, and landscape indicators. While “terrain-mediated” refugia will mostly be limited to coastal and mountain regions, the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in “ecosystem-protected” refugia. A notable example is boreal peatlands, which can retain high surface soil moisture and water tables even in the face of drought. Refugia from wildfire are also especially important in the boreal region, which is characterized by active disturbance regimes. Our framework will help identify areas of high refugia potential, and inform ecosystem management and conservation planning in light of climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

In the years preceding the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, a flurry of non-state and state actors signed on to various declarations and commitments to reduce deforestation as one globally significant climate mitigation solution. This paper focuses on the Rio Branco Declaration (RBD) and the 30 first-order subnational jurisdictions located in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru that signed it between 2014 and 2018, committing to reduce deforestation 80% by 2020, conditional upon adequate support from the international community. We assess each study jurisdiction’s progress toward that commitment in terms of reducing deforestation, and examine a subset of the potential factors supporting or slowing progress, including the existence of commensurate targets within jurisdictions’ legal frameworks and the international financial support pledged to jurisdictions. We found that progress toward achieving the target was slow and likely unattainable in most jurisdictions outside of Brazil. Among the four jurisdictions likely to achieve the target under current deforestation trajectories, only Mato Grosso State has a target within its legal framework that is more ambitious than the RBD target. We found that the international response to the RBD was sluggish and likely inadequate – with only one financial pledge made in direct response to the declaration and the majority of funding to support jurisdictional efforts coming from one source. We did not find a clear relationship between international finance pledged and progress toward the RBD deforestation target; however, more often, jurisdictions that received pledges earlier have made more progress. We explore what may explain individual jurisdictions’ performance with respect to the target, including specific jurisdictional circumstances, national context, and international support. We estimate that, if current deforestation trajectories continue, the RBD signatories in our study could contribute approximately 3.7% (0.65 GtCO2e) of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction needed to keep global warming at 1.5°C, compared with a potential 5.7% (0.98 GtCO2e) if they were to all meet the RBD target. © Copyright © 2020 Stickler, David, Chan, Ardila and Bezerra.","climate change; deforestation; environmental governance; jurisdictional approach; performance targets; tropics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087888495

A building-resolving urban climate model as a tool for urban planning can contribute to prepare to these issues. However, currently available urban climate models do not correspond to the level of expertise of the various stakeholders in planning practice and their respective computing infrastructures. The German research program Urban Climate Under Change [UC]2 aims at the development, validation and application of a high-resolution and user-friendly urban climate model (PALM-4U) for entire cities. UseUClim, one of four joint research projects, reviews PALM-'s user-friendliness and practicality by applying the living lab approach. Living labs are platforms that gather all relevant stakeholders and, hereby, support a systematic user-science interaction. Both stakeholders from urban planning practice and model developers provide crucial input to the successful co-development of a scientifically-based and practicable urban climate model. Consequently, it is important that both contribute on an equal footing. To ensure this equality, UseUClim acts as a neutral intermediary between the two.

Using the checklist of the vascular plant species, areas of endemism, phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism were identified and climate change velocity was estimated. A database was compiled to identify current climate preferences and multivariate analyses were used to identify the most significant variables. The relationship between climate velocity, endemism and phylogenetic diversity was determined by regression analyses. Results indicate that the most significant areas of endemism and phylogenetic endemism were in the northwest and the southernmost zones of the Chihuahuan Desert associated with mountains. These areas should be considered important in conservation planning. Velocity of climate change was low in these areas, however low velocity of change was more evident in areas of phylogenetic endemism than in areas of phylogenetic diversity.

This may either be through individual actions, such as reducing car travel, or through reducing working time, income and aggregate consumption (‘downshifting’). However, the environmental benefits of both strategies may be less than anticipated. First, people may save money that they can spend on other goods and services that require energy to provide (rebounds). Second, people may feel they have ‘done her bit’ for the environment and can spend time and money on more energy-intensive goods and activities (spillovers). Third, people may save time that they can spend on other activities that require energy to participate in (time-use rebounds). This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on rebounds and spillovers from sufficiency actions, and on time-use rebounds from downshifting. It concludes that: first, rebound effects can erode a significant proportion of the anticipated energy and emission savings from sufficiency actions; second, that such actions appear to have a very limited influence on aggregate energy use and emissions; and third, that downshifting should reduce energy use and emissions, but by proportionately less than the reduction in working hours and income. © 2020 The Authors","Downshifting; Energy sufficiency; Moral licensing; Negative spillovers; Rebound effects; Time-use rebound effects",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078790107

As demonstrated by the results, carbon emissions per capita in China bears a clustering effect significantly according to the Moran's I statistics. Furthemore, the estimates of spatial Durbin model with spatial fixed effects indicate that the level of economic growth and export value tend to cause carbon emissions to increase within a specific region, but mitigate it in the adjacent regions. However, the level of inward foreign investment leads to an opposite result, indicating that local governments ought to make the most of the spatial spillover effects in economic growth from adjacent regions, and development of complementary industries with high efficiency & low carbon emission. Meanwhile, local governments are supposed to be proactive in guiding the inward foreign investment into high & new technology-intensive industries, making the market accessible to foreign investment and putting in place the ""Negative List System"" in the field of clean energy. © 2020 International Journal of Environmental Science and Development.

In South Korea, information on energy sources (electricity, gas, district heating, etc.) is provided, but detailed energy use information, such as space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water (DHW) and lighting, is insufficient to establish a specific action plan for energy savings. Energy use information by end-use can be acquired through actual measurements in close proximity to actual energy use. This information reflects the effects of complex elements such as building operations and residential characteristics, but it is also insufficient. This study presents statistical data on energy use intensities (EUIs) and greenhouse-gas-emission intensities by end-use, derived by measured data collected from 48 sample office buildings in representative city from May 2017 to April 2018, and compares those with the U.S. commercial building energy consumption survey (CBECS) 2012 report. The average site EUIs by end-use were in the following order: space heating > electric appliances (typical floors) > space cooling > lighting > air movement > DHW > vertical transportation > city water supply. With regard to the average primary EUIs by end-use, the magnitude relationship between electric appliances (typical floors) and space heating was opposite that of the average site EUIs. Vertical transportation and DHW exhibited almost the same average greenhouse-gas-emission intensities as those of the average annual primary EUIs.

The effects of two iron-based additives (iron ore and iron oxide) on the pyrolysis characteristics of MSW were first investigated by using TGA, and the kinetic results illustrated that the average activation energy of MSW pyrolysis was 180.32 kJ/mol. By adding iron ore and iron oxide, the activation energy decreased to 151.76 and 150.18 kJ/mol, respectively. Then, the product yield and product composition of MSW were analyzed by a fixed-bed reactor, GC-MS and GC. The fixed-bed reactor experiments of MSW pyrolysis indicated that the iron ore and iron oxide acted as catalysts to change the yield and composition of pyrolysis gas and tar, thereby promoting thermal cracking of MSW and showing a high conversion rate for MSW pyrolysis (55.81 and 55.05%). The GC-MS and GC analyses demonstrated that the two additives could significantly reduce the heteroatomic compounds of pyrolysis tar and increase H2, CO and CO2 production. Furthermore, the reduction of iron ore and the catalytic mechanism were analyzed by H2-TPR, XPS and BET. The H2-TPR results showed that compared with the peak of iron oxide, the characteristic peaks of iron ore shifted to a high temperature due to being suppressed by minerals in the iron ore. XPS suggested that the MSW volatiles led to an increase in the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 and a decrease in the binding energy of O 1s during the reduction of iron ore. BET analysis indicated that the high activity of the catalyst might be attributed to its high surface area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Iron-based additives; Municipal solid waste; Pyrolysis","Activation energy; Additives; Binding energy; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic cracking; Chemical reactors; Iron ores; Iron oxides; Municipal solid waste; Pyrolysis; Tar; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Catalytic mechanisms; Characteristic peaks; Heteroatomic compounds; Iron-based; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Product composition; Product distributions; Pyrolysis characteristics; Iron ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080134588

In addition, it explores the influence mechanism on urban ecological efficiency and further investigates the differential influence based on heterogeneous resource dependence and urban scale. The results show that: (1) China's low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy has significantly improved urban ecological efficiency, as confirmed through a series of robustness tests. (2) In terms of action mechanisms, the LCCP policy in 2012 improved urban ecological efficiency only through the technological innovation path and not through industrial structure advancement or energy utilization efficiency; there is room to expand the scope and enhance the effectiveness of the LCCP policy. (3) Regarding urban heterogeneity, resource-based cities are constrained by the dilemma of resource dependence and the construction of low-carbon cities has a weak effect on improving ecological efficiency. Similarly, the economic agglomeration effect of megacities can further strengthen the role of low-carbon city construction in improving ecological efficiency, while the effect is weak in small and medium-sized cities. This study's conclusions reliably evaluate the results of the current low-carbon city construction and suggest a feasible path for further implementation of the related policy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Difference-in-difference; Ecological efficiency; Low-carbon city","Carbon; Ecology; Energy utilization; Environmental management; China; Difference-in-differences; Ecological efficiency; Ecological environments; Energy utilization efficiency; Heterogeneous resources; Low-carbon cities; Technological innovation; Energy efficiency; carbon; carbon emission; emission control; empirical analysis; experimental study; innovation; panel data; urban area; urban ecosystem; analytical parameters; Article; China; data analysis; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental policy; feasibility study; industrial area; low carbon city construction; low carbon city pilot policy; program effectiveness; quasi experimental study; reliability; technology; urban area; urban ecological efficiency; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080087595

Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM, hereafter Hg0) is the predominant form in both anthropogenic and natural emissions. Evaluation of the efficacy of reductions in emissions set by the UN's Minamata Convention (UN-MC) is critically dependent on the knowledge of the dynamics of the global Hg cycle. Of these dynamics including e.g. red-ox reactions, methylation-demethylation and dry-wet deposition, poorly constrained atmosphere–surface Hg0 fluxes especially limit predictability of the timescales of its global biogeochemical cycle. This review focuses on Hg0 flux field observational studies, namely the theory, applications, strengths, and limitations of the various experimental methodologies applied to gauge the exchange flux and decipher active sub-processes. We present an in-depth review, a comprehensive literature synthesis, and methodological and instrumentation advances for terrestrial and marine Hg0 flux studies in recent years. In particular, we outline the theory of a wide range of measurement techniques and detail the operational protocols. Today, the most frequently used measurement techniques to determine the net Hg0 flux (&gt;95% of the published flux data) are dynamic flux chambers for small-scale and micrometeorological approaches for large-scale measurements. Furthermore, top-down approaches based on Hg0 concentration measurements have been applied as tools to better constrain Hg emissions as an independent way to e.g. challenge emission inventories. This review is an up-dated, thoroughly revised edition of Sommar et al. 2013 (DOI: 10.1080/10643389.2012.671733). To the tabulation of &gt;100 cited flux studies 1988–2009 given in the former publication, we have here listed corresponding studies published during the last decade with a few exceptions (2008–2019). During that decade, Hg stable isotope ratios of samples involved in atmosphere-terrestrial interaction is at hand and provide in combination with concentration and/or flux measurements novel constraints to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the bi-directional Hg0 flux. Recent efforts in the development of relaxed eddy accumulation and eddy covariance Hg0 flux methods bear the potential to facilitate long-term, ecosystem-scale flux measurements to reduce the prevailing large uncertainties in Hg0 flux estimates. Standardization of methods for Hg0 flux measurements is crucial to investigate how land-use change and how climate warming impact ecosystem-specific Hg0 sink-source characteristics and to validate frequently applied model parameterizations describing the regional and global scale Hg cycle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bi-directional flux; Elemental mercury; Gas exchange; Global cycling","Alkylation; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Land use; Bi-directional; Concentration Measurement; Elemental mercury; Experimental methodology; Gas exchange; Gaseous elemental mercury; Global cycling; Relaxed Eddy accumulation; Uncertainty analysis; gaseous elemental mercury; mercury derivative; unclassified drug; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; biogeochemical cycle; concentration (composition); gas exchange; mercury (element); air pollution control; Article; climate warming; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; environmental monitoring; field study; flow measurement; gas exchange; land use; meteorology; methodology; observational study; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; standardization; surface atmosphere mercury exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081360046

When blooms collapse, dead cells settle and aggregate into ""marine snow""particles, resulting in a large and climatically important vertical flux of carbon from the ocean surface to its depth, a process known as the ""biological pump.""To date, the formation of marine snow has been modeled as coagulation between spherical particles driven by gravitational settling and turbulent mixing, characterized by coagulation dynamics that converge onto time-independent concentrations of aggregates. However, many phytoplankton species are elongated and how their rodlike shape affects the aggregation process has remained unknown. Here, we study marine snow formation in a quiescent fluid assuming the constituent particles are elongated and form bundles upon encounter. We derive the collision kernel between dissimilar rods settling under gravity and discover that the most frequent collisions occur between the thinnest and thickest bundles, rather than between bundles of similar size. As a consequence, in the full coagulation model that combines exponential growth with settling, the thin-thick coupling can lead to statistically stationary states where the concentrations of aggregates of different size oscillate in time, exhibiting periodic bursts. The bursts are predicted to occur on the scale of a week and eventually lead to broadening of aggregate size spectra and may thus be highly relevant for plankton dynamics and the carbon cycle in the ocean. © 2020 authors.

SOC is sensitive to local agricultural management practices that sum up into regional SOC storage dynamics. Understanding regional carbon emission and sequestration trends is, therefore, important in formulating and implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. In this study, the estimation of SOC stock and regional storage dynamics in the Ondavská Vrchovina region (North-Eastern Slovakia) cropland and grassland topsoil between 1970 and 2013 was performed with the RothC model and gridded spatial data on weather, initial SOC stock and historical land cover and land use changes. Initial SOC stock in the 0.3-m topsoil layer was estimated at 38.4 t ha-1 in 1970. The 2013 simulated value was 49.2 t ha-1, and the 1993-2013 simulated SOC stock values were within the measured data range. The total SOC storage in the study area, cropland and grassland areas, was 4.21 Mt in 1970 and 5.16 Mt in 2013, and this 0.95 Mt net SOC gain was attributed to inter-conversions of cropland and grassland areas between 1970 and 2013, which caused different organic carbon inputs to the soil during the simulation period with a strong effect on SOC stock temporal dynamics. © 2020 Rastislav Skalský et al., published by Sciendo.","legacy soil data; regional soil organic carbon storage; RothC; soil organic carbon modelling; soil organic carbon stock","agricultural land; grassland; land cover; land use; organic carbon; soil carbon; spatiotemporal analysis; topsoil; Slovakia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087425270

Over the past 30 years, the high altitude areas in Eastern Africa have been reported to experience increased cases of malaria. Governments including that of the Republic of Uganda have responded through intensifying programs that can potentially minimize malaria transmission while reducing associated fatalities. However, malaria patterns following these intensified control and prevention interventions in the changing climate remains widely unexplored in East African highland regions. This study thus analyzed malaria patterns across altitudinal zones of Mount Elgon, Uganda. Methods: Times-series data on malaria cases (2011-2017) from five level III local health centers occurring across three altitudinal zones; low, mid and high altitude was utilized. Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation regression and Mann Kendall trend test were used to analyze malaria patterns. Vegetation attributes from the three altitudinal zones were analyzed using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to project malaria patterns for a 7 year period. Results: Malaria across the three zones declined over the study period. The hotspots for malaria were highly variable over time in all the three zones. Rainfall played a significant role in influencing malaria burdens across the three zones. Vegetation had a significant influence on malaria in the higher altitudes. Meanwhile, in the lower altitude, human population had a significant positive correlation with malaria cases. Conclusions: Despite observed decline in malaria cases across the three altitudinal zones, the high altitude zone became a malaria hotspot as cases variably occurred in the zone. Rainfall played the biggest role in malaria trends. Human population appeared to influence malaria incidences in the low altitude areas partly due to population concentration in this zone. Malaria control interventions ought to be strengthened and strategically designed to achieve no malaria cases across all the altitudinal zones. Integration of climate information within malaria interventions can also strengthen eradication strategies of malaria in such differentiated altitudinal zones. © 2020 The Author(s).","Altitude; Climate change; Ecohealth; Infectious diseases; Malaria; Patterns; Time series","rain; altitude; Article; climate change; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; disease burden; geographic information system; health care access; health service; human; malaria; malaria control; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Uganda; vegetation; incidence; malaria; mortality; Plasmodium; temperature; Altitude; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Incidence; Malaria; Plasmodium; Rain; Temperature; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086693775

Evaluation of surface water quality is an important issue to assure from its safe and stable use. However, describing quality conditions is generally difficult considering spatial variability of pollutants and a wide range of indicators like biological, physical and chemical substances which can be measured. This paper includes the study of surface water quality parameters in the northern Punjab region. Samples from different sources across northern Punjab were analysed for pH, TDS, TSS, turbidity, DO, chloride content, iron content and hardness of surface water. The pH, TDS, TSS, turbidity, DO, chloride content, iron content and hardness were found in the range of 6.7-8.7, 1358.00-1430.60 mg/l, 135.10-141.21 mg/l, 0.001-0.62 NTU, 0.96-7.80 mg/l, 0.80-15.56 mg/l, 0.01-0.02 mg/l and 1.2-13.9 mg/l respectively. The obtained results were compared with the acceptance limits as given by Indian standard code IS: 10500-2012. The high values of water quality parameters obtained as a result of this study indicates the level of pollution of the different sources of surface water of northern Punjab. At the end the obtained results were critically examined and suggestions were made for better management of surface water resources. An efficient transportation system is vital to economic development and a sustainable environment in a country. India's road transportation contributes to approximately 5.4% of the GDP carrying 65% of freight traffic and 85% of passenger traffic. India's fuel imports are growing at an average of 18% annually for which India spends 3.5% of GDP, thereby posing a major threat to the economy of the country in the future. Also, the use of such a high quantity of fuel causes vehicular pollution, which is responsible for fuel emission in urban areas. This study concentrates on carrying out an interdisciplinary work involving the sectors of transportation, energy, and environment considering the parameters like vehicle model split, fuel consumption and vehicular emissions. This is done by building, System Dynamics (SD) forecasting simulation models using STELLA software to mathematically forecast these parameters in the upcoming years until 2030. Hence, a scenario of augmenting the growth rate of public transportation and simultaneously restricting the growth rate of personalised transportation showed a substantial decrease in fuel consumption and fuel emissions, which eventually resulted in a reduction of fuel cost as well as an increase in the GDP in the transportation system for Chennai city. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Chlorine compounds; Computer software; Economics; Forecasting; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hardness; Indicators (chemical); Iron; River pollution; Surface water resources; System theory; Traffic surveys; Turbidity; Water hardness; Forecasting modeling; Industrial activities; Interdisciplinary work; Mathematical approach; Public transportation; Sustainable environment; Transportation system; Water quality parameters; Surface waters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086392858

We also tested the usefulness of the cheap and simple gravimetric method to assess the PM deposition, and compared to the expensive, but standard laser diffraction method. We found significant differences between the concentrations of PM10 deposited on tree leaves, and on dust traps. A significant difference was found in the concentration of PM5 only in July. A significant difference was also found in the concentration of PM10 among months based on leaves and dust traps. For PM5 there was a significant difference among months based on leaves deposition. We found a significant positive correlation between the PM10 concentration deposited on leaves and on dust traps. A positive correlation was found between the concentration of PM based on the gravimetric and laser diffraction measurement methods. Our findings pointed out the particulate material's washing by rain from leaves; thus, dust deposition on the surface of leaves is limited. Our results demonstrated that trees play an important role in the mitigation of air pollution, and they are a useful indicator of PM deposition for biomonitoring studies. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Deposited dust; Environmental assessment; Foliage dust; Urban health; Urbanization","Air pollution; Deposition; Diffraction; Dust; Forestry; Lime; Biological indicators; Biomonitoring studies; Gravimetric methods; Laser diffraction method; Laser diffractions; Particulate materials; PM10 concentration; Positive correlations; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); correlation; ecological approach; gravimetry; particulate matter; urban area; Debrecen; Hajdu-Bihar; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087109247

About 70% of agricultural soils in Indonesia has been exhausted and over mined and categorized as sick soils. The impacts of CC has already hit Indonesia and caused the rise of temperature about 0.2-0.3 °C per decade and sea level (SRL) about 5 mm per year, drought and floods occur more frequently, the change of rainfall intensity and rainfall pattern, the shifting of planting season and lead to the decreasing of crops yield or yield loss significantly. The CC along coastline (95,181 km) increases and cause a severely more consequence on the livelihoods inhabitants (40% of total population) and decreasing of lowland agriculture. The paddy fields in coastal area until 2050 will decrease around 174,461 ha in Java, 8,095 ha in Bali, 78,701 ha in Sulawesi, 25,372 ha in Kalimantan, 3,170 ha in Sumatera and 2,123 ha in Lombok Island.

Paraguay is a developing country with the highest per capita hydroelectric energy generation in the world, but only 18% of local consumption is hydroelectric and 41% of its energy matrix corresponds to oil products. This paper aims to analyse the importance the Country places on EE as a strategy towards sustainable development and to highlight as EE is an effective pathway to mitigate the climate changes and contrast their effects. The authors initially provide an insight into the climate scenarios for Paraguay and underline the effects of the climate changes on the buildings' comfort. Subsequently, the authors provide, by resourcing a bibliographic review, a description of the Paraguayan sectors of greater energy consumption, its policies and targets set for increasing EE. Besides, the main EE projects developed by other neighbouring South American countries are analysed to show the level of development of each one in the scope of EE and to offer a reference basis of potential virtuous solutions to be adopted in Paraguay. A focus on the building sector is also made to provide a foundation for policy analyses to enhance EE in this sector. As a result of this review, evidence that EE is beginning to take part in Paraguay's public policies was found, with the leaders becoming aware of its importance. Nevertheless, many concrete results could not be achieved as of yet and overcoming these barriers still involve a great challenge. Regarding the building sector, few advances have been noticed regarding the regulations of buildings' thermal performance, a reason for which the National objectives set need to be more specific to achieve greater collective awareness to enforce them. Finally, key actions are recommended for Paraguay aiming to improve EE levels to face the climate change phenomenon. © 2020 by the authors.","Buildings; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Paraguay; Policies",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086922704

Thus, it is important to demonstrate ways of avoiding polluted areas. The approach described in this paper is intended to draw attention to polluted areas and help pedestrians and cyclists to achieve the lowest possible level of air pollution when planning daily routes. We utilise real-time air quality data which is obtained from monitoring stations across the world. The data consist of the geolocation of monitoring stations as well as index numbers to scale the air quality level in every corresponding monitoring stations. When the air quality level is considered having a moderate health concern for people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, an alternative route that avoid air pollution will be calculated so that pedestrians and cyclists can be informed. The implementation can visualize air quality level in several areas in 3D map as well as informs health-aware route for pedestrian and cyclist. It automatically adjusts the observed air quality areas based on the availability of monitoring stations. The proposed approach results in a prototype of a health-aware 3D navigation system for pedestrian and cyclist. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Air quality; Environmental technology; Health; Navigation systems; Photogrammetry; Air quality data; Air quality levels; Alternative routes; Geolocations; Health concerns; Index numbers; Monitoring stations; Polluted area; Air navigation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088707845

In general, the grid provides the electricity required to charge an EV's battery. However, it could be worthwhile to consider EV charging by specific solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to further facilitate the use of renewable energy and to minimize CO2 emissions. Additional benefits could, for instance, be less overloaded local grids and additional grid flexibility. Because little information and experiences exist with so-called solar PV-powered EVs, this paper explores how well PV systems—with the possible combination of battery energy storage systems (BESSs)—might contribute to charging of EVs in four different countries, namely, The Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, and Australia. To this end, a model has been developed that calculates the interactions between PV-BESS systems, EVs, and the grid in each country to determine the electricity balance, financial consequences, and avoided CO2 emissions of PV-powered EVs, compared with EVs that are solely charged by the grid, as well as conventional passenger cars with an internal combustion engine (ICE-V). It is logically found that in countries with a high irradiation, the whole year through, such as Brazil and Australia, solar PV-powered EVs can be operated more effectively than in countries with a high variability of irradiation over the year such as The Netherlands and Norway. If the charging system's PV share is increased from 0% to 50%, the number of required grid charging events per year can be reduced from 104 to 34 in The Netherlands and from 123 to 55 in Norway. PV charging can also reduce CO2 emissions of EVs by 18% to 93% as compared with ICE-Vs depending on the location. From a financial perspective, PV-powered EVs are not yet financially feasible in all countries; however, in some nations, 100% PV charging is already a viable option. In general, it can be concluded that in contrast to driving an ICE-V, the further PV-powered EVs are driven, the more affordable they become—they might even generate financial revenues—and hence, the higher their positive environmental impact will be. On the basis of this study, it can therefore be concluded that solar PV-powered EVs are a technically feasible and increasingly financially attractive option for transport sector emission reductions in most countries when compared with regular grid charging of EVs and certainly as compared with ICE-Vs. © 2019 The Authors.

Both national and regional-level authorities are capable of addressing their actions more effectively if they have information about the spatial distribution of phenomena related to the policies they conduct. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to explain the regional differences in carbon intensity in Poland. The differences in carbon intensity between regions and the national average were analysed using index decomposition analysis (IDA). Aggregate carbon intensity for regional economies as well as the carbon intensity of households was investigated. For both levels of analysis: total emissions and emission from households economic development is the key factor responsible for the inter-regional differences in carbon emission per capita. In the case of total emissions, the second important factor influencing these differences is the structure of the national power system, i.e., its concentration and the production of energy from fossil fuels. For households, disposable income per capita is a key factor of differences in CO2 emission per capita between regions. Higher households' incomes contribute to higher emission per capita, mostly due to the shift in consumption towards more energy- and material-intensive goods. The contribution of energy emissivity is quite low and not as varied as in the case of income. This suggests that policy instruments targeted at the consumption of fuels can be rather uniform across regions, while more developed regions should also be subject to measures supporting less energy-intensive consumption. On the other hand, policy in less developed regions should prevent them from following the path of per capita emissions growth. © 2020 by the author.","Carbon intensity; Index decomposition analysis; Kaya identity; Spatial analysis","Carbon; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Index decomposition analyses (IDA); Less-developed regions; Levels of analysis; National power systems; Production and consumption; Regional differences; Spatial differences; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090804984

It is unknown how land management interventions in dry climate conditions can benefit water yield in the context of climate and land use change interactions. In this study, we assessed the effects of both land use and predicted climate change on the Mordagh Chay basin water yield using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model. First, we modeled the current water yield, followed by developing six combined climate–land use scenarios until 2030 based on the CCSM4 climate model for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. We used three future land use scenarios simulated by the Dyna-CLUE model. The trend scenario of land use change, which does not include any improvements in irrigation efficiency, significantly affected basin water yield under both climate scenarios. Water yield decreases by 19.8% and 31.8% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Under all land use scenarios that included improvements in irrigation efficiency, the water yield responded positively. For the RCP4.5 scenario, the water yield was projected to increase between 16.6% and 18% depending on the land use scenario. The increase in water yield under the RCP8.5 climate scenario was much lower than for the RCP4.5 scenario (about one-third). Overall, the results showed that by adopting appropriate irrigation efficiency, it is possible to achieve a better balance between environmental needs and regional economic and agricultural development. The results provide insight into possible sustainable development options and also provide guidance for managing the other Urmia Lake sub-basins, whereas the approach of integrated assessment of climate, land use change, and land management options is also applicable in other conditions to help inform sustainable management. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ecosystem Services; InVEST; irrigation efficiency improvement; RCP scenarios; Urmia Lake basin","Air navigation; Climate models; Economics; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Irrigation; Lakes; Land use; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Irrigation efficiency; Lake basins; RCP scenarios; Climate change; climate change; future prospect; land management; land use change; semiarid region; water yield; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078890864

Because of logistical constraints, very few studies have been conducted to assess the variability within and across homes and the predictors of this variability. This study evaluated within- and between-home variability of indoor PM2.5 and identified predictors for PM2.5 in homes of mothers participating in the urban Mother and Child in the Environment birth cohort study in Durban, South Africa. Thirty homes were selected from 300 homes that were previously sampled for PM2.5. Two measurements of PM2.5 levels were conducted in each home within a 1 week interval in both warm and cold seasons (four samplings per home) using Airmetrics MiniVol samplers. A linear mixed-effect model was used to evaluate within- and between-home variability and to identify fixed effects (predictors) that result in reduced variability. The PM2.5 levels in the 30 homes ranged from 2 to 303 μg m-3. The within-home variability accounted for 94% of the total variability in the log-transformed PM2.5 levels for the 30 homes. The fixed effects extracted from the repeated samplings in the present study were used to improve a previously developed multivariable linear regression model for 300 homes, and thereby increased the R2 from 0.50 to 0.54. Inclusion of fixed-effects in multivariable linear regression models resulted in a reasonably robust model that can be used to predict PM2.5 levels in unmeasured homes of the cohort. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Durban , South Africa; Epidemiological studies; Mixed-effect models; Multi-variable linear regression; Robust modeling; Socio-economics; Total variabilities; Urban-household; Regression analysis; Article; cohort analysis; household; human; indoor environment; mother; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; season; socioeconomics; South Africa; urban area; adult; air pollutant; child; environmental monitoring; female; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Cohort Studies; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Mothers; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087110932

The results show that rail transportation distances range from 0 km to over 3500 km. Transportation emissions can be as high as 35% of a power plant's operational emissions – a number significantly higher than previous literature estimates. Additionally, implementation of post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) at existing plants may further increase transportation emissions.

In this regard, our paper aims to evaluate the costs of these two paths and then analyze whether the industrial sector has made a good trade-off. In particular, we measured costs of the two paths by shadow prices of water use and wastewater emissions, and then we built a non-parametric input-output model to produce the estimates. For 2015, the shadow price of water use was 37.85 RMB/ton at the national level, which indicated the marginal cost of saving each ton of water was 37.864 RMB and that of wastewater emissions was 141.759 RMB/ton, which meant that the marginal cost of abating each ton of wastewater emissions was 141.759 RMB. Over the period 2004-2015, both shadow prices exhibited an upward trend at the national and regional levels, which suggested there was an increased cost to reduce emissions. However, the two shadow prices did not follow a common trend, but deviated from each other in most of China's provinces, which resulted in a bad trade-off between the two scenarios. As a result, the bad trade-off not only lowered the efficiency to reduce emissions, but it was also linked to a high cost. © 2020 by the authors.","Abatement cost; Cost-effective; Saving water; Shadow price; Wastewater emissions","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Wastewater treatment; Cost-effective methods; Industrial sector; Industrial wastewaters; Input output model; Non-parametric; Production process; Regional levels; Wastewater emissions; Cost benefit analysis; emission control; industrial waste; methodology; trade-off; wastewater treatment; water use; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087544375

The first area is implemented by two approaches: authoritarian governance and multi-stakeholders' initiatives (MSI). MSI is more effective, but at the same time only possible if there are developed and interested initiative participants. It allows us to discuss key issues together, as well as increases the degree of cooperation of companies in the regions. Voluntary initiatives have been made possible by increased attention to environmental issues and the transition to green mining. On the part of innovation, the authors note the importance of supporting them, as new technologies not only improve efficiency, but also reduce emissions and improve safety of working conditions.

ACI 318-19, Iranian steel rebars standard INSO 3132 and next edition of Iranian national building allow the use of high strength rebars in elements of ductile force-resisting systems. Therefore it is important to verify that if S520 rebars are capable of providing adequate, a) strain capacity, b) out of plane buckling deformation capacity, which are the two common sources of failures observed in recent earthquakes in boundary elements of lightly reinforced shear walls. An experimental program is designed to compare strain capacity of boundary elements reinforced with S400 and S520 rebars, which include monotonic and cyclic loading considering probable loading on lightly reinforced boundary elements. Considering test results for specimens under monotonic and cyclic loading it is shown that, a) gauge length suggested by INSO for rebar test could be misleading in the evaluation of rebar axial strain capacity, b) S520 rebars have limited ductility compared to S400, but considering strain demand, this limited strain capacity is adequate to avoid rebar fracture, c) local strain (crack width) has a better correlation with out of plane buckling compared to average strain as suggested by some researchers, d) it seems that out of plane buckling for S520 rebars occurs at smaller deformation, which means there is the need for larger minimum dimension for sections reinforced with S520 compared to S400. © 2020, Materials and Energy Research Center.

This research looks at alternative methods to increase the shading effect by changing the block's orientation and buildings' height diversity within the urban block. ENVI-Met 4.1 software is used to predict the outdoor thermal performance of a base case urban configuration then used to evaluate several proposed urban configurations and compare their thermal performance to the base case configuration. Orientation was the most influential factor in the outdoor air. For the base case, a reduction of 1.8 °C degree was noted between the N-S and NE-SW orientations. An urban configuration with significant variation in the buildings' height resulted in more reduction in outdoor air temperature compared to a configuration with gradual variation in the buildings' heights. Orienting the significant variation in buildings' heights along the short axis of the urban block resulted in a reduction of the air temperature in NW-SE orientation by 1.1 °C. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Buildings height diversity; ENVI-Met; Outdoor thermal performance; Urban geometry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080903697

In this study, we investigated the effect of different litter removal and addition treatments on the annual forage production and on soil carbon and nitrogen contents of four rangeland communities in arid to semiarid areas of Iran. The results showed that litter removal reduced the contents of carbon and nitrogen in soil and the annual forage production. There was an 80% drop in annual forage production of Artemisia aucheri stand when whole litter mass was removed. The litter removal increased the annual production in Saccharum bengalense stand, and the highest forage production increment was seen when 50% of litter was removed. There was no significant difference between legume and non-legume plant stands owing to variations of soil nitrogen content. Due to the allelopathic effects in Artemisia aucheri stand, litter manipulation had no effect on the annual growth of annuals. The litter quality was more correlated to soil C and N contents and to annual forage production than to litter quantity in plant stands. Plant stands in semiarid rangelands were more sensitive to litter removal than to litter addition. Generally, short-term litter manipulation for a growing season had greater impacts on shrubland communities. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Arid land; Grassland; Plant community; Rangeland; Shrubland","forage; grass; growing season; leaf litter; legume; nutrient dynamics; rangeland; semiarid region; shrubland; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; Iran; Artemisia aucheri; Saccharum bengalense",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085309271

In a large number of studies in this field, the construction of valid bounds for the evolution time is always the core mission, yet the physics behind it and some fundamental questions like which states can really fulfill the target are ignored. Understanding the physics behind the bounds is at least as important as constructing attainable bounds. Here we provide an operational approach for the definition of the quantum speed limit, which utilizes the set of states that can fulfill the target to define the speed limit. Its performances in various scenarios have been investigated. For time-independent Hamiltonians, it is inverse proportional to the difference between the highest and lowest energies. The fact that its attainability does not require a zero ground-state energy suggests it can be used as an indicator of quantum phase transitions. For time-dependent Hamiltonians, it is shown that, contrary to the results given by existing bounds, the true speed limit should be independent of the time. Moreover, in the case of spontaneous emission, we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that a lousy purity can benefit the reduction of the quantum speed limit. © 2020 authors.

Here we performed highly time-resolved measurements of NH3 concentrations and auxiliary parameters in the ceiling duct of a typical building complex during different seasons with varying temperature and population, allowing an in-depth investigation of the driving forces in terms of governing NH3 emissions. Extremely high levels of NH3 concentration (1013 ± 793 μg m−3) were observed throughout the campaign. Seasonally, the NH3 concentration during summer vacation (1377 ± 1072 μg m−3) was significantly higher than during school time in fall (796 ± 432 μg m−3) and winter (661 ± 267 μg m−3). Moreover, the diurnal variation of NH3 during summertime was highly correlated with temperature (R2 = 0.95, p &lt; 0.01), while it was not the case for school time with dense population (R2 = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01, R2 = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01 in fall, winter, respectively). The highest temperature was 35.9 °C, with an emission intensity peak of 4.1 mg s−1 while the lowest temperature was 1.3 °C with an emission intensity of 0.8 mg s−1. The nitrogen stable isotopic composition of NH3(δ15N–NH3) may be a useful tool to trace NH3 sources. Here we report the δ15N–NH3 measured from ceiling duct collected directly, which constrains human excreta source δ15N–NH3 values (meanminmax) ‰ to −35.6‰−39.8‰−31.9‰. These results support that temperature is the key factor in controlling NH3 emissions from human excreta and demonstrate the importance of using human excreta emitted δ15N–NH3 to quantify excreta NH3 contribution in urban atmospheres. Our findings highlight opportunities to limit NH3 emissions from human excreta that will bring co-benefits to the air quality and human health in urban China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia; Emission intensity; Human excreta; Isotopic signature; Seasons","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Ceilings; Ducts; Auxiliary parameters; Building complexes; Emission intensity; Highest temperature; On-line characterization; Stable isotopic compositions; Time resolved measurement; Varying temperature; Ammonia; ammonia; nitrogen 15; air quality; air temperature; ammonia; anthropogenic source; building; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; excretion; Internet; isotopic composition; nitrogen; stable isotope; summer; urban area; urban atmosphere; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; autumn; body fluids and secretions; chemical composition; China; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); environmental temperature; human; leisure; meteorology; online analysis; population density; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; urban area; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083454600

Using biomass-burning stoves alongside clean stoves undermines health and environmental goals. This review synthesizes stove stacking data gathered from eleven case studies of clean cooking programs in low- and middle-income country settings. Analyzed data are from ministry and program records, research studies, and informant interviews. Thematic analysis identifiedy key drivers of stove stacking behavior in each setting. Significant (28%–100%) stacking with traditional cooking methods was observed in all cases. Reasons for traditional fuel use included: costs of clean fuel; mismatches between cooking technologies and household needs; and unreliable fuel supply. National household surveys often focus on 'primary' cookstoves and miss stove stacking data. Thus more attention should be paid to discontinuation of traditional stove use, not solely adoption of cleaner stoves/fuels. Future energy policies and programs should acknowledge the realities of stacking and incorporate strategies at the design stage to transition away from polluting stoves/fuels. Seven principles for clean cooking program design and policy are presented, focused on a shift toward “cleaner stacking” that could yield household air pollution reductions approaching WHO targets. © 2020","Adoption; Clean cooking; Cookstoves; Household air pollution; Household energy","Air cleaners; Fuels; Surveys; Cooking technology; Design Principles; Household surveys; Low and middle income countries; Pollution reduction; Thematic analysis; Traditional cooking; Traditional fuels; Stoves; atmospheric pollution; biomass power; design; developing world; energy policy; fuel consumption; future prospect; household energy; low income population; pollution control; targeting; World Health Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082761463

However, large set of accurate data of various sources and modeling calibrations are needed for such complex modeling system to be reliable. The problem becomes more obvious when the model is operated over a domain in which there is a general lack of accurate input data such as emission inventory data. The current study investigates the possibility of model tuning for more accurate prediction of air pollutant concentrations in the city of Tehran in an air pollution episode as a case study. In the last several years, Tehran has frequently experienced long episodes of air pollution, often resulted in forced holidays in the city. WRF/CAMx modeling system were used to simulate the spatial distribution of pollutants concentrations over the city of Tehran in a highly polluted episode during December 2017. In order to improve model performance, a methodology was developed and used to adjust the emission inventory of the system. Due to lack of national emission inventory and background data, effects of introducing a top-down national emission inventory to the modeling system was investigated. This emission inventory can also be used to prepare more accurate boundary concentrations for countries located near Iran. In addition, emission rates of the most dominant emission sources of the city of Tehran – mobile sources – were adjusted using the results from chassis dynamometer tests. Also, the hourly variations of emission were improved using measured ambient NO2 concentrations. Comparison of modeled and measured concentrations at air quality monitoring stations for various pollutant showed that emission adjustment was the most effective method which resulted in considerable model performance improvement over Tehran. Results showed that due to better and more realistic emission factors used in the model, bias error for CO, NO2, O3 and PM2.5 reduced by 0.36 ppm, 3.4 ppb, 0.19 ppb and 2.14 μg/m3, respectively and correlation coefficient for CO, O3 and PM2.5 increased by 0.13, 0.02 and 0.6. This proves the possibility of using such method to improve model performance when there is a general lack of accurate input data. © 2020","Air quality modeling improvement; Emission inventory adjustment; Model performance evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082759009

We analyze the implications of integrating health and climate when determining the best locations for replacing power plants with new wind, solar, or natural gas to meet a CO2 reduction target in the United States. We employ a capacity expansion model with integrated assessment of climate and health damages, comparing portfolios optimized for benefits to climate alone or both health and climate. The model estimates county-level health damages and accounts for uncertainty by using a range of air quality models (AP3, EASIUR, and InMAP) and concentration-response functions (American Cancer Society and Harvard Six Cities). We find that reducing CO2 by 30% yields $21-68 billion in annual health benefits, with an additional $9-36 billion possible when co-optimizing for climate and health benefits. Additional benefits accrue from prioritizing emissions reductions in counties with high population exposure. Total health benefits equal or exceed climate benefits across a wide range of modeling assumptions. Our results demonstrate the value of considering health in climate policy design and the need for interstate cooperation to achieve additional health benefits equitably.

In the large, populated and industrialized areas like the Asian continental outflow region, the combination of regional transport and local stagnation often exacerbates urban haze pollution. However, the detailed chemical processes underlying the enhancement of urban haze induced by the combined effect of local emissions and transported remote pollutants are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate an important role of transported hygroscopic particles in increasing local inorganic aerosols, by studying the chemical composition of PM2.5 collected between October 2012 and June 2014 in Seoul, a South Korean megacity in the Asian continental outflow region, using the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic model. PM2.5 measured under the condition of regional transport from the upwind source areas in China was higher in mass concentration and richer in secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) species (SO2-4 , NO-3 ,and NH+4) and aerosol liquid water (ALW) compared to that measured under non-transport conditions. The secondary inorganic species and ALW were both increased, particularly in cases with high PM2.5 levels, and this indicates inorganic species as a major driver of hygroscopicity. We conclude that the urban haze pollution in a continental outflow region like Seoul, particularly during the cold season, can be exacerbated by ALW in the transported particles, which enhances the nitrate partitioning into the particle phase in NOx- and NH3-rich urban areas. This study reveals the synergistic effect of remote and local sources on urban haze pollution in the downwind region and provides insight into the nonlinearity of domestic and foreign contributions to receptor PM2.5 concentrations in numerical air quality models.. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; concentration (composition); haze; hygroscopicity; inorganic matter; nitrate; outflow; pollutant transport; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088412311

Such contributions are conventionally expressed as radiative forcing (RF) and global warming impact (GWI). We contextualize our results within landscape carbon production and storage to highlight the importance of changes in albedo for landscape GWI from multiple causes, including net ecosystem production (NEP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Objective: To examine the spatiotemporal changes in albedo (Δα) in contrasting managed landscapes through calculations of albedo-induced RF (RFΔα) and GWI (GWIΔα) under different climatic conditions. Methods: We selected five contrasting landscapes within the Kalamazoo River watershed in southern Michigan USA as proof of concept. The daily MCD43A3 MODIS (V006) product was used to analyze the inter- and intra-annual variations of growing season albedo. In addition, the variations of RFΔα and GWIΔα were computed based on landscape composition and climate. Results: The RFΔα (− 5.6 W m−2) and GWIΔα (− 1.3 CO2eq ha−1 year−1) were high in forest-dominated landscapes, indicating cooling effects and CO2eq mitigation impacts similar to crops. The CO2eq mitigation of cropland-dominated landscapes was on average 52% stronger than forest-dominated landscapes. In the landscape with the highest proportion of forest, under dry and wet conditions CO2eq mitigation was reduced by up to 24% and ~ 30%, respectively; in one cropland-dominated landscape wet conditions reduced CO2eq mitigation by 23%. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that quantifying spatiotemporal changes in albedo in managed landscapes and under different climatic conditions is essential to understand how landscape modification affects RFΔα and GWIΔα and thereby contributes to ecosystem-level GWI. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Albedo; Cropland; Forest; Global warming impact; Land mosaics; Radiative forcing","agricultural land; albedo; annual variation; carbon dioxide; climate conditions; global climate; global warming; growing season; MODIS; net ecosystem production; spatiotemporal analysis; watershed; Kalamazoo River; Michigan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085092172

High resolution meteorological information about the current and future urban climate, with the main focus on heat load, was provided for the model cities Wiesbaden and Mainz. The MUKLIMO_3 urban climate model and the cuboid method were used to downscale an ensemble of 17 regional climate projections to a grid size of 100 m. The climate analysis also includes the effects of nocturnal cold air drainage flows. Simulations based on the present level of urban development were compared with those including no development. The results indicate that, in densely built-up areas, the increase in summer climate indices attributable to urban development is of a similar magnitude to that due to climate change. They also show that cold air drainage flows play an important role in providing relief for heat-affected areas. The “co-creation” process, involving both climate experts and municipal agencies, demonstrated that the transfer of the meteorological information into maps suitable for practical use in municipal planning is a challenging, but crucial step that requires intensive interdisciplinary discussion. © 2020 Deutscher Wetterdienst",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083467589

A type of integration of the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is emerging based on the premise of battery swapping. Drivers can exchange their empty batteries quickly with full batteries from any battery swapping station. The limited battery capacities of electric taxis require visiting the swapping stations during pickup and drop-off tours, which entails choosing the route more effectively to avoid customer delay. We propose the dynamic routing of electric taxis with a look-ahead policy using a Markov decision process (MDP) for assigning an electric taxi fleet to customers with the assumption of elastic demand. This is the first model that focuses on the design of a non-myopic routing of electric taxis that considers the limited battery capacity through serving customers, detours of the taxi drivers to battery swapping stations (BSS), and integration of customers delay and the system cost into a dynamic non-myopic pricing policy under the objective of maximizing social benefit. Using battery recharging locations and taxicab trip data in New York City, we showed an improvement in the average of social welfare, due to use of clean and smart taxi routes based on the proposed dynamic non-myopic routing policy by up to 8% compared to the routing problem without a look-ahead policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery charging station (BCS); Battery swapping station (BSS); Dial-A-Ride problem (DARP); Greenhouse gas (GHG); Traveling salesman problem with pickup and drop-off (TSPPD); Vehicle routing problem (VRP)","Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Costs; Drops; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Markov processes; Pickups; Sales; Taxicabs; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle routing; Battery swapping; Charging infrastructures; Dial-a-ride problem; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy expenditure; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Markov Decision Processes; Vehicle routing problem; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080939846

During the experiments, the temperature was monitored at the site of exposure, as well as its distribution in the liquid. Pulsed solid-state Nd:YAG laser and CW diode laser with an irradiation power of â1/4500 mW were used as radiation sources. However, a three-dimensional composite was formed only with constant exposure. The effect of pulsed laser radiation with an intensity corresponding to nonlinear interaction with water dispersion led only to its enlightenment. Thus, it is important not only the energy parameters of radiation but also the frequency of energy portions exposure for the fabrication of tissue-engineered structures (composites). As a result, it was found that the curing of the dispersion and the composite formation occurs under the action of continuous or pulsed (with a high pulse repetition rate) laser radiation at a temperature in the range from 45°C to 50°C; in case the pulse repetition rate is insufficient, composite formation is not observed even under the action of high intensity radiation and heating occurs only to a temperature of â1/440 ° C. This formation process can be generated both in the visible 532 nm and in the infrared 810-nm wavelength ranges. In this case, one of the main conditions is the absence of albumin or cells absorption at these wavelengths so that absorption occurs mainly with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Studies of the surface and internal structure of the composite made it possible to demonstrate the binding of nanotubes to each other. This happened under the influence of laser radiation. This led to high hardness values of the composites.

The present study aims at addressing this research gap for boreal spruce trees growing in three different regions of Canada, submitted to distinct levels of atmospheric emissions, by examining the amount of carbon gained per unit of water lost in trees, i.e., the intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). Under pristine air quality conditions, middle-to long-term trends passed from no-reaction mode to passive strategies due to atmospheric CO2, and short-term iWUE variations mostly ensue from year-to-year climatic conditions. In contrast, in trees exposed to pollutants from a copper smelter and an oil-sands mining region, air quality deterioration generated swift, long-term iWUE rises immediately at the onset of operations. In this case, the very active foliar strategy sharply reduced the intra-foliar CO2 (Ci) pressure. Statistical modeling allowed identifying emissions as the main trigger for the iWUE swift shifts; subsequent combined effects of emissions and rising CO2 led to passive foliar modes in the recent decades, and short-term variations due to climatic conditions appeared all along the series. Overall, boreal trees under different regional conditions modified their foliar strategies mostly without changing their stem growth. These findings underline the potential of acidifying emissions for prompting major iWUE increases due to lowering the stomatal apertures in leaves, and the combined influence of rising CO2 in modulating other foliar responses. A fallout of this research is that degrading air quality may create true divergences in the relationship between tree-ring isotopes and climatic conditions, an impact to consider prior to using isotopic series for paleo-climatic modeling. Gas exchange strategies of forests exposed to acidifying emissions create major divergences from responses to pCO2 and climatic conditions, a concern for modeling global C and water cycles. © 2020 Natural Resources Canada","Growth rings; Isotopes; NOx; SO2; Water use efficiency","Acidification; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Deterioration; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Isotopes; Oil sands; Anthropogenic changes; Atmospheric emission; Growth rings; Intrinsic water-use efficiencies; Quality deteriorations; Short-term variations; Statistical modeling; Water use efficiency; Forestry; carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; air quality; anthropogenic effect; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; coniferous tree; isotopic composition; nitric oxide; physiological response; sulfur dioxide; tree ring; water use efficiency; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; Canada; carbon footprint; climate; controlled study; environmental exposure; mining; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant stem; plant stoma; plant water use; pressure measurement; spruce; tree growth; trend study; air pollution; drug effect; physiology; spruce; Canada; Picea; Air Pollution; Canada; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080094199

In order to develop an in vitro conservation technology to obtain plants for reintroduction, seeds of Vriesea flammea L.B.Sm. were collected, sterilized and germinated in culture medium. The plants obtained were cultured for 180 days in MS medium with different concentrations of mineral nutrients (25 and 50% of nitrogenous salts and macronutrients), and different concentrations of sucrose (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 g L-1), and then acclimatized for 150 days on commercial substrate. When seeds were sterilized directly, only 4% of them were contaminated, whereas sterilization of capsules resulted in 43.6% contaminated seeds. Germination rates above 80% were recorded. Low concentrations of nitrogenous salts and macronutrients produced greater than 76% survival and promoted greater in vitro plant development than the complete MS medium. The development of the aerial system, root system, fresh mass and photosynthetic pigments were positively related to sucrose concentration in vitro. The highest sucrose concentration also indirectly promoted greater development of the aerial system and fresh mass of acclimatized plants. We established conditions for in vitro cultivation and acclimatization for efficient propagation of V. flammea with a view towards conservation of the species or reestablishment of natural populations. © 2020, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

The findings from this paper revealed very interesting results proving that good governance has a negative relationship with CO2 emissions. Oil-producing countries have good governance system to help control and reduce CO2 emissions as compared to non-oil-producing countries. Particularly, in oil-producing countries, business regulatory environment, budget and fiscal management, as well as fiscal policy have a significant negative relationship with CO2 emissions. But there is rather a positive relationship between these indicators and CO2 emissions in non-oil-producing countries as they do not have the required structures and arrangements to control CO2 emissions. Also, in oil-producing countries, property rights and rules have positive relationship with CO2 emissions but in the case of non-oil-producing countries, there is a negative relationship, meaning that non-oil-producing countries have good legal system and rule-based governance structures that is capable of protecting property rights. There is positive relationship between quality of government administration and CO2 emissions in oil-producing countries but negative for non-oil-producing countries. Trade liberalization and economic growth have positive relationship with CO2 emissions in both categories.

The accurate and efficient use of plants that support urban green infrastructure would play an important role in these decisions. The present study aimed to determine the tolerance of domestic and exotic woody plant species planted in public spaces in Artvin province, Turkey to the effects of climate change. Thus, the tolerance of 59 most prevalent trees and shrubs identified in public spaces and natural fields in 12 sampling areas in Artvin province center, Hopa and Ardanuc district centers were surveyed. Findings of the regression model demonstrated that drought, cold hardiness and precipitation had an impact on the adaptability scores of the plants. The differences between the climate conditions in sample areas had an impact on the future adaptation and tolerance of the plants to climate change. This demonstrated that plant species in urban green areas will be affected not only by the global climate change but also by local climate conditions in the short and long term.

The purpose of this study was to perform compositional analysis of the municipal solid waste produced at the Astana International Airport and evaluate different waste management scenarios in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Recyclable and combustible fractions were found to be the major fractions (over 50%) of the total municipal solid waste generated in the Astana International Airport. Four base greenhouse gas emissions scenarios were proposed in this study, namely scenario-1 describing the current municipal solid waste management case, scenario-2 with integration of 29% recycling and 71% of municipal solid waste landfilling, scenario-3 for 100% of airport municipal solid waste being incinerated and scenario-4 for recycling 29% and the remaining waste being processed for energy recovery purposes. The proposed scenario 2 demonstrated significantly reduced net greenhouse gas emissions (t CO2 eq/year) over the existing scenario 1, while scenarios 3 and 4 showed negative net greenhouse gas emissions.

The crop, soil and weather data used in the simulations were obtained from field experiments carried out in maize crops in 2008 and 2011 in two different edaphoclimatic regions in Alagoas State, Northeast Brazil. The approach we used explored the ability of APSIM to simulate growth variables and soil water dynamics of a maize variety (AL Bandeirante). During parametrization, we made some adjustments regarding the variety and soil organic matter to attain a better representation of the growth and soil water dynamics, respectively. The APSIM-Maize model predicted the leaf area index with a RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) ranging between 0.14 and 1.06 cm2 cm-2 and the biomass production with an RMSE between 2.30 and 3.34 Mg ha-1. The volumetric soil water content was satisfactorily predicted with RMSE ranging between 0.02 and 0.08 mm mm-1. Results showed that this model is a useful tool for decision-making, which can be potentially used as a support in climate risk management and policies, aiming to improve regional production, provided it has been previously validated with independent datasets. © 2020, Southern Cross Publishing.","Agricultural systems; APSIM; Crop simulation model; Field experiment; Sowing date; Zea mays l",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088633491

This work examined a number of technologies in the intensification of a 2 MHz RF glow discharge plasma to deposit carbon film by means of the hollow cathode. Three types of the cathode configurations, which were cylindrical, rectangular and a cylindrical-rectangular combination, were tested to get an optimum condition for the carbon deposition. Both carbon target and substrate were fixed inside the hollow cathode. The plasma was characterized by means of optical emission spectroscopy (OES) at the range of 200 nm - 1000 nm. The results showed that the combination where the rectangular hollow was placed inside the cylindrical one, produced the most intense glow. Ion density and electron temperature in the plasma were determined by a calculation based on the atomic data related to the specific electronic transitions of the ions. The density of ions was very high in the centre area of the rectangular hollow producing complex reactions. On the other hand, the high density of the ions decreases the electron temperature. The energy of the ions was difficult to be predicted since the spectrum showed the existence of a large number of ion states. Observations on the resulted deposit on the surface of quartz substrate suggest that the intensification needs to be further investigated related to the effectiveness of sputtering and deposition process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon films; Cathodes; Deposits; Electron sources; Etching; Glow discharges; Ions; Optical emission spectroscopy; Substrates; Carbon deposition; Complex reactions; Deposition process; Electronic transition; Optical emission spectroscopies (OES); Optimum conditions; Plasma sputtering depositions; RF glow discharge; Electron temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087047942

Data on pollutant emissions, hospitalizations, and hospital costs were collected from 2008 to 2017 and correlated with air quality standards. The results showed that the concentration of particulate matter increased each year during the study period and was highly correlated with hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases. Ozone (O3) was within the quality standard throughout the study period but registered an increase in the mean and a positive correlation with hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases. The carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were within the quality standards throughout the study period with a decrease in the last years studied, but showed a positive correlation with hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases. The pollutant emissions and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases had an inverse relationship with the monthly rainfall curve for São Paulo, which indicates that rainfall tended to reduce pollutant emissions and consequently hospitalizations due to inhalation of these pollutants. Because costs are directly associated with hospitalizations, both increased during the study period-302,000 hospitalizations at an average cost of 368 USD resulted in a total cost of 111 million USD. To reduce these costs, Brazil should implement stricter policies to improve the air quality of its major cities and develop a viable alternative to diesel vehicles. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality index; Environmental protection; Human health; Particulate material; Pollutant emissions; Pulmonary disease","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; correlation; diesel engine; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; respiratory disease; sulfur dioxide; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087714989

Using both biophysical and spatially explicit integrated models, biophysical and monetary values of key Ecosystem Services (ESs) were estimated in the Sundarbans Biosphere Region (SBR), India. Quantification was made both in time series (1982–2017) and individual years (1973, 1988, 2003, 2013, 2018, 2025, 2035, 2045) to understand the impact of climate change and land-use dynamics on the long-term ecological status of the region. The monetary and biophysical values of the ESs were then obtained from Net Primary Productivity (NPP) models, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST), and Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model (CA-Markov). NPP increased significantly during the first half period (1982–1999), but significantly declined during the second period (2000–2017). The highest estimated ESVs (US$ ha−1) was found for habitat service (30780), nutrient cycling (12626), and gas regulation (7224.81), whereas, lower ESVs were approximated for water regulation (347.81), raw material production (777.82) and waste treatment (13.57) services. Among the nine ESs evaluated, climate regulation, gas regulation, and disturbance regulation were the most important regulating services of the SBR. The combined effects of climate change and land-use dynamics on ESs are much stringent in a vulnerable region like the SBR. Most of the regulating services were closely associated with the fluctuation of land use land cover input. Thus, land management policies and land reform strategies that will encourage the conversion of productive land, especially the highly productive mangrove forest, for the development or any other financial benefits, would disturb the ideal human-nature balance of this ecosystem. The outcomes of this study also provide an important reference to the land administrators, researchers, and decision-makers to comprehend the expected social-ecological juxtaposition in a protected natural reserve region like the Sundarbans. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CA-Markov; Climate change; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Land use; Sundarbans","Biophysics; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Markov chains; Plants (botany); Waste treatment; CA-Markov; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Land use/ land covers; Net primary productivity; Raw material production; Sundarbans; Valuation of ecosystem services; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079628308

Plants coevolved with microbial symbionts, which are involved in major functions both at the ecosystem and plant level. The use of microbial biostimulants, by exploiting this symbiotic interaction, represents a sustainable strategy to increase plant performances and productivity, even under stresses due to climate changes. Microbial biostimulants include beneficial fungi, yeasts and eubacteria sharing the ability to improve plant nutrition, growth, productivity and stress tolerance. This work reports the current knowledge on microbial biostimulants and provides a critical review on their possible use to mitigate the biotic and abiotic stresses caused by climate changes. Currently, available products often provide a general amelioration of cultural conditions, but their action mechanisms are largely undetermined and their effects often unreliable.

For that purpose, a PDMS membrane module was operated for treating the effluent from an AnMBR prototype-plant, which treated urban wastewater (UWW) at ambient temperature. Different transmembrane pressures and liquid flow rates were applied for evaluating methane recovery efficiency. Maximum methane recoveries were achieved when increasing the vacuum pressure and reducing the liquid flow rate, reaching a maximum methane recovery efficiency of around 80% at a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 0.8 bars and a treatment flow rate (QL) of 50 L h−1. The results revealed that the combination of PDMS DMs and AnMBR technology would allow to reduce the energy demand of UWW treatment, achieving net energy productions while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Optimum operation was determined at a TMP of 0.8 bars and a QL of 150 L h−1 when combining energy, environmental and economic targets. Under these operating conditions, the combination AnMBR + DM resulted in energy requirements and greenhouse gases emissions of −0.040 kWh and 0.113 kg of CO2-eq per m3 of treated water, respectively, resulting in a DM payback period of around 10.5 years. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR); Greenhouse gas (GHG); Methane recovery; PDMS degassing Membrane; Urban wastewater","Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Degassing; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Liquid methane; Membranes; Methane; Microchannels; Recovery; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Energy requirements; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gases emissions; Methane recovery; Operating condition; Transmembrane pressures; Urban wastewater; Effluents; carbon dioxide; dimeticone; methane; Article; artificial membrane; carbon footprint; effluent; energy conversion; energy yield; environmental temperature; flow rate; gas flow; liquid; priority journal; scale up; urban area; vacuum; waste water; waste water treatment plant; Degassing; Effluents; Greenhouse Gases; Membranes; Methane; Recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082410837

The reaction of the emitted precursors (mostly methane and nitrogen oxides) with solar radiation contribute to O3 levels that exceed established thresholds for crop damage. This paper shows current and projected (up to 2080) relative yield losses (RYLs) driven by O3 exposure for different crops and the associated economic damages applying dynamic crop production and prices that are calculated per region and period. We adjust future crop yields in the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to reflect the RYLs and analyze the effects on agricultural markets. We find that the changes (generally reductions) in O3 precursor emissions in a reference scenario would reduce the agricultural damages, compared to present, for most of the regions, with a few exceptions including India, where higher future O3 concentrations have large negative impacts on crop yields. The annual economic impact of O3 driven losses from 2010 to 2080 are, in billion US dollars at 2015 prices ($B), 5.0–6.0, 9.8–18.8, 6.7–10.6 and 10.4–12.5 for corn, soybeans, rice and wheat, respectively, with the large losses for wheat and soybeans driven by their comparatively high responses to O3. When O3 effects are explicitly modelled as exogenous yield shocks in future periods, there is a direct impact in future agricultural markets. Therefore, the aggregated net present value (NPV) of crop production would be reduced around by $90.8 B at a global level. However, these changes are not distributed evenly across regions, and the net present market value of the crops would increase by up to $118.2 B (India) or decrease by up to $59.2 B (China). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural systems; Integrated assessment; Ozone; Yield damages","Agricultural robots; Commerce; Costs; Cultivation; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Agricultural markets; Agricultural system; Assessment models; Concentration levels; Crop production; Economic damages; Economic impacts; Net present value; Crops; ozone; agricultural application; concentration (composition); crop yield; economic impact; future prospect; pollution effect; pollution exposure; soybean; wheat; Africa; agricultural land; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; Canada; China; concentration (parameter); crop production; environmental economics; environmental exposure; food insecurity; futurology; harvest; India; land use; maize; Middle East; priority journal; rice; solar radiation; Southeast Asia; soybean; United States; wheat; China; India; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083721189

On Earth, ocean dynamics are a primary means of heat and nutrient distribution. Continents are a critical source of nutrients, strongly influence ocean dynamics, and participate in climate regulation. In this work, we investigate how the size of a substellar land mass affects the oceans ability to transport heat and upwell nutrients on the tidally locked planet Proxima Centauri b using the ROCKE-3D coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (GCM). We find that dayside ice-free ocean and nutrient delivery to the mixed layer via upwelling are maintained across all continent sizes. We also find that Proxima Centauri b's climate is more sensitive to differences among atmospheric GCMs than to the inclusion of ocean dynamics in ROCKE-3D. Finally, we find that Proxima Centauri b transitions from a ""lobster"" state where ocean heat transport distributes heat away from the substellar point to an ""eyeball"" state where heat transport is restricted and surface temperature decreases symmetrically from the substellar point when the continent size exceeds ∼20% of the surface area. Our work suggests that both a dynamic ocean and continents are unlikely to decrease the habitability prospects of nearby tidally locked targets like Proxima Centauri b that could be investigated with future observations by the James Webb Space Telescope. © 2020 The American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086929979

Sustainable fuels, e.g., emulsified biofuel, have demonstrated promise in reducing emissions and greenhouse gases. The aim of this project is to investigate the stability of a water in oil emulsion using sunflower oil. The primary objective is to achieve an emulsion which is stable for at least 4 days, and the secondary objective is to investigate how altering the emulsification parameter values of the surfactant hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), energy density and sonotrode depth in an ultrasonication procedure can impact the stability. The stability of each emulsion was measured over a period of 14 days. The main outcome is that two of the 14 emulsions made remained stable for at least 14 days using a surfactant HLB of five, which proved to be the optimum value from those tested. The results also show that, by using the sonotrode in a higher starting position, emulsions achieved a greater stability. Furthermore, over-processing of the emulsion was determined, with the point of over-processing lying between an energy density of 75 and 200 W.s/mL. © 2020 by the authors.

To understand the potential impact of climate and land use changes on regional terrestrial water balance has become crucial for ensuring appropriate water management strategies for adaptation and mitigation purposes. In this study we employ an RCP-SSP (Representative Concentration Pathways—Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenario framework (1.5 and 2°C warming scenarios and SSP1–5) to explore the relative impacts of projected twenty-first century climate and land use changes on the surface hydrology of the Ganga river basin. By statistically comparing the hydrological responses of each combination of socioeconomic and climate mitigation pathways against a control scenario, we distinguish between the impacts of each scenario. We also analyze our data in a conceptual framework to understand how climatic and land use factors impact the basin characteristics and which one among them is projected to be the dominant factor in our study region. Our results show that, in terms of hydrologic impact assessment, climate change mitigation pathways are the dominant factor and the land use changes associated with socio-economic pathways contribute little to the projected future changes.

Among these are financially distressed cities and neighborhoods that are facing enormous challenges without the scientific and technical capacity for planning and mitigation. The city of Camden is one of those economically distressed areas with a predominantly minority population, a high unemployment rate, high poverty rates, and poor air quality (PM2.5 and ozone), and it remains vulnerable to heat events. This paper focuses on studying a coupled effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and Ozone-PM2.5 pollution at the neighborhood-scale in the city of Camden, using fine scale remotely sensed land-surface temperature and air quality data from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modelling System in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platform. To assess the impact of urban microclimate on the city of Camden, NJ, residents' health, we identified several environmental and social parameters as the root causes of vulnerability imposed by extreme-heat and poor air quality. Vulnerability in terms of environment and social wellbeing was spatially quantified as two conceptual vulnerability-index models (i.e., environmental vulnerability index (EVI) and a social vulnerability index (SVI)) using multiple linear regression algorithm. Factors such as remotely sensed earth surface properties, built-environment components, air quality, and socio-economic data were incorporated in a holistic geographic approach to quantify the combined effect. Surface temperature gradient and Proportional Vegetation (Pv) generated from 30 m resolution Landsat 8 were sampled along with other variables in the city of Camden, NJ. Models incorporating Pv suggest better fit than models with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Water fraction (33.5%,32.4%), percentage imperviousness (32.5%, 32%), Pv (20.5%, 19.6%), and digital elevation model (DEM) (9%, 8%) have the highest contributions in both models. Two output maps identified the vulnerable neighborhoods in the city through comprehensive GIS analysis: Lanning Square, Bergen Square, Central Waterfront, Gateway, Liberty Park, and Parkside. This can provide useful information for planners and health officials in targeting areas for future interventions and mitigations. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; CMAQ; Environmental risk; Impact index; Social risk; UHI",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085650695

There are several fast luminescence processes in solid-state materials, which could be good candidates for fast timing applications. The development of new ultrafast silicon photomultipliers with increased vacuum-ultraviolet to ultraviolet (VUV-UV) sensitivity has renewed interest to one of those, cross-luminescence (CL), emitted in the VUV-UV region with subnanosecond decay time. Previous investigations have shown that CL is mostly situated in the VUV region in binary K and Ba compounds, but ternary fluorides with a complex valence band structure can provide ultrafast emissions in UV. According to the band structure calculations for K2SiF6, its complex valence band is composed of the F 2p, Si 2s, and Si 2p states. Transitions between the valence subbands and the outermost K 3p core band may extend CL from the VUV-UV to the visible region. This motivated us to perform spectroscopic study of phase-pure K2SiF6 micropowders with a high degree of crystallinity. The stationary (10 keV) and pulsed (100 keV, δ t 55 ps) electron beams were applied in the studies of relaxation processes of K2SiF6 in the temperature range of 77-300 K. At 300 K, the dynamics of ultrafast processes was studied at the FemtoMAX beamline (MAX IV Lab) providing 10-keV X-ray pulses of 100-fs duration. As a result, we revealed multiple CL bands extending from 9 to 4 eV. A nonexponential decay in the subnanosecond time range was revealed for the CL bands at 4.5 and 5.25 eV under both pulsed electron-beam and X-ray excitations. This opens prospects for a band structure engineering approach in developing new ultrafast scintillators with intrinsic emissions. This approach is based on a targeted modification of material composition to influence the density of states in complex valence bands and to provide a favorable shift of CL to lower energies. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Cross-luminescence (CL); pulsed cathodoluminescence; ternary hexafluorides; time-resolved luminescence; ultrafast decay; ultrafast scintillators","Barium compounds; Crystallinity; Electron beams; Fluorine compounds; Ionization; Luminescence; Medical imaging; Positron emission tomography; Relaxation processes; Scintillation counters; Silicon compounds; Spectroscopic analysis; Valence bands; X rays; Band structure calculation; Band structure engineering; Degree of crystallinity; Modification of materials; Pulsed electron beams; Silicon photomultiplier; Solid-state materials; Spectroscopic studies; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087153847

A radical change in the behavior of humanity is thus needed urgently. One of the major challenges is to replace our current energy systems with sustainable systems in the face of environmental degradation. For this purpose, and as part of the European initiatives, the Covenant of Mayors is enabling municipalities, cities and regions to carry out actions in the fields of energy and climate. In this framework, a newly-developed tool, the SECAP-SSP or Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan-Self Sufficient Program, is applied by the Municipality of Hammana-Lebanon (standard process) in order to design its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) and ensure compliance with the Covenant of Mayors. This case study has resulted in a broad understanding of how to use this tool, or even to show that SECAP-SSP has greatly simplified the task compared to the conventional tools that have been used before. It should be noted that SECAP-SSP can be applied by any municipality in Lebanon and can be extended to suit the South-Mediterranean context. Every authority could create its 'SECAP' space online. The various human activities in all sectors (residential, tertiary, industry, transportation, agriculture, electricity generation, etc.) involving energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions are the specific data that the user must enter. The structure of the software facilitates the work to be done in each sector. Other data on climate, the availability of renewable energy and the current price of fossil fuels are provided by the tool. Indicators (economic, environmental and potential) to achieve optimization are calculated by the tool. In the end, SECAP-SSP established a Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) for the authority as well as it suggested the SECAP, feasible and profitable both economically and environmentally. © 2020 IEEE.","Covenant of mayors; Emission inventory; Greenhouse gases reduction; Mitigation; Sustainable energy and climate action plan","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Developing countries; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Electricity generation; Emission inventories; European initiatives; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Human activities; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Sustainable systems; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091966838

The spin state of the condensate is reflected in polarization of the exciton-polariton emission, with temporal fluctuations of this polarization being, in general, capable of reflecting quantum statistics of polaritons in the condensate. To study the polarization properties of optically trapped polariton condensates, we take advantage of the spin noise spectroscopy technique. The ratio between the noise of ellipticity of the condensate emission and its polarization plane rotation noise is found to be dependent, in a nontrivial way, on the intensity of continuous wave nonresonant laser pumping. We show that the interplay between the ellipticity and the rotation noise can be explained in terms of the competition between the self-induced Larmor precession of the condensate pseudospin and the static polarization anisotropy of the microcavity. © 2020 authors.

This so-called superparameterisation acts as a replacement for the convection parameterisation and large-scale cloud scheme. The concept of embedding a cloud-resolving model (CRM) inside of each grid box of a general circulation model leads to an explicit representation of cloud dynamics. The new model component is evaluated against observations and the conventional usage of EMAC using a convection parameterisation. In particular, effects of applying different configurations of the superparameterisation are analysed in a systematical way. Consequences of changing the CRM's orientation, cell size and number of cells range from regional differences in cloud amount up to global impacts on precipitation distribution and its variability. For some edge case setups, the analysed climate state of superparameterised simulations even deteriorates from the mean observed energy budget. In the current model configuration, different climate regimes can be formed that are mainly driven by some of the parameters of the CRM. Presently, the simulated total cloud cover is at the lower edge of the CMIP5 model ensemble. However, certain ""tuning"" of the current model configuration could improve the slightly underestimated cloud cover, which will result in a shift of the simulated climate. The simulation results show that especially tropical precipitation is better represented with the superparameterisation in the EMAC model configuration. Furthermore, the diurnal cycle of precipitation is heavily affected by the choice of the CRM parameters. However, despite an improvement of the representation of the continental diurnal cycle in some configurations, other parameter choices result in a deterioration compared to the reference simulation using a conventional convection parameterisation. The ability of the superparameterisation to represent latent and sensible heat flux climatology is independent of the chosen CRM setup. Evaluation of in-atmosphere cloud amounts depending on the chosen CRM setup shows that cloud development can significantly be influenced on the large scale using a too-small CRM domain size. Therefore, a careful selection of the CRM setup is recommended using 32 or more CRM cells to compensate for computational expenses. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Nowadays, social ecological innovation has envisaged a new prominent business model focusing on social and environmental goals to achieve sustainable development. The intent of this paper is to propose the community garden framework as a social and ecological innovation tool in order to boost sustainable development in urban areas as well as rural areas. For this purpose, an empirical analysis based on a structured interview was conducted in the area of Naples on a sample of 150 gardeners. The results of the interviews have been aggregated by using a variance and correlation analysis in order to explore to what extent the social and environmental dimensions are linked to the community gardens and to identify a pattern between community gardens and social ecological innovation. Two attributes of community gardens, that is, urbanization effects mitigation and wellness and community, were identified as having the ability to influence other community garden attributes.

This perception is dependent on a number of influencing factors, called drivers, in ways that are still not clearly understood. Our study quantifies the relative strength of drivers of climate change perception, taking into account differences in the social, political, geographical, economic and educational identities of any considered community. In addition to investigating the direct influence of the main drivers on climate change perception, we particularly examine the interactions among drivers, identifying in this way indirect pathways of influence. We find that perceptions are directly influenced by the share of principles and ideals within a community and by the physical experience of weather change. Indirect influences are found to be related to the level of development of a community, to its level of social interaction (i.e. individualistic vs. communitarian), and to the spread of climate change information. A deeper understanding of interactions among drivers should prove especially useful for the design of effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Community; Driver; Influence; Interaction; Perception","article; climate change; controlled study; human; perception; quantitative analysis; social interaction; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083456986

There is, however, limited evidence in research, policies and in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) about the impact of environmental factors on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) for people living in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Important is that 80% of NCDs are taking place in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and linked to a third of the deaths in SSA. The question is, what would these statistics look like if environmental risk factors (e.g., pollution, chemicals) for NCDs, linked to climate change, were prevented and controlled. This article presents a framework for understanding climatic pathways' impacts on climate-sensitive NCDs and achieving the SDGs. It further explains how current global mitigation interventions in high income urban settings, with implied health co-benefits for NCD reduction (i.e., promoting use of less polluting vehicles, bicycles, walking, public transport, green spaces), experience major implementation challenges in SSA cities (i.e., too costly, lack of availability, poor road conditions, gender and cultural norms, security problems). Recommendations are made for applying this framework to control climate change impacts on NCDs and achieving the SDGs in SSA cities. These include, support for more research on the climate - NCD nexus, ensuring health professional training includes sustainable health education, and including a focus on climate change and health in primary and secondary school curricula. Further recommendations for addressing climate-sensitive NCDs and urban environmental health towards achieving and sustaining the SDGs, are linked to promoting climate-sensitive and health policies and governance, as well as controlling the influence of advertising. Lastly, improving communication of research findings for policy makers and the public in a manner for informed policy making, and how to comprehend this information to promote the reduction and prevention of NCDs in urban SSA, is key. © 2018 The Author","Climate change; Climate-sensitive; Health co-benefits; Noncommunicable diseases; Sustainable development goals; Urbanization","Decision making; Environmental protection; Health; Planning; Road vehicles; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Climate-sensitive; Environmental factors; Environmental risk factor; Health co-benefits; Low and middle income countries; Non-communicable disease; Primary and secondary schools; Urbanization; Climate change; climate change; disease control; environmental factor; noncommunicable disease; Sustainable Development Goal; urban population; urbanization; adaptation; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; climate change; diarrhea; disease burden; disease control; health care policy; health education; health practitioner; human; kidney disease; mass communication; non communicable disease; physical disease; prevention study; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; snakebite; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; management; urban health; Sub-Saharan Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Health Policy; Humans; Noncommunicable Diseases; Policy Making; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081979808

Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and are therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel cell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize HDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are consistent with current logistic operational requirements. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in transport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE) across different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power system by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an electricity system optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two scenarios – one sizing refueling stations to support the power system and one sizing them independently of it – are assessed regarding their impacts on the total annual electricity system costs, regional RE integration and the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on locational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we find average LCOH of between 4.83 euro/kg and 5.36 euro/kg, for which nodal electricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong difference in LCOH between north and south Germany. Adding HDV-HRS incurs power transmission expansion as well as higher power supply costs as the total power demand increases. From a system perspective, investing in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than independently promises cost savings of around seven billion euros per annum. We therefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is important for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies. © 2020 The Author(s)","Alternative fuel vehicle; Electricity system modeling; Fuel cell; Heavy-duty vehicles; Hydrogen refueling network; Optimization; Sector coupling","Costs; Economics; Electric power systems; Expansion; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Investments; Vehicles; Electricity prices; Heavy duty vehicles; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen technologies; Integration of renewable energies; Investment planning; Locational marginal pricing; Operational requirements; Electric power system planning; alternative fuel; electric vehicle; energy planning; future prospect; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; transportation planning; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085078300

This study compares trends in environmental sustainability indicators worldwide, Portugal, Brazil and two universities in these countries. The data collection is done based on findings from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) between 2007 and 2017, and reports from both universities between 2010 and 2018. As a result, it can be seen that global Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased (10.6 to 9 ton/capita). Portugal also reduced its CO2 till 2014 (5.2 to 4.6 ton/capita) but experienced a raise in its rates in the following years. Brazil experienced a growth in its CO2 (1.7 to 2 ton/capita), as did the Portuguese university (0.85 to 0.87ton/alumnus). World municipal waste decreased (541.8 to 524.4 kg/capita), as well as in Portugal until 2013 (513.7 to 436.7 kg/capita), but in the following years increased. Similarly, Brazil reduced the indexes until 2011 (271.9 to 266.8 kg/capita) and increased in 2012. In the Portuguese university, the rates increased until 2014 (4.02 to 9.02 kg/student) and reduced in 2015, as in the Brazilian university that increased until 2018 (19.53 to 25.08kg/student). Portugal, Brazil, and the two universities pointed out a trend of increasing emissions and waste while the world data a reduction. The Brazilian university had higher municipal waste rates than Portugal. The consumption of water and energy in the Portuguese university decreased while it increased the Brazilian university.

Changing climatic conditions further compound the losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. The state of Florida is known for its biodiversity but has experienced declines in species populations and habitats because of urbanization and sea level rise. Because Florida benefits from a multibillion-dollar income from natural resources tourism, these declines challenge the state’s economy. In this study, we assessed the potential future impacts of urbanization and sea level rise on a suite of conservation targets that have been set for the state. We developed six scenarios of all combinations of intermediate and high sea level rise paired with two types of urbanization, sprawling and compact, in both 2040 and 2070 to examine the potential future threats to conservation targets in High Pine and Scrub, Coastal Uplands, and Freshwater Aquatics ecosystems. Our results show projected decreases in extent and area of these priority ecosystems into the future. Under Florida’s current trends in urbanization practices, projections indicate a greater impact on conservation targets than if sprawl reduction practices are implemented. Projections indicate that Coastal Uplands will experience the greatest loss in area, at up to 47%. Conservation-focused urban planning and climate adaptation strategies can help protect Florida’s natural resources with benefits to Florida’s tourism economy as well as critical ecosystem functions and services such as coastal flood protection and storm surge risk reduction. © 2020 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Their societal role shifted from the support of the traditional agrarian system in the past, to a variety of situations nowadays. The intrinsic characteristics of these social-ecological units make them a promising opportunity for rural development in the region that calls for more scientific attention on the arena of ecosystem services. In this study, we investigated the social perception and valuation of a comprehensive range of ecosystem services and disservices on the peri-urban communal forests of Mount Xalo (NW Spain), distinguishing among the perspectives of landowners and various visitor types. For this, we used a socio-cultural approach consisting of 175 semi-quantitative surveys that included a basic Public Participation Geographic Information System. Our results showed that Mt. Xalo is a well recognised provider of ecosystem services that constitutes a local hotspot in the region. The most frequently perceived and most valued ecosystem services within ecosystem services classes were the provision of drinking water, the practice of sports, climate regulation and a group of three cognitive cultural ecosystem services: socializing, mythical features and sense of place. Nevertheless, nuances were noticed among landowners and visitor types following a rural–urban gradient where landowners and urban users presented the most significant differences. These findings address recognition to the actual role of these communal forests for society and call for collaboration with public institutions to facilitate the sustainable management of their resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural ecosystem services; Landscape values; Local scale; Participatory mapping; Social-ecological systems; Stakeholder knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082179644

Selective logging and forest conversion to oil palm plantation has major implications for biogeochemical cycling and carbon storage that are underpinned by plant-soil interactions. Soil fungi are key regulators of carbon and mineral nutrient flows between above- and below-ground organisms, yet understanding of fungal community-productivity relationships in hyper-diverse tropical forests is lacking. Recent studies suggest sensitivity of soil fungal communities to land-use change, although impacts on fungal productivity remain largely unresolved. To address this gap, we installed hyphal in-growth bags for 6 months in old-growth (OG) and selectively logged (SL) forest and oil palm plantation (OP) in Bornean lowland rainforest. Mycelial (actively foraging) fungal communities were characterized by ITS amplicon sequencing, and mycelial production estimated by measurement of fungal hyphae. Mycelial fungal community compositions were similar in OG and SL forest, whereas OP had significantly different communities of saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi. In particular, total mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal relative abundances, total mycorrhizal richness and mycelial production was reduced. However, due to restricted sampling replication in OP, effects associated with site could not be excluded. In forest plots (OG & SL), we further explored the broader drivers of mycelial fungal communities using tree community, structure and productivity data, and soil and environmental properties. Forest mycelial community dissimilarities were related to soil and vegetation characteristics, while mycelial production was broadly independent of these as well as fungal community attributes. An increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal relative abundance was also found with selective logging, which may have implications for carbon storage capacity in these forests, while an apparent retention of mycorrhizal mycelium in SL forest may act as a reservoir of inoculum that could aid forest restoration. Our results show that conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation has significant consequences for fungal diversity-productivity relationships with implications for nutrient and carbon dynamics and restoration over large spatial scales. © Copyright © 2020 Robinson, Elias, Johnson, Both, Riutta, Goodall, Majalap, McNamara, Griffiths and Ostle.","arbuscular; ectomycorrhizal; hyphae; inorganic P; ITS; mycorrhiza; oil palm; selective logging",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100831667

Each component has a different method for assessing and measuring the magnitude of its impact. The aim of the study is to obtain quantitative methods to assess the magnitude of the impact of forest and land fires on the atmospheric environment so that they can be used for the valuation of environmental losses. The magnitude of the impact of the air quality component is measured based on the Air Pollution Index (ISPU) and visibility, the component of the greenhouse gas is assessed by approaching the amount of GHG emissions and / or loss of carbon stocks, while changes in the microclimate by assessing changes in the level of thermal comfort. Gas and particulate emissions values of forest and land fires use the carbon mass balance approach and emission factors. Analysis of air pollution dispersion is conducted use the Gaussian model, with case study is the incidence of land fires in oil palm plantations located in Kayuagung sub-district, Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, South Sumatra Province in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

The results of the assessment show that land fires covering 551 ha in 2015, 59 ha in 2016 and 253 ha in 2018 have resulted in changes in the air pollutant standard index in Kayuagung from the medium category (ISPU PM10 = 75) to very unhealthy (ISPU PM10 = 272) in 2015, unhealthy (ISPU CO = 116) in 2016 and very unhealthy (ISPU CO = 205) in 2018. Visibility in an area of about 500-600 meters in the direction of the wind from the fire's location was less than 1 km with PM10 of more than 176 µg m-3. The contribution of GHGs to each fire's year is 26.8, 2.8 and 12.3 kilo tons of CO2e consist of CO2 and CH4.

In the policy issue of environmental justice, Presidents Clinton and Obama used executive orders in an attempt to remedy some of the latent problems for minority and low-income populations, most notably, the regulation of carbon dioxide and methane. The coal industry lobbied candidate Trump who promised to rollback the regulations that affected that industry. This research investigates the executive orders issued in the Trump administration, presents a discussion of administrative rulemaking and federalism, and assesses the status of the executive orders to date. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","administrative process; climate change; executive orders; rollback; rulemaking","carbon dioxide; climate change; coal industry; emission control; environmental justice; environmental legislation; environmental risk; low income population; methane; political discourse; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086787393

In recent studies, models of competitive interactions failed predictive tests, thereby casting doubt on results of many past studies. We believe these model failures owe at least partly to heterogeneity in unmodeled factors (e.g., nutrients, soil pathogens) that affect both target plants and neighboring competitors. Such heterogeneity is ubiquitous, and models that do not account for it will suffer omitted variable bias. We used instrumental variables analysis to test for and correct omitted variable bias in studies that followed common protocols for measuring plant competition. In an observational study, omitted variables caused competition to seem like mutualism. In a quasi-experiment that partially controlled competitor abundances with seeding, omitted variables caused competition to seem about 35% weaker than it really was, even though the experiment occurred in an abandoned agricultural field where environmental heterogeneity was expected to be relatively low. Despite decades of research, consistently accurate estimates of competitive interactions remain elusive. The most foolproof way around this problem is true experiments that avoid omitted variable bias by completely controlling competitor abundances, but such experiments are rare. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","coexistence; competition; density dependence; instrumental variables analysis; intraspecific and interspecific interactions; model; plant interactions; population and community dynamics","climate change; coexistence; community response; ecological modeling; environmental factor; heterogeneity; interspecific interaction; invasive species; mutualism; plant community; ecosystem; plant; soil; Ecosystem; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082777242

In spite of major advancements in air pollution control systems and emission regulations, emissions of trace metals (TMs) (As, Cd, Cu, Ga, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, W, Zn) and rare earth elements (REEs) (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Yb) may occur. Here, leaves, wood, forest floor, and A horizons in urban forests were assessed to determine if TM and REE concentrations show enrichment near MSWI relative to other urban areas for three cities in the northeastern USA. Vegetation and soil concentrations measured were generally comparable to concentrations observed in previous studies in non-urban sites. Overall, higher TM and REE in forest floor, A horizons, leaves, and wood were not observed consistently for MSWI sites when compared to city sites. Although pooled forest floor Ni and V and A horizon La and Nd concentrations were significantly different, they were not consistent but driven by a large difference at one of the three cities. This indirect study suggests air pollution control systems have prevented or have reduced TM and REE emissions to local urban forests to negligible amounts. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential interferences from other urban air pollution sources, and conduct direct emission measurements to validate MSWIs are not emitting TMs and REEs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forest soils; Heavy metal pollution; Industrial land use; Toxic metals; Urban soils","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); forest floor; incineration; municipal solid waste; pollution control; rare earth element; trace metal; urban area; World Bank; United States; heavy metal; lanthanide; city; environmental monitoring; forest; incineration; soil pollutant; solid waste; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Incineration; Metals, Heavy; Metals, Rare Earth; Soil Pollutants; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083803772

The proportion of pasture on diets may affect all these factors, mainly in subtropical climate zones, where cows may access tropical and temperate pastures during warm and cold seasons, respectively. The aim of the study was to assess the C footprint of a dairy system with annual tropical and temperate pastures in a subtropical region. The system boundary included all processes up to the animal farm gate. Feed requirement during the entire life of each cow was based on data recorded from Holstein × Jersey cow herds producing an average of 7,000 kg ECM lactation-1. The milk production response as consequence of feed strategies (scenarios) was based on results from two experiments (warm and cold seasons) using lactating cows from the same herd. Three scenarios were evaluated: total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum intake, 75, and 50% of ad libitum TMR intake with access to grazing either a tropical or temperate pasture during lactation periods. Considering IPCC and international literature values to estimate emissions from urine/dung, feed production and electricity, the C footprint was similar between scenarios, averaging 1.06 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1. Considering factors from studies conducted in subtropical conditions and actual inputs for on-farm feed production, the C footprint decreased 0.04 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 in scenarios including pastures compared to ad libitum TMR. Regardless of factors considered, emissions from feed production decreased as the proportion of pasture went up. In conclusion, decreasing TMR intake and including pastures in dairy cow diets in subtropical conditions have the potential to maintain or reduce the C footprint to a small extent. © Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We investigated the effects of grazing intensities and nitrogen application to black oats pasture (Avena strigosa) on carbon and nitrogen additions, mainly by roots, into soil. Methods: The ICL experiment in southern Brazil comprised no, moderate and intensive grazing of black oats pasture receiving 0, 75 and 150 kg N ha−1. Root (0–30 cm) and aboveground biomass of black oats were assessed over two years, in a sequence of maize (Zea mays)–black oats–soybean (Glycine max)–black oats. Results: Moderate grazing did not change the carbon and nitrogen additions by roots, but reduced the aboveground additions by 45–54%, compared to no grazing. Generally, the intensive grazing did not affect root or aboveground additions relative to moderate grazing, but in year of normal precipitation and supplied with 150 kg N ha−1, it reduced root carbon and nitrogen addition by 11–22%. Nitrogen application had no clear effect on root additions, but increased the aboveground additions. Conclusions: In ICL system, moderate grazing maintained carbon and nitrogen additions by roots of black oats, compared to no grazing, while nitrogen fertilization can be used to increase carbon and nitrogen aboveground additions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Annual C3 grasses; Cover crop grazing; Dung; Precipitation; Residual biomass; Subtropics","aboveground biomass; grazing; integrated approach; maize; mixed farming; pasture; root system; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; subtropical region; Brazil; Avena strigosa; Glycine max; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084305071

This paper introduces a novel methodology for the development of integrated thermal, power and mobility 5th generation (5G) smart energy networks. The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting flexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artificial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15–25 °C as a so-called ‘ambient loop’ system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network. The system also integrates thermal and electrical storage to create additional flexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management. A smart management system flexibly controls individual assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles in response to price signals reflecting the intermittency of renewable energy sources on the electricity grid. The ambient district thermal loop will distribute low carbon energy to a range of end users. Results presented in this paper provide an understanding of capital costs associated with integrated smart energy systems and the relative performance of individual technologies in a complex system using a techno-economic modelling approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the implementation of the 5G concept results in lower energy costs to consumers while at the same time transforming a large existing urban area to a near zero-carbon energy system in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and transport. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated; Mobility; Networks; Power; Smart; Thermal","Air quality; Carbon; Costs; Digital storage; Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Waste heat; Additional flexibilities; Electricity demands; Individual technology; Low carbon energies; Relative performance; Renewable energy source; Secondary energy sources; Smart energy systems; 5G mobile communication systems; air quality; artificial intelligence; building; cooling; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy storage; heating; performance assessment; pumping; smart grid; thermal power; London",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083893089

This observational clinical study compared morphologic and functional changes of cones after vitrectomy for macula-off retinal detachment. Design: Prospective, fellow-eye comparative case series. Methods: STUDY POPULATION: Five eyes after vitrectomy with gas for macula-off retinal detachment (retinal detachment eyes, RDE) and 5 healthy fellow eyes (HFE) of 5 patients (mean age 59.8 years, macula-off duration 0.5 days to 5.5 days). OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Eyes were examined with adaptive-optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT), spectral-domain OCT (SDOCT), and microperimetry (MP) at 6 (baseline, BL) and 56 weeks (follow-up, FUP) after 23 gauge pars plana vitrectomy and SF6 gas tamponade. Eight corresponding regions at foveal eccentricities of 2.5° (ecc 2.5°) and 6.5° (ecc 6.5°) were analyzed in every eye. AO-OCT en face images and SD-OCT B-scans were graded regarding irregularity and loss of photoreceptor signals ranging from none to severe changes. The number of detectable cones at height of the inner-outer segment junction (IS/OS) and cone outer segment tips (COST) was counted manually in AO-OCT images. MP with a custom grid was used to assess retinal sensitivity at these locations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cone density, cone pattern regularity and signal attenuation, retinal sensitivity. Results: In comparison to HFE, RDE showed highly irregular cone patterns in AO-OCT and irregular outer retinal bands in SDOCT. Despite significant improvement of cone pattern regularity compared to BL (P &lt; .001), 63% of AO images showed remaining cone pattern irregularity and 45.5% of SDOCT B-scans showed severe signal reduction at FUP. In HFE, mean cone density retrieved from IS/OS and COST remained around 20,000/mm2 (ecc 2.5°) and 16,000/mm2 (ecc 6.5°) at BL and FUP. Cone density of RDE was significantly reduced and ranged between 200/mm2 and 15,600/mm2 (P &lt; .001) at BL. Despite improvement at FUP (P &lt; .001), mean cone density at IS/OS and COST was still lower compared to HFE and ranged between 7790 and 9555 cones/mm2 (P &lt; .001). Mean retinal sensitivity of all measured locations remained 18 dB in HFE and was significantly lower in RDE, with 14.30 dB at BL and 14.64 dB at FUP. Both SDOCT grading and microperimetry sensitivity showed strong correlation with AO-OCT grading and cone density (rho values &gt; 0.750). Conclusions: The combination of AO-OCT, SDOCT, and microperimetry is a powerful tool to capture cone regeneration after vitreoretinal surgery. Our study shows that cone morphology and function improve within 56 weeks after RD surgery but structural and functional impairment is still present. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; aged; Article; attenuation; B scan; clinical article; clinical feature; disease severity; female; functional assessment; human; male; microperimetry; morphology; observational study; outcome assessment; pars plana vitrectomy; perimetry; photoreceptor; photoreceptor outer segment; priority journal; retina detachment; retina maculopathy; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; cell count; diagnostic imaging; endotamponade; eye axis length; follow up; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; optics; pathophysiology; physiology; prospective study; retina cone; retina detachment; visual acuity; visual field; vitrectomy; Aged; Axial Length, Eye; Cell Count; Endotamponade; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Optics and Photonics; Prospective Studies; Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells; Retinal Detachment; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Visual Field Tests; Visual Fields; Vitrectomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082849463

We examined how qualitative network models (QNMs) can be deployed to support decision making when data, time, and funding limitations restrict use of more demanding quantitative methods. We used QNMs to evaluate management interventions intended to promote the rebuilding of a collapsed stock of blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus) (BKC) around the Pribilof Islands (eastern Bering Sea) to determine how their potential efficacy may change under climate change. Based on stakeholder input and a literature review, we constructed a QNM that described the life cycle of BKC, key ecological interactions, potential climate-change impacts, relative interaction strengths, and uncertainty in terms of interaction strengths and link presence. We performed sensitivity analyses to identify key sources of prediction uncertainty. Under a scenario of no climate change, predicted increases in BKC were reliable only when stock enhancement was implemented in a BKC hatchery-program scenario. However, when climate change was accounted for, the intervention could not counteract its adverse impacts, which had an overall negative effect on BKC. The remaining management scenarios related to changes in fishing effort on BKC predators. For those scenarios, BKC outcomes were unreliable, but climate change further decreased the probability of observing recovery. Including information on relative interaction strengths increased the likelihood of predicting positive outcomes for BKC approximately 5–50% under the management scenarios. The largest gains in prediction precision will be made by reducing uncertainty associated with ecological interactions between adult BKC and red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus).

Achieving this goal necessitates governing city air quality at large scale. However, the lack of interconnection among air quality modelling, multi-source data, pollution diagnosis and control actions impedes scalable and efficient governance of city air pollution. Here we present a design of digital governance to make full use of science and information techniques, so that information and decisions can be well generated and processed to form scientific prevention and control against heavy city air pollution. We implement the desired interconnection based on open-architecture big atmospheric environmental data system, which supports digitizing the workflow and dataflow of governance practices. Through the network of digital governance, those cities with limited resources and capacities can henceforth access data and expertise, such as model-based air quality forecast and data-based mitigation actions, to realize regional joint prevention and control of heavy air pollution. With a demonstration case for the Wuhan city in China using the Nested Grid Air Quality Prediction Modelling System (NAQPMS) developed by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, we show how our design of digital governance would empower scientific control of heavy city air pollution and help achieving the SDG goal 11. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Computer architecture; Geophysics; Quality control; Sustainable development; Air quality forecasts; Air quality modelling; Air quality prediction; Atmospheric physics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Environmental data; Information techniques; Prevention and controls; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086230553

In this study, a multiproxy peat record with high-resolution from Sichanghu in the northern Tianshan was used to document the changes in vegetation and climate over the past 450 years in the arid Central Asia. The pollen, grain size, and loss on ignition (LOI) records indicate that the productivity of local peat began to increase at ∼1730 AD. The vegetation in the Sichanghu area experienced several transitions, from temperate desert to dense desert, marsh meadow, and steppe desert vegetation. The climate in the study area was extremely dry during the early stages of the Little Ice Age (LIA) (before 1730 AD) and relatively wet during the late stages (1730–1880 AD). The inferred changes in the moisture conditions of the Sichanghu peatland since the LIA may have been controlled by the extent of Arctic sea ice, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Siberian High via the connections of large-scale atmospheric circulations such as the Westerlies. © 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","arid Central Asia; Little Ice Age; moisture condition; pollen; Tianshan; vegetation change","arid region; atmospheric circulation; climate variation; Little Ice Age; moisture content; North Atlantic Oscillation; paleoclimate; pollen; sea ice; semiarid region; vegetation dynamics; westerly; China; Tien Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077036680

Besides the structural advantage of 2D nanosheets, the electronic structure change of bimetallic FeNi phosphides via modulating Fe/Ni ratio is another reason responded for the exceptional activities with reduced overpotentials of this hybridized catalyst for both hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions.

In the present study, the effect of tropical and extra-tropical climate modes such as Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on wind-wave climate of the Indian Ocean (IO) is studied using multiple linear regression of individual climate indices on relevant wind-wave parameters. There are two regions of importance for swell generation in the Indian Ocean - a region between 40° and 60° S in the Southern Ocean (SO) and another region in the Eastern Tropical Indian Ocean (ETIO; 10°–30° S, 60°–100 °E). SAM, the strongest inter-annual mode of the SO, generates swells in the 40°–60°S band throughout the year that eventually propagates to the entire North IO. Both the positive and negative phases of SAM generate swells from SO, but it’s genesis region vary meridionally depending on the phase of SAM. The positive phase of ENSO (LaNiña) generally reduce the westerly wind anomalies in the SO caused by a positive phase of SAM and hence reduce the swell generation from SO, but causes stronger south-easterlies in the ETIO, generating more swells from there. IOD that peaks in September–October–November period has its effect on swell generation limited to eastern equatorial IO. Our analysis suggests that interannual climate features are important in modulating wind-wave climate of IO and a basin-wide model set-up with an accurate representation of various interannual climate features is a prerequisite for accurate wave forecast. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ENSO; Indian Ocean; IOD; Multiple linear regression; SAM; Wave climate","air-sea interaction; annual variation; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; extratropical environment; multiple regression; ocean wave; surface wave; tropical region; wave field; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085136513

To do so, individuals must track resources along two main non-exclusive axes: time (rescheduling the breeding timing) and space (i.e., shifting their range). While the vast majority of studies have focused on the study of specific populations inhabiting small and homogeneous environments, little is known about the response of species across large regions with highly heterogeneous topographies. Here, we studied roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), an income breeder that has demonstrated a lack of phenotypic plasticity on birth timing in a densely forested lowland area, and evaluated its ability to track resources along a wide elevational gradient (288–2366 m a.s.l.). We used data from 8986 parturition events collected in Switzerland during the period 1971–2015. We hypothesize that the mismatch between roe deer parturition dates and peak resource availability will increase over the study period. In addition, we expect this mismatch to be larger in low areas compared to higher elevation areas. Contrary to previous studies, we did find a consistent, but small, trend toward more advance parturition dates through time across all elevations. However, this rate of advance was less than that of the plant phenology indicators, resulting in an increasing mismatch at all elevations. Parturition dates changed on average at a rate between 7.5 times slower than the growing season start and 5 times slower than the flowering start. Thus, at the lowest elevations, parturition timing has already fallen outside the optimal time window for high-quality forage, while at high elevations, parturitions are still synchronized with the peak availability of quality forage. Our study emphasizes the need for large-scale study designs along climatic gradients to help understand the complex relationships that shape adaptation across environments. This would allow for better understanding of how populations will respond to the new environmental conditions imposed by climate change. © 2020 The Authors.","adaptation; birth timing; Capreolus capreolus; elevation; Europe; herbivory; migration; phenology; plasticity; reproduction; roe deer; ungulates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087710845

This is, perhaps, a recently-introduced building concept that is increasingly gaining attention due to the policies and strategies intended to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional buildings, which nowadays represent a large portion of the global energy consumption and C02 emissions. This study provides a systematic literature review of the existing body of knowledge of research related to Green Buildings in the arctic region. Despite numerous studies and projects developed during the last decades, a study describing the current research for this specific region is still missing. Starting from the definition of Green Building and Arctic Region, an examination is made of research approaches developed to achieve the required green building standards, for which rating tools currently in use for their evaluation are also identified. The result is a critical analysis highlighting benefits and critical issues of Green Buildings located in the Arctic in comparison with conventional buildings, focusing on the environmental, economic and social dimensions.

For this reason, the current discourse in disaster risk reduction (DRR) has been experiencing a shift toward a vulnerability-led paradigm, raising new questions about how to address (i) the complexity of vulnerabilities to multiple hazards, (ii) their cultural, dynamic, and subjective character, and (iii) the effectiveness and legitimacy of vulnerability assessments as decision-support tools. In this paper, we present a review of 707 vulnerability studies (derived from the Clarivate WoS database; 1988-2018) with a particular focus on urban settings and spatially explicit assessments in order to evaluate current efforts to meet the aforementioned issues. The reviewed studies assessed vulnerabilities to 35 hazard types that were predominantly (n=603, 85%) analysed as single hazards (mostly seismic, flood, and groundwater contamination hazards, as well as climate change), whereas only 15% (n=104) of studies focused on multiple hazards (mostly atmospheric hazards). Within the spatially explicit vulnerability studies, almost 60% used data collected by the study itself (mostly seismic hazards), while statistical and combined data were both employed in 20% of cases (mostly floods, climate change, and social and political hazards). Statistical data were found to have only limited transferability, often being generalised to be applicable in small-scale studies, while reducing the role of cultural and contextual factors. Field research data provided high-resolution information, but their acquisition is time-consuming, and therefore fixed at a local scale and single temporal stage. Underlying hazard types and suitable data sources resulting in other differences found a preference towards the specific coverage and resolution of vulnerability maps that appeared in 44% of all reviewed studies. Altogether, the differences we found indicated a division of spatially explicit vulnerability research in two major directions: (i) geological and geomorphological studies focusing on physical vulnerability, using their own data surveys at a detailed scale and lacking links to other hazards, and (ii) other studies (mostly atmospheric hazards and socialpolitical hazards) focusing on social or combined vulnerabilities, using primarily statistical or combined data at a municipal, regional, and country scale with occasional efforts to integrate multiple hazards. Finally, although cartographic representations have become a frequent component of vulnerability studies, our review found only vague rationalisations for the presentation of maps, and a lack of guidelines for the interpretation of uncertainties and the use of maps as decision-support tools. © 2020 Pavel Raška et al.","Disasters; Socio-ecological hazards; Spatial assessment; Urban; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090268321

Such worlds are representative of early Earth, Mars, and Venus and analogous exoplanets. Photodissociation of H2O controls the atmospheric photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH, which dominates the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV; >200 nm) absorption cross sections of H2O play an outsized role in OH production; these cross sections were heretofore unmeasured at habitable temperatures (<373 K). We present the first measurements of NUV H2O absorption at 292 K and show it to absorb orders of magnitude more than previously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross sections, we employ a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and resolve past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these higher cross sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O2, suppressing both by orders of magnitude relative to past predictions and eliminating the low-outgassing ""false-positive""scenario for O2 as a biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases rainout of reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may also suppress CH4 and H2; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants is inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While we focus on CO2-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in general. Overall, our work advances the state of the art of photochemical models by providing crucial new H2O cross sections and resolving past disagreement in the literature and suggests that detection of spectrally active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres may be more challenging than previously considered. © 2020.

Given China's rapid economic development and increasing environmental pollution, this study aims to investigate how environmental decentralization affects China's carbon emissions. Environmental decentralization indicators are reconstructed from the perspective of dynamic changes in the number of staff in environmental protection agencies on the basis of China's 30 provinces from 2005 to 2016. Spatial panel and dynamic threshold models are employed to investigate the impacts of environmental decentralization on carbon emissions. Results indicate that a remarkably positive spatial correlation is found in regional carbon emissions in China, and environmental decentralization has a positive impact on carbon emissions, suggesting that China's current environmental decentralization system may be unconducive to carbon emission control. Taking different environmental decentralization types as threshold variables, results from the dynamic threshold panel model show that environmental administrative decentralization and environmental monitoring decentralization have a positive threshold promoting effect on carbon emissions, whereas environmental supervision decentralization has a negative threshold inhibiting effect on carbon emissions. Therefore, the environmental administrative and monitoring power of local governments must be appropriately reduced and an environmental management mechanism must be developed for joint prevention and control to reduce carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Dynamic threshold panel model; Environmental decentralization; Spatial econometric model","Carbon; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental Protection Agency; Carbon emissions; Environmental decentralization; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental pollutions; Environmental supervision; Panel model; Prevention and controls; Spatial econometric models; Quality control; carbon emission; decentralization; econometrics; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; environmental quality; modeling; spatial analysis; threshold; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; decentralization; econometric model; economic development; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; human; mathematical model; priority journal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081017941

The increased population has not only reduced this treasure but also has affected the global climate at an alarming rate. Among the GHGs, emission of N2O due to agricultural activities is nowadays a global concern. Agricultural industries have increased N2O and CH4 by 17% in the atmosphere since 1990, with an average emanation rate of around 60 MT CO2 equivalents per year. Crop production accounts for approximately 50% of N2O emissions stemming from the farming community and discharges of fertilizer-induced N2O, for the time being estimated by IPCC at 1.24% of the N used ranging from 0.76% (rice) to 2.77% (maize). The concentration of atmospheric N2O has increased (60 ppb) after the industrial revolution, at the pace of 0.73 ppb year−1. Besides, soil structure, temperature, moisture, denitrifying microbial population, pH, C:N ratio, and relief are the factors which significantly enhance the N2O levels into the atmosphere. N2O as a GHG has more potential towards global warming than CO2 and has a very long residence period (115 years) in the atmosphere. N2O emission is nowadays a core issue which needs to be mitigated so as to decline the levels of its production in agricultural soils. However, priority should be given to the organic farming, management of soil chemistry, and phytoremediation to reduce the addition of N2O into the ambient air. Furthermore, deployment of N2O reductase in agricultural soils increases the efficiency of converting N2O to inert N2 which is a valuable strategy to reduce N2O production. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Nitrification; Phytoremediation; Soil enzymes; Synthetic fertilizers","Agricultural robots; Bioremediation; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Agricultural activities; Agricultural industries; Agricultural soils; Farming communities; Global climates; Industrial revolutions; Microbial populations; Phytoremediation; Soils; nitric oxide reductase; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural emission; agricultural soil; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); crop production; emission control; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; black gram; chick pea; concentration (parameter); crop production; denitrification; fertilizer application; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); Macrotyloma; maize; mineralization; mung bean; mustard; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; organic farming; pea; peanut; pearl millet; phytoremediation; pigeonpea; Review; rice; soil acidity; soil management; soil moisture; soil structure; soil temperature; sorghum; soybean; tillage; wheat; agriculture; environmental monitoring; soil; Zea mays; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086575323

Population growth and its increasingly concentration in the cities turn these areas into a major consumer of energy, mainly due to the residential and service sector in order to meet the heating and cooling demand. In this scenario of taking advanced of renewable local resources shallow geothermal energy is presented as a renewable resource that can contribute to meet this demand with high energy and gas emissions savings. In this context, this work shows the art-of-state of the energy transition to a renewable energy society in Spain by means of the use of shallow geothermal energy. It proposes a procedure to transform the current fossil fuel consumption into renewable heating and cooling by the use of Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP).

Location: Oaxaca State, Mexico. Methods: We used a trait-based approach together with climate exposure models to evaluate the vulnerability of rodent species to projected climate conditions in the study region. Vulnerability was estimated based on three factors: (a) Level of climatic exposure that species are projected to experience across their current statewide range; (b) inherent species-specific sensitivity to stochastic events; and (c) species’ capacity to cope with climate change effects. We defined species as inherently sensitive if they had any of the following: restricted geographic distribution in Mexico; narrow altitudinal range; low dispersal ability; or long generation length. Results: Vulnerability varied depending on the climate change scenario applied. Under the MPI general circulation model and current emissions trends, by 2099, all species evaluated were projected to have some level of threat (vulnerable for at least one factor), with 4 out of 55 species vulnerable for all three factors, 29 for two factors, and 22 for one factor. Six out of ten rodent species endemic to Oaxaca were vulnerable for two or more factors. We found that species with narrow and restricted-range distributions combined with low adaptive capacity were projected to be particularly vulnerable. Main conclusions: By including species-specific trait information in climate exposure assessments, researchers can contextualize and enhance their understanding about how climate change is likely to affect individual taxa in an area of interest. As such, studies like this one provide more relevant threat assessment information than exposure analyses alone and serve as a starting point for considering how climatic changes interact with an array of other variables to affect native species across their range. © 2020 The Authors.

The use of alternative and renewable-based technologies is one of the options to achieve the target of sustainable development through the reduction of these harmful emissions. Among different technologies thermally activated cooling systems are one which can reduce the harmful emissions caused by conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technology. Thermal cooling systems utilize different porous materials and work on a reversible adsorption/desorption cycle. Different advancements have been made for this technology but still a lot of work should be done to replace conventional systems with this newly developed technology. High adsorption capacity and lower input heat are two major requirements for efficient thermally driven cooling technologies. In this regard, it is a need of the day to develop novel adsorbents with high sorption capacity and low regeneration temperature. Due to tunable topologies and a highly porous nature, the hybrid porous crystalline materials known as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a great inspiration for thermally driven adsorption-based cooling applications. Keeping all the above-mentioned aspects in mind, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the potential use of MOFs as adsorbent material for adsorption and desiccant cooling technologies. A detailed overview of MOFs, their structure, and their stability are presented. This review will be helpful for the research community to have updated research progress in MOFs and their potential use for adsorption-based cooling systems. © 2020 by the author.

However, despite its importance, seagrasses are not receiving similar attentions with its adjacent ecosystems, the mangroves, and coral reefs. Because of their role in climate change mitigation, seagrasses along with mangroves and salt marshes (the blue carbon ecosystems) are gaining attention recently. This preliminary study investigates the perception of coastal communities in Eastern Samar, Philippines on seagrasses. The results of the survey show that there is a level of high awareness among respondents to seagrass ecosystem services. Despite that, however, utilization remains low. The level of awareness varies on the type of ecosystem service; for instance, locals have a high awareness of provisioning services while low awareness of cultural services. The survey also included the perceived threats to seagrasses, where damages caused by natural disturbances are identified as the most concerning threat. This may be due to the geographic location of the sites that are frequented by typhoons. The perception potentially indicates depleted resources brought about by mismanagement or overlooking this natural resource. The results provide a more contextualized understanding on how local communities are aware of and interacting with, or the lack thereof, seagrass ecosystems.

This is due to in part to its potential role as a cleaner energy source in the emissions-constrained development agenda that is currently being pursued at both global and national levels. Solar PV has also been propelled to the forefront of today's menu of technological options by virtue of its attributes such as scalability, fast deployment lead times, and low operating cost. Substantial investments are needed in the coming years in order to accomplish climate targets and other goals set by various countries and regional/subregional blocs. In support of informed investment decision-making and ultimately, improved outcomes of solar PV projects, there has been an uptick in studies on operational performance of fielded PV systems across the globe. These studies are, however, geographically unbalanced, and there is the need for data from underrepresented regions. This paper presents a synthesis of results obtained from recent seminal field studies on PV module performance degradation in Ghana. The studies altogether analyzed sixty-five (65) modules (mono- and polycrystalline silicon) from twenty-nine (29) installations across the country (1118 module-years). The field-aged modules were characterized in situ using current-voltage (I-V) curves, visual inspection checklists, and thermal imaging.

In this study, the effects of sand mining activities on the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, different N-removal processes (Feammox, anammox, and denitrification), and composition of the relative bacterial community at a depth of 0–40 cm were determined based on investigations in riparian sand mining areas and adjacent forestlands. The SOC density of the sand mining areas (2.59 t ha−1, depth of 0–40 cm) was lower than that of the riparian forestlands (80.42 t ha−1). Compared with those of the riparian forestland, the sand mining area exhibited a dramatic reduction in the CO2-fixed gene abundances (cbbL) and a significant change in the composition of cbbL-containing bacteria. The rates of the Feammox (0.038 ± 0.014 mg N kg−1 d−1), anammox (0.017 ± 0.017 mg N kg−1 d−1), and denitrification (0.090 ± 0.1 mg N kg−1 d−1) processes at a depth of 0–20 cm in the soil layer of the sand mining area were reduced by 70.17%, 91.5%, and 93.62% compared with those of the riparian forestland, respectively. The riparian areas in the study area (approximately 12 ha, depth of 0–40 cm) destroyed by sand mining activities released approximately 933.96 t stored soil carbon, which reduce the annual carbon sequestration potential by 28.8–40.8 t. Moreover, the potential N-removal rates in the riparian forestlands (depth of 0–20 cm) by the Feammox, anammox, and denitrification processes were 1514.21–1530.95 kg N ha−1 year−1, whereas the potential N-removal rates in the sand mining area were only 121.2–126.19 kg N ha−1 year−1. Therefore, more investigations are necessary for comparing the benefits and damage of sand mining activities in riparian areas before more sand mining activities are approved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anammox; Feammox; Nitrogen removal; Riparian forestlands; Sand mining activities; Soil organic carbon","Bacteria; Denitrification; Forestry; Organic carbon; River pollution; Sand; Soils; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; ANAMMOX; Feammox; Forestlands; Sand mining activities; Soil organic carbon; Nitrogen removal; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; soil organic matter; carbon sequestration; mining; nitrogen cycle; organic carbon; pollutant removal; riparian forest; sand; soil pollution; Article; bacterial gene; carbon sequestration; cbbL gene; China; controlled study; denitrification; heavy metal removal; microbial community; mining; nonhuman; riparian ecosystem; river; sampling; sand; soil; soil analysis; chemistry; denitrification; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Li River; Bacteria (microorganisms); Carbon Sequestration; China; Denitrification; Mining; Rivers; Sand; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079885312

It has been suggested that the globalwarming induced thawing and dissociation of these reservoirs is currently releasing methane (CH4) to the shallow coastal ocean and ultimately the atmosphere. However, a major unknown in assessing the contribution of this CH4 flux to the global CH4 cycle and its climate feedbacks is the fate of CH4 as it migrates towards the sediment-water interface. In marine sediments, (an)aerobic oxidation reactions generally act as a very efficient methane sink. However, a number of environmental conditions can reduce the efficiency of this biofilter. Here, we used a reaction-transport model to assess the efficiency of the benthic methane filter and, thus, the potential for benthic methane escape across a wide range of environmental conditions that could be encountered on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Results show that, under steady-state conditions, anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) acts as an efficient biofilter. However, high CH4 escape is simulated for rapidly accumulating and/or active sediments and can be further enhanced by the presence of organic matter with intermediate reactivity and/or intense local transport processes, such as bioirrigation. In addition, in active settings, the sudden onset of CH4 flux triggered by, for instance, permafrost thaw or hydrate destabilization can also drive a high nonturbulent methane escape of up to 19 ?molCH4 cm2 yr1 during a transient, multi-decadal period. This ""window of opportunity"" arises due to delayed response of the resident microbial community to suddenly changing CH4 fluxes. A first-order estimate of non-turbulent, benthic methane efflux from the Laptev Sea is derived as well. We find that, under present-day conditions, non-turbulent methane efflux from Laptev Sea sediments does not exceed 1 GgCH4 yr1. As a consequence, we conclude that previously published estimates of ocean-atmosphere CH4 fluxes from the ESAS cannot be supported by non-turbulent, benthic methane escape. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Treatments included absolute control, application of organic, mineral, organic and mineral fertilizers at increasing rates. One of the experiments showed the growth of C stocks 12‰ in the layer 0-20 cm in the first 20 years in treatments with mineral fertilization, and 17‰ with the additional application of manure in an average annual rate of 10 Mg·ha-1. The accumulation of C allowed increasing its stock by 18-25%. Still, with the subsequent decline in crop rotation productivity, there was a loss of part of the previously accumulated C. In another experiment, at close values of annual C input, there was a loss of initial C stock due to the history of land use. The crop rotation adjustment provided a 3-8 ‰ increase of soil C in the 0-20 cm layer in the first 20 years after introduction but was insufficient to match the 4 ppm initiative. In the long term, the organic fertilizer system had an advantage over the mineral one in ensuring the stability of organic C stocks in the arable layer. However, the management of C sequestration was complicated in the non-equilibrium state of the carbon system plant residues-organic fertilizer-soil. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Agricultural robots; Crops; Fertilizers; Land use; Minerals; Soils; Agricultural soils; C sequestration; Long-term field experiments; Mineral fertilization; Mineral fertilizers; Nonequilibrium state; Organic fertilizers; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Organic carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088445962

It is widely recognized as a major environmental issue which drives landscape fragmentation and ecosystem services degradation and loss. Italy is one of European countries with the highest extent of soil sealing. The most affected area is northern Italy, especially the Po Valley with more than 12% of sealed surfaces. According to official data, Veneto Region and the city of Padua are seriously affected by this phenomenon. The Biotope Area Factor is a consolidated ecological urban index for mapping soil sealing, adopted in different European cities to support urban planning; it expresses the ratio of the ecologically effective surface area in relation to the total land area according to land cover classes. The general aim of this study is to map and to assess soil sealing in the whole municipal territory of Padua using the Biotope Area Factor (BAF) index. We tested and adopted a digital land cover map together with aerial images to perform a BAF analysis on the whole municipal territory of Padua. By using sample areas previously analyzed, we validated our source data by a double spatial validation process; therefore, soil sealing analysis was scaled-up to the municipality territory. Results show that in the city of Padua, the average BAF index value is 0.6; totally permeable surfaces (BAF = 1) cover 59.5%, whereas totally ""sealed"" surfaces (BAF = 0) are 40.3% of the municipal territory (93 km2). Most of the sealed soil is located in the east sector and in the historical core of the city, with BAF values ranging from 0 to 0.2. A particularly critical area is identified within the new industrial area of the city, which is strongly affected by soil sealing. BAF maps are useful tools to identify critical areas by geovisualizing surface permeability at a very detailed scale and by enabling further analyses for hydrogeological risk assessment and urban climate regulation. Moreover, the use of BAF maps at urban scale today represent an important tool for urban management, especially for policy makers who are planning mitigation and compensation measures to control soil sealing. © 2020 by the authors.","Biotope area factor; Land use-land cover; Soil sealing; Urban planning; Urbanization","assessment method; biotope; image analysis; index method; land cover; mapping method; policy making; risk assessment; sealing; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086932393

It allows a further reduction of CO2 emissions equal to 10% at the same annual costs of the Italian integrated energy and climate action plan scenario. Both these results are then compared to climate change scenarios through the carbon budget indicator. This comparison shows the difficulties to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 °C. The results also show that this target can only be met through an increase in the total annual costs in the order of 25% with respect to the integrated energy and climate action plan scenario. However, the study also shows how the shift in expenditure from fossil fuels, external expenses, to investment on the national territory represents an opportunity to enhance the national economy. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate-change; Energy scenarios; EPLANopt; Multi-objective optimization; Photovoltaics; Wind","Budget control; Climate models; Computer software; Economics; Evolutionary algorithms; Fossil fuels; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Climate change scenarios; Energy transitions; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization models; National economy; Security issues; Simulation software; Temperature increase; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088676223

However, studies on the impact of the substitution position in isostructural molecules to regulate aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or convert aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE have not been reported to date. In the present study, aggregation properties of two isostructural fluorophores viz. (E)-4-(2-(anthracen-9-yl)vinyl)benzonitrile (p-AnCN) and (E)-3-(2-(anthracen-9-yl)vinyl)benzonitrile (m-AnCN), with different substitution positions have been evaluated. It was observed that m-AnCN exhibits an ACQ behavior, whereas, p-AnCN exhibits enhanced emission upon aggregation. Upon aggregation, c.a. 1.4-fold decrease in luminescence quantum yield has been observed for m-AnCN, whereas, c.a. 11-fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield has been achieved for p-AnCN. Results from the study indicate that absence of interplay between the excited states from a dark Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) state to Locally Excited state (LE) in m-AnCN is the primary reason behind the observed difference in the emission properties of the aggregates. Thus, modulation of ACQ-AIE properties has been achieved using isostructural organic fluorophores, which in turn can be used as a versatile strategy to achieve AIE-luminophores. Further, the AIE active p-AnCN aggregates have been utilized to generate three-component white light emission with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). © 2020","Aggregates; Aggregation caused quenching (ACQ); Aggregation induced emission (AIE); Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state; White light emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085064169

The catalyst preparation was easy and the characterization was carried out by using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid-state 13C cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The catalyst displayed good catalytic activity for the direct reduction of CO2 with hydrosilanes, tunably yielding silylformate or methoxysilane products depending on the hydrosilanes used. The catalyst was also active for the reductive insertion of CO2 into both primary and secondary amines. The catalytic activity of the resin-supported formate can be predicted from the FTIR spectra of the catalyst, probably because of the difference in the ionic interaction strength between the supported alkylammonium cations and formate anions. The ion pair density is thought to influence the catalytic activity, as shown by the elemental and solid-state 13C NMR analyses. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To reduce carbon emission, India has set up an ambitious target to harness power from renewable energy resources. To examine whether solar and wind are the least cost options to reduce carbon emission, the study estimates the cost of avoided carbon emission from thermal and renewable power generation in India. The study first estimates the Levelized Cost of Electricity Generation (LCOE). These LCOE estimates are then extended to calculate the avoided cost of carbon emission (CAC) from coal-based super and ultra-supercritical technologies along with solar, wind, and combined cycle gas-based power with respect to the subcritical power plant. The study also conducts sensitivity analysis and scenario building exercises. It establishes that super and ultra-supercritical power plants and not the solar or wind are the least-cost options for India to reduce its carbon emission.

The presence of multiple constituents institutes a synergistic effect that endows the catalyst with superior performance and appreciable potential in a diverse range of catalytic applications, including electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. These promising catalysts can support a feasible method for large-scale processing of valuable carbonaceous feedstock or fuel generation and alleviation of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Such technologies will serve as the much-needed remedy for the global energy and environmental crisis.

The estimated changes in climatic conditions including increasing temperature, with particular attention to the summer means, together with the expected changes in the temporal precipitation distribution pose enormous challenge to the agriculture. Currently, dynamic system models are most frequently used tools that are capable of estimating the prospective effects of climate change on agro-ecosystems. A deterministic biogeochemical model is presented that is developed by Hungarian scientists within the framework of the AgroMo project. The main goal of the AgroMo project is to develop climate-smart strategies in order to mitigate the effect of potential future hazards in the context of climate change by 1) creating a complex, state-of-the-art experimental platform; 2) producing ten new, 0.1° spatial resolution climate scenarios based on the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; 3) developing an integrated assessment and modeling framework that is capable of simulating every major land use types; 4) analyzing/simulating a great number of adaptation strategies that can be used to support decision makers. Based on the preliminary simulation results, climate change will most likely expose significant negative impact on the spring sown crops in Hungary. Although, the yield losses could be avoided with irrigation or could be mitigated with earlier sowing, the role of winter crops is likely to become more significant in Hungary in the future. © INRA and Springer-Verlag France 2015.","Climate change; Crop yield; Model; Nitrate leaching; Secision support; Simulation","agricultural ecosystem; biogeochemistry; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; ecosystem service; sowing; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082671005

Unlike emissions from fossil-fueled power plants, the carbon footprint of the industrial sector represents a complex mixture of stationary combustion and process emissions produced as a reaction byproduct of cement, iron and steel, glass, and oil production. This study quantifies the potential opportunities for low-cost carbon capture and storage (CCS) scenarios with process emissions from the U.S. industrial sector by analyzing the variabilities in point-source capture and geographic proximity to relevant sinks, specifically enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and geologic sequestration opportunities. Using a technology-agnostic cost model developed from mature CO2 capture technologies, costs of CCS are calculated for each of the 656 facilities considered, with application of the U.S. federal tax credit 45Q to qualifying facilities. Capture of these targeted industrial process emission streams may lead to the avoidance of roughly 195 MtCO2/yr (188 MtCO2/yr qualifying for 45Q). A total of 123 facilities have the potential to avoid roughly 68.5 MtCO2/yr at costs below $40/tCO2 delivered. This could be competitive for using CO2 for EOR depending on the price of oil. At regional CO2 collection hubs, emissions of 40 MtCO2/yr can be avoided within 100 miles of the existing Louisiana-Mississippi and Texas-New Mexico pipelines.

Moreover, the old building stock of most countries requires suited policies to support renovation programs aimed at improving energy performances and optimize energy uses. A toolbox was developed in the framework of the PrioritEE project to provide policy makers and technicians with a wide set of tools to support energy efficiency in Municipal Public Buildings. The toolbox, available for free, was tested in the partners’ communities, proving its effectiveness. The paper illustrates its application to the Potenza Municipality case study in which the online calculator DSTool (the core instrument of the toolbox) was utilized to select and prioritize the energy efficiency interventions in public buildings implementable in a three-year action plan in terms of costs, energy savings, CO2 emissions’ reduction and return on investments. The results highlight that improvements in the building envelopes (walls and roofs), heating and lighting and photovoltaic systems allow reducing CO2 emission approximately 644 t/year and saving about 2050 MWh/year with a total three-year investment of 1,728,823 EUR. © 2020 by the authors.

In both examples, populist battle-cries for 'taking back control' and for lowering regulatory standards were followed by governmental attempts at evading parliamentary control over executive foreign policy powers to violate, or withdraw from, multilateral agreements. Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism, President Trump's mercantilist power politics, authoritarian state-capitalism (e.g. in China), and European ordo-liberalism reflect systemic divergences that may justify broad interpretations of WTO'exceptions' (e.g. for WTO trade remedies and climate changemitigation). Europe's multilevel, democratic constitutionalism protecting 'social market economies' was comparatively more effective in limiting protectionism and carbon emissions inside Europe's common market. The EU's 'new green deal' for a carbon-neutral 'green economy' was made possible by stronger, social, and democratic support based on 'constitutional interpretations' of Europe's ordo-liberalism assisting adversely affected workers, producers, traders, investors, and other citizens to adjust economic and environmental activities to climate change mitigation. EU leadership for WTO-consistent climate change rules requires 'greening embedded liberalism' by interpreting the WTO 'sustainable development' objectives in conformity with the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UN 'sustainable development goals', and human rights (e.g. as legal basis for climate change litigation in Europe). © 2020 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097146629

In the last decade, new colonies outside their usual range have been predicted through modeling and reported by the National Commission on Protected Areas of Mexico. The objectives of the study were to recover information on the historical and new hibernation sites, reported or modeled, from different literature sources. We also aimed to perform a bioclimatic and forest biometric characterization of new monarch butterfly colonies located in Sierra Nevada in Mexico to provide information to aid in conservation strategies for the monarch butterfly population. We conducted field trips to georeference the colonies at sites located in the Atlautla municipality in Mexico State. Climatic, topographic, and forest biometric variables were used to characterize the sites physically. It was found that the butterfly’s roosts occurred at a higher elevation than those recorded by other sources. The locations where the monarch’s colonies were established, in the east of Mexico State, provide information relevant to defining and developing policies for their conservation. © 2020 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of baseline and longitudinal basal forebrain atrophy with cognitive decline and dementia in PD. Methods: We included 106 non-demented PD patients, 19 PD dementia (PDD) patients and 42 controls with longitudinal structural MRI and cognitive testing. After 4.2 ± 1.8 years, 20 non-demented PD patients were diagnosed with dementia (PD-dementia converters), whereas the rest of PD patients remained non-demented (stable-PD). We compared MRI volumes of the medial septum/diagonal band (Ch1/Ch2) and nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4) between groups. Cox regression analyses were applied to test whether Ch1/Ch2 or Ch4 atrophy could predict future dementia and linear mixed models assessed their association with cognitive decline. Results: Compared to controls, we found reduced Ch4 baseline volumes in PD-dementia converters (p =.003) and those who already had PDD (p <.001) but not in stable-PD. Over time, there was a greater loss in Ch1/Ch2 volumes in PD-dementia converters and PDD compared to the other groups (p =.004). Baseline and longitudinal Ch4 volumes were associated with cognition (p <.002) and longitudinal Ch4 atrophy predicted future dementia (p =.009). Conclusions: Atrophy of Ch4 precedes and predicts future dementia in PD and is followed by changes in Ch1/Ch2, reflecting a posterior-anterior pattern of basal forebrain atrophy. This pattern could be used to track the spread of cholinergic degeneration and identify patients at risk of developing dementia. © 2020 The Authors","Basal forebrain; Cognitive decline; Dementia; Longitudinal MRI; Parkinson's disease","cholinergic receptor blocking agent; cholinesterase inhibitor; levodopa; adult; aged; Article; basal forebrain; basal forebrain atrophy; brain atrophy; brain degeneration; brain radiography; brain region; brain size; cholinergic nerve cell; cognitive defect; cognitive function test; controlled study; dementia; disease association; disease duration; DSM-5; female; human; image analysis; linear mixed model; major clinical study; male; Meynert basal nucleus; middle aged; national health organization; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; patient identification; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; septum pellucidum; statistical model; atrophy; basal forebrain; case control study; cognition; cognitive defect; dementia; disease exacerbation; longitudinal study; neuropsychological test; Parkinson disease; pathology; prospective study; Sweden; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrophy; Basal Forebrain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease; Prospective Studies; Sweden; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081702032

Here we report on a series of robust Fe-MOFs with triangular channels constructed by rod-like fluorinated pyrazolate ligands, comprising an increasing number of fluorine atoms on the centralp-phenylene core (F = 1, 2, and 4). This yielded a series of isoreticular frameworks, engineered with orientational flexibility of the fluorinated aryl rings pivoted on ethynyl groups with an sp2-sp soft rotary barrier, providing a stable axel, which supported reorientable C-F dipoles. A combined approach, including powder X-ray diffraction, multinuclear solid-state NMR (2D1H-13C,19F, hyperpolarized129Xe NMR and distance measurements by paramagnetic shift), gas-adsorption and microcalorimetry, enabled the exhaustive description of the fluorinated ring arrangement and the organization of functionalized sites for accommodating CO2. In the tetrafluoro-aryl-derivative MOF, protrusion of perfluorinated rings towards the channel space plays a major role in CO2capture. Partially fluorinated aryl rings of mono- and di-fluoro MOFs turn to retract into the channel-walls to form continuous ribbons of inter-strut supramolecular interactions, contributing to the robustness of the overall architecture. Detailed computational models obtained using GCMC and DFT of CO2diffusion and interactions in MOFs showed how the gas molecules approach the channel walls. The highly occupied sites are aligned at the corners of the triangular channels, wherein fluorine atoms participate in host-CO2interactions. A CO2-matrix adsorption enthalpy of 33 kJ mol−1, suitable for capture/delivery cycles, was accurately measuredin situby simultaneous acquisition of microcalorimetric and volumetric-isotherm data. Thus, the designed advantages of rotationally flexible fluorinated moieties were successfully explored. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fluorine; Gas adsorption; Matrix algebra; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Supramolecular chemistry; Adsorption enthalpies; Computational model; Multinuclear solid state NMR; Paramagnetic shifts; Partially fluorinated; Powder X ray diffraction; Simultaneous acquisition; Supramolecular interactions; Rings (components)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086182194

This study assesses the performances of ET0 estimates based on weather data, respectively produced by two high-resolution reanalysis datasets: UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX (UMS) and ERA5-Land (E5L). The study is conducted in Campania Region (Southern Italy), with reference to the irrigation seasons (April-September) of years 2008-2018. Temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation and ET0 derived from reanalysis datasets, were compared with the corresponding estimates obtained by spatially interpolating data observed by a network of 18 automatic weather stations (AWSs). Statistical performances of the spatial interpolations were evaluated with a cross-validation procedure, by recursively applying universal kriging or ordinary kriging to the observed weather data. ERA5-Land outperformed UMS both in weather data and ET0 estimates. Averaging over all 18 AWSs sites in the region, the normalized BIAS (nBIAS) was found less than 5% for all the databases. The normalized RMSE (nRMSE) for ET0 computed with E5L data was 17%, while it was 22% with UMS data. Both performances were not far from those obtained by kriging interpolation, which presented an average nRMSE of 14%. Overall, this study confirms that reanalysis can successfully surrogate the unavailability of observed weather data for the regional assessment of ET0. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation policies; ERA5-land; Gridded agro-meteorological data; Gridded data; Kriging; Reanalysis data; Reference evapotranspiration; UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX; Water management; Weather variables","Budget control; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Meteorology; Water supply; Weather information services; Wind; Automatic weather stations; Kriging interpolation; Reference evapotranspiration; Spatial interpolation; Statistical performance; Universal kriging; Vapor pressure deficit; Weather observations; Interpolation; abiotic factor; climate conditions; comparative study; data set; evapotranspiration; interpolation; spatiotemporal analysis; water budget; Campania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087469049

In the European Union (EU), the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is failing with respect to biodiversity, climate, soil, land degradation as well as socio-economic challenges. The European Commission's proposal for a CAP post-2020 provides a scope for enhanced sustainability. However, it also allows Member States to choose low-ambition implementation pathways. It therefore remains essential to address citizens' demands for sustainable agriculture and rectify systemic weaknesses in the CAP, using the full breadth of available scientific evidence and knowledge. Concerned about current attempts to dilute the environmental ambition of the future CAP, and the lack of concrete proposals for improving the CAP in the draft of the European Green Deal, we call on the European Parliament, Council and Commission to adopt 10 urgent action points for delivering sustainable food production, biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation. Knowledge is available to help moving towards evidence-based, sustainable European agriculture that can benefit people, nature and their joint futures.

Recent studies have found meteorological factors, such as temperature, are associated with HFMD in Asia. However, few studies have explored the relationship in the United States, although HFMD cases have steadily increased recently. As concerns of climate change grow, we explored the association between temperature and HFMD admissions to the Emergency Department (ED) in California. Methods: Weekly counts of HFMD for 16 California climate zones were collected from 2005 to 2013. We calculated weekly temperature for each climate zone using an inverse distance-weighting method. For each climate zone stratified by season, we conducted a time-series using Poisson regression models. We adjusted models for weekly averaged relative humidity, average number of HFMD cases in previous weeks and long-term temporal trends. Climate zone estimates were combined to obtain an overall seasonal estimate. We attempted stratified analyses by region, race/ethnicity, and sex to identify sensitive subpopulations. Results: Risk of ED visits for HFMD per 1 °F increase in mean temperature during the same week increased 2.00% (95% confidence intervals 1.15, 2.86%) and 2.35% (1.38, 3.33%) during the warm and cold seasons, respectively. The coastal region showed a higher, though not statistically different, association during the cold season [3.18% (1.99, 4.39)] than the warm season [1.64% (0.47, 2.82)]. Conclusions: Our findings indicated an association between temperature and ED visits for HFMD, with variation by season and region. Thus, the causative pathogen's ability to persist in the atmosphere may vary by season. Furthermore, the mild and wet winter in the coastal region of California may contribute to different results than studies in Asia. With the onset of climate change, HFMD cases will likely grow in California, warranting further investigation on this relationship, including new populations at-risk. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Children; Coxsackievirus; Enterovirus; Infectious disease; Temperature","child health; climate change; coastal zone; disease; health care; health risk; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; subpopulation; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; California; child; climate change; emergency ward; Enterovirus; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; ethnicity; female; hand foot and mouth disease; hospital admission; human; humidity; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; priority journal; seashore; seasonal variation; summer; time series analysis; winter; Asia; China; hand foot and mouth disease; hospital emergency service; incidence; season; temperature; Asia; California; United States; United States; Coxsackievirus; Enterovirus; Asia; California; Child; China; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Incidence; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082757066

Sensitivity analysis of each climatic parameter on reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was performed to estimate the sensitivity coefficients and to evaluate the impact of global warming on ETo in the eastern Himalayan region of Sikkim, India. Results of trend analysis showed a significant increasing trend for minimum temperature and mean temperature. Mean relative humidity and sunshine duration showed decreasing trends. Reference evapotranspiration also showed a significant decreasing trend by 0.008 mm year–1 in Sikkim state of India. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the seasonal and annual ETo were most sensitive to maximum temperature followed by sunshine hours whereas wind speed, minimum temperature and relative humidity had a fluctuating effect on mean ETo. The sensitivity coefficient indicated that ETo changes positively with maximum and minimum temperature, sunshine hour, and wind speed, while it changes negatively with relative humidity. Analysis indicated that increase in relative humidity would decrease the ETo in the study area. The findings of this study would be useful for sustainable water resources planning and management of agriculture in hilly regions of the state and for development of adaptation strategies in adverse climatic conditions. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Climatic parameters; Evapotranspiration; Mann–Kendall; Sensitivity; Sen’s slope; Sikkim","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Water conservation; Wind; Adaptation strategies; Climatic conditions; Climatic parameters; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Minimum temperatures; Reference evapotranspiration; Sensitivity coefficient; Sustainable water resources; Sensitivity analysis; climate conditions; evapotranspiration; global warming; sensitivity analysis; time series analysis; trend analysis; water management; Himalayas; Sikkim Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086888710

The purge gases are the combination of flare gas (consist mainly of methane) and high-temperature flue gas (containing CO2 and steam). The proposed loop including three main parts: 1) flare gas desulfurization unit; 2) CO2 and steam recovery unit and, 3) a membrane reformer for combined dry-steam reforming of methane, heating with high-temperature flue gas. The hazardous hot gases convert to valuable products instead of discharging to the atmosphere. A steady-state one-dimensional model is used to predict the loop performance. The results show that 55.5% of methane conversion can be achieved from the purge gases consisting of 797 kmol/h flare gas and 17,200 kmol/h flue gas. The proposed process can produce 338 kmol/h of pure hydrogen and 1,209 kmol/h of syngas. In addition, the effects of purge gas properties and process modifications on the loop performance were investigated. The method presented in this work is a promising alternative to reduce purge gas released to the atmosphere from industrial plants.

The transition to a low-carbon energy system is a capital intensive process. Different technological options at different scales and different time frames will be required for the successful transition to a low-carbon energy system. The economic impact on countries that transform their energy system depends on a multitude of factors including their energy system profile, the access to low-cost financial resources, whether they are market leaders in the production of clean energy technology and their ability to assimilate knowledge that is produced elsewhere. In this study, we use a large scale applied CGE model to compute the macroeconomic implications of the investments required to reduce by 76% as compared to 1990 levels the GHG emissions of the Italian energy system within a context of global concerted GHG mitigation action. The focus of the analysis has been on the Italian economy and energy system as Italy is both an equipment manufacturer, its energy system is largely based on fossil fuels and its financial system is currently under pressure following the elevation of public debt and deficits. The model-based results suggest that the Italian economy can benefit from the low-carbon transition in the coming decades in case Italian firms and households have access to low-cost financial resources, Italian manufacturers acquire market shares in the production of clean energy technologies and technological progress is rapid driven by innovation and economies of scale. The average annual GDP growth of Italy in the period 2015–2050 can be 1.3% in the case that Italy reduces drastically its GHG emissions and the associated cumulative expenditures sum up to one trillion euro. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Commerce; Competition; Coordination reactions; Costs; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Renewable energy resources; Capital intensive process; Clean energy technology; Equipment manufacturers; Low-carbon energy systems; Low-carbon transitions; Macro-economic analysis; Technological progress; Technology advancement; Investments; capital; economic growth; economic impact; economic policy; finance; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; urban policy; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073948343

These traits are of increasing economic importance due to changing consumer demand, reduced labor availability, and climate-change-related increasing global aridity. Many crop species, including common bean, show genetic variation in growth rate, between varieties. Despite this, the genetic basis of early-season growth has not been well-resolved in the species, in part due to historic phenotyping challenges. Using a range of UAV-and ground-based methods, we evaluated the early-season growth vigor of two populations. These growth datawere used to find genetic regions associatedwith several growth parameters. Our results suggest that early-season growth rate is the result of complex interactions between several genetic and environmental factors. They also highlight the need for high-precision phenotyping provided by UAVs. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified in this study are the first in common bean to be identified remotely using UAV technology. These will be useful for developing crop varieties that compete with weeds and use water more effectively. Ultimately, this will improve crop productivity in the face of changing climatic conditions and will mitigate the need for water and resource-intensive forms of weed control. © 2020 by the authors.","Growth rate; Organic; Phaseolus vulgaris; SUAS; UAV; Vigor; Weed competitiveness","Antennas; Climate change; Crops; Genes; Plants (botany); Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Weed control; Climatic conditions; Consumer demands; Crop productivity; Economic importance; Environmental factors; Genetic variation; Growth parameters; Quantitative trait locus; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086439173

We apply a sequential method which has a strong relationship to policy indicators. First, an analysis of the dynamics is undertaken to identify if convergence is occurring, followed by a study of the determinants of those dynamics. This approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous work analyzing emission convergence by focusing on country specific characteristics such as energy mix and energy efficiency. The analysis reveals per capita CO2 emissions, energy intensity, carbonization and per capita incomes are slowly converging over the full sample. Yet this behavior is not uniform; there were differences in transition paths prior to and after the Asian Financial Crisis. The per capita income driver was the most important driver in explaining the dynamics and variation of emissions while carbonization and energy intensity drivers were less pronounced. The analysis reveals that the energy needs of the region's extraordinary economic growth favored fossil fuels and a surprising revelation is that despite having different per capita income levels China, Korea, and Vietnam all share a common convergence path.

Alkalinization due to high dialysate bicarbonate may stimulate organic acid generation, which could lead to poor outcomes. Using measurements of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and lactate, we quantified organic anion (OA) balance in two single-arm studies comparing high and low bicarbonate prescriptions. In study 1 (n = 10), patients became alkalemic using 37 meq/L dialysate bicarbonate; in contrast, with the use of 27 meq/L dialysate, net bicarbonate loss occurred and blood bicarbonate decreased. Total OA losses were not higher with 37 meq/L dialysate bicarbonate (50.9 vs. 49.1 meq using 27 meq/L, P = 0.66); serum BHB increased in both treatments similarly (P = 0.27); and blood lactate was only slightly higher with the use of 37 meq/L dialysate (P = 0.048), differing by 0.2 meq/L at the end of hemodialysis. In study 2 (n = 7), patients achieved steady state on two bicarbonate prescriptions: they were significantly more acidemic when dialyzed against a 30 meq/L bicarbonate dialysate compared with 35 meq/L and, as in study 1, became alkalemic when dialyzed against the higher bicarbonate dialysate. OA losses were similar to those in study 1 and again did not differ between treatments (38.9 vs. 43.5 meq, P = 0.42). Finally, free fatty acid levels increased throughout hemodialysis and correlated with the change in serum BHB (r = 0.81, P < 0.001), implicating upregulation of lipolysis as the mechanism for increased ketone production. In conclusion, lowering dialysate bicarbonate does not meaningfully reduce organic acid generation during hemodialysis or modify organic anion losses into dialysate. © 2020 American Physiological Society.

Mobile source emissions (including vehicle exhaust) contribute significantly to air pollution, along with other sources including industrial, residential, and cross-border. This study aims at separating unobserved vehicle emissions from air-pollution mixtures indicated by ambient air quality data. The level of contributions from vehicle emissions to air pollution cannot be determined by simply comparing ambient air quality data with traffic levels because of the various other contributors to overall air pollution. To estimate contributions from vehicle emissions, researchers employed advanced multivariate receptor modeling called positive matrix factorization (PMF) to analyze hydrocarbon data consisting of hourly concentrations measured from the Chamizal air pollution monitoring station in El Paso. The analysis of hydrocarbon data collected at the Chamizal site in 2008 showed that approximately 25% of measured Total Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (TNMHC) was apportioned to motor vehicle exhaust. Using wind direction analysis, researchers also showed that the motor vehicle exhaust contributions to hydrocarbons were significantly higher when winds blow from the south (Mexico) than those when winds blow from other directions. The results from this research can be used to improve understanding source apportionment of pollutants measured in El Paso and can also potentially inform transportation planning strategies aimed at reducing emissions across the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrocarbon; Mobile source emissions; Multivariate receptor modeling; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment","Air quality standards; Factorization; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Matrix algebra; Mobile power plants; Vehicles; Air-pollution monitoring stations; Mobile source emissions; National Air Quality Standards; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Positive Matrix Factorization; Receptor model; Source apportionment; Transportation planning; Air quality; hydrocarbon; methane; volatile organic compound; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; emission; hydrocarbon; matrix; multivariate analysis; numerical model; source apportionment; traffic emission; wind direction; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; controlled study; gas chromatography; meteorology; Mexico; motor vehicle; multivariate analysis; non-negative matrix factorization; principal component analysis; priority journal; Texas; wind speed; El Paso; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080987060

In the call for the first Computing within Limits workshop, it was stated that ""A goal of this community is to impact society through the design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of limits and/or scarcity.""There have since been several contributions to Computing within Limits that have accepted the challenge of discussing and imagining what such systems as well as what ""a future of limits and/or scarcity""could look like. Despite this, there is currently no consensus about what exactly such a future entails and the community can consequently only offer hazy ideas about exactly what systems we should strive to design and develop. The basic problem can be summed up as follows: we know that fundamental changes are necessary and will come, but we still struggle with envisioning what a post-growth/decarbonising society looks like and what computing systems need to be designed and developed for use in such futures, or, to support that transition. In this paper we argue that the work of imagining an actionable ""future of limits""could benefit from using the ""carbon law""as a starting point. The carbon law is based on work in the environmental sciences and we exemplify how it can be used to generate requirements that can guide the development of computing systems for a future of limits. While these lessons are general, we exemplify by describing a research project that aims to support the KTH Royal Institute of Technology's goal of-in line with the carbon law-radically reducing CO2 emissions from academic flying over the next decade. We give examples of how computing can aid in this task, including by presenting visualisation tools that we have developed to support the KTH carbon abatement goals. We also discuss the role of computer science in general and of Computing within Limits in particular in supporting the transition to a more sustainable (or at least a less unsustainable) future. © 2020 Owner/Author.","academic flying; carbon emissions; carbon law; computer science; sustainability","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Sustainable development; Carbon abatement; CO2 emissions; Community IS; Computing system; Design and Development; Environmental science; Fundamental changes; Royal Institute of Technology; Environmental regulations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090497602

This interdisciplinary study was carried out on three historical green roofs covering bunkers in Wroclaw, located in southwestern Poland. It presents the results of a three-year investigation of the water storage of these roofs. The study also presents soil conditions and spontaneous vegetation after their functioning for over 100 years. The soils covering the bunkers are made of sandy, sandy-loam, and loamy-sand deposits. This historical construction ensures good drainage and runoff of rainwater, and is able to absorb torrential rainfall ranging from 100 to 150 mm. It provides suitable conditions for vegetation growth, and forest communities with layers formed there. In their synanthropic flora, species of European deciduous forests dominate, which are characteristic of fresh or moist and eutrophic soils with a neutral reaction. Some invasive species, such as Robinia pseudoacacia, Padus serotina, and Impatiens parviflora, also occur with high abundance. Nowadays, historical green roofs on fortifications, although they have lost their primary military role, are of historical and natural value. These roofs can promote the nonmilitary functions of historical fortifications in order to strengthen the ties between nature and heritage. Protecting and monitoring historical green roofs should be included in the elements of the process of sustainable development and the conservation of these structures in order to mitigate climate change in the outskirts of the city. For this, it is necessary to ensure proper conservational protection, which, in addition to maintaining the original structure, profiles, and layout of the building, should include protection of their natural value. © 2020 by the authors.","Fortified landscape; Green infrastructure; Heritage protection; Soil water retention; Synanthropic flora; Technogenic soil; Urban vegetation","climate change; conservation management; deciduous tree; drainage; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; growth; historical record; interdisciplinary approach; plant community; runoff; soil drainage; sustainability; sustainable development; urban ecosystem; Poland [Central Europe]; Wroclaw [Poland]; Impatiens parviflora; Robinia pseudoacacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086364432

Bias-corrected future climate was projected based on ensembles of multiple models selected from a set of 19 regional climate models (RCMs). The impacts on water availability were then assessed by forcing a well calibrated and validated hydrological model with projected future precipitation (P) and temperature (T) for various climatic scenarios. New hydrological insights for this region: Results showed that future T is projected to increase spatio-temporally with higher rate for the mountain stations in the winter season; whereas future P has no distinct spatio-temporal trend but increase in dry season precipitation for future periods. The projected changes in P, T and evapotranspiration are expected to alter average annual flow at the outlets of the KarMo and its sub-basins, albeit with varying rate. The simulated results showed higher impacts in water availabilty at higher altitudes, thus indicating higher vulnerability of northern mountainous region to CC than the southern flatlands.

The establishment of artificial revegetation of different ages has formed vegetation landscapes with different chronological sequences in the southeast margin of the Tengger Desert. As an important regulatory factor of the Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC) system, changes in vegetation characteristics will affect the water uptake of the entire ecosystem. In this study, the δ2H and δ18O isotope ratios in precipitation, plant water, soil moisture, and underground water, and the δ13C isotope ratio of plant leaves were measured using the stable isotope technique for artificial revegetation used to fix the sand dunes in the Tengger Desert. The purpose of this study was to establish the isotope content and characteristics of potential water sources for plants and leaf carbon isotopes, to clarify whether the soil moisture condition and duration of sand-fixing influenced the isotopic signal, and to identify the main water source for desert plants. The results indicated that air temperature and amounts of precipitation were two important influencing factors in precipitation isotope ratio change. Soil water isotopic ratios were different under different water conditions, and under the same water conditions, the vertical variation in soil water isotopes in a single area and spatial variation at any depth for different revegetation areas were all significant (p &lt; 0.01). Shallow soil waters were enriched in isotope ratios and the value increased with an increase of the sand-fixing duration (as found in older revegetation areas). The δ2H and δ18O values in Caragana korshinskii leaves were higher than they were in Artemisia ordosica leaves because the former has a higher transpiration rate. The higher δ13C value of Artemisia ordosica plant leaves indicated high water use efficiency, which is a result of better adapting to the arid environment compared to Caragana korshinskii. Overall, water uptake of these two shrubs was mainly (&gt;70%) concentrated at a soil depth of 20–150 cm. For Caragana korshinskii plants, the 60–150 cm soil layer was the main water supply layer, while the water contribution layer of Artemisia ordosica plants focused on the 20–100 cm soil layer and the contribution rate of shallow soil water increased with the increase of sand fixation time in older revegetation areas, regardless of the species used for revegetation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Revegetation plants; Stable isotopes; Water sources; Water use efficiency","desert soil; ecohydrology; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; revegetation; soil water; stable isotope; terrestrial ecosystem; water availability; water uptake; water use efficiency; China; Tengger Desert; Artemisia ordosica; Caragana korshinskii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078398683

Results show that (i) the forest sector has larger carbon leakage of 39.6%; (ii) substitution degree increases carbon leakage, but it is not statistically significant; (iii) contrary to popular belief, coalition size is not always negatively related to carbon leakage; (iv) local economic conditions are key drivers of carbon leakage; and (v) carbon leakage is overestimated in the forest sector by 41.42% when ignoring agricultural expansion through the land use change. Results also support the following policy implications: (i) the global agreement, which requires the participation of poorer regions and countries, may effectively reduce carbon leakage; (ii) a mature worldwide carbon trading market with relatively high carbon prices can attract more participants; and (iii) a long-term and integrated land-use planning will be an effective way to reduce carbon leakage caused by agricultural expansion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon leakage; Causal loop diagram (CLD); Climate policy; Energy/forest sectors; Meta-regression","Agricultural robots; Emission control; Expansion; Forestry; Land use; Public policy; Carbon leakage; Causal loop diagrams; Climate policy; Energy/forest sectors; Meta-regression; Carbon; Carbon; Economic Conditions; Energy; Expansion; Forestry; Land Use; Leakage; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082804272

This study applies the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in design for global development, where understanding the tendency to adopt beneficial technologies based on parsimonious approaches is critical to programmatic impact. To investigate robustness and applicability of behavioral models in a data scarce setting, this study applies TPB to the adoption of biomass cookstoves in a sample size of two remote communities in Honduras and Uganda before and after a trial period. Using multiple ordinal logistic regressions, the intention to adopt the technology was modeled. Results quantify the influence of these factors on households’ intentions to cook their main meals with improved cookstoves. For example, the intention of participants with slightly stronger beliefs regarding the importance of reducing smoke emissions was 3.3 times higher than average to cook more main meals with clean cookstoves. The quantitative method of this study enables technology designers to design and develop clean technologies that better suit user behavior, needs, and priorities. In addition, the data driven approach of this study provides insights for policy makers to design policies such as subsidies, information campaigns, and supply chains that reflect behavioral attributes for culturally tailored clean technology adoption initiatives.

In order to achieve satisfying climatic conditions not only thermal storage, but also moisture storage of walls needs to be taken into consideration. Dynamic effects of walls and the impact on thermal room climate require a detailed thermal wall simulation. In the simulation program NANDRAD a Finite Volume approach is used to discretized each building construction. The balance equation system is now extended with coupled moisture mass balance, both for zone air volumes and all construction elements. This leads to a duplication of system unknowns with highly nonlinear interactions between solution variables, resulting in strong increase of simulation time. In order to improve performance for larger simulation models, a mixed grid approach is evaluated. Hereby, a detailed grid is used for energy balances and coarser grid for moisture balances. In the article we discuss the procedure, evaluate the impact on accuracy of solution results, and discuss numerical problems. We show that the procedure indeed helps reducing the overall number of unknowns, which, however, appears to pay off only for large building models. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Heat storage; Moisture; Building construction; Climatic conditions; Construction elements; Finite volume approach; Hygro-thermal conditions; Improve performance; Nonlinear interactions; Numerical problems; Walls (structural partitions)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088476191

Although mycorrhizal fungi are crucial for nutrient acquisition and can receive a large fraction of annual net primary production, most studies do not explicitly include carbon flux to mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem C budgets. We measured annual production of plant components (foliage, wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant production varied from about 600 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m−2 y−1 in conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25 g C m−2 y−1 in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m−2 y−1 in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bartlett Experimental Forest; carbon allocation; forest carbon; mycorrhizal fungi; total belowground carbon flux (TBCF)","carbon cycle; community structure; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; dominance; forest ecosystem; fungus; mass balance; nitrogen; nutrient availability; resource availability; stand structure; temperate forest; Coniferophyta; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073826546

Evolving a sustainable development practice is an emergent concern for the construction industry in both developing and developed countries. Sustainable construction is concerned with site planning and design, community, indoor air quality, energy, materials, water, commissioning and marketability for the benefit of mankind. This requires enormous efforts from all the stakeholders in the industry. Sustainable construction efforts in the Nigerian construction industry have been ineffective as a result of a number of barriers that prevent a smooth transition to sustainable construction practice in the country. The aim of this study is to assess the potential barriers that hinder effective adoption of sustainable construction practice in the Nigerian Construction Industry, with a view to exploring how these barriers can be overcome and thereby achieving sustainable construction in the country. A cross-sectional questionnaire was adopted for the survey. Purposive sampling technique was used to elicit 105 copies of questionnaires from various construction professionals based in Lagos state, Nigeria. Data collected were analysed using frequency, percentage, mean, relative importance index and ranking. The results revealed that key barriers to sustainable construction in the Nigerian Construction Industry are poor government support for sustainable construction, lack of relevant laws and regulations to drive sustainable construction, lack of demand for sustainable construction from clients, low level of awareness of sustainable construction and fear of the cost of adopting sustainable construction. Based on the findings from this study, it was recommended that government should assume a greater role in the popularisation and application of sustainable strategy. The barriers identified and the suggestions made to minimize barriers to the adoption of sustainable construction in Nigeria should offer an enabling environment for stakeholders in construction sector to smoothly adopt sustainable construction for the benefit of humanity. © 2020 The Author.

Hybrid electric vehicles could have a chance of achieving this, by recovering energy during braking phases, running in pure electric mode and allowing the internal combustion engine to operate under better efficiency conditions, while maintaining traditionally expected vehicle performances (mileage, weight, available on-board volume, etc.). The energy storage systems for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have different requirements than those designed for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs); high specific power is normally the most critical issue. Using Li-ion Batteries (LiBs) in the designing of on-board Energy Storage Systems (ESS) based only on power specifications gives an ESS with an energy capacity which is sufficient for vehicle requirements. The highest specific power LiBs are therefore chosen among those technologically available. All this leads to an ESS design that is strongly stressed over time, because current output is very high and very rapidly varies, during both traction and regeneration phases. The resulting efficiency of the ESS is correspondingly lowered, and LiBs lifetime can be relevantly affected. Such a problem can be overcome by adopting hybrid storage systems, coupling LiBs and UltraCapacitors (UCs); by properly dimensioning and controlling the ESS- components, in fact, the current output of the batteries can be reduced and smoothed, using UCs during transients. In this paper, a simulation model, calibrated and validated on an engine testbed, has been used to evaluate the performances of a hybrid storage HEV microcar under different operative conditions (driving cycles, environment temperature and ESS State of Charge). Results show that the hybridization of the powertrain may reduce fuel consumption by up to 27%, while LiBs lifetime may be more than doubled. © 2020 by the authors.","Hybrid storage; Hybrid vehicles; Li-Ion Battery; Microcars; UltraCapacitors","Automobiles; Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Braking performance; Charging (batteries); Energy storage; Engines; Land vehicle propulsion; Lithium-ion batteries; Supercapacitor; Energy storage systems; Environment temperature; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Hybrid storage systems; On-board energy storage; Propulsion system; Recovering energy; Simulation model; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088676104

Questionnaires were used to collect primary data from a sample of 161 households out of 1000 covering variables such as average dry weight of fuel wood used per household, average dry weight of fuel wood used in the production of charcoal, and area logged per year. A randomized experimental design was deployed across the study area covering Asa, Ilorin West, Ilorin East, and Ilorin South Local Government Areas. NAICCI was aimed at reducing carbon emission from the use of fuelwood for cooking, which was estimated using Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Decision Support Tool (REDD+ DST) to arrive at an estimate of 8.6 tonnes of carbon emission (CO2e) per capita for the period under review translating to 2.2 tCO2e/year. For fuelwood-induced carbon emissions to be sustainably reduced, we recommend enforcement of prevention of illegal logging to prevent indiscriminate deforestation, use of satellite technology in improving carbon reduction estimates, use of bioethanol from biowaste and nonfood crops, and use of Vulnerability Scoping Diagrams (VSDs) for targeted selection of beneficiaries.

As well as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, all of this aims to reduce the excessive exploitation of natural resources. Thermal insulation of buildings has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as it became apparent that the greatest energy savings could be achieved by using appropriate thermal insulation for the building. In this experimental investigation, physico-mechanical and thermal properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) composed of coarse aggregates and natural pozzolana (NP) are evaluated. Eleven concrete mixes were prepared in order to vary the substitution rate by weight of natural aggregates by recycled aggregates. The substitution rates were set at 50% and likewise, the cement has also been substituted from 5% to 20% by weight by natural pozzolan (NP). The results indicate that recycle SCC mixes that contain NP has a beneficial effect on the capillary dimension of the hardened cement paste, since the capillary absorption provides information on the rise of water through the open porosity of the concrete produced by the tension superficial liquid.

In response, the United States has substantially reduced mercury emissions over the last two decades, largely through air quality management; however, questions remain on the effectiveness of these emission controls in reducing mercury inputs to local ecosystems, due to a disproportional influence of global pools over local sources. Here, we show that trends in mercury concentrations in air and precipitation are largely decreasing across monitoring sites in the United States, coincident with decreases in stationary mercury emissions. Significant decreasing trends primarily occurred in the eastern United States, while trends in the western United States were more often insignificant or increasing, despite no clear increases in local, stationary emissions. For the eastern United States, local emissions appear to have had larger impacts on atmospheric and precipitation mercury concentrations than has been suggested from simulations using atmospheric models, suggesting that reductions in local mercury emissions can confer meaningful benefits to mercury-contaminated areas. These findings highlight the success of air management policies in the United States and are especially timely, as the United States Environmental Protection Agency has decided to roll back the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

Primary data from twelve (12) rural communities that have benefited from rural electrification since 1997 in Oyo State, southwest, Nigeria was collected. Key empirical findings revealed that children study hour reduces with household access to grid electricity, it decreases by 8 percent. Expenditure on electricity significantly decreases children study hour by 12 percent. Electrification decreases the rate at which indoor air pollution reduces by 1.1 percent. Household electricity expenditure increases with reduction in indoor air pollution, it decreases the rate of air pollution by 1.6 percent. Better illumination due from access to modern electricity reduces indoor pollution by 1.2 percent. To enhance the electrification benefits, the adoption of the mini-grid option is inevitable, which requires government commitment for sustainability. The off-grid solution, which is usually renewable solution, with strong supporting legislation is equally required for rural electrification strategy. The efficiency of the existing electricity system entails the implementation of the gas master plan, which is crucial in paving way for increasing supply reliability, coverage, and then higher social benefits. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Education; Electrification; Health; Nigeria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088486153

It assessed changes in future climate (2031–2055) relative to the baseline period (1992–2016) and their impacts on the yields of 3 staple food crops (maize, rice and cassava). Robustness of the identified adaptation options adopted by local farmers was examined with a view to evaluating the opportunities of integrating indigenous adaptation options for climate-smart agriculture (CSA). A regional climate–crop modeling system (RegCM-DSSAT) and structured questionnaire were used for the study. A warmer and wetter future climate was projected with higher frequency of occurrence of false start of rainfall. Results also suggested future rise in the yield of cassava (8.2%) but declines in maize (− 9.2%) and rice (− 3.6%). Use of organic fertilizer, irrigation or fadama farming system and change in planting dates were ranked highly efficient indigenous adaptation strategies for improved crop yields. Model simulations projected 3.9% increase in cassava yield when irrigation farming system was adopted. This approach was found to offset the negative impact of future warming on the yields of maize and rice and increased their yields by 6.53% and 1.31%, respectively. Combined use of fertilizer and change in planting date was found to significantly enhance yields of maize (27.53%) and rice (21.49%). The paper concludes that integrated approach to indigenous climate change adaptation strategies, as required in CSA, could significantly reduce negative effects of future warming on food crop yields. © 2019, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).","Cassava; Climate change impacts; Climate-smart agriculture; Crop yield; Fadama; Farming systems; Irrigation; Maize; Regional climate–crop modeling system; Rice","Crops; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Plants (botany); Cassava; Climate change impact; Crop model; Crop yield; Fadama; Farming system; Maize; Rice; Smart agricultures; Climate change; alternative agriculture; cassava; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; indigenous knowledge; irrigation; maize; rice; risk assessment; Nigeria; Osun; Manihot esculenta; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070323303

The developed method can estimate hourly generation amounts with spatial resolutions of 1-km mesh. It was applied to Fukushima Prefecture, located in the northeast region of Japan. To establish future scenarios three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and seven Global Climate Models (GCM) were analyzed, and uncertainties caused by differences in future scenarios were investigated.

These changes affect all fishing activities, from small-scale to industrial fishing, and have implications for livelihoods, economies, and society along the entire seafood supply chain. Understanding fisheries as social-ecological systems (SESs) that include dynamic responses and feedbacks for the targeted stocks, the fishers, and the fishing industry provides an essential standpoint for thinking about fisheries’ adaptation to climate change. In this Perspective, we briefly summarize the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of target species’ distribution shifts. We propose using a resilience perspective where fishery SESs can respond to climate changes by maintaining, coping, adapting, and/or transforming the system. In this context, we identify what specific actions by individuals, groups, and institutions allow the fishery system to respond in these ways and discuss policy solutions to allow for adaptation and transformation to shifting species distributions. © 2020 The Authors","fishery; fishing livelihoods; resilience; SES; species distributions; transformation","climate change; climate effect; environmental disturbance; environmental impact; fishery management; fishing community; geographical distribution; livelihood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090120427

The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Pará state and the Itacaiúnas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Economic incentives; Natural regeneration; Reforestation; Seed availability; Socioeconomic benefits; Species selection","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Conservation; Cost reduction; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land reclamation; Land use; Laws and legislation; Research and development management; Restoration; Seed; Timber; Water resources; Carbon sequestration; Implementation cost; Landscape restoration; National legislation; Natural regeneration; Protection of water resources; Socio-economic benefits; Vegetation protection; Reforestation; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; commercialization; ecosystem service; environmental protection; habitat restoration; land use; management practice; mitigation; native species; policy implementation; reforestation; seedling; soil management; water resource; Agronomy; Biodiversity; Carbon; Commerce; Conservation; Cost Control; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Bos",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083445700

We included original research studies reporting the development and validation of imaging feature-based models. The overall quality, the standard of reporting and the advancements towards clinical practice were assessed. Eighteen out of the 24 selected articles were classified as ""highquality"" studies according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS- 2). The 18 ""high-quality papers"" adhered to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) with a mean of 62.9%. The majority of ""highquality"" studies (16/18) were classified as phase II. The most commonly used imaging predictors were radiomic features, followed by visual qualitative computed tomography (CT) features, convolutional neural network-based approaches and positron emission tomography (PET) parameters, all used alone or combined with clinicopathologic features. The majority (14/18) were focused on the prediction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Thirty-five imaging-based models were built to predict the EGFR status. The model's performances ranged from weak (n = 5) to acceptable (n = 11), to excellent (n = 18) and outstanding (n = 1) in the validation set. Positive outcomes were also reported for the prediction of ALK rearrangement, ALK/ROS1/RET fusions and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Despite the promising results in terms of predictive performance, image-based models, suffering from methodological bias, require further validation before replacing traditional molecular pathology testing. © 2020 by the authors.

While numerous existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies estimate the GHG footprint of LNG, large variation exists in these results. Such variability could be caused by differing project designs, system boundaries, modeling methods and data sources. It is not clear which of these factors is the most important. Here, three research groups from Canada and the US performed independent LCAs of the same planned LNG supply chain from Canada to China. The teams applied different methods and assumptions but used aligned system boundaries and worked with a single upstream producer to obtain production data. The GHG emissions of Canadian LNG to China for power and heat generation were found to be 427–556 g CO2-eq/kWh and 81–92 g CO2-eq/MJ. Compared with Chinese coal for power generation, 291–687 g CO2-eq (34%–62%) reduction can be achieved per kWh of power generated. The central tendency in each study is aligned more closely than the overall uncertainty range: thus, uncertainty caused by fundamental data challenges likely outweighs variability caused by use of different LCA methods. Differences in assumptions and methods among the three teams lead to moderate variation at the stage level, but in better agreement at the life-cycle level, showing the existence of compensating variation. Given the robustness to very different LCA methods, existing literature variation may be explained by project-, location- and operator-dependent parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Canadian liquefied natural gas; China; District heating; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Power generation","Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; District heating; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Power generation; Supply chains; Canada and the US; Central tendencies; China; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Project designs; Research groups; Liquefied natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080120948

However, to achieve high nitrogen removal rate in such a process remains a critical challenge in practical application. This work investigated the interactions between n-DAMO and Anammox in membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) and then developed operational strategies of MBfR for high rate nitrogen removal from landfill leachate. Initially, influent containing nitrate and ammonium facilitated the development of n-DAMO and Anammox microorganisms in MBfR, but nitrogen removal performance is hard to be further improved even deteriorated. Detailed investigations of interactions among n-DAMO and Anammox microorganisms confirmed that extra addition of nitrite into MBfR fed with nitrate and ammonium not only stimulated the activities of Anammox bacteria, but also enhanced the activities of n-DAMO archaea from 172.3 to 356.9 mg NO3−-N L−1 d−1. Functional gene analysis also indicated that mcrA and hzsA genes increased after nitrite addition. Based on this finding, influent containing NO3−, NO2− and NH4+ enabled nitrogen removal rates of MBfR increase from 224.9 to 888.2 mg N L−1 d−1. Finally, nitrate in the influent was gradually replaced with nitrite to mimic the effluent from partial nitriation of landfill leachate, but maintain the nitrate availability for n-DAMO archaea through increasing nitrate production from Anammox. These operation strategies enabled MBfR achieve the steady state with a nitrogen removal rate of 6.1 kg N m−3 d−1. Microbial community analysis revealed n-DAMO archaea, n-DAMO bacteria and Anammox bacteria jointly dominated the biofilm, and their relative abundance dynamically shifted with feeding regime. This work provides promising operational strategies for high rate of nitrogen removal from landfill leachate through integrating n-DAMO and Anammox process. © 2020 The Authors","Anammox; Interactions; Landfill leachate; Membrane biofilm reactor; Nitrate/nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation; Nitrogen removal; Operational strategies","Bacteria; Beam plasma interactions; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Effluents; Genes; Leachate treatment; Methane; Nitrates; Oxidation; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic methane oxidations; ANAMMOX; Landfill leachates; Membrane biofilm reactor; Operational strategies; Nitrogen removal; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; ammonium; bacterium; biofilm; genetic analysis; landfill; leachate; methane; nitrate; operations technology; oxidation; wastewater treatment; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anaerobic metabolism; Article; batch process; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameter); gene; genetic analysis; heavy metal removal; hzsA gene; landfill leachate; mcrA gene; microbial interaction; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; denitrification; organismal interaction; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Microbial Interactions; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082680311

This paper looks at the changes in forest-specific legislation applicable to regular productive forests, across 28 European countries. We compare the legal framework applicable in the mid-1990s with that applicable in 2015, using the Property Rights Index in Forestry (PRIF) to measure changes across time and space. The paper shows that forest owners in most western European countries already had high decision-making power in the mid-1990s, following deregulation trends from the 1980s; and for the next two decades, distribution of rights remained largely stable. For these countries, the content and direction of changes indicate that the main pressure on forest-focused legislation comes from environmental discourses (e.g. biodiversity and climate change policies). In contrast, former socialist countries in the mid-1990s gave lower decision-making powers to forest owners than in any of the Western Europe countries; over the next 20 years these show remarkable changes in management, exclusion and withdrawal rights. As a result of these changes, there is no longer a clear line between western and former socialist countries with respect to the national governance systems used to address private forest ownership. Nevertheless, with the exception of Baltic countries which have moved towards the western forest governance system, most of the former socialist countries still maintain a state-centred approach in private forest management. Overall, most of the changes we identified in the last two decades across Europe were recorded in the categories of management rights and exclusion rights. These changes reflect the general trend in European forest policies to expand and reinforce the landowners’ individual rights, while preserving minimal rights for other categories of forest users; and to promote the use of financial instruments when targeting policy goals related to the environmental discourse. © 2020 The Authors","Forest governance; Institutional changes; PRIF; Private ownership; Property rights","Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision making; Public policy; Sustainable development; Forest governance; Institutional change; PRIF; Private ownerships; Property right; Forestry; Biodiversity; Decision Making; Forest Management; Forestry; Legislation; Paper; Public Ownership; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082106153

Major challenges in the field include methods to efficiently restrict ESDBR and enhance AIE performance without using bulky substituents (e.g., tetraphenylethylene and triphenylamine). In this study, we rationally developed fluoro-substituent AIEgens with stronger intermolecular H-bonding interaction for restricted molecular motions and increased crystal density, leading to decreased nonradiative decay rate by one order of magnitude. The adjusted ESDBR properties also show a corresponding response to variation in viscosity. Furthermore, their aggregation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations have been discovered. The application of such planar AIEgen in treating multidrug-resistant bacteria has been demonstrated in a mouse model. The relationship between ROS generation and distinct E/Z-configurational stacking behaviors have been further understood, providing a design principle for synthesizing planar AIEgen-based photosensitizers. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With the consideration of real driving emissions, the reduction in NOx emissions in high transient engine operation becomes even more challenging. Apart from increasing the complexity of exhaust aftertreatment systems, internal engine measures play a major role. The approach to reducing NOx emissions described in this paper uses the precise control of the combustion. For this purpose, the method of digital combustion rate shaping control is applied, which allows the realization of a predefined combustion by automatically adapting the injection profile during operation. Within this work, this controller is extended in order to control the predefined combustion trace based on target NOx values. First, the working principal of the state-of-the-art digital combusting rate shaping controller is explained. In the next step, the design and strategy of the extended control approach are explained and validated. Finally, its potential to reduce engine-out NOx emissions during transient driving situations is evaluated based on simulations of the WLTC. It is shown that the control concept fulfills the requirements and is able to effectively reduce high NOx peaks during transient operation. © 2020, China Society of Automotive Engineers (China SAE).","Closed loop combustion control; Combustion rate shaping; Diesel engine; Emission control; NOx Control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091830230

Using CCU technologies to consume waste feedstocks can cut production costs; benefit the environment; monetize industrial emissions; and, depending on the region, allow companies to meet CO2 emissions goals. Moreover, using waste carbon to make chemicals can also reduce manufacturers' reliance on fossil fuels such as crude petroleum and natural gas, an important factor, particularly for the European Union and China, given the volatility in sourcing and pricing of fossil fuels, especially those that are imported. This working paper: 1) explains carbon's critical role in the production of chemicals and as a target for industrial emissions reduction; 2) describes new CCU technologies stemming from advances in fields such as industrial biotechnology and electrolysis; 3) identifies sectors and geographical locales in which these technologies are being adopted, as well as factors driving adoption; and 4) examines potential implications for US and global industrial competitiveness within one sector with high emissions, the steel industry. This paper concludes that these CCU technologies are promoting a paradigm shift that has the potential to increase firm-level competitiveness for manufacturers that adopt these processes, while also reducing the environmental impact of these manufacturers. To the extent that these technologies become widely adopted, they could result in substantial increases in supply of such chemicals globally, with potential disruptive impacts on trade and prices. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon monoxide; Competition; Crude oil price; Emission control; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Metal drawing; Natural gasoline plants; Steelmaking; Carbon feedstock; Chemical companies; European union; Industrial biotechnology; Industrial competitiveness; Paradigm shifts; Production cost; Working papers; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092674326

The scheme consists of two phases. At the first stage, sources' locations and emission rates, i.e., source term estimation, as a function of the model's parameter space are sought (“backward computation”). Then, the source term is used to generate the dense maps utilizing the same dispersion model (“forward computation”). The algorithm is model-invariant to the dispersion model, and thus is suitable for a wide range of applications according to the required accuracy and available resources. A simulation of an industrial area demonstrated that this method produced more accurate maps than current state-of-the-art techniques.

Nevertheless, deforestation and forest degradation are rampant in many parts of the world. In particular, the Amazonian rainforest faces the constant threats posed by logging, mining, and burning for agricultural expansion. In Brazil, the ""Sete de Setembro Indigenous Land"", a protected area located in a lowland tropical forest region at the border between the Mato Grosso and Rondonia states, is subject to illegal deforestation and therefore necessitates effective vegetation monitoring tools. Optical satellite imagery, while extensively used for landcover assessment and monitoring, is vulnerable to high cloud cover percentages, as these can preclude analysis and strongly limit the temporal resolution. We propose a cloud computing-based coupled detection strategy using (i) cloud and cloud shadow/vegetation detection systems with Sentinel-2 data analyzed on the Google Earth Engine with deep neural network classification models, with (ii) a classification error correction and vegetation loss and gain analysis tool that dynamically compares and updates the classification in a time series. The initial results demonstrate that such a detection system can constitute a powerful monitoring tool to assist in the prevention, early warning, and assessment of deforestation and forest degradation in cloudy tropical regions. Owing to the integrated cloud detection system, the temporal resolution is significantly improved. The limitations of the model in its present state include classification issues during the forest fire period, and a lack of distinction between natural vegetation loss and anthropogenic deforestation. Two possible solutions to the latter problem are proposed, namely, the mapping of known agricultural and bare areas and its subsequent removal from the analyzed data, or the inclusion of radar data, which would allow a large amount of finetuning of the detection processes. © 2020 by the authors.","Analysis-ready data; Cloud cover; Cloud shadow; Deep learning; Deforestation; Google earth engine; Landcover; Rainforest; Sentinel-2; Vegetation","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deep neural networks; Deforestation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Error correction; Neural networks; Satellite imagery; Time series analysis; Tropics; Vegetation; Agricultural expansion; Amazonian rainforest; Assessment and monitoring; Classification errors; Neural network classification; Optical satellite imagery; Temporal resolution; Vegetation monitoring; Patient monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086442347

Transformation of a city system into a smart system is meant to improve the quality of life for its people and their way of living, its environment, economy, transport, and governance. Due to benefits associated with the concept of the smart city and associated implementation challenges, traditional city systems have been undergoing transformation into smart city systems. However, observed approaches of transformation presented disconnected and fragmented city systems that usually hamper the interaction of city subsystems with the efficient and environmentally friendly urban environment. This work emphasizes the systematic view of a city system and proposes a novel method of smart city system integration. The results of our study show that in a smart city environment, where ecosystem services are valorised, air pollution emitted by vehicles can be removed by taking into consideration information related to air pollution reduction.

These advanced technologies bring about numerous benefits and has begun to play a major role in daily lives, particularly data mining applied in precision agriculture to discover knowledge. Also in agro-industrial production chain, the combination of wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries is outstanding. Mobile IoT such as narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) and the long-term evolution (LTE) for machines (LTE-M) are significant innovations of this accelerating development of IoT technologies. In the era of ubiquitous communication where everything is connected to the internet, NB-IoT systems are expected to offer better quality-of-services (QoS) to end users than the traditional IoT paradigm. However, offering better QoS satisfaction to end users will become a great challenge due to the bottleneck caused by the dual problem of increasing IoT use cases and the shortage of wireless spectrum resources. Whilst discussing the recent innovative solutions of NB-IoT resource allocation, significant challenges and open issues related to the real-time implementation of NB-IoT are identified and discussed. Therefore, this paper gives a general overview of the resource allocation solutions in this NB-IoT innovation and further suggests and motivates for the intelligentization of future resource allocation solutions (i.e., the use of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies). © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Intelligentization; Internet of Things; Long-term evolution; Machine learning; Narrowband-IoT; Resource allocation","Agricultural robots; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Real time control; Resource allocation; Telecommunication industry; Advanced technology; Climatic conditions; Industrial production; Innovative solutions; Internet of thing (IOT); Literature reviews; Real-time implementations; Ubiquitous communication; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091920077

These facts combined with the reality that residential energy use alone, accounts for almost 40% of global energy emissions indicates that the challenge of reducing our profligate use of residential energy, and thus reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, is first and foremost an urban challenge and opportunity. The theme of this paper is prioritisation. By prioritising the development of low rise, integrated-mixed-use developments we are facilitating energy use in the most efficient and beneficial way, toward achieving these reductions. Furthermore the paper argues that such developments are also societally enriching by the creation of another layer of understanding of the urban environment, achieved through reflecting key energy engagements between buildings, uses and sites. The energy logic of such mixed use developments is further justified and enabled, if combined with the reuse of serviced 'brownfield' urban sites, a variety of user profiles, long life facilitation of habitation use, and resource efficiencies; all achieved whilst facilitating low carbon living at an urban microscale. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Regional planning; Brown fields; Design strategies; Global energy; Residential energy; Resource efficiencies; Resource optimisation; Urban environments; User profile; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088437741

Electrochemical water-salt splitting to generate useful chemicals is an ideal method to valorize wastewater from desalination and incentivize its collection, which can expand the adoption of desalination to inland regions. We designed a three-chamber electrochemical cell that splits brine to generate an acid (HCl) and a base (NaOH). The three chambers were separated by an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), and the reactor operated robustly in various realistic brine concentrations (13,000-35,000 ppm NaCl). Buffer species, including carbonate, borate, and phosphate, reduced proton leakage through the AEM and did not introduce other side reactions. By testing several anodes for stability and selectivity toward oxygen evolution, we found that graphite carbon exhibited a 25% higher acid generation than mixed-metal oxides (Ti-Ir and Ti-Pt) and a 69% selectivity toward oxygen evolution because of a lower chloride adsorption on its surface (44% less chloride oxidized).

Nevertheless, to use wind energy properly, the environmental circumstances and geographical location related to wind intensity should be considered as a priority. Different factors may affect the selection of a suitable location for developments of wind power plants; thus, these factors should be considered concurrently to identify the optimum location of wind plants. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, first, basic data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used, then dual DEA was used and, finally, Anderson Petersen (AP) model of dual DEA was selected to prioritize cities or decision-making units (DMUs). Numerical Taxonomy (NT) method was also used to assess the validity of AP dual model in DEA. The prescribed approach was applied for five cities in East Azerbaijan province of Iran. Findings: The results indicate that wind power as a renewable energy can be harnessed in few cities, and the ranking by DEA illustrated that the city of Tabriz is the first priority. Practical implications: Low environmental degradation effects in comparison to other methods and the ability to utilization at a widespread level include the benefits of using wind energy in the generation of electricity. In this regard, the study of relevant potentials and finding suitable locations for the deployment of wind energy utilization equipment are essential. Using DEA method helps us to choose optimal locations according to different criteria. Social implications: Wind energy is justifiable in reducing social costs in comparison with fossil fuel plants, which includes negative effects, and its electricity can be used as a sustainable energy in the country's economic, social and cultural development. Originality/value: For identifying the most proper location for development of wind power plants in Iran, DEA is applied for the first time to prioritize the suitable locations for installations of wind turbines among five different cities in the East Azerbaijan region. A number of crucial factors including land price, distance to power, rate of natural hazards, wind speed and topography are considered for location optimization of wind turbines for the first time. Also, to validate the results of DEA method, NT method is used to assess the validity of AP dual model in DEA. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","DEA; Green energy; Location planning; Prioritization; Wind turbine","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Location; Numerical methods; Topography; Wind; Wind turbines; Decision making unit; Design/methodology/approach; Fossil-fuel plants; Geographical locations; Location optimization; Numerical taxonomy; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077542788

Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the westernmost fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br−) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8–75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3–13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8–13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1–8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br− rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111–253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br−] of interstitial waters (129 μg/L–79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1–508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14–173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic “model”. As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br− upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","(De)bromination; Autochthonous plants; Climate; Peatlands; Phytovolatilization; Salt marshes","Bioaccumulation; Bromine; Chlorine compounds; Wetlands; (De)bromination; Autochthonous plants; Climate; Peat land; Phytovolatilization; Salt marshes; Bromine compounds; bromine; chloride; methyl bromide; organic matter; rain; sea water; bromine; biogeochemical cycle; bromide; bromine; climate effect; enrichment; geodynamics; peatland; saltmarsh; wetland; Article; Atlantic Ocean; atmosphere; biogeochemical cycle; bromination; coastal waters; concentration (parameter); correlational study; environmental factor; moisture; peatland; pH; Portugal; priority journal; river; sediment; water sampling; wetland; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Portugal; Atlantic Ocean; Bromine; Portugal; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081981438

The proper management of agricultural areas has important implications for ecosystem services (food production, biodiversity, climate regulation and the landscape). In the coming years, an increase of abandoned areas is expected due to socio-economic changes. The identification and quantification of abandoned agricultural plots is key for monitoring this process and for applying management measures. The Valencian Region (Spain) is an important fruit and vegetable producing area in Europe, and it has the most important citrus industry. However, this agricultural sector is highly threatened by diverse factors, which have accelerated land abandonment. Landsat and MODIS satellite images have been used to map land abandonment. However, these images do not give good results in areas with high spatial fragmentation and small-sized agricultural plots. Sentinel-2 and airborne imagery shows unexplored potential to overcome this thanks to higher spatial resolutions. In this work, three models were compared for mapping abandoned plots using Sentinel-2 with 10 m bands, Sentinel-2 with 10 m and 20 m bands, and airborne imagery with 1 m visible and near-infrared bands. A pixel-based classification approach was used, applying the Random Forests algorithm. The algorithm was trained with 144 plots and 100 decision trees. The results were validated using the hold-out method with 96 independent plots. The most accurate map was obtained using airborne images, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Thiam's Transformed Vegetation Index (TTVI), with an overall accuracy of 88.5%. The map generated from Sentinel-2 images (10 m bands and the EVI and TTVI spectral indices) had an overall accuracy of 77.1%. Adding 20 m Sentinel-2 bands and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) did not improve the classification accuracy. According to the most accurate map, 4310 abandoned plots were detected in our study area, representing 32.5% of its agricultural surface. The proposed methodology proved to be useful for mapping citrus in highly fragmented areas, and it can be adapted to other crops. © 2020 by the authors.","Citrus; High-resolution imagery; Image classification; Land abandonment; Machine learning algorithms; Random Forests algorithm; Sentinel-2","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Citrus fruits; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Mapping; Vegetation; Classification accuracy; Enhanced vegetation index; High resolution imagery; MODIS satellite images; Normalized difference moisture indices; Pixel based classifications; Socio-economic change; Visible and near infrared; Image enhancement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088247788

However, dysfunctional trees in terms of urban heat mitigation are dominant in many sub-tropical cities' landscapes due to the lack of scientific basis of tree selection. Therefore, this study proposes and evaluates a methodological framework as an approach for “right tree, right place” for urban heat mitigation through parametric ENVI-met simulations that involve the combination of 54 generic tree forms and 10 characteristic urban morphology – Sky-View Factor (SVF). Results show variable temperature regulation by tree forms (species) with varying magnitude in different urban morphology. Daytime and nighttime temperature regulation effects were between 0.3 °C – 1.0 °C and 0.0 °C – 2.0 °C, respectively depending on tree forms and SVF value. Furthermore, the Heat Reduction Potential (HRP) of trees forms were determined in terms of their human thermal comfort improvement. In general, we found a range of +5% and − 20% depending on SVF, negative and positive values imply heat reduction and increment, respectively. With the competing shading effect of buildings, the HRP of trees reduces from high to low SVF area with variable magnitude among tree forms (species). Hence, the proposed morphology-based tree selection approach was evaluated by comparison with two uninformed selection approaches in a realistic urban neighborhood in Hong Kong.

In the South Pars zone, elevated concentrations of reactive hydrocarbons co-emitted with nitrogen oxides from industrial facilities lead to substantial ozone production downwind. To understand the role of these emissions on the ozone formation and, to formulate appropriate control strategies in this zone, emissions of precursors of ozone were quantified, and compounds that deserve relatively more attention were determined. To do this, first, a fully-speciated ozone precursors emission inventory was prepared to provide necessary input data for air quality simulation models. Then, the emission inventory was weighted by emitted mass and incremental reactivity scales to determine which compounds deserve relatively more detailed representation in the modeling. Afterward, a photochemical model was applied to determine the ozone sensitivity to its precursors. Finally, source apportionment was done for the most important compounds. Additionally, the reactivity-based inventory was compared with other regions. Results show that nitrogen oxides sensitive chemistry is dominant in the zone thus the most effective control strategy is the mitigation of the nitrogen oxides emissions. Gas refinery plants have a larger share than petrochemical plants in the nitrogen oxides emission and, the gas turbines are the main sources of nitrogen oxides emission in this region. Emitted volatile organic compounds contain more highly reactive species in comparison with the ambient air composition of typical urban areas and areas with gas production industries. Propylene and ethylene have the most contribution to the ozone formation in comparison with other volatile organic compounds. The major sources of their emissions are the olefin processes and polymer production plants. © 2020, Iranian Institute of Research and Development in Chemical Industries.

Using meterwave data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we present the first successful detection of impulsive emissions down to flux densities of ∼mSFU, about two orders of magnitude weaker than earlier attempts. These impulsive emissions have durations ≲1 s and are present throughout the quiet solar corona. The fractional time occupancy of these impulsive emissions at a given region is ≲10%. The histograms of these impulsive emissions follow a power-law distribution and show signs of clustering at small timescales. Our estimate of the energy that must be dumped in the corona to generate these impulsive emissions is consistent with the coronal heating requirements. Additionally, the statistical properties of these impulsive emissions are very similar to those recently determined for magnetic switchbacks by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We hope that this work will lead to a renewed interest in relating these weak impulsive emissions to the energy deposited in the corona, the quantity of physical interest from a coronal heating perspective, and explore their relationship with the magnetic switchbacks observed by the PSP. © 2020.

Four alternative scenarios are developed for the 2014–2050 period to assess national and regional benefits of alternative energy development strategies. The study finds that electricity trading scenarios out-perform a reference scenario that assumes no energy trading, lowering systems cost by 4.5–7.2%. Total systems costs are lower, even when transmission costs for trade are considered. Costs are also lower with increased generation from renewables compared to investments without regional trade. Investing in renewables has important co-benefits, such as improved energy security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Supporting energy trade not only reduces systems costs, but can also strengthen cooperation in the region, as reflected in the energy trading efforts of the East African Power Pool and the transboundary collaboration efforts of the Nile Basin Initiative. © 2020 The Authors","Energy security; Energy trading; Optimization; Renewable energy target; TIMES model","Electric power system interconnection; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Power markets; Alternative energy; Collaboration efforts; Electricity sector; Electricity trading; Modelling framework; Regional trade; Trans-boundary; Transmission costs; Costs; alternative energy; cost analysis; greenhouse gas; investment; long-term change; optimization; trade-environment relations; Egypt; Ethiopia; Nile Basin; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084078979

APTI is calculated from parameters that are affected by air pollutants, such as ascorbic acid content, total chlorophyll content, relative water content and pH of leaf extract. In this study we report APTI values of two common tree species (Celtis occidentalis and Tilia sp.) in Debrecen, Hungary. We also ran a meta-analysis to compare APTI values among various global cities and land use types (industrial, roadside and urban) using robust ANOVA. APTI's relationship with city population and PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm) was analysed using regression modelling and Principal Component Analysis. We applied Random Forest Regression for statistical model building. We demonstrated that the tolerance of tree species is higher in industrial areas and in cities with high pollution levels than in control areas. We found a strong positive correlation between APTI and the size of cities. The cities showed a separation along the first principal component, which was also correlated with APTI and the size of cities.

Of the three microalgae isolates, the interaction of Scenedesmus sp. UKM9 with bacteria showed the highest COD and PO4 3− removal percentages. For NH4 + removal, all three isolates showed removal of more than 80 % in both sterilized and unsterilized POME. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the quantities of bacteria were constant after the treatment, while the quantities of microalgae changed.

Among the various disasters, the frequency and severity of cyclones have increased at an alarming rate in the last two decades, which is attributed to climatic change. The state government of Odisha has made great strides in reducing the lives lost in the state, but an increase in economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure has become a point of worry. Considering the power sector as the most crucial of all critical infrastructures, this paper explores the impact that cyclones have had on the sector in the last two decades in Odisha. The 4R concept of robustness, redundancy, rapidity and resourcefulness is applied to the power sector, and how this is supported by governance is studied. The study points towards need for the master planning of critical infrastructure, based on the risk assessment, establishment of funding mechanisms for mitigation measures and the standardization and quality checking of power sector equipment to withstand the wind speeds of category 4 and above. There needs to be a good coordination between the power sector and the disaster management sector with proper legislative provision. Knowledge management, training and capacity building is another important issue which needs to be focused on. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate and disaster resilience; Critical infrastructure; Cyclone; Odisha; Power sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087514326

Passenger electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as a viable solution to the rapidly increasing global GHG emissions from ICE vehicles. This study investigated the future impact of perceived adoption of electric vehicles in Gauteng Province of South Africa on carbon emissions. Estimations of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were made with data from 2000 to 2018 to provide a reference period for the analysis. Projections of CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2030 were undertaken using three future cases, namely: mitigation, business as usual, and high economic growth based on the projected 20% population of electric vehicles, and four scenarios representing varying proportions of different types of EVs. The results showed an increasingly significant trend in CO2 emissions during the reference period. CO2 emissions estimated using the mitigation case showed an overall reduction in emissions of between 30% and 35%, depending on the scenario. The business as usual case showed an increase in emissions of 1-5% by 2030. The high economic growth case showed a high increase in CO2 emissions of 35-41% by 2030. The study indicates a need to accelerate the adoption of EVs with a 20% projection of the vehicle population still not enough to make a meaningful contribution towards decreasing CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles. © 2020 by the authors.","GHG emissions; Policy recommendations; Transport emissions","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Internal combustion engines; Population statistics; Vehicles; Business-as-usual; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Direct carbons; Economic growths; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Passenger vehicles; Viable solutions; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; electric vehicle; future prospect; scenario analysis; trend analysis; Gauteng; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086987756

Air concentrations of minor and trace elements (Al, As, Br, Ca, Cd, Cl, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, S, Si, Sb, and Zn) in TSP were determined by means of wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). From these data, the main ionic composition of particulate matter was inferred by means of a species correlation/ratio-derived approach, based on former studies of the region. Enrichment factors, bivariate correlations, diagnostic ratios, and chemical mass closures were calculated utilizing the concentration data of TSP constituents for each site in order to reveal the emission sources. A couple of diagnostic ratios (Ni/Cd, Zn/Cd, Br/Ni, Ni/Sb) were useful for source identification, e.g., motor vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. Significant increases in concentrations of As, Br, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were observed, as compared to results for the city before 2010.

However, tailing sands used in reclamation contain residual hydrocarbons and plants growing in these areas may rely on hydrocarbon-degrading endophytic bacteria to survive. This study assessed the hydrocarbon-degrading potential (genes: CYP153, alkB and nah) of culturable and unculturable endophytic bacteria associated with annual barley (Hordeum vulgare) and sweet clover (Melilotus albus) plants in an oil sands reclamation area. Our results suggest higher CYP153 gene copy numbers in sweet clover when compared to barley. Yet, no significant differences were detected in 16S rRNA, alkB and nah genes. In addition, total hydrocarbons, pH, total soil carbon, organic carbon and total nitrogen play an important role in determining hydrocarbon-degrading potential in these communities. The assessment of culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria revealed 42 isolates (total of 316) that were positive for at least one hydrocarbon-degrading gene. Most of these isolates were positive for alkB, and closely match the database for Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter spp. Thus, to improve oil sands reclamation strategies, plant inoculation with select hydrocarbon-degrading endophytes could be used to increase plant tolerance and hydrocarbon degradation in these areas. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Endophytic bacteria; hydrocarbon degradation; land reclamation","hydrocarbon; petroleum; RNA 16S; bioremediation; Canada; microbiology; oil and gas field; soil pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Canada; Hydrocarbons; Oil and Gas Fields; Petroleum; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078631763

It is generally accepted that management practices intending to increase forage production (e.g. decreasing grazing density) result in increased soil C stocks by increasing the return of biomass inputs to the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. However, the contribution of C inputs to stable SOC versus GHG losses, and how this is affected by soil properties, remains largely unknown, particularly within subtropical biomes. To investigate the role of soil texture and mineralogy on SOC stabilisation, we identified three different soil types with varying physical properties in close proximity (&lt; 2 km2) to each other. We used isotopically labelled plant material (13C), placed on the soil surface versus incorporated within the mineral soil, to trace the fate of fresh residue inputs into SOM fractions that differed in their degree of protection and mechanistic interactions with the soil matrix. Weekly GHG measurements (CO2, N2O and CH4) were taken to understand the overall GHG balance resulting from C inputs (i.e. SOC accrual versus GHG losses in CO2 equivalents). In finer textured soils with a greater smectite content, SOC accrual was greater but was significantly outweighed by GHG losses, primarily from native SOC priming. The incorporation of residue within the soil increased residue-derived SOC accrual by 4- to 5-fold, whilst also suppressing the priming of native SOC. This improved understanding of how soil texture and residue placement affect the global warming mitigation potential of subtropical grassland soils will be important in determining identifiable regions that should be targeted for SOC restoration efforts by increasing C inputs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C priming effect; C sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Decomposition; GHG fluxes; SOC stabilisation; Soil texture; Stable isotopes","biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; global warming; grassland soil; grazing; mineralogy; organic carbon; smectite; soil organic matter; soil surface; soil texture; soil type; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085289820

Market forces are an inherent part of consequential LCA and the practice of coupling economic models with life cycle inventory data has increased in popularity. Nevertheless, the actual relationship between the price of a commodity and potential changes to its life cycle inventory has rarely been discussed explicitly. The adoption price effect refers to a change in a product’s environmental impact associated with a change in price, calculated on a functional unit basis. The price of a product influences the type and quantity of incumbent product(s) it displaces. This study provides insights on when the adoption price of a product is likely to influence its life cycle inventory and also identifies conditions where adoption price is expected to have negligible effects on inventory results. Methods: A switchgrass bioenergy case is used to demonstrate the adoption price effect on life cycle inventory results when introducing a new product (i.e., switchgrass) into a system with multiple incumbents (i.e., crops, hay, pasture). This study estimates the adoption price effect on nutrient emissions by coupling biogeochemical models with a simplified economic breakeven model that estimates potential switchgrass adoption. Results and discussion: In this case study, high switchgrass prices correspond to nitrate emission reductions that are three times greater than low switchgrass prices (0.67 kg N reduced/Mg switchgrass vs 0.21 kg N reduced/Mg switchgrass). The large adoption price effect found within the Southeastern USA is due to the highly heterogeneous landscape in the region. There is no single dominant land use, each incumbent product has a different environmental baseline, and each is displaced at a different switchgrass price range. Meanwhile, the adoption price effect is expected to be negligible in mostly homogenous landscapes, such as the more commonly studied Corn Belt, which has a single dominant incumbent in the form of corn-soy production. In addition to the specific case study, this analysis discusses general adoption conditions likely to lead to adoption price effects when conducting consequential LCA. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biofuels; Consequential life cycle assessment (LCA); Diffusion of innovation; Emerging technology; Land use change; Product adoption; Switchgrass; Water quality","adoption price effect; Article; bioenergy; biogeochemical model; chemical model; controlled study; cost; crop; economic breakeven model; environment; environmental impact; hay; land use; life cycle assessment; maize; nonbiological model; nonhuman; nutrient; Panicum virgatum; pasture; priority journal; soy food; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084455956

And first of all, this is due to the change in the proportionality and concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, PFC (perfluorocarbons). This paper analyzes the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change has many consequences on human health throughout the world, especially in African countries. The growth of greenhouse gas emissions is viewed as a cause of infectious and non-infectious diseases, negative effects on nutrition, water security and other social disruptions. The global average temperature gradually increases, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration has exceeded 400 ppm due to the intensification of greenhouse effect. The method of energy balance was featured to simulate the trends in Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecast in different sectors until 2030. Through sensitivity analysis, we found that the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from people (cars and households) would deescalate the consequences of the above trends. Emissions are mostly associated with industries, which can be reduced if local Government will want to achieve the Paris Agreement goal. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Climate change; Emission reduction; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084729383

Unfortunately, they typically present biases due to parameterizations, choices of numerical schemes, and the complexity of many physical processes. Beyond improving the models themselves, a way to improve the performance of the modeled climate is to consider multi-model combinations. In the present study, we propose a method to select the models that yield a multi-model ensemble combination that efficiently reproduces target features of the observations. We used a neural classifier (self-organizing maps), associated with a multi-correspondence analysis to identify the models that best represent some target climate property. We can thereby determine an efficient multi-model ensemble. We illustrated the methodology with results focusing on the mean sea surface temperature seasonal cycle in the Senegalo- Mauritanian region. We compared 47 CMIP5 model configurations to available observations. The method allows us to identify a subset of CMIP5 models able to form an efficient multi-model ensemble. The future decrease in the Senegalo- Mauritanian upwelling proposed in recent studies is then revisited using this multi-model selection. © Author(s) 2020.",,"assessment method; CMIP; complexity; numerical method; observational method; parameterization; performance assessment; sea surface temperature; seasonality; upwelling; Mauritania; Senegal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086948462

These volcanoes are among the most prolific sources of volcanic SO2 pollution on earth. Objective: We investigated the possible spatiotemporal relationships between volcanic degassing represented by eruptive emissions of SO2 that occurred between 2000 and 2010, and the incidence of acute respiratory symptoms (ARS) in populations living in areas up to more than 100 km from the volcanoes. Methodology: The total flux of SO2 emitted during eruptions since 2000 and the average spatial distribution of the volcanic plume (2004-2008) were based on publicly available remote sensing data. The monthly numbers of adults and children reporting acute respiratory symptoms were extracted from health data collected routinely by selected local health centres and hospitals between 2000 and 2010. The monthly numbers of persons with ARS recorded during or after eruptions were compared with those recorded before eruptions, using negative binomial regression models allowing the calculation of incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence intervals. We first compared years with and without eruptions and then considered shorter time-windows (months). Results: In the investigated area, ARS were the second most frequent cause of medical visits (12.2%, n = 3.2 million cases), after malaria (32.3%, n = 8.4 million cases). SO2 emissions gradually increased 30 to 50 times in 2010 compared to 2002. Taking 1999 as a reference, the IRR for ARS increased three-fold between 2000 [0.9 (0.8, 1.1)] and 2009 [2.8 (2.2, 3.7)]. Although the incidence of ARS appeared to increase after some eruptions, especially in areas close (< 26 km) to the volcanoes, we did not find a consistent temporal association between the yearly incidence of ARS and volcanic eruptions when considering the entire observation period. When we analysed shorter time-windows (6 months in the year preceding an eruption), we observed increased ARS incidences in eruptive months, except in 2010. IRRs were increased for centres situated close to volcanoes (< 26 km) in 2001 and 2002. Conclusion: ARS incident cases increased over the years in populations living around the Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo volcanoes, but we found no consistent evidence for an association between the yearly incidence of ARS and volcanic eruptions or the intensity of SO2 emissions, possibly because of interference with man-made events, including massive population displacements caused by insecurity in the area. Nevertheless, some evidence was found for increased incidence of ARS following eruptions, especially in areas close to volcanoes. Assessing personal, ground level exposure to SO2 and particulates with adequate controlling for confounding, such as viral and other infections, could clarify the contribution, if any, of volcanic emissions of SO2 to the high burden of respiratory diseases in this region. © 2020 The Author(s).","Active volcanoes; Acute respiratory symptoms; Ambient air pollution; Democratic Republic of Congo; Goma; Nyamulagira-Nyiragongo; Spatial analysis","sulfur dioxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; health impact; health status; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; time series analysis; volcanic eruption; acute respiratory tract disease; air pollution; ambient air; Article; Democratic Republic Congo; disease association; disease burden; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; health center; human; incidence; malaria; medical information system; natural disaster; particulate matter; plume; pollution transport; priority journal; time series analysis; trend study; virus infection; volcano eruption; adverse event; air pollutant; respiratory tract disease; spatiotemporal analysis; volcano; Democratic Republic Congo; Democratic Republic Congo; Nord Kivu; Nyamuragira; Nyiragongo; Air Pollutants; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Incidence; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Sulfur Dioxide; Volcanic Eruptions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086051997

As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere-ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services.

Martin Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR  72701, United States","Purpose: Our aim is to assess the environmental impacts associated with the provision of tap water in Israel and adjacent regions. The main objective of this paper is to present the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the Israeli water supply system in order to evaluate and understand the sources of the largest impacts in the system and derive conclusions related to countries and regions with similar climate using similar water production technologies. Methods: We defined the functional unit of our study to be 1 m3 of potable water distributed to the point-of-use. Our scope includes sub-systems’ operation and infrastructure construction and decommissioning. An LCI dataset of tap water was generated, and an LCA that covers the value chain of the country’s complex water supply system was conducted. The Israeli water supply system includes water abstraction and production from groundwater, surface water, brackish water, and seawater; water treatment; desalination; a national transmission system, which runs throughout the country; and distribution to the final consumer. The study comprises data collection for all components of the Israeli water system, resulting in the first national-level LCA of tap water. The life cycle inventory data comprises energy and chemical consumption, materials for infrastructure, and materials’ transportation. Results and discussion: The processes with the main impacts in most of the environmental categories are the reverse-osmosis desalination of seawater and the long and energy-intensive transmission and distribution system. However, by changing the electricity mix to a cleaner one, the impacts of the water supply system are reduced even more than by reducing the share of desalination. In two impact categories (terrestrial ecotoxicity and mineral resource scarcity), the infrastructure is the major contributor to the total impact. Leakage of water throughout the system also has considerable impacts. As expected, freshwater use decreases with the increase of desalination, which uses seawater rather than depleting freshwater. Conclusions: This LCA represents a region with limited freshwater supply that is dependent on desalination. Israel and adjoining regions in Golan and the West Bank are similar to an increasing number of regions and can be used as a proxy for tap water production in LCAs of products from these regions. High consumption of electricity for desalination is an important cause of the large impact scores of the Israeli water supply system. The high scores are due to using only a small fraction of clean primary fuels in the electricity grid. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Desalination; Life cycle assessment; Water distribution; Water supply; Water treatment","brackish water; fresh water; ground water; sea water; surface water; tap water; Article; case study; climate change; desalination; energy consumption; environmental impact; Israel; life cycle assessment; osmosis; priority journal; semiarid climate; water supply; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083983532

Actions must be taken to restore its environmental quality by managing riparian zones for increased water-self purification. The current study aimed to characterize organic matter (OM) dynamics and humic substances (HS) spectrochemical properties along the lower-middle basin of the Suquía River. Riparian soil (0–20 cm) and sediment (0–10 cm) samples were collected from a reference location (S1) and four polluted sites (S2–S5) during a low-flow period. The contents of soil and sedimentary OM and HS fractions were analyzed by wet oxidation, as well as HS Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrochemical properties. The OM and HS fractions from riparian soil were high upstream of Córdoba City (S1 and S2, 50.2–50.4 g/kg OM) and within a 50 km downstream location (S5, 30.9 g/kg OM) owing to a surplus of fresh plant biomass-carbon (C) inputs. Highly heterogeneous sediment samples did not show any significant differences among sites (P &gt; 0.05). The lowest values of the ratio of absorbances at 465 and 665 nm (E4/E6) (1.78) and the Δ log K (0.15) coefficient (a measure of HS maturity degree) were obtained downstream of Córdoba City, for both riparian soil and sediment, indicating that HS were enriched by more condensed aromatic structures within highly degraded portions of the river. All samples exhibited similar IR spectra, implying overlapping recalcitrant-C structures at the functional group level, but with different absorbance intensity. Data from the current study constitute a baseline for understanding the chemical nature of HS from sediment and riparian soil along the Suquía River and can be used as a reference for future studies tracking OM compositional changes over time. © 2019 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation / the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research","FT-IR spectroscopy; Humic acids; Lotic ecosystems; Organic matter; UV–Vis spectroscopy","FTIR spectroscopy; humic acid; lotic environment; organic matter; riparian zone; river pollution; sediment analysis; soil pollution; Argentina; Cordoba [Argentina]; Suquia Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076244539

In these systems, water-rock interactions generate highly alkaline and reducing fluids that can contain hydrogen, methane, and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons-potent reductants capable of fueling microbial metabolism. In this study, we investigated the microbiota of Hakuba Happo hot springs (∼50°C; pH∼10.5–11), located in Nagano (Japan), which are impacted by the serpentinization process. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences revealed that the bacterial community comprises Nitrospirae (47%), “Parcubacteria” (19%), Deinococcus-Thermus (16%), and Actinobacteria (9%), among others. Notably, only 57 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were detected, and fifteen of these accounted for 90% of the amplicons. Among the abundant ASVs, an early-branching, uncultivated actinobacterial clade identified as RBG-16-55-12 in the SILVA database was detected. Ten single-cell genomes (average pairwise nucleotide identity: 0.98–1.00; estimated completeness: 33–93%; estimated genome size: ∼2.3 Mb) that affiliated with this clade were obtained. Taxonomic classification using single copy genes indicates that the genomes belong to the actinobacterial class-level clade UBA1414 in the Genome Taxonomy Database. Based on metabolic pathway predictions, these actinobacteria are anaerobes, capable of glycolysis, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and CO2 fixation via the Wood–Ljungdahl (WL) pathway. Several other genomes within UBA1414 and two related class-level clades also encode the WL pathway, which has not yet been reported for the Actinobacteria phylum. For the Hakuba actinobacterium, the energy metabolism related to the WL pathway is likely supported by a combination of the Rnf complex, group 3b and 3d [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases, and V-type (H+/Na+ pump) ATPase.

However, the differential margin between electricity supply and demand is chaotic; and only a production/consumption balance could reconcile both ends. The adaptation of energy flows is therefore necessary to confront the gigantic energy waste related to electricity storage challenges. Consequently, electric vehicle batteries recently emerged as a solution to the actual limitation of storage capability. Indeed, they are used in this study as means of storage and retrieval of energy. Thus, this paper proposes a control and regulation algorithm aimed at reaching a balanced production/consumption system. The balance is acquired through the bidirectional control of the energy flows related to domestic residences, electric vehicles and the grid. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization of vehicular charging and discharging is assessed using the genetic algorithm to attain an optimal fulfillment of the system's energetic needs. Once the regulation algorithm is set and the optimizations implemented, the algorithm's simulation is performed using Matlab. Through the developed algorithm, we aim these major findings: 1. Regulate energy flows depending on supply and demand. 2. Optimize charging and discharging modes. 3. Flows merge towards the system's equilibrium state. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bidirectional; Electric vehicles; Electricity production and consumption; Energy flows; Optimization; Regulation","Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Vehicle-to-grid; Bidirectional; Electric vehicle batteries; Electricity production; Electricity supply and demands; Energy flow; Regulation; Storage and retrievals; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081684288

In the Southwest Atlantic, a Seamounts chain near the Abrolhos Bank has been hypothesized as a stable climatic refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This refugium would have allowed recolonization of the present-day shoreline. Here, we integrated paleoclimatic simulations based on ecological niche modeling (ENM) and adopted a phylogeographic approach to assess this hypothesis for the endemic reef-building coral Mussismilia braziliensis. The niche modeling indicated that the potential distribution of M. braziliensis was smaller in the LGM than in the present; however, the predicted climatically stable regions were not located in the Victoria–Trindade seamount chain, but in regions to the north of this chain. Genetic data showed low structure for the three markers used: SRP-54, ITS, and MaSC-1. Our results suggest a scenario in which the M. braziliensis distribution probably followed the sea-level fluctuation, maintaining its latitudinal distribution range since the LGM, and that it was not confined to a reduced climatic refugium, as previously imagined. We highlight the pioneering nature of this study by combining phylogeography and paleoclimate modeling in order to clarify historical processes that resulted in the current scleractinian biodiversity of Brazilian reefs. © 2020, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung.","Abrolhos Bank; Climatic refuges; Last glacial maximum; Pleistocene; Sea-level variation; Victoria–Trindade seamount chain","biodiversity; climate modeling; coral; coral reef; endemic species; Last Glacial Maximum; marine ecosystem; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Pleistocene; recolonization; refugium; sea level change; seamount; Abrolhos Bank; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Australia; Trindade; Victoria [Australia]; Anthozoa; Mussismilia braziliensis; Scleractinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084849551

Hence, alternative high‐quality roughage‐based diets are required to improve milk yield and reduce methane emission (CH4). Thus, we tested the effects of feeding natural pasture hay, improved forage grass hays (Napier and Brachiaria Hybrid), and treated crop residues (Eragrostis tef straw) on nutrient digestibility, milk yield, nitrogen balance, and methane emission. The eight lactating Fogera cows selected for the experiment were assigned randomly to a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Cows were housed in well‐ventilated individual pens and fed a total mixed ration (TMR) comprising 70% roughage and 30% concentrate. The four roughage‐based basal dietary treatments supplemented with formulated concentrate were: Control (natural pasture hay (NPH)); treated teff straw silage (TTS); Napier grass hay (NGH); and Brachiaria hybrid grass hay (BhH). Compared with the control diet, the daily milk yield increased (p < 0.01) by 31.9%, 52.9%, and 71.6% with TTS, NGH, and BhH diets, respectively. Cows fed BhH had the highest dry matter intake (8.84 kg/d), followed by NGH (8.10 kg/d) and TTS (7.71 kg/d); all of these intakes were greater (p = 0.01) than that of NPH (6.21 kg/d). Nitrogen digestibility increased (p < 0.01) from the NPH diet to TTS (by 27.7%), NGH (21.7%), and BhH (39.5%). The concentration of ruminal ammonia nitrogen was higher for cows fed NGH than other diets (p = 0.01) and positively correlated with plasma urea nitrogen concentration (R² = 0.45). Feeding TTS, NGH, and BhH hay as a basal diet changed the nitrogen excretion pathway from urine to feces, which can help protect against environmental pollution. Estimated methane yields per dry matter intake and milk yield were decreased in dairy cows fed BhH, NGH, and TTS diets when compared to cows fed an NPH diet (p < 0.05). In conclusion, feeding of TTS, NGH, and BhH roughages as a basal diet to lactating dairy cows in tropical regions improved nutrient intake and digestibility, milk yield, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and reduced enteric methane emission. © 2020 by the authors.

Such strategies are discussed in a variety of scientific communities, such as sustainability science, industrial ecology and symbiosis and circular economy. However, existing analyses of win-win strategies tend to take a systems perspective, while paying less attention to the specific actors and activities, or their interconnections, which are implicated in win-win strategies. Moreover, they hardly address adaptation WWS. To address these gaps and support the identification and enhancement of WWS for entrepreneurs and policy-makers, we propose a typology of WWS based on the concept of a value-consumption chain, which typically connects several producers with at least one consumer of a good or service. A consideration of these connections allows an evaluation of economic effects in a meso-economic perspective. We distinguish 34 different types of WWS of companies, households and the state, for which 23 real-world examples are identified. Further, contrary to prevailing views on the lack of a business case for adaptation, we do identify real-world adaptation WWS, though they remain underrepresented compared with mitigation WWS. Our typology can be used as an entry point for transdisciplinary research integrating assessment of individual transformative socioeconomic activities and highly aggregated approaches assessing, e.g. the macro-economic effects of WWS. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Green business models; Green entrepreneurs; Mitigation; Typology; Win-win","Climate change; Economics; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Climate change mitigation; Economic perspective; Industrial ecology; Scientific community; Sustainability science; Sustainability transition; Win-win strategies; Economic and social effects; adaptive management; climate change; connectivity; economic cycle; industrial development; interdisciplinary approach; policy making; socioeconomic status; sustainability; typology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084855231

Classifying heat events is particularly relevant for identifying the criteria to activate early warning systems. Heat event classifications may also differ due to heterogeneity in climates among different geographic regions, which may occur at a small scale. Using local meteorological data, we identified heat waves and extreme heat events that were associated with the highest burden of excess hospitalizations within the County of San Diego and quantified discrepancies using county-level meteorological criteria. Methods: Eighteen event classifications were created using various combinations of temperature metric, percentile, and duration for both county-level and climate zone level meteorological data within San Diego County. Propensity score matching and Poisson regressions were utilized to ascertain the association between heat wave exposure and risk of hospitalization for heat-related illness and dehydration for the 1999–2013 period. We estimated both relative and absolute risks for each heat event classification in order to identify optimal definitions of heat waves and extreme heat events for the whole city and in each climate zone to target health impacts. Results: Heat-related illness differs vastly by level (county or zone-specific), definition, and risk measure. We found the county-level definitions to be systematically biased when compared to climate zone definitions with the largest discrepancy of 56 attributable hospitalizations. The relative and attributable risks were often minimally correlated, which exemplified that relative risks alone are not adequate to optimize heat waves definitions. Conclusions: Definitions based on county-level defined thresholds do not provide an accurate picture of the observed health effects and will fail to maximize the potential effectiveness of heat warning systems. Absolute rather than relative risks are a more appropriate measure to define the set of criteria to activate early warnings systems and thus maximize public health benefits. © 2020","Climate and health; Early warning systems; Heat and health","Climatology; Diseases; Hospitals; Population statistics; Public risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Attributable risks; Early Warning System; Event classification; Health benefits; Meteorological data; Poisson regression; Population health; Propensity score matching; Health risks; early warning system; extreme event; health risk; heat wave; meteorology; public health; Article; attributable risk; California; climate change; controlled study; dehydration; disease burden; early warning score; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; extreme hot weather; health impact assessment; heat injury; heat wave; hospitalization; human; meteorological phenomena; population health; priority journal; propensity score; public health; risk factor; California; San Diego County; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081687845

In Taiwan, government-designated EIPs have operated since 1995, with 23 industrial parks currently in operation. This study presents a case from Taiwan, the Linhai Industrial park, and analyzes the park's transition towards industrial symbiosis and resource sharing. Resource sharing modifications resulted in reduced carbon emissions, millions of liters of fuel saved, and thousands of tons of industrial waste recycled. This successful transition was possible because of coordinated government support. Key factors include technological subsidies, policy support, and willing manufacturers.

The consequences of such vegetation changes on soil carbon cycling are still not fully understood. Here, we used an ungulate exclusion experiment to investigate how different levels of herbivory and associated changes in vegetation succession modulate soil CO2 efflux and its heterotrophic and autotrophic sources following windthrow in temperate mountain forests. Our results indicate that only high levels of ungulate herbivory and associated vegetation shifts from tree to rather grass dominated plant communities affect soil CO2 fluxes. We did not find evidence that a moderate herbivory level and accompanied smaller shifts in the functional plant community affect soil CO2 fluxes. A greater soil CO2 efflux under the influence of high herbivory pressure was primarily attributed to accelerated heterotrophic respiration, likely due to warmer soil conditions. Moreover, autotrophic respiration from grass roots and associated microbial communities is suggested to contribute to higher soil CO2 fluxes. We conclude that intense herbivory and accompanied successional changes in the functional plant community enhance soil carbon losses following forest windthrow. This might have negative consequences for the soil carbon stocks and for the climate system. © 2019, The Author(s).","Autotrophic respiration; Forest disturbance; Heterotrophic respiration; Soil CO2 efflux; Succession; Ungulate exclusion","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; herbivory; montane forest; plant community; soil carbon; temperate forest; ungulate; vegetation; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075909230

All these will be present in future transportation that is expected to be connected and automated. While advances in vehicle automation can make cities smarter, safer, cleaner, or more energy efficient, it can also make traffic management increasingly more complicated. As a result, current traffic management tools and policies may become inefficient. Since we already experience systematic growth in Smart City technology around the world, new sets of rules and policies to protect cities and their citizens in the emerging digital and automated era must be developed and enforced. Solutions such as automated driving introduce new challenges and opportunities for climate change mitigation and improvement of traffic conditions in densely urbanized city centers. There are different approaches to integrate autonomous vehicles and their novel functionalities into the traffic management. In this paper we demonstrate such functionalities and their impact on different traffic and environmental parameters based on traffic microscopic simulation adopted to such connected functionality. The results clearly show the need to carefully and individually analyze and prioritize the impact of the CAVs functionalities for each city and each traffic situation individually, as they might have contradictory effects on traffic. The key performance indicators must be defined and the functionalities carefully integrated into the existing traffic management. This is true for the mixed traffic during the early introduction of CAVs in cities even more. © 2020 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; Cooperative infrastructure; Smart City; Traffic management","Automation; Behavioral research; Benchmarking; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Smart city; Climate change mitigation; Environmental parameter; In-vehicle automation; Key performance indicators; Microscopic simulation; Traffic conditions; Traffic management; Traffic situations; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090118037

This has resulted in cement factories being the major sources of dust pollution. Dust emanating from the cements plants deposits on buildings, roadways, on road pavements and plants. The purpose of this study was to determine the concentration of platinum group metals (PGMs) emitted with cement dust on a dust suppressed roadway next to a cement factory in Waterberg, South Africa. The concentrations of PGMs were determined using inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry. This region is well known for large reserves and mining of PGMs such as Pt, Rh, Ru and Pd. The highest concentration in the dust samples collected along the roadway was that of Pt followed by Ru, Rh and Pd. The concentrations of Pt, Ru, Rh and Pd in soil samples decreased with the increase of depth. Water concentration of PGMs decreased at each sampling point in the following order; Pt > Ru > Rh > Pd. Sediments samples were also sampled along the Crocodile River for characterisation of physico-chemical parameters. It was of great importance to also analyse PGMs in soils, water and sediments since, dust settles on them. Elevated concentrations of Pt were observed in all samples and the highest concentrations were partitioned to the small particle size fraction of 32 µm. The pH and electric conductivity (EC) of the sediments were measured and the pH values increased while EC values decreased moving along the river. The most common minerals identified in the dust samples were quartz and calcites. Vehicular emissions were also found to be the major contributor to suspended particulate matter and atmospheric deposition of dust dominantly result from emission from the cement plant. The cement plant was the major polluter through atmospheric deposition of dust particles. The result also revealed that the pH of the Crocodile River was slightly alkaline which was influenced by the effluent from the cement plant. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cement dust; Cement factory; Dust suppressants; Environment; Platinum group metals","Air pollution; Alkalinity; Atmospheric chemistry; Calcite; Cement manufacture; Cement plants; Deposition; Dust; Economics; Effluents; Electromagnetic induction; Meteorological problems; Optical emission spectroscopy; Particle size; Particle size analysis; River pollution; Rivers; Sediments; Soil cement; Soils; Atmospheric depositions; Elevated concentrations; Global economic growth; Inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry; Infrastructural development; Physico - chemical parameters; Platinum group metals; Suspended particulate matters; Cement industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100787283

These chemicals seem to be among the key drivers of TSP genotoxicity. We have shown previously that the mutagenic potencies of the EOM from Limeira, Stockholm, and Kyoto, cities with markedly different meteorological conditions and pollution sources are similar. Here we compare the profiles of non-substituted PAHs (27 congeners), alkyl-PAHs (15 congeners), and nitro-PAHs (7 congeners) from the same EOM samples from these cities. We also compared the genotoxicity profiles using comet and micronucleus assays in human bronchial epithelial cells. The profiles of PAHs, as well as the cytotoxic and genotoxic potencies when expressed in EOM, were quite similar among the studied cities. It seems that despite the differences in meteorological conditions and pollution sources of the cities, removal, mixing, and different atmospheric transformation processes may be contributing to the similarity of the PAHs composition and genotoxicity profiles. More studies are required to verify if this would be a general rule applicable to other cities. Although these profiles were similar for all three cities, the EOM concentration in the atmospheres is markedly different. Thus, the population of Limeira (∼10-fold more EOM/m3 than Stockholm and ∼6-fold more than Kyoto) is exposed to higher concentrations of genotoxic pollutants, and Kyoto's population is 1.5-fold more exposed than Stockholm's. Therefore, to reduce the risk of human exposure to TSP genotoxins, the volume of emissions needs to be reduced. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alkyl-PAHs; comet assay; micronucleus assay; nitro-PAHs; non-substituted PAHs","1 nitropyrene; 2 nitropyrene; 2 phenylnaphthalene; anthracene; benzo[a]fluorene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[b]fluorene; benzo[c]phenanthrene; benzo[e]pyrene; benzo[ghi]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; coronene; dibenzo[a,e]pyrene; dibenzo[a,h]pyrene; dibenzo[a,i]pyrene; dibenzo[a,l]pyrene; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; fluoranthene; indeno[1,2,3 cd]fluoranthene; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; nitropyrene; perylene; phenanthrene; picene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; mutagenic agent; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air pollution; air sampling; Article; chemical composition; city; comet assay; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA strand breakage; EC50; flow cytometry; genotoxicity; HBEC cell line (bronchial epithelium); human; human cell; limit of quantitation; meteorology; micronucleus test; particulate matter; tail intensity; atmosphere; bioassay; cell death; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; double stranded DNA break; drug effect; epithelium cell; particulate matter; suspension; Atmosphere; Biological Assay; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Cities; Comet Assay; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Micronucleus Tests; Mutagens; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Suspensions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085112155

Now, more than ever, the increased environmental pollution and global warming are threatening the stone cultural heritage. Weathering due to physical, chemical and biological factors results in monumental calcareous stone deterioration. These agents induce a progressive dissolution of the mineral matrix, increase porosity, and lead to structural weakening. Bacterial Calcium Carbonate Mineralization is a widespread naturally occurring process which in the last decades was proposed as an environmentally friendly tool to protect monumental and ornamental calcareous stones. The advantage of this treatment is that it mimics the natural process responsible for stone formation, producing a mineral product similar to the stone substrate. This mini review highlights the milestones of the biomineralization approaches with focus on in situ stone artworks protection. The strategies explored to date are based on three main approaches: (i) the use of allochthonous and (ii) autochthonous alive cells that, due to the bacterial metabolism, foster biomineralization; (iii) the cell-free approach which uses fractionated cellular components inducing biomineralization. We discuss the challenging aspects of all these techniques, focusing on in situ applications and suggesting perspectives based on recent advances. © Copyright © 2020 Marvasi, Mastromei and Perito.","biodeposition; bioremediation; calcite biomineralization; cultural heritage; stone conservation; stone microbiota","calcium carbonate; RNA 16S; Acinetobacter; Bacillus subtilis; biomineralization; bioremediation; carbon mineralization; cell component; crystallization; ecological niche; greenhouse effect; metabolomics; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; Review; risk factor; warming",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088099219

The objective of the study was defying method for its assessment. The characteristics of the proposed method are as follows: (1) biogas potential is expressed in electric power of cogeneration units that can operate with biogas produced from available feedstock. Available thermal energy, or biomethane production, can be calculated based on biogas potential; (2) the determined sustainable potential is based on environmental, technological, and socio-economic criteria; (3) the assessment is related to the actual substrates’ availability, whereby expected technological advancements are considered. Developed method has been tested in the form of a case study for Serbia and obtained outcomes compared with studies previously done by other authors. The potential is lower than previously assessed.

The results suggest that there are significant benefits from the IS network. Large reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and abiotic resource depletion were identified. Furthermore, large reductions in local impacts, namely eutrophication and acidification impacts are illustrated. It was shown that all firms in the network benefit from the synergies involved, with a large share of the benefits stemming from the facilitated exchanges with the waste management company. The replacement of conventional products and energy streams with bio-based counterparts from within the network is of significant importance.

To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to boost electricity generation coming from renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy. Finding areas that are suitable for solar farm development is crucial for the economic feasibility of these projects and the sustainable use of land. This research investigates how to identify optimal sites for the development of solar plants. A GIS-based approach combined with a Multi-Criteria Evaluation methodology is used to create a map which shows a ranking of areas with high potential for solar farm development. The GIS-based methodology is employed in the treatment of the legal and environmental criteria and sub-criteria to delimit the suitable locations. These locations are evaluated and ranked by order using the PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations). The importance of each criteria and sub-criteria is determined by an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In the Valencian Community the most discriminating criterion, when selecting the best locations, is the intensity of solar radiation, while temperature is the least discriminant. In terms of areas, the most suitable are located in the province of Alicante, while the least suitable are in the north of the Castellón province. It is also observed that the most appropriate locations are those that have greater solar radiation, and/or are at a lower altitude. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Best sites; GIS; Grid connection; MCDM; PROMETHE; Solar energy; Solar farms","Analytic hierarchy process; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Hierarchical systems; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Best sites; Grid connections; MCDM; Multi-criteria evaluation; Photovoltaic power plant; PROMETHE; Renewable energy source; Location",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081122418

While the IPCC Report sent an urgent cry to reduce total emissions and to achieve specific results—45% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050—reductions need to be combined with capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientific studies have shown that an annual increase of 0.4% of carbon stored in soils would make it possible to stop the present increase in atmospheric CO2. This Article focuses on carbon farming, a Climate Smart Agriculture strategy that uses plants to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil to achieve the IPCC Report goal. This Article makes two contributions. First, recognizing the potential of private certifications to drive sales and investment (Organic-Certified food sales soared to $100 billion in 2018), this Article designs a new Carbon Farming Certification with an Organic or Regenerative Agriculture certification as a base, and an add-on module to measure carbon sequestration. Second, a carbon farming certification becomes a linchpin to accessing a greater network of resources to scale-up carbon farming: farmers leverage the Certification to gain access to immediate and long-term financing; to unlock lucrative opportunities to sell carbon credits to those who purchase carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade market; and to engage in forward contracting with major supply chains. State and local governments should leverage sequestered carbon metrics from Carbon Farming Certified-farms to demonstrate compliance with international law and treaty targets, as well as national and local climate policies. Filling gaps in food law and environmental governance literature, this Article presents a multidisciplinary approach to solving a critical global problem. It identifies barriers which hinder the scale-up of promising carbon farming strategies, including: insufficient information, lack of funding for innovation to drive down solution costs, inconsistent regulations that hinder project development and private sector commercialization, and a patchwork of quantification standards for ensuring carbon sequestration is measured consistently and fairly. The Article’s proposed solution draws from new developments in computer modeling simulation and metrics, carbon credits, and global best practices. Further, this Article shares case studies highlighting novel collaborations between nations, private parties, NGOs, and international institutions. © 2020 Denver University Law Review.

The exact dynamics involved in this crucial passage are still a matter of discussion. As newer studies have highlighted the key role of climatic fluctuations during this period, their relationship with the human occupation of the landscape are yet to be fully explored. We investigated the infilling of negative structures at the archaeological site of Tegole di Bovino (Apulia, Southern Italy) looking at evidence of the interaction between climate changes and human strategies. The archaeological sedimentary deposits, investigated though geoarchaeological and micromorphological techniques, show the presence of natural and anthropogenic infillings inside most structures. Both human intervention and/or natural events occurred in the last phases of occupation of the site and its subsequent abandonment. The transition to unfavorable climatic conditions in the same period was most likely involved in the abandonment of the site. The possible further impact of human communities on the landscape in that period, testified by multiple other archives, might have in turn had a role in the eventual change in land use. © 2020 by the authors.

The results show that with the current tax rates, a minimal decrease in emissions is achieved. Also, other scenarios are simulated to evaluate the impact of modifying the current tax rates. For example, it is determined that the increase in taxes on local (global) pollutants complements the reduction of emissions from global (local) pollutants. Finally, the results of the Leontief price model are transferred to microdata to analyze the effects on the poverty rate and income distribution.

Additionally, BB aerosols and gas-phase emissions can substantially reduce air quality at local, regional, and global scales, negatively affecting human health. South America is one of largest contributors to BB emissions globally. After Amazonia, the BB emissions from wildfires and agricultural burns in the grassland plains of northern South America (NSA) are the most significant in the region. However, few studies have analyzed the potential impact of NSA BB emissions on regional air quality. Recent evidence suggests that seasonal variations in air quality in several major cities in NSA could be associated with open biomass burning emissions, but it is still uncertain to what extent those sources impact air quality in the region. In this work, we report on 3 years of continuous equivalent black carbon (eBC) and brown carbon (BrC) observations at a hilltop site located upwind of the city of Bogotá, and we demonstrate its association with fires detected by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in a 3000 km_2000 km domain. Offline PM2:5 filter samples collected during three field campaigns were analyzed to quantify water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), organic and elemental carbon (OC=EC), and biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan, galactosan, and potassium. MODIS active fire data and HYSPLIT back trajectories were used to identify potential biomass burning plumes transported to the city. We analyzed the relationship between BrC, WSOC, water-soluble potassium, and levoglucosan to identify signals of the regional transport of BB aerosols. Our results confirm that regional biomass burning transport from wildfires occurs annually during the months of January and April. The seasonality of eBC closely followed that of PM2:5 at the city air quality stations; however, the observed seasonality of BrC is distinctly different to that of eBC and strongly associated with regional fire counts. The strong correlation between BrC and regional fire counts was observed at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales. WSOC at the measurement site was observed to increase linearly with levoglucosan during high BB periods and to remain constant at 2:5 ?gCm3 during the low BB seasons. Our findings show, for the first time in this region, that aged BB plumes can regularly reach densely populated areas in the Central Andes of northern South America. A source footprint analysis involving BrC observations, back trajectories, and remotely sensed fire activity shows that the eastern savannas in NSA are the main BB source region for the domain analyzed. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Herein, we investigate the relationship between the atmospheric concentration of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and phytoplankton biomass in the Mediterranean Sea by identifying the main MSA source regions during a springtime intensive observation period. The study approach combines i) spatio-temporal correlation analysis between in situ aerosol data measured in April 2016 at Capo Granitola (southern Sicily), and high-resolution ocean color composites, ii) back-trajectory analysis, and iii) potential source contribution function (PSCF) algorithm. The southwestern Mediterranean region (between Sardinia and the Algerian coast) was identified as the most probable dimethylsulfide (DMS) source region contributing to the observed MSA concentrations. Conversely, the blooming northwestern Mediterranean Sea region did not appear to contribute significantly. The present analysis shows that the reasons may be biotic (phytoplankton type, stress level) or abiotic (sea surface temperature), or a combination of both.

This self-sensitized approach simplifies systems and efficiencies; therefore, complete understanding of mechanistic principles is essential for improving catalysts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of dark reactions using electrochemical techniques to understand the multiple pathways for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO by an example self-sensitized photocatalyst: [Ir(bip)(ppy)(CH3CN)]2+ (bip = 2,6-bis(benzimidazole)pyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile under anhydrous conditions reveals electrocatalysis by a two electron cycle at -1.7 V vs Fc+/0 (denoted the cat-1 region) in which the metallocarboxylate formed by binding of Ir(I) to CO2 is cleaved by CO2 as the oxide acceptor. At -1.9 V (denoted the cat-2 region), the Ir(CO2) intermediate is reduced and catalysis is accelerated. In the presence of water, Ir(CO2) is protonated to Ir(CO2H), which is reduced at a potential less negative than -1.7 V, and then, the oxide acceptor is either CO2 to form HCO3- or protons to release H2O and the conjugate base of the acid source. Further reduction of Ir(CO2H) at cat-2 again accelerates catalysis. Rates vary widely in these various regimes with the minimum kobs of 0.3 s-1 for anhydrous cat-1 to a maximum cat-2 rate of 2100 s-1 with 1% water. Competitive deactivation pathways were discovered as Ir-Ir dimerization without reacting with CO2 or the formation of a hydride-bridged dinuclear complex during extended electrolysis at a high water concentration. The Ir-Ir dimer was characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).

Several studies analyzed the impacts of these policies on optimum solutions of biomass supply chain models. However, due to the focus on specific case studies, insights from these studies may not be general. In this paper, the impact of carbon pricing policies on the optimum solutions of case-independent biomass supply chain models is studied. Several propositions that discuss the impact of carbon pricing policies on optimum cost and emissions of biomass supply chain models are presented and proved mathematically. Next, mathematical models are developed to determine the optimal feedstock mix of a biomass-fed district heating plant. The case study results are used to numerically confirm all propositions. When the carbon price increases, the models prescribe the replacement of natural gas with biomass. Carbon tax and carbon cap-and-trade models result in equal optimum decision variables and emissions for equal carbon prices. The carbon cap-and-trade model has less cost than the carbon tax model if the carbon price is more than the price of initial allowance. Careful allotment of the compliance target is important for the carbon offset model because it bounds the optimum emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Biomass supply chains; Carbon pricing; District heating; Optimization","Biomass; Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Natural gasoline plants; Supply chains; Biomass supply chain; Cap and trade; Carbon offsets; Carbon pricing; District-heating plants; Optimization models; Optimum decision; Optimum solution; Costs; biomass power; carbon emission; compliance; cost analysis; decision analysis; environmental impact assessment; optimization; pollution tax; pricing policy; supply chain management; trade openness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089182398

We report a comprehensive kinetic examination of a model carboxylate O-arylation, comparing a state-of-the-art homogeneous photocatalyst (Ir(ppy)3) with a competitive heterogeneous photocatalyst (graphitic carbon nitride). Experimental conditions were adjusted such that the nickel catalytic cycle is saturated with excited photocatalyst. This approach was designed to remove the role of the photocatalyst, by which only the intrinsic behaviors of the nickel catalytic cycles are observed. The two reactions did not display identical kinetics. Ir(ppy)3 deactivates the nickel catalytic cycle and creates more dehalogenated side product. Kinetic data for the reaction using Ir(ppy)3 supports a turnover-limiting reductive elimination. Graphitic carbon nitride gave higher selectivity, even at high photocatalyst-to-nickel ratios. The heterogeneous reaction also showed a rate dependence on aryl halide, indicating that oxidative addition plays a role in rate determination. The results argue against the current mechanistic hypothesis, which states that the photocatalyst is only involved to trigger reductive elimination.

This perception arises due to them often being in less developed areas with high levels of exposure to stressors, while reportedly lacking the means to cope with these stressors. Studies which use developed-country yardsticks, such as those used in past IPCC-based assessments, when measuring vulnerability in less developed states will however inevitably over-pronounce its effects in such areas. The sustainable livelihoods approach provides an alternate means of determining vulnerability using capital assets such as social capital. The presence of these assets enables communities to pursue diverse livelihood strategies which ultimately serve to reduce their vulnerability. This study seeks to measure attributes of social capital in five marine dependent communities of Solomon Islands. This was done through a questionnaire survey of 110 respondents, which comprised of 15 questions related to social capital. Question scores were equally balanced and also contributed equally to each of the five indicators of social capital identified in the literature-namely community cohesion, gender equity, leadership, decision making, and equal access to services and resources. The results indicated an overall social capital vulnerability score of 0.379, where 0 indicates the lowest possible vulnerability score and 1 the most vulnerable. Community cohesion decreased vulnerability the most within these communities, followed by gender equity, leadership, equal access to services and resources and decision making. Our results indicate a high degree of social capital in Solomon Islands communities, and therefore its importance as an inherent measure for households to cope with both climate and non-climate related stressors. Climate change directed policy should therefore be developed with the aim of preserving social capital as it provides a culturally embedded means of deterring vulnerability, at the risk of more expensive and possibly less pragmatic alternative measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Rural communities; Social capital; Vulnerability","Decision making; Risk assessment; Rural areas; Surveys; Coastal communities; Developed countries; Livelihood strategies; Questionnaire surveys; Rural community; Social capitals; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; coastal zone; decision making; environmental stress; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; leadership; livelihood; perception; questionnaire survey; rural area; rural population; social capital; vulnerability; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Solomon Islands [Solomon Islands (ISG)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082524906

Black carbon is one of the major air pollutants released during several mining activities having dangerous effect on climate and human health. In this paper we aim to study the behavioral pattern and trends in the time series of black carbon concentration over the three major coal mines of India namely Raniganj, Jharia and Bokaro considering a long term time series data of past 38 years using regression and fractal dimensional analysis of black carbon between the major coal mines with the help statistical tools like Hurst exponent, predictability index and trend percent. In this comparative study it is observed that the time series display anti persistent behavior with positive and large variation then the past time. The results and comparisons obtained will be helpful in studying the behavior and trends in the concentration of black carbon over the coal mines regions. The significance of the study will be helpful to gather the interest of researcher's, NGO's and government towards the black carbon concentration over the coal mines so that preventive measures and new policies be framed to keep a check on black carbon concentration in these areas. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Coal; Coal industry; Fractals; Statistical mechanics; Time series; Time series analysis; Behavioral patterns; Comparative studies; Fractal dimensional analysis; Market fluctuations; Mining activities; Preventive measures; Statistical tools; Time-series data; Coal mines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086388815

In this review, the most recent advances in UASB reactor applications are critically summarized and discussed, with outline on the most critical aspects for further possible future developments. Beside traditional anaerobic treatment of soluble and biodegradable substrates, research is actually focusing on the treatment of refractory and slowly degradable matrices, thanks to an improved understanding of microbial community composition and reactor hydrodynamics, together with utilization of powerful modeling tools. Innovative approaches include the use of UASB reactor for nitrogen removal, as well as for hydrogen and volatile fatty acid production. Co-digestion of complementary substrates available in the same territory is being extensively studied to increase biogas yield and provide smooth continuous operations in a circular economy perspective. Particular importance is being given to decentralized treatment, able to provide electricity and heat to local users with possible integration with other renewable energies. Proper pre-treatment application increases biogas yield, while a successive post-treatment is needed to meet required effluent standards, also from a toxicological perspective. An increased full-scale application of UASB technology is desirable to achieve circular economy and sustainability scopes, with efficient biogas exploitation, fulfilling renewable energy targets and green-house gases emission reduction, in particular in tropical countries, where limited reactor heating is required. © 2020 by the authors.

The effects of climate change further exacerbate feed availability. Therefore, there is a need to develop feasible cost-effective strategies for improving the year-round feed supply. Improved planted forages such as Brachiaria grass have been recommended as one of the strategies of alleviating feed scarcity, especially in drier agro-ecological zones. This study analyses the socio-economic determinants of adoption and the impact of adopting Brachiaria grass for feed sufficiency and increased milk production. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was used to assess the determinants and impact of the adoption of Brachiaria grass. Empirical results indicate that the adoption of Brachiaria grass led to a significant increase in milk production by 27.6% and feed sufficiency by 31.6%. The positive impact of Brachiaria grass is consistent with the role of agricultural technologies in improving the productivity, income, and welfare of smallholder farmers. The adoption of Brachiaria grass is influenced by age of farmer, tropical livestock unit (TLU), type of animal breed, perceived benefits of the technology, access to extension, and farmer group membership. The study recommends holistic policy approaches that promote the widespread adoption of Brachiaria grass. There is also a need for an effective information dissemination pathway for Brachiaria grass. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agricultural economics; Agricultural policy; Agricultural technology; Animal nutrition; Brachiaria grass; Cattle; Climate-smart; Economics; Feed sufficiency; Livestock management; Milk productivity; Planted fodder technology; Propensity score matching",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086921431

Our hypothesis is that legume cover crops can improve efficiency of N fertilizer and can decrease N2O emissions compared to non-cover crop systems. The objectives of this study were to (a) evaluate the performance of summer leguminous cover crops in terms of N uptake and carbon (C) accumulation following winter wheat and (b) to quantify the effects of summer leguminous cover crops and N fertilizer rates on N2O emissions and grain yield of the subsequent grain sorghum crop. Field experiments were conducted in the context of a wheat-sorghum rotation for two seasons in Kansas. Treatments consisted of double-cropped leguminous cover crops following winter wheat harvest with no fertilizer applied to the following grain sorghum or no cover crop after wheat harvest and N fertilizer rates applied to the grain sorghum. The cover crops were cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). The three N treatments (were 0, 90, and 180 kg·N·ha-1). Fallow systems with 90 and 180 kg·N·ha-1 produced significantly greater N2O emissions compared with cropping systems that received no N fertilizer. Emissions of N2O were similar for various cover crops and fallow systems with 0 kg·N·ha-1. Among cover crops, pigeon pea and cowpea had greater C accumulation and N uptake than sunn hemp. Grain yield of sorghum following different cover crops was similar and significantly higher than fallow systems with 0 kg·N·ha-1. Although fallow systems with 90 and 180 kg·N·ha-1 produced maximum sorghum grain yields, N2O emissions per unit of grain yield decreased as the amount of N fertilizer was reduced. We conclude that including leguminous cover crops can decrease N fertilizer requirements for a subsequent sorghum crop, potentially reducing N2O emissions per unit grain yield and providing options for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Cover crops; Crop rotation; Cropping system; Greenhouse gas emissions; Legumes; Nitrogen management; Nitrous oxide; Sorghum","agricultural emission; agricultural soil; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); cover crop; crop yield; denitrification; farming system; fertilizer application; harvesting; legume; nitrous oxide; sorghum; wheat; Kansas; United States; Cajanus cajan; Crotalaria juncea; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum; Vigna unguiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086089391

The adverse effects of air pollution may be intensified in high altitudes (HA) due to increased minute ventilation (MV), which may result in higher deposition doses compared to that at sea level. Despite this, air quality studies in regions with combined high pollution levels and enhanced inhalation are limited. The main goals of this study are to investigate how the choice of travel mode (walking, microbus, and cable car ride) determines (i) the personal exposure to equivalent black carbon (eBC) and (ii) the corresponding potential respiratory deposited dose (RDD) in HA. For this investigation, we chose La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia as HA representative cities. The highest eBC exposure occurred in microbus commutes (13 μg m-3), while the highest RDD per trip was recorded while walking (6.3 μg) due to increased MV. On the other hand, the lowest eBC exposure and RDD were observed in cable car commute. Compared with similar studies done at sea level, our results revealed that a HA city should reduce exposure by 1.4 to 1.8-fold to achieve similar RDD at sea level, implying that HA cities require doubly aggressive and stringent road emission policies compared to those at sea level. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Black carbon; Personal exposure; Respiratory tract deposition dose","Air quality; Cables; Carbon; Deposition; Adverse effect; Air pollutants; Deposited dose; Microenvironments; Minute ventilations; Personal exposures; Pollution level; Respiratory tract; Sea level; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); emission control; health risk; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; Bolivia; El Alto; La Paz [Bolivia]; La Paz [La Paz (DPR)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087107846

A hybrid dynamical-statistical downscaling approach links Global Climate Models (GCMs) with dynamically downscaled extreme heat events using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Downscaled historical simulations in WRF incorporate urban canopy physics to better describe localized land surface details in the urban environment relevant to extreme heat. This downscaled library is then used in an analog-based approach. This contribution reports a series of enhancements to existing analog-based methods which can efficiently produce more detailed results. The system here uses advanced statistical methods and simple machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize analog selection, perform spatially-consistent bias correction, and decompose patterns of extreme heat into dynamic components such as the land-sea contrast and inland sea-breeze penetration. Hindcast projections are validated against observational data from in-situ weather observing stations. The results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of this system as it is deployed in cloud-based architectures with parallelized code. Downscaled predictions are equally applicable to heat stress at weather and climate time scales, supporting infrastructure resilience and adaptation, and emergency response. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate downscaling; Extreme heat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079842964

It is estimated that approximately 1.6 million VMT and more than 700 tonnes CO2-equivalent are generated annually by driving dogs to dog parks in Seattle, representing approximately 0.07% of vehicle trips and 0.04% of GHG emissions from cars and light trucks in the city. Based on a stated choice exercise, it is estimated that allowing dogs off-leash in neighborhood parks could reduce these VMT and GHG emissions by 38% and 45%, respectively, while encouraging more than 39,000 additional walking trips annually. Even limiting such use to the hours of 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. would reduce VMT and GHGs by 24% and 28%, respectively, while encouraging 22,000 additional walking trips. Although less than 20% of survey respondents expressed an interest in replacing a trip to the dog park with a visit to a neighborhood park, those who did were likely to replace driving trips to the dog park with walking trips. Thus, allowing dogs off-leash in neighborhood parks, even for limited hours each day, could increase physical activity while reducing the vehicle travel and GHG emissions associated with driving dogs to dog parks. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Gas emissions; Motor transportation; Surveys; Vehicles; Driving trips; Intercept surveys; Physical activity; Stated choice; Travel demand; Vehicle travels; Vehicle-miles traveled; Walking trips; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087709989

This study comprehensively evaluates the effect of SOFA angles on flow, combustion characteristics and NOx emissions for the novel combustion system by numerical simulation and in-situ experiment. The numerical simulation shows in acceptable consistence with the in-situ experiment. The simulated results show that significant NOx reduction is obtained for all five SOFA angles compared to the original combustion system. O2 and CO concentrations at the furnace outlet, as well as the carbon content in the fly ash decrease significantly with increasing SOFA angle from 0° to 40°. NOx emissions increase slightly and the average temperature at the re-heater entrance changes slightly with the increase of SOFA angle from 0° to 30°. However, with further increasing SOFA angle from 30° to 40°, NOx emissions increase substantially due to the smaller reducing region below the SOFA and the average temperature at the re-heater entrance falls significantly. Taking combustion, NOx and steam parameters into account, a SOFA angle of 30° is advisable. The actual industrial measurements also show that the steam can achieve the designed values when the SOFA angle is set at 30° instead of 40°.

This deposit is hosted by dolomitic limestone and dolomite of the Yangxin Formation with Zn-Pb ore reserves of more than 20 million tons (Mt). Ore minerals mainly include sphalerite, galena and pyrite. According to the occurrence of orebodies, ore textures, and mineral assemblages, the hydrothermal Zn-Pb mineralization stage could be subdivided into three generations: (1) light brown sphalerite associated with minor galena in dolomite breccias; (2) dark brown to brown sphalerite associated with galena, dolomite and minor gypsum; (3) disseminated reddish-brown to light yellow sphalerite in calcite vein. Sulfides from three stages have similar major, trace elements, Re-Os and S isotopic compositions. Rhenium and Os in sphalerite are 7–58 ppb and 3–56 ppt, respectively, and in galena of 13–30 ppb and 1-5ppt, respectively. 187Re/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios in sphalerite are 387–16193 and 1.29–12.0, respectively, and in galena of 5449–27180 and 0.35–5.0, respectively. Pyrite, galena, and sphalerite have δ34S values of +14.69‰ to +20.64‰, +6.26‰ to +12.39‰, and +12.01‰ to +16.03‰, respectively. Re-Os isotopic compositions of sphalerite and galena have Os model ages from 1 Ma to 500 Ma, indicating an unclosed Re-Os system. Different sulfides from the same sample follow the trend of (δ34Spyrite ≥ ) δ34Ssphalterite &gt; δ34Sgalena, indicating that sulfur isotopes between different sulfides have attached equilibrium. Fluid inclusions in sphalerite have homogenization temperatures ranging from 135 ℃ to 235 ℃ with two peaks of 220–235 ℃ and 135–160 ℃, which agree well with calculated temperatures of sphalerite-galena pairs (99 ℃–202 ℃). A relatively high sulfur isotope composition (+6.3‰ to + 16.6‰) in sulfides, indicating that sulfur was mainly derived from the reduction of gypsum in Carboniferous strata. Sphalerite and galena in sulfide ores of carbonate-hosted deposits in SYG metallogenic province have experienced post-ore hydrothermal alteration by oxidizing fluids, forming oxidized minerals including gypsum, smithsonite, and anglesite. The activity of such oxidized fluids might last for a long time. Rhenium in sulfides is more mobile than Os in such an oxidizing environment and thus Re-Os isotope system remains open until the interaction between sulfide and fluids stops. Therefore, redox condition of hosting carbonates can highly influence the closure of Re-Os isotope system of sulfide in carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits. Sulfide in oxidizing mineral bearing carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits is not suitable for Re-Os dating. In contrast, Re-Os isotope system is possible to be used for dating the age of Pb-Zn mineralization within reduced carbonates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Closure of Re-Os system; Diffusion of Os; Fule Zn-Pb deposit; Later disturbance; SYG metallogenic province","Binary alloys; Calcite; Carbonation; Clay alteration; Deposits; Economic geology; Gypsum; Isotopes; Lead compounds; Lead zinc deposits; Lime; Mineralogy; Pyrites; Rhenium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Textures; Trace elements; Zinc sulfide; Carbonate-hosted deposits; Carboniferous strata; Dolomitic limestone; Homogenization temperatures; Hydrothermal alterations; Isotopic composition; Mineral assemblage; Oxidizing environments; Osmium compounds; carbonate; geochemistry; hydrothermal alteration; isotopic composition; lead; metallogenesis; mineralization; ore deposit; redox conditions; rhenium-osmium dating; sulfide; zinc; China; Guizhou; Sichuan; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084339273

The main focus of the project was on capturing drag energy in the vehicle's compartment, where some airflow is needed for cooling purposes but most is wasted as drag. The project entails estimating the potential of mounting a rotating fan blade attached to a generator in the vehicle's engine compartment, which would spin as the vehicle is in motion and generate extra power for the vehicle's battery. To evaluate this potential, an anemometer and logger were mounted in the compartment of a Ford C-Max Plug-In Hybrid to estimate how much electrical power could be generated at various speed limits. Data was collected from a sample trip that included local roads and highway travel. From the data collected, an equation was generated to show the correlation between driving speed and power generated. The results showed that the drag-energy-capturing system would generate enough power to increase the vehicle's battery life by an average of 0.1% at full capacity. While an economical product cannot be made based on these results, it will still be helpful to investigate such an idea further. We identified multiple areas for improvement including a refined experimentation and measurement process and system designs that can increase the system's power-generating capability and ultimately reduce emissions from vehicles.

PAHs undergo long-range atmospheric transport, as evidenced by in situ observations across the Arctic. However, monitored atmospheric concentrations of PAHs indicate that ambient PAH levels in the Arctic do not follow the declining trend of worldwide anthropogenic PAH emissions since the 2000s, suggesting missing sources of PAHs in the Arctic or other places across the Northern Hemisphere. To trace origins and causes for the increasing trend of PAHs in the Arctic, the present study reconstructed PAH emissions from forest fires in the northern boreal forest derived by combining forest carbon stocks and MODIS burned area. We examined the statistical relationships of forest biomass, MODIS burned area, emission factors, and combustion efficiency with different PAH congeners. These relationships were then employed to construct PAH emission inventories from forest biomass burning. We show that for some PAH congeners, for example, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)—the forest-fire-induced air emissions are almost one order of magnitude higher than previous emission inventories in the Arctic. A global-scale atmospheric chemistry model, GEOS-Chem, was used to simulate air concentrations of BaP, a representative PAH congener primarily emitted from biomass burning, and to quantify the response of BaP to wildfires in the northern boreal forest. The results showed that BaP emissions from wildfires across the northern boreal forest region played a significant role in the contamination and interannual fluctuations of BaP in Arctic air. A source-tagging technique was applied in tracking the origins of BaP pollution from different northern boreal forest regions. We also show that the response of BaP pollution at different Arctic monitoring sites depends on the intensity of human activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BaP; Biomass burning; Emission; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Source apportionment","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Barium compounds; Biomass; Carbon; Combustion; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Fossil fuels; Mineral oils; Neutron emission; Organic pollutants; Pollution control; Radiometers; Atmospheric chemistry model; Atmospheric concentration; Biomass-burning; Interannual fluctuations; Long-range atmospheric transports; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Source apportionment; Statistical relationship; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; benzo[a]pyrene; carbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; boreal forest; carbon emission; combustion; forest fire; fossil fuel; MODIS; PAH; source apportionment; air analysis; air pollution; Arctic; Article; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; forest fire; geographic distribution; human; human activities; moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; nonhuman; pollution transport; primary production (biomass); taiga; trend study; wildfire; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; fire; Arctic; Air Pollutants; Arctic Regions; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Taiga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079664814

The resultingNU-1000-BzTzcomposite has been thoroughly characterized in the solid state. The functional group loading has been determined through1H NMR analysis of the digested sample (5% HF-DMSO-d6): a maximum value of 1.7BzTzligand per [Zr6] node is achieved. The material preserves its pristine crystallinity after SALI, as witnessed by powder X-ray diffraction. The functionalized MOF has a slightly lower thermal stability than its parent material (Tdec= 780vs.800 K, respectively). The N2adsorption isotherm collected at 77 K disclosed that its BET specific surface area (1530 m2g−1) is lower than that of prisitineNU-1000(2140 m2g−1), because of the space taken and weight added by the dangling benzothiazolium groups inside the pores. A total CO2uptake of 2.0 mmol g−1(8.7 wt% CO2) has been calculated from the CO2adsoprtion isotherm collected atT= 298 K andpCO2= 1 bar. Despite the lower BET area,NU-1000-BzTzshows an increased thermodynamic affinity for CO2(isosteric heat of adsorptionQst= 25 kJ mol−1) if compared withNU-1000(Qst= 17 kJ mol−1), confirming that the presence of a polar functional group in the MOF pores improves the interaction with carbon dioxide. Finally,NU-1000-BzTzhas been exploited as a luminescent sensor for polluting anions (CN−, SCN−, OCN−, and SeCN−as sodium or potassium salts) in aqueous solutions, after bromide exchange. A marked reversible blue shift of its emission band from 490 to 450 nm is observed in all cases, with the associated emission color change from light green to blue under a UV lamp. The detection limit of CN−(1.08 × 10−6M) is much lower than that measured for the other “stick-like” anions considered in this study. The process occurs efficiently even in the presence of other competing ions (i.e.in ordinary tap water), opening promising application perspectives in cyanide luminescence sensing in drinking water. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Blue shift; Crystallinity; Cyanides; Gas adsorption; Ions; Isotherms; Luminescence; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Potable water; Salts; BET specific surface area; Carbon dioxide adsorption; Detection limits; Luminescent sensors; Parent materials; Polar functional groups; Potassium salts; Powder X ray diffraction; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086315867

The viability of CO2electroreduction depends critically on developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts. As a new frontier in the field of catalysis, carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal catalytic sites have shown great potential for CO2electroreduction, and offer opportunities for an in-depth understanding and clear identification of the active sites at the atomic level. In addition, the tunable local environment of metal atoms and supports in SACs made it possible to optimize their electrocatalytic performances for CO2reduction. However, controllable synthesis and optimization of carbon-based SACs for high-efficiency CO2RR remain rather challenging. Herein, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of carbon-based SACs for CO2RR, and discuss the mechanisms as well as the influencing factors during the catalytic process. Moreover, some optimization strategies for carbon-based SACs towards CO2electroreduction are highlighted. At the end of this review article, we present an outlook on the challenges and prospects in this specific research area. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Atoms; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysts; Industrial chemicals; Catalytic process; Catalytic sites; Controllable synthesis; Dispersed metals; Electrocatalytic performance; In-depth understanding; Local environments; Optimization strategy; Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085947285

In particular, during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) and 12th FYP (i.e., 2006–2015), the emission control measures were executed intensively and efficiently under the supervision of law enforcement authorities. These measures helped substantially reduce the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration over this region. Hence, it is now important to determine how the decrease in PM2.5 concentration influenced the exposure condition and health burdens in the PRD region during 2006–2015. In this study, the exposure and mortality apportionment of PM2.5 under both 2006 and 2015 emission scenarios were investigated. The simulated population-weighted PM2.5 concentration was found to be lower under the 2015 emission scenario compared with that under the 2006 scenario. The average reductions in simulated PM2.5 exposure concentrations (population-weighted average) for Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, and Shenzhen were 32.7, 27.0, 25.3, and 24.1 μg/m3, respectively. After excluding the meteorological variations, a difference of approximately 16,400 (95% CI: 9,100, 22,800) in the number of simulated premature deaths was obtained after the 10-year efforts for emission control and industrial restructuring. Among the five major anthropogenic emissions (mobile, area, power plant, marine vessel, and industrial point emissions), the control of mobile emissions was found to be the most relevant to the estimated health benefits. The calculated economic benefits from controlling mobile emissions reached 30,300 (21,600, 37,100) million USD in 2015. In contrast, the mortality related to area emissions turned out to be higher under the 2015 emission scenario. The difference between 2006 and 2015 meteorological scenarios could substantially influence the simulated exposure concentration in each month. However, the impact of the meteorological factors was found to be limited when the exposure concentrations of the 4 months were averaged. Further, 26,700 (18,500, 33,400) premature deaths difference was calculated after the PM2.5 concentration over the PRD region reached the Air Quality Guideline standard. Therefore, more efforts, including the control of area emissions and the enhancement of regional cooperation (e.g., reducing industrial emission consistently and systematically in southern China), are crucial further to reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the PRD region and improve the living conditions for the residents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Apportionment; Exposure; Health benefit; Mortality; PM2.5","Air quality; Emission control; Law enforcement; Anthropogenic emissions; Emission control measures; Enforcement authorities; Exposure concentration; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Industrial restructuring; Meteorological variation; Pearl River Delta region; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; industrial emission; law enforcement; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; source apportionment; adult; air pollution control; air quality; article; China; controlled study; electric power plant; human; meteorological phenomena; mortality; resident; river; simulation; China; Dongguan; Foshan; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083877184

The decoupling of construction industry and carbon emissions through policies, technologies and model innovations is an effective way for reducing environmental pollution and achieve eco-urban target. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Within the scope of green building carbon emissions (GB-CO2) research, a large number of scientific literature has been published in construction discipline over the past few decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary of strategies, techniques, models and scientific discussion of future direction of GB-CO2 is lacking. Therefore, this paper carries out data mining on authoritative journals, identified the key research topics, active research areas and further research trends through visualization studies. Findings: This study contributes to the body of knowledge in GB-CO2 by critically reviewing and summarizing: professional high-quality journals have a greater influence in the scope of research, developed countries and developing countries are all very concerned about sustainable buildings, and the current hot topics of research focus on the application of the life cycle models, energy efficiency, environmental performance of concrete material, etc. Moreover, further research areas that could expand the knowledge of cross-national long-term carbon mechanisms, develop comprehensive life cycle carbon emissions assessment models, build technical standards and tests for the sustainable building material and systems, and exploit multi-objective decision models considering decarbonizing design and renewable energy. Originality/value: This study is of value in systematic insight the state-of-the-art of GB-CO2 research in the more recent decade. A more vividly and effectively method is documented in extending the traditional bibliometric review to a deeper discussion.

Anaerobic digestion technology (AD) for biogas production has an important role in achieving circular economy goals, as it may not only recover the energy contained in the biomass but also contribute to nutrient recovery and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The expansion of biogas production promotes the need for assessment of the technical potential of biomass, which is available for biogas production and is not in the competition with other purposes. This research work presents a Geographical Information System (GIS) based approach for the assessment of the spatial distribution of the biogas production potential by taking into consideration seasonal variation of biomass production, in order to assess the influence of biomass seasonality. The method developed in this research work is based on a combination of statistical and spatial explicit methods. The presented approach was tested in a case study of Croatia and the final results are representing the seasonal and spatial distribution of biogas potential at the spatial level of 1 km × 1 km. The results show that there is a strong need to include the influence of seasonality in assessment of biogas potential for lignocellulosic agricultural residues.

As a consequence, different types of regulatory instruments are being implemented to reduce emissions. In this study, we evaluate both the potential and actual effect of a subsidy programme for stove exchange, which has been in place for over 20 years in Oslo (Norway). The subsidy programme provides economic support to the inhabitants for substituting old stoves for RWC with new and cleaner stoves as a measure to reduce PM emissions. Different approaches were selected to assess the potential effect of the Oslo subsidy programme. First, we evaluate the potential for reductions in emissions and pollution levels through the use of emission and dispersion modelling under different scenarios. We then assess the actual reductions associated with the stoves already replaced with the subsidy. We conclude the study by evaluating the time variation (2005 to 2018) in emissions, wood consumption and emission factors in Oslo in comparison with other municipalities with and without subsidy programmes in place. Results from emission and dispersion modelling show that the replacement of old wood stoves for new ones could have a significant effect on the reduction of emissions (up to 46%) and PM2.5 levels (up to 21%). Despite that, with near 8% of the total existing stoves in Oslo being exchanged with subsidy, the potential for reduction based on improved emission factors was estimated to be smaller by an order of magnitude. We find no evidence that municipalities with subsidy reduce emissions faster than those without subsidy. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence from our modelling results, supported by available observation data, that indicate that the emissions or concentrations in Oslo have been reduced as a result of the subsidy programme. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; MetVed emissions; PM2.5 emissions; Residential wood combustion; Stove exchange subsidy","Dispersions; Emission control; Dispersion Modelling; Economic supports; Emission reduction; Emissions and pollution; Particulate Matter; Potential effects; Reduction of emissions; Residential wood combustions; Stoves; combustion; dispersion; emission control; equipment; particulate matter; urban area; air quality; article; combustion; comparative effectiveness; Norway; particulate matter; Norway; Oslo [Norway]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083583483

We present detailed modelled emissions (i.e., CO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10), concentration levels (i.e., PM2.5 and PM10) and population exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 under three scenarios of ESL implementation for the Metropolitan Area of Oslo. We find that whilst emissions of NOx and CO2 do not seem to show significant changes with ESL implementation, PM10 emissions are reduced by 6–12% and annual concentration levels are reduced up to 8%, with a subsequent reduction in population exposure. The modelled data is used to carry out a detailed analysis to quantify the changes in private and social costs for the roads in Oslo where ESL are implemented today. This involves assessments related to human health, climate, fuel consumption, time losses and the incidence of traffic accidents. For a scenario using actual speed data from ESL implementation, our study shows a net benefit associated with the implementation of ESLs, whilst for a theoretical scenario with strict speed limit compliance we find a net increase in costs.

The experiment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribution. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by inequality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive-based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substantially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing payment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

An attractive route for synthetic fuel production is the Fe-or Co-catalysed Fischer-Tropsch process. A profound knowledge of the catalyst deactivation phenomena under industrial conditions is crucial for the process optimisation. In this study, we followed the structural changes of a Co-Ni-Re/?-Al2O3 catalyst for &gt;300 hours at 30 bar and 250 °C during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis operando at a synchrotron radiation facility. The advanced setup built for operando X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy allows simultaneous and robust monitoring of the catalytic activity even over 300 h time on stream. We found three activity regimes for the Co-Ni-Re/?-Al2O3 catalyst during 310 h of operation. Fast decline in activity was observed during the initiation phase in the first hours of operation due to liquid film formation (mass transport limitations). Furthermore, solid state reactions and carbon depositions were found while continuing the exposure of the catalyst to harsh temperature conditions of 250 °C. By using this advanced setup, we bridged the gap between industrially oriented catalysts and fundamental studies at synchrotron radiation facilities, opening up new possibilities for operando characterisation of industrial processes that rely on conditions of up to 450 °C and 50 bar. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Coal liquefaction; Fossil fuels; Liquid films; Optimization; Solid state reactions; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; Synthetic fuels; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Deactivation phenomena; Fischer-Tropsch process; Industrial conditions; Mass transport limitation; Renewable energy using; Synchrotron radiation facility; Synthetic fuel productions; Temperature conditions; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089834480

However, surface ozone (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span>) concentrations have still been increasing in urban areas across the country. In a previous analysis, we examined in detail the roles of meteorological variation during 2013-2017 in the summertime surface <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> trend in various regions of China. In this study, we evaluated the effect of changes in multi-pollutant emissions from anthropogenic activities on <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> levels during the same period by using an up-to-date regional chemical transport model (WRF-CMAQ) driven by an interannual anthropogenic emission inventory.

The effects of changes in individual pollutant emissions on <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> were also simulated. The reduction of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span> emission increased the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> levels in urban areas due to the nonlinear <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span> and volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry and decreasing aerosol effects; the slight increase in VOC emissions enhanced the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> levels; the reduction of PM emissions increased the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> levels by enhancing the photolysis rates and reducing the loss of reactive gases on aerosol surfaces; and the reduction of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">SO2</span> emissions resulted in a drastic decrease in sulfate concentrations, which increased <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> through aerosol effects. In contrast to the unfavorable effect of the above changes in pollutant emissions on efforts to reduce surface <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span>, the reduction of CO emissions did help to decrease the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> level in recent years. The dominant cause of increasing <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> due to changes in anthropogenic emissions varied geographically. In Beijing, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span> and PM emission reductions were the two largest causes of the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> increase; in Shanghai, the reduction of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span> and increase in VOC emissions were the two major causes; in Guangzhou, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span> reduction was the primary cause; in Chengdu, the PM and <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">SO2</span> emission decreases contributed most to the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> increase. Regarding the effects of decreasing concentrations of aerosols, the drop in heterogeneous uptake of reactive gases - mainly <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">HO2</span> and <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> - was found to be more important than the increase in photolysis rates. The adverse effect of the reductions of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span>, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">SO2</span>, and PM emissions on <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> abatement in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu would have been avoided if the anthropogenic VOCs emission had been reduced by 24&thinsp;%, 23&thinsp;%, 20&thinsp;%, and 16&thinsp;%, respectively, from 2013 to 2017.

In this study, we conducted numerical experiments with an up-to-date regional chemical transport model to assess the contribution of the changes in meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emissions to the summer ozone level from 2013 to 2017 in various regions of China. The model can faithfully reproduce the observed meteorological parameters and air pollutant concentrations and capture the increasing trend in the surface maximum daily 8&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">h</span> average (MDA8) ozone (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span>) from 2013 to 2017. The emission-control measures implemented by the government induced a decrease in MDA8 <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> levels in rural areas but an increase in urban areas. The meteorological influence on the ozone trend varied by region and by year and could be comparable to or even more significant than the impact of changes in anthropogenic emissions. Meteorological conditions can modulate the ozone concentration via direct (e.g., increasing reaction rates at higher temperatures) and indirect (e.g., increasing biogenic emissions at higher temperatures) effects. As an essential source of volatile organic compounds that contributes to ozone formation, the variation in biogenic emissions during summer varied across regions and was mainly affected by temperature. China's midlatitude areas (25 to 40<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ&circ; </span>&thinsp;N) experienced a significant decrease in MDA8 <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> due to a decline in biogenic emissions, especially for the Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin regions in 2014 and 2015. In contrast, in northern (north of 40<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ&circ; </span>&thinsp;N) and southern (south of 25<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ&circ; </span>&thinsp;N) China, higher temperatures after 2013 led to an increase in MDA8 <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> via an increase in biogenic emissions. We also assessed the individual effects of changes in temperature, specific humidity, wind field, planetary boundary layer height, clouds, and precipitation on ozone levels from 2013 to 2017. The results show that the wind field change made a significant contribution to the increase in surface ozone over many parts of China. The long-range transport of ozone and its precursors from outside the modeling domain also contributed to the increase in MDA8 <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3</span> in China, especially on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (an increase of 1 to 4&thinsp;ppbv).

Globally, data centers will become the world's largest users of energy consumption, with the ratio rising from 3% in 2017 to 4.5% in 2025. Due to its unique climate and energy-saving advantages, the high-latitude area in the Pan-Arctic region has gradually become a hotspot for data center site selection in recent years. In order to predict and analyze the future energy consumption and carbon emissions of global data centers, this paper presents a new method based on global data center traffic and power usage effectiveness (PUE) for energy consumption prediction. Firstly, global data center traffic growth is predicted based on the Cisco's research. Secondly, the dynamic global average PUE and the high latitude PUE based on Romonet simulation model are obtained, and then global data center energy consumption with two different scenarios, the decentralized scenario and the centralized scenario, is analyzed quantitatively via the polynomial fitting method. The simulation results show that, in 2030, the global data center energy consumption and carbon emissions are reduced by about 301 billion kWh and 720 million tons CO2 in the centralized scenario compared with that of the decentralized scenario, which confirms that the establishment of data centers in the Pan-Arctic region in the future can effectively relief the climate change and energy problems. This study provides support for global energy consumption prediction, and guidance for the layout of future global data centers from the perspective of energy consumption. Moreover, it provides support of the feasibility of the integration of energy and information networks under the Global Energy Interconnection conception. © 2020","carbon emission; Data center; Data traffic; Energy consumption; Global Energy Interconnection; Pan-Arctic; PUE","Carbon; Climate change; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Information services; Site selection; Data-communication; Emission mitigation; Energy and information; Energy consumption prediction; Exponential growth; Polynomial fitting method; Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE); Simulation model; Green computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104695944

The study aimed to quantitatively determine Pd content and water quality parameters, to analyze the variation differences and to explore the effect of water quality parameters on Pd content in the urban water environment system (wet deposition-rainfall runoff-receiving water body-estuary) of the city of Haikou, Hainan Island, China. The method used in this study included microwave digestion under high pressure and temperature, analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, quality control of the experimental procedure and guaranteed recovery (85% -125%). The results showed that the dissolved Pd average content in the urban water environment system was the highest in rainfall runoff (4.93 ng/L), followed by that in the receiving water body (4.56 ng/L), and it was the lowest in wet deposition (0.1 ng/L). The suspended Pd average content was the highest in the estuary (2.83 ng/L), followed by that in rainfall runoff (1.26 ng/L), and it was the lowest in wet deposition (6 × 10-4 ng/L). The particle-water partition ratio of the estuary Pd was the highest (1.26), followed by that of Pd in rainfall runoff (0.26). The particle-water partition ratio of the wet deposition Pd was the lowest (6 × 10-3). The dissolved Pd was correlated with the pH, Cl-, and total suspended solids (TSS) (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.52, -0.68, 0.39, p &lt; 0.05; regression coefficient ¼ 1.27, -1.39, 0.01). The suspended Pd was only correlated with Cl- and TSS (correlation coefficient ¼ -0.36, 0.76, p &lt; 0.05; regression coefficient ¼ -1.45, 0.01). Cl- and TSS were the most closely related to Pd in the water environment system. Although individual factors such as pH, Cl-, and TSS had certain migration and transformation effects on Pd in the wet deposition-rainfall runoff-receiving water body-estuary system, the probability of strong correlations was not high. In particular, Eh was not related to the dissolved nor suspended Pd content (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.14, 0.13), which may be due to the synergistic effect of the multiple physical factors on Pd.

Moreover, biomass combustion can be an important source of air pollution in rural areas, comparable to vehicle and industrial emissions in urban planning. And their air pollutants are mainly affected by local sources. For this reason, a survey on rural air pollution was carried out in this study. Therefore, portable, battery-powered monitoring devices were used to measure particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1, particle number concentration, and black carbon) in order to study air quality in rural communities. The focus of the investigations was to explore the application of mobile monitoring equipment in small-scale environments, compare the differences in rural air pollutants between two neighboring villages in two countries, and the identification of pollution hotspots. The measurements were carried out in November 2018 in two villages on the German-Czech border. Over a period of four days, 21 mobile measurements along fixed routes were carried out simultaneously at both locations. The analysis of the data revealed significant differences in PN and PM concentrations in rural air pollutants between the two countries.

This study was conducted over a period of 13 months using low-cost air quality monitors, each comprising two low-cost sensors, which were subjected to a wide range of pollution sources and concentrations, relative humidity and temperature at four locations in Australia and China. The aim of the study was to establish the performance characteristics of the two low-cost sensors (a Plantower PMS1003 for PM2.5 and an Alphasense CO–B4 for carbon monoxide, CO) and the KOALA monitor as a whole under various conditions. Parameters evaluated included the inter-variability between individual monitors, the accuracy of monitors in comparison with the reference instruments, the effect of temperature and RH on the performance of the monitors, the responses of the PM2.5 sensors to different types of aerosols, and the long-term stability of the PM2.5 and CO sensors. The monitors showed high inter-correlations (r &gt; 0.91) for both PM2.5 and CO measurements. The monitor performance varied with location, with moderate to good correlations with reference instruments for PM2.5 (0.44&lt; R2 &lt; 0.91) and CO (0.37&lt; R2 &lt; 0.90). The monitors performed well at relative humidity &lt; 75% and high temperature conditions; however, two monitors in Beijing failed at low temperatures, probably due to electronic board failure. The PM2.5 sensor was less sensitive to marine aerosols and fresh vehicle emissions than to mixed urban background emissions, aged traffic emissions and industrial emissions. The long-term stability of the PM2.5 and CO sensors was good, while CO relative errors were affected by both high and low temperatures. Overall, the KOALA monitors performed well in the environments in which they were operated and provided a valuable contribution to long-term air quality monitoring within the elucidated limitations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Low-cost sensor; PM2.5","carbon monoxide; aerosol; air quality; environmental monitoring; error analysis; high temperature; long-term change; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollutant source; relative humidity; sensor; aerosol; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; cost; high temperature; humidity; low temperature; measurement accuracy; parameters; particulate matter; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Australia; environmental monitoring; Australia; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Australia; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082861097

We compared plants of Spartina alterniflora from the native (United States, 27–43°N) and introduced (China, 19–40°N) ranges. In the field and greenhouse, aboveground productivity of Chinese plants was greater than that of North American plants. Aboveground biomass in the field declined with increasing latitude in the native range, a pattern that persisted in the greenhouse, indicating a genetic basis. Aboveground biomass in the field displayed hump-shaped relationships with latitude in China, but this pattern disappeared in field and greenhouse common gardens, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Relationships in both geographic regions were explained by temperature, which is probably the underlying environmental factor affecting aboveground biomass. S. alterniflora has evolved greater biomass in China, but in the four decades since it was introduced, it has not yet evolved the genetic cline in biomass seen in its native range. By working at lower latitudes in the introduced range than have been sampled in the native range, we identified an optimum temperature in the introduced range above which aboveground productivity decreases. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"aboveground production; adaptation; biomass; environmental factor; grass; introduced species; native species; phenotypic plasticity; saltmarsh; China; United States; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077873249

However, 20-60% of the methane produced remains dissolved in the anaerobically treated effluent, which is a potent greenhouse gas and is easily stripped out in the aeration tank. This study aims to develop a solution using dissolved methane to support denitrification, thus simultaneously enhancing nitrogen removal and achieving beneficial use of dissolved methane. By coupling anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) with nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO), up to 85% of dissolved methane and more than 99% of nitrogen were removed in parallel in a biofilm system. Mass balance was conducted during both long-term operation and short-term batch tests, which indicated that n-DAMO bacteria and n-DAMO archaea indeed contributed jointly to the methane removal. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing further showed the co-presence of n-DAMO bacteria and n-DAMO archaea, while anammox bacteria were detected with a low relative abundance. This proposed technology can potentially be applied to reduce the carbon footprint and to save the organic carbon consumption in WWTPs.

However, a significant challenge in the reduction of CO2 is achieving high conversion efficiency due to the high CO dissociation energy of CO2 and difficultly in accessing the surface of photocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst with hydroxyethyl groups grafted on its edge via a facile bottom-up strategy, facilitating the efficient surface absorption of CO2 and lowering the CO2 transformation energy barrier; this was accompanied with exceptional extended optical absorption ability to the near-infrared region and increase in the density of states at the Fermi level. Thus, concentrated CO2 molecules could contact the surface of PCN and be easily activated; this resulted in an excellent CO production rate of up to 209.24 μmol h-1 g-1 in the modified PCN (i.e., 39.5-fold increase compared to that of pristine PCN) and a selectivity of 98.5% under white LED illumination, exceeding that of most PCN-based energy conversion systems reported to date. Notably, this PCN matrix also exhibited photocatalytic activity for the production of CO in the near-infrared region from 780 to 850 nm. These results pave the way for the development of structured photocatalysts with easy accessibility for CO2 and broadband spectral response for the efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

Nonetheless, its occurrence and effects on plant growth in the sand-based ecosystems of the Mongolia Plateau are largely unknown. We performed laboratory experiments and conducted a three-year field investigation of dew in the Hunshandak sandland, northern China. Dew yield was determined by a weighing method. The ecological significance of dew was evaluated by measuring isotopes in the field, leaf water content, photosynthesis and the biomass of drought-stressed plants exposed to dew. Nights producing dew comprised 53% of those between June and October when the atmospheric relative humidity was higher than 80% and wind speed was lower than 4.0 m s−1. Dew yield averaged 0.15 mm night−1 and its maximum value was 0.30 mm night−1. When exposed to dew, drought-stressed plants increased leaf relative water content and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) between 5-76% and 5-240% for C3 plants, and 3–18% and 5–109% for C4 plants. Dew produced more root and total biomass (15–81% and 24–82%) in C4 species than in C3 species (3–28% and 5–25%). Regular dew events on five or more consecutive nights in seven days can sustain C3 species, while C4 species accumulate more carbon resources. This study found that the high dew yield in arenicolous ecosystems was due to the soil matrix and environmental differences in the neighboring steppe ecosystem. C4 species and drought resistant C3 species displayed higher efficiency for dew utilization than the moderately drought resistant C3 species. This may affect the plant community's dynamic and ecological interactions in response to future climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Dew yield; Foliar uptake; Leaf water content; Meteorological factors; Photosynthesis","C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon sequestration; dew; drought resistance; grass; hydrometeorology; leaf; nutrient uptake; photosynthesis; relative humidity; sandy soil; yield response; Mongolian Plateau; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079875911

To explore the responses and mechanisms of the frequency and strength of freeze–thaw events on soil microbial communities, a lab-scale FT test was conducted on forest soil in permafrost region from the Daxing’an Mountains, China. The number of FT cycles (FTN) had a greater effect on microbial communities than FT temperature fluctuation (FTF). The FTN and FTF explained 20.9 and 10.8% of the variation in microbial community structure, respectively, and 22.9 and 11.6% of the variation in enzyme activities, respectively. The total and subgroup microbial biomass, the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F/B), and C- and N-hydrolyzing enzyme activities all decreased with an increase in FTN. Among microbial groups, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were the most sensitive to FT events. Based on the changes of F/B and AMF, the reduction in soil carbon sequestration caused by frequent FT events can be explained from a perspective of microorganisms. Based on redundancy analysis and Mental Test, soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen were the major factors affecting microorganisms in FT events. In the forest ecosystem, soil water and fertilizer were important factors to resist the damage of FT to microorganism, and sufficient water and fertilizer can lighten the damage of FT events to microorganisms. As a result of this study, the understanding of the responses of soil microorganisms to the variation in FT patterns caused by climate changes has increased, which will lead to better predictions of the effects of likely climate change on soil microorganisms. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Feng, Cai and Tang.","enzyme activity; freeze–thaw cycle frequency; freeze–thaw temperature fluctuation; microbial community structure; soil microbial biomass","cadmium; chlorophyll; cytosol aminopeptidase; fatty acid; hemicellulose; nitrogen; organic carbon; polysaccharide; soil organic matter; soil water; Article; Bacillus subtilis; Betula platyphylla; biomass; bog bilberry; climate change; DNA extraction; enzyme activity; fermentation; Firmicutes; freeze thawing; mass fragmentography; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; physical chemistry; Planctomycetes; plant height; Populus; redundancy analysis; Rhododendron; Scots pine; soil acidity; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil respiration; symbiosis; weathering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086588127

However, insufficient separation of charge carriers and weak CO2 adsorption hamper the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Herein, we tackle these challenges by introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the two-dimensional Bi4Ti3O12 ultrathin nanosheets via a combined hydrothermal and post-reduction process. Selective photodeposition experiment of Pt over Bi4Ti3O12 discloses that the ultrathin structure shortens the migration distance of photo-induced electrons from bulk to the surface, benefiting the fast participation in the CO2 reduction reaction. The introduction of OVs on ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets leads to enormous amelioration on surface state and electronic structure, thereby resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption, photoabsorption and charge separation efficiency. The photocatalytic experiments uncover that ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with OVs reveal a largely enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity for producing CO with a rate of 11.7 μmol g−1 h−1 in the gas–solid system, ~3.2 times higher than that of bulk Bi4Ti3O12. This work not only yields efficient ultrathin photocatalysts with OVs, but also furthers our understanding on enhancing CO2 reduction via cooperative tactics. © 2020 Science China Press","Bismuth titanate; Charge separation; CO2 photoreduction; Oxygen vacancies; Ultrathin nanosheets","Artificial photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Electronic structure; Nanosheets; Oxygen vacancies; Photocatalytic activity; Titanium compounds; Bismuth titanate; Charge separations; Migration distance; Photo-reduction; Photoabsorptions; Reduction process; Ultra-thin structures; Ultrathin nanosheets; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080126989

Experiments on a photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage system under maximizing self-consumption and time-of-use strategies are conducted to study the system performance and validate energy balance based battery and energy management models. Four renewable application scenarios are investigated for a typical high-rise building in Hong Kong through coupled modelling and optimizations with TRNSYS and jEPlus + EA. A comprehensive technical optimization criterion integrating the energy supply, battery storage, building demand and grid relief indicators is developed, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) considering detailed renewables benefits including the feed-in tariff, transmission loss saving, network expansion saving and carbon reduction benefit is formulated. Experimental results show that root mean square deviations between the tested and simulated battery state of charge for the two strategies are 1.49% and 0.94% respectively. It is indicated that the PV system covers 16.02% of the annual load at a LCOE of 0.5252 US$/kWh and the PV-wind system covers 53.65% of the annual load at the lowest LCOE of 0.1251 $/kWh. The added battery improves the annual average load cover ratio and self-consumption ratio by 14.08% and 16.56% respectively, while the optimum PV-wind-battery system covers 81.29% of the annual load at an affordable LCOE of 0.2230 $/kWh.

As such, it could be a potential climate mitigation tool when paired with geological sequestration of CO2or downstream conversion to produce products with low life cycle carbon intensities. Of particular interest is the ability to pair CO2from DAC with electrolytic hydrogen powered by renewable electricity to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons that can be used in transportation (often referred to as “e-fuels”). This presents a pathway additional to electric and fuel cell vehicles to harness renewable electricity for use in the transportation sector and may present an attractive opportunity as costs of renewable electricity and electrolysis equipment continue to fall. We conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a DAC system paired with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce transportation fuel (i.e., diesel). This is the first LCA study of a DAC-to-fuel process based on data from an operating DAC pilot plant. We estimate the system emits 0.51 gCO2e per gCO2captured from air or 29 gCO2e per MJ FTS fuel combusted in the baseline scenario, in which the electricity emissions factor used in the process is relatively low. This carbon intensity (CI) is extremely sensitive to changes in the electricity emissions factor. We find that an electricity emissions factor of less than 139 g CO2e per kW h is required for this pathway to provide a climate benefit over conventional diesel fuel. If a low carbon source of electricity is used, this pathway can deliver transport fuels at a CI lower than conventional diesel production and several biofuel pathways. This analysis suggests that fuel synthesis facilities need to be located in regions with very low grid emissions factors, or preferentially, co-located with new-build renewable electricity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Artificial life; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Pilot plants; Electrolytic hydrogen; Fischer-tropsch fuels; Geological sequestration; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquid hydrocarbons; Renewable electricity; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Life cycle; alternative energy; ambient air; carbon sequestration; electricity; electrokinesis; emission; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086011302

However, whether and how urban land expansion influences atmospheric humidity, a key indicator closely relating to human comfort and urban environment, warrant further investigations. By taking Guangdong Province as an example, in this study we examined the change in atmospheric moisture over South China during 1961–2014 and evaluated the urban expansion effects. We found a prominent drying tendency over Guangdong, as characterized by decreasing relative and specific humidities and increasing vapor pressure deficit. The drying trend has a positive correlation with urban expansion speed and exhibited regional differences, with particularly stronger trends in more urbanized and populated areas such as the Pearl River Delta. Using a dynamic classification of urban / rural stations based on time-varying high-resolution land use / land cover maps, we estimated that urbanization contributed to approximately 50% of the total drying trend in the urban areas of Guangdong. Possible mechanisms and processes underlying the urban expansion effect were also discussed. We suggested that the changes in atmospheric moisture and the urban expansion effect should be considered in future climate change mitigation, urban planning, and landscape design to support sustainable development in urban areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric moisture; Dynamic classification; Land use change; Long-term trend; Urbanization effect; Vapor pressure deficit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084205850

However, the studies were scant in China concerning the health effects of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5; particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter) on hospital visits for COPD. We applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to calculate relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between hospital visits for COPD and an interquartile range (24.50 μg/m3) increment of ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Yinzhou District between 2016 and 2018. The ambient PM2.5 concentration was positively associated with hospital visits for COPD at a distributed lag of 0–7 days (RR = 1.073, 95% CI, 1.016, 1.133). In the stratified analysis, we found that the association between ambient PM2.5 and COPD was stronger during the warm season (April to September) than that during the cold season (October to March), but we did not observe statistically significant differences in age groups (&lt; 60 years and ≥ 60 years) or gender groups (male and female) related to the effects of PM2.5. The associations between ambient PM2.5 and COPD became partially attenuated after the adjustment for gaseous pollutants in subgroups.

Four primary factors were resolved by constraining the profiles of the previously separated organic factors, while three unconstrained secondary factors were resolved. Secondary factors (sum of organic and inorganic components) accounted for over half of NR-PM1 during normal days (NDs, 58% or 105.7 μg m-3) and Chinese New Year (CNY, 79% or 72.6 μg m-3). Among the organic components of the total secondary aerosol, 38-48% (8.0-14.4 μg m-3) of the oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) was attributed to the nitrate-rich OOA (i.e., OOA-NO3) factor, indicating that a part of the OOA was freshly formed and/or had similar volatility as nitrate. In comparison, a portion of 25-26% (5.5-7.7 μg m-3) of the OOA was attributed to the regionally transported sulfate-rich OOA (i.e., OOA-SO4) while 26-37% (7.3-7.4 μg m-3) of the OOA to aged primary aerosol. The positive relationship between OOA-SO4 and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) in the same air mass suggested an aqueous-phase reaction pathway, which produced nearly half as much OOA as sulfate (12.0-17.0 μg m-3), while photochemical reactions could produce similar amounts of OOA as nitrate (8.6-15.4 μg m-3), as indicated by the positive relationship between OOA-NO3 and Ox (O3 + NO2). During CNY, the NR-PM1 concentrations (91.9 μg m-3) were reduced by ∼50% when compared to the nonholiday periods (182.7 μg m-3). This reduction was primarily due to the reduced anthropogenic activities, resulting in a 65-89% reduction in the primary emissions from traffic, cooking, biomass burning, and coal combustion, as well as a 1-44% reduction in secondary factors. The results in our study have significant implications for controlling primary emissions, while joint measures over a regional scale are needed to reduce the secondary aerosols in Shijiazhuang. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","air quality; Chinese New Year; oxygenated organic aerosol; particulate matter; positive matrix factorization; regional transport","aerosol; air mass; air quality; algorithm; human activity; nitrate; particulate matter; source apportionment; water content; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090929769

However, the literature addressing the rapid development issues of the photovoltaic industry and related carbon dioxide abatement costs is limited. China is currently the largest photovoltaic producer and consumer in the world, hence suitable as our research object. In this paper, a fixed effect panel model with provincial panel data during the period 2012–2016 is applied to study the factors that influence China’s photovoltaic industry. The empirical results indicate that carbon dioxide emission mitigation requirements, government subsidies, technological progress, energy substitution, economic growth, and illumination resources promote the development of the photovoltaic industry. We further adapt the cost estimation model to estimate the average carbon dioxide abatement cost of photovoltaic electric power in China at 679.72 yuan/ton in 2015 and 681.88 yuan/ton in 2016. Compared with wind power and biomass energy, photovoltaic electric power is currently less economical for carbon dioxide emission reduction. Moreover, the future carbon dioxide abatement cost is predicted using a scenario analysis at 118.94–259.42 yuan/ton in 2025 and 42.63–171.95 yuan/ton in 2030. Since the carbon dioxide abatement cost in 2030 is in line with the future price level of the carbon trading market, it will be both economical and feasible to use photovoltaic electric power to decrease carbon dioxide emissions in the future. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide abatement cost; Carbon dioxide mitigation requirements; Fixed effect panel model; Photovoltaic industry; Scenario analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083661658

In our paper we provide a preliminary evaluation of preconditions of such goal within the context of shrinking regions. Our data originates form renovation subsidy database of large renovation programme managed by state fund and form Nation Statistical Bureau. First we estimate the potential of apartment buildings occupation within the next 30 years. We exclude buildings that are going to be abandoned due to the demographical and migration reasons. Next we calculate the potential of construction sector to deliver required amount of renovations. We observe that the in our case current renovation rate must at least be increased by factor of three in order to comply with the carbon neutrality goal. This, however, is very challenging because supply of renovations' construction is limited and overstimulated demand could increase construction prices significantly while rendering the effect of state incentives inefficient. Therefore an urgent technological change in renovation delivery is required to reach carbon neutrality goals. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon; Construction industry; Apartment buildings; Carbon neutralities; Construction sectors; European union; Preliminary assessment; Residential building; Technological change; Apartment houses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088431682

In part due to sparse observations, the dispersion/transport mechanisms that lead to PM2.5 pollution over the PRD region are not yet fully understood, and the potential synoptic controls have not been investigated. In this study, systematic analyses were conducted using the multisite surface meteorological observations, two-site radiosonde measurements, and regional PM2.5 observations, based on the application of self-organizing map neural network to large-scale mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) data. The results suggested that the relative position of the PRD to high-pressure systems exerted significant effects on the dispersion conditions and the PM2.5 distribution over the PRD region. When cold high pressure invaded, the PRD region was dominated by synoptic-scale northerly flow, which caused southward pollution transport and hence positive PM2.5 anomalies in the coastal area. When cold high pressure weakened and moved eastward, the PRD region was dominated by meso/local-scale flows, resulting in strong atmospheric recirculation and elevated PM2.5 concentrations in the inland area. However, the regional average of PM2.5 concentrations was not sensitive to the changes in synoptic circulation patterns, which implied that the synoptic circulation played roles most in redistributing the air pollutants within the PRD region and hence a regional PM2.5 pollution emission reduction is needed to improve regional air quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric recirculation; PM2.5 pollution; Scale of atmospheric motion; Self-organizing map; Synoptic circulation classification","Air quality; Conformal mapping; Drought; Emission control; High pressure effects; Sea level; Self organizing maps; Atmospheric recirculation; Chinese national standard; Mean sea level pressures; Meteorological observation; Pearl River Delta region; Radiosonde measurements; Self-organizing map neural network; Synoptic circulations; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dry season; emission control; particulate matter; pollutant transport; radiosonde; self organizing map; synoptic meteorology; air pollutant; air quality; article; cold stress; dry season; human; motion; multicenter study; pollution transport; river; sea level; seashore; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083169466

Bestowed with its micro-sample consumption, the proposed method offers advantages of direct multi-element analysis in wine samples with high ethanol (1-20%) and salt contents, insignificant carbon deposits, reduced matrix effects, and better analytical performance. External calibration using either the solid reference material NIST 610 glass or aqueous standard solutions in combination with an indium internal standard provides accurate results. This calibration strategy offers a solution to the lack of a multi-element certified wine reference material for matrix-matched calibration. Twenty elements (Li, B, Mg, Al, V, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pb, and U) were determined in the wine samples. The proposed method was validated by a comparison with the conventional solution nebulization ICPMS method, with satisfying results. The detection limits for these elements were 0.01-1 ng mL-1.

(ii) Considering the climate-water-land nexus, is there a risk of shifting impacts from climate to water scarcity and land occupation, and what are the key opportunities for impact mitigation? Methods: A framework for conducting a large-scale regionalised LCA was developed and applied to compare the environmental impacts of 212 plant-based fat spreads, 16 plant-based creams and 40 dairy alternatives sold in 21 countries per 1 kg of product. Data was compiled for different product recipes, key ingredient sourcing countries, production factory locations, energy mixes, packaging designs, transportation and end-of-life scenarios. Spatially (archetype) differentiated agricultural life cycle inventory data were generated, as well as LUC emissions for agricultural ingredients. A total of 18 environmental indicators were assessed. Results and discussion: All plant-based spreads had a significantly lower climate impact than butter, with and without LUC inclusion. The regionalised analysis highlighted large variabilities across products, ranging from 0.98 to 6.93 (mean 3.3) kg CO2-eq for 212 plant-based spreads and 8.08 to 16.93 (mean 12.1) kg CO2-eq for 21 dairy butter with 95th confidence interval. The main drivers of GHG emissions for plant-based products are oilseed farming and the associated LUC emissions, which can vary significantly depending on type of oilseeds, quantity and sourcing country; in the worst-case scenario, the climate advantage is no longer valid due to LUC. Thus, the inclusion of LUC is essential for a robust assessment and hotspot identification. Overall, the risk of shifting impact was small, as most of the plant-based spreads also had lower impacts for water scarcity footprints and land occupation; 8 of the 212 products were not lower, due to oilseed ingredients with high embodied impacts. Conclusions: This study confirmed that plant-based spreads had lower climate, water and land impacts than butter, despite variability of product recipes, geographies and influence of LUC. This research offers a framework for performing regionalised agricultural LCA for a large portfolio of products thereby enabling identification of inter-product variabilities and hotspots for the development of mitigation strategies. Key mitigation opportunities include reducing oilseed ingredients’ embodied impacts by optimising product recipe design and adapting supply chain sourcing and agricultural practice. © 2020, The Author(s).","Butter; Climate change; Land occupation; Plant-based fat spreads; Regionalisation; Spatial differentiation; Water scarcity footprint","carbon dioxide; fresh water; mineral; vegetable oil; acidification; Article; butter; climate; climate change; crop production; dairy cream; deforestation; ecotoxicity; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; eutrophication; fossil; land occupation; land use; life cycle assessment; oilseed; packaging; particulate matter; plant based fat spread; plant product; priority journal; water scarcity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078054313

However, existing studies on the health effects of PM2.5 in China were less considered the regional transport of PM2.5 concentration. In this study, we aim to explore the association between lung cancer and PM2.5 and then forecast the PM2.5-induced lung cancer morbidity and mortality in China. Ridge regression (RR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), model tree-based (MT) regression, regression tree (RT) approach, and the combined forecasting model (CFM) were alternative forecasting models. The result of the Pearson correlation analysis showed that both local and regional scale PM2.5 concentration had a significant association with lung cancer mortality and morbidity and compared with the local lag and regional lag exposure to ambient PM2.5; the regional lag effect (0.172~0.235 for mortality; 0.146~0.249 for morbidity) was not stronger than the local lag PM2.5 exposure (0.249~0.294 for mortality; 0.215~0.301 for morbidity). The overall forecasting lung cancer morbidity and mortality were 47.63, 47.86, 39.38, and 39.76 per 100,000 population. The spatial distributions of lung cancer morbidity and mortality share a similar spatial pattern in 2015 and 2016, with high lung cancer morbidity and mortality areas mainly located in the central to east coast areas in China.

Here, using 2,683 observations from 240 journal articles, we conducted a global meta-analysis to reveal effects of N addition on 14 photosynthesis-related traits and affecting moderators. We found that across 320 terrestrial plant species, leaf N was enhanced comparably on mass basis (Nmass, +18.4%) and area basis (Narea, +14.3%), with no changes in specific leaf area or leaf mass per area. Total leaf area (TLA) was increased significantly, as indicated by the increases in total leaf biomass (+46.5%), leaf area per plant (+29.7%), and leaf area index (LAI, +24.4%). To a lesser extent than for TLA, N addition significantly enhanced leaf photosynthetic rate per area (Aarea, +12.6%), stomatal conductance (gs, +7.5%), and transpiration rate (E, +10.5%). The responses of Aarea were positively related with that of gs, with no changes in instantaneous water-use efficiency and only slight increases in long-term water-use efficiency (+2.5%) inferred from 13C composition. The responses of traits depended on biological, experimental, and environmental moderators. As experimental duration and N load increased, the responses of LAI and Aarea diminished while that of E increased significantly. The observed patterns of increases in both TLA and E indicate that N deposition will increase the amount of water used by plants. Taken together, N deposition will enhance gross photosynthetic C gain of the terrestrial plants while increasing their water loss to the atmosphere, but the effects on C gain might diminish over time and that on plant water use would be amplified if N deposition persists. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","leaf area; N addition; N deposition; photosynthesis; plant carbon gain; plant functional traits; plant water use","carbon cycle; leaf area index; meta-analysis; nitrogen; photosynthesis; plant community; stomatal conductance; terrestrial environment; transpiration; water use efficiency; nitrogen; water; evapotranspiration; meta analysis; photosynthesis; plant; plant leaf; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Transpiration; Plants; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083046805

We propose improvements to a country specific method for estimating N2O emissions from agricultural soils in Canada based on a compilation of soil N2O flux data from recent published literature. We provide a framework for the development of empirical models that could be applied in regions where similar data and information on N2O emissions are available. The method considers spatial elements such as soil texture, topography and climate based on a quantitative empirical relationship between synthetic N-induced soil N2O emission factor (EF) and growing season precipitation (P) {N2OEF = e(0.00558P−7.7)}. Emission factors vary from less than 0.0025 kg N2O-N kg N−1 in semi-arid regions of Canada to greater than 0.025 kg N2O-N kg N−1 in humid regions. This approach differentiates soil N2O EFs based on management factors. Specifically, empirical ratio factors are applied for sources of N of 1.0, 0.84, and 0.28 for synthetic N, animal manure N and crop residue N, respectively. Crop type ratio factors where soil N2O EFs from applied manure- and synthetic-N on perennial crops are approximately 19% of those on annual crops. This proposed approach improves the accuracy of the dominant factors that modulate N2O emissions from N application to soils. © 2020, Crown.","Crop residue N; Organic N; Perennial/annual crop; Soil N2O emissions; Synthetic N; Tillage","agricultural soil; crop residue; estimation method; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; mitigation; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Canada; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083223275

Reductive acetogenesis by acetogens is a possible alternative sink that can dispose of hydrogen for acetate production. However, the distribution of rumen methanogens and acetogens along with the relationships among methanogens, acetogens, and their host are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the rumen methanogen and acetogen communities of 97 individual animals representing 14 ruminant species within three ruminant families Cervidae (deer), Bovidae (bovid), and Moschidae (musk deer). The results showed that the Methanobrevibacter spp. and acetogens associated with Eubacteriaceae were the most widespread methanogens and acetogens, respectively. However, other methanogens and acetogens exhibited host specificity in the rumen of reindeer and Chinese muntjac deer. Acetogen and methanogen communities were not correlated in these species, and the phylosymbiosis signature between host phylogeny and the composition of both communities was lacking. The abundance of Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii was negatively correlated with the degree of papillation of the rumen wall. Finally, co-occurrence analysis showed that the variation of the predicted methane yields was characterized by the interactive patterns between methanogens, acetogens, and concentrations of rumen metabolites. Our results show that rumen methanogen and acetogen communities have low compositional interdependence and do not exhibit parallel host evolution, which suggests that the strategies for mitigating methane production should be based on a species-specific rumen microbiota analysis. © Copyright © 2020 Li, Wang, Alberdi, Deng, Zhong, Si, Zheng, Zhou, Wang, Yang, Wright, Mao, Zhang, Guan and Li.","host–microbiome interaction; methane; phylosymbiosis; reindeer; rumen epithelium; ruminants","volatile fatty acid; acetogen; Article; bootstrapping; bovid; cell structure; cell wall; controlled study; deer; DNA extraction; Eubacteriaceae; functional genomics; gene amplification; gene library; high throughput sequencing; host microbe interaction; host range; metabolite; Methanobrevibacter; methanogen; microbial interaction; microbiome; molecular ecology; Moschidae; nonhuman; organisms by metabolism; phylogeny; protozoon; real time polymerase chain reaction; rumen; species composition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087891578

We take the province of Shanxi, a typical coal resource-based area in China, as an example, and use the dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the impact of carbon tax on employment under various carbon tax revenue recycling schemes. We disaggregate the employment effect into demand effect, cost effect, factor-shift effect, and investment-pull effect to analyze the transmission path of the influence of carbon tax on employment. The results show that the carbon tax is conducive to alleviating the pressures on employment reduction in coal resource-based areas. Compared with the scenario of no carbon tax revenue recycling, the pressures on employment reduction under the scenario where carbon tax is returned to residents or enterprises in different forms, are allayed. More into detail, carbon tax has the least inhibiting effect on industry employment in case that tax revenue is returned to residents in the form of transfer payment. In addition, there is a prominent difference in the transmission path through which the carbon tax promotes employment, that is, the single effect, or the combination of demand effect, cost effect, factor-shift effect, and investment-pull effect. However, the carbon tax would obstruct employment principally through the demand effect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; CGE model; Employment; Tax revenue recycling","Carbon; Coal; Coal deposits; Costs; Emission control; Employment; Recycling; Transmissions; Carbon taxes; CGE model; Computable general equilibrium model; Employment effects; Inhibiting effect; Tax revenue; Transfer payment; Transmission paths; Taxation; coal supply; computable general equilibrium analysis; cost analysis; demand analysis; employment; environmental economics; investment; pollution tax; recycling; tax system; Article; capital; carbon tax; China; computable general equilibrium model; controlled study; cost; economic model; employment; gross national product; human; industry; investment; market; priority journal; production cost; tax; China; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080132411

While urban building energy-use modeling has been widely applied in many studies, limited studies have been conducted for Manhattan, New York City (NYC). Since the release of the new ""80-by-50""law, the NYC government has committed to reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050; indeed, the government is facing a big challenge for reducing the energy use and carbon emissions. Therefore, understanding the building energy use of NYC with a high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for the government and local citizens in managing building energy use. This study quantified the building energy use of Manhattan in NYC with consideration of the local microclimate by integrating two popular modeling platforms, the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) and Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM). The research results suggest that (1) the largest building energy use is in central Manhattan, which is composed of large numbers of commercial buildings; (2) a similar seasonal electricity-use pattern and significantly different seasonal gas-use patterns could be found in Manhattan, NYC, due to the varied seasonal cooling and heating demand; and (3) the hourly energy-use profiles suggest only one electricity-use peak in the summer and two gas-use peaks in the winter. © 2020 by the authors.","Building energy use; Localized weather data; Manhattan; Urban building energy use model","Carbon; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Building energy use; Building sectors; Carbon emissions; Commercial building; Energy use profile; Manhattan , New York; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Weather generator; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089983861

Different energy system modelling approaches can be used to systematically evaluate the influence of the uncertainties, but this often leads to an unmanageable number of pathways. Summarising the large ensemble through a more limited number of representative pathways, to inform stakeholders, can be challenging. This study thus explores how to identify representative decarbonisation pathways using clustering algorithms, which can assist in grouping similar data points in uncategorised datasets, such as pathway ensembles. However, the suitability of clustering algorithms for pathway characterisation has not been investigated to date. Hence, k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture model, spectral clustering, and density-based clustering are adopted for comparisons. An illustrative pathway ensemble for the United Kingdom is applied to evaluate their performance based on cluster validity indices. Three metric transformations, including power, standardisation and sectoral standardisation, are also applied to create three additional sets of pathways for testing. The k-means algorithm is found to outperform others consistently, although hierarchical clustering might also be applicable if the distribution of pathway proximity is uneven. The results also highlight the utility of the approach in revealing distinctive trade-offs between technologies among the identified representative pathways. For instance, the electrification of heating can be replaced by district heating in the residential sector. The described, novel approach can be applied to characterise other sets of pathways, with greater technological details generated by any energy system models, to reveal insights for long-term decarbonisation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering analysis; Decarbonisation pathways; Energy transition; Uncertainty","Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; Gaussian distribution; Hierarchical clustering; Standardization; Uncertainty analysis; Cluster validity indices; Density-based Clustering; Energy system model; Energy system modelling; Gaussian Mixture Model; Metric transformation; Residential sectors; Spectral clustering; K-means clustering; algorithm; chemical reaction; data set; electrification; heating; model; modeling; performance assessment; standardization; uncertainty analysis; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083429412

Taking economic benefit maximization, environmental benefit maximization and energy efficiency maximization as sub-objectives, the mathematical model of multi-objective optimal allocation and operation strategy of the energy internet is established considering supply-demand balance constraints, equipment characteristic constraints, operation mode constraints, and energy conditions constraints. The calculation results show that without considering the outsourced electricity, the balanced strategy, the economic development strategy, the environmental protection strategy, and the energy efficiency strategy are obtained by calculation, which are all superior to the traditional energy supply strategy. Moreover, considering the outsourced electricity, the proportion of outsourced electricity to total electricity is 19.8%, which is the system optimization of the energy internet under certain power demand. Compared with other strategies without outsourced electricity, the outsourced electricity strategy can have a certain emission reduction effect, but at the same time reduce the economic benefit. Furthermore, the huge difference in demand for thermal and cooling load between industrial and commercial areas results in the installed capacity of gas distributed energy stations in industrial areas being nearly twice as large as that in commercial areas.

Here, an analysis was undertaken to quantify crop production-related greenhouse gas emissions in China over the period 1991–2015, using Kaya's equation to identify its drivers. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method was adopted to separately quantify the contributions of the efficiency, structure, economy and labor factors. The analysis identified that the efficiency, structure and labor factors acted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of 455.93, 49.42, 98.75 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, respectively, while the economy factor contributed to increase of 637.30 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. On a regional basis, the contributions to the national greenhouse gas emissions differed, ranging from −8.24 to 20.86 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Furthermore, the influence of efficiency, structure, economy and labor factors also varied significantly by region. For each region, the management of different factors or combinations of these would be necessary in order to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions in the future: for the northern, north-western and north-eastern regions, it was the efficiency, structure and labor factors; for the eastern region it was the economy factor; for the central-southern region it was the economy and the labor factors; and for the south-western region it was all four factors. Regarding the effect of the efficiency factor, controlling this requires the reduction of chemical fertilizer usage and submerged irrigation time, and the selection of good varieties. With respect to the structure factor effect, the optimization of the agriculture structure is required, particularly in Gansu, Hainan and Shanghai. As for the economic factor, managing its effect requires a moderate economic growth rate with a higher quality of economic development, and the acceleration of the development of agricultural science and technology innovation, guidance and promotion. Finally, the labor factor effect may be controlled with the improvement of the level of agricultural intensification. This study identified, decomposed and quantified the driving factors of the national and regional crop production-derived greenhouse gas emissions and provided practice ways for greenhouse gas inhabitation in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crop production; Factor decomposition; Greenhouse gas emissions; LMDI","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Agricultural intensification; Agricultural science and technology innovations; Chemical fertilizers; Crop production; Divisia index method; Factor decompositions; LMDI; North eastern region; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079394900

The aim of this study is to propose a unified model for simultaneously optimizing crop planting area, irrigation water, and nitrogen fertilizer considering uncertainty. Water, carbon, energy, and ecological footprints are analyzed to jointly evaluate the re-allocation of resource. The proposed model has an advantage in addressing trade-offs of land, water, and fertilizer resources for different irrigation subareas in a cost-efficient, resources-efficient, and environmental-friendly manner, thus helping decision makers track resource utilization and where effort should be made from different perspectives, and also dealing with non-linearity and uncertainty. The model is applied to an irrigation district in northeast China. Results demonstrate that rice production is based on the simultaneous allocation of land, water, and fertilizer resources, but the objectives for the optimization model are conflicting. The model performs best when both water supply and precipitation are at their medium level. Compared with status quo, the value of irrigation water use efficiency increases by 1.6%, and the value of Global warming potential deceases by 7.45%. The allocation of 1.596 × 107 m3 of water can be regarded as a reference amount for water planning, which is obtained by considering possible scenarios of high-low flow level combinations of water supply and precipitation. Results of “footprint family” assessment suggest that improving the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization is particularly important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, and indicate that land re-allocation helps improve the utilization of rice straw. The proposed model can help manage agricultural land, water, and fertilizer resources in a sustainable way in a changing environment, and is applicable for similar agriculture-centered regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Footprint family; Land-water-fertilizer; Modelling; Randomness; Rice; Sustainability","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Models; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sustainable development; Water supply; Environmental-friendly; Footprint family; Global warming potential; Irrigation water use efficiency; Randomness; Rice; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable management; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080892789

The explosive characteristic parameters including flame configuration, velocity of flame propagation, explosion pressure, and pressure rising rate are quantified and revealed. The difference of explosion mitigation effect of ordinary and ultra-fine ABC dry powders are examined based upon the specific surface area and the settling velocity. As the concentration of ordinary or ultra-fine ABC dry powder increases, the explosion pressure initially increases and decreases afterwards, indicating that there is an optimal mass concentration of explosion mitigation for both powders. The effect of ignition delay time on the explosion mitigation of ultra-fine ABC dry powder is characterized on the basis of the turbulent lever and the dry powder particle settling state.

The results show that residents' knowledge of the electricity price policy indirectly affects their habitual intentions by affecting their attitudes whereas residents' knowledge of the subsidy policy have direct effects on their investment intentions. Environmental concern can directly affect residents' habituation and investment intentions and also indirectly affect their habituation ones by affecting their personal moral norm. However, its indirect effect on the investment intention is not significant. Perceived behavioral control has a significant positive impact on residents' investment intentions and behaviors, but the impacts on their habituation ones are not significant.

Based on the distribution of travel modes, transportation engineers could provide some proper strategies to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. With advanced sensing techniques, it is possible to collect high-resolution GPS trajectory data of travelers and we can infer travel modes using some popular machine learning methods. One of the difficult tasks facing the application of machine learning especially deep learning in travel mode detection is the lack of large, labeled dataset, because to label the trajectory data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, samples of different travel modes are always unbalanced. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of the generative model and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a hybrid travel modes detection model using less labeled trajectory data. Our key contribution is the utilization of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to artificially create some training samples in such a way that it not only increases the required sample size but balances the dataset to improve the accuracy of the detection model. Furthermore, CNN is applied to extract deep features of trajectory data, and then to classify the travel modes. The results show that the highest accuracy (86.70%) can be achieved by the proposed model. In particular, the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy of bus and driving modes because it can solve the small sample size problem. Moreover, the large sample size can provide an opportunity to develop some advanced deep learning models in future studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Deep learning; Trajectory data; Transportation planning","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Large dataset; Motor transportation; Sampling; Traffic congestion; Trajectories; Adversarial networks; Detection accuracy; Infrastructure design; Machine learning methods; Sensing techniques; Small sample size problems; Transportation engineers; Transportation planning; Learning systems; artificial neural network; GPS; machine learning; transportation mode; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083756064

Lungs are considered the primary organ affected by PM2.5. In order to understand the mechanism underlying PM2.5-induced lung injury, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis were conducted to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on lung microbiome and its metabolic profile. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 through intratracheal instillation and a lung injury model was established. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that PM2.5 exposure significantly altered the richness, evenness, and composition of the lung microbiome. Metabolomics profiling showed that the levels of lung metabolites were perturbed after PM2.5 exposure. The altered metabolites mainly belonged to metabolic pathways, such as the citrate cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism. The altered lung microbiota showed significant correlations with lung metabolites. The levels of fumaric acid negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. These results revealed that PM2.5 exposure not only significantly altered the lung microbiome composition but also perturbed a number of metabolites involved in diverse metabolic pathways.

The effectiveness of EV in decreasing GHG emissions is influenced by factors such as electric energy structure, climate and power economy of EV, needs to be further explored. Consequently, a modified electric vehicle emissions index (MEVEI) model is established to conduct a China case study and quantify the effect of these factors on the GHG emissions of EV in 31 provinces. The provinces are divided into eight clusters via k-means cluster analysis of electric energy structure and climate. After clusters with a similar power economy value of EV are combined, the eight clusters are merged into five. For provinces in cluster III and IV where fossil-fuel electricity accounts for more than 80%, the GHG emissions of EV can be reduced through trade-off between fossil-fuel electricity proportion and power economy of EV. When the temperature is sub-zero, the GHG emissions of EV are higher than those of fuel vehicle (FV); when the temperature is above 25 °C, the usage of EV can be promoted to make the GHG emissions of EV less than those of FV. When the power economy value of class III EV decreases by 20%, EV deployment can reduce the GHG emissions in provinces except cluster V. Policy recommendations are formulated in consideration of the specific obstacles of EV promotion. Moreover, the result establishes a solid foundation for accurate performance evaluation of the GHG emissions of EV for four quarters in 31 China's provinces. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Climate; Electric energy structure; Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas emissions; Policy recommendations; Power economy of EV",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080986356

Understanding the mechanism of greenhouse gas emissions from soil and their impact factors is essential for cleaner agricultural production and global greenhouse gas mitigation. This paper investigated greenhouse gas emissions from soil of mulching cultivated maize (Zea mays L.) field under different irrigation and fertilization regimes. Border and drip irrigation with different schedules were implemented in the upper reaches of Yellow River, China. Border irrigation included three different irrigation depths (180, 315 and 450 mm), and drip irrigation was controlled by a tensiometer and triggered by three different matric potentials (−15, −25 and −35 kPa). Three nitrogen fertilizer levels (350, 250 and 150 kg ha−1) were applied for the drip irrigation triggered by the matric potential of −25 kPa. Soil acted as a sink of CH4 in the semiarid site regardless of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes. Irrigation scheduling had no significant influence on CO2 emissions, but the irrigation method did have. Cumulative CO2 emissions increased by 24.7% for drip irrigation compared with border irrigation at the same water and nitrogen fertilizer levels. Cumulative CO2 emissions for the high nitrogen fertilizer treatment (350 kg ha−1) increased by 19.3% in comparison with the medium and low levels under drip irrigation. N2O emissions were positively related to the irrigation depth under both drip and border irrigation. Cumulative N2O emissions reduced by 23.5% for drip irrigation compared with border irrigation at the same water and nitrogen fertilizer levels. N2O emissions increased with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer application under drip irrigation. Drip irrigation with high frequency (−15 kPa) and medium nitrogen fertilization (250 kg ha−1) obtained the best economic and environmental performance through comprehensive evaluation of the yield, water and fertilizer productivity, global warming potential, greenhouse gas intensity and net ecosystem economic budget. The findings can provide an opportunity for greenhouse gas mitigation without crop yield reduction following the proper irrigation and fertilization regimes in the semiarid region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Border irrigation; Drip irrigation; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen fertilizer","Arid regions; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Water management; Agricultural productions; Border irrigation; Comprehensive evaluation; Drip irrigation; Economic and environmental performance; Fertilizer applications; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Irrigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081403102

Moreover, hydropower plants provide comprehensive utilization functions in many areas, including flood control, shipping, and emission reduction. In the current contradictive situation between power supply and demand, China's hydropower grid pricing mechanism does not reflect the positive externality of hydropower, which is not conducive to fair competition between hydropower and other power sources. This study proposed the concept of the positive external electricity price (PEEP) and a pricing mechanism that considered, for the first time, the values of hydropower positive externality factors by using the positive externality theory. A representative quasi-public welfare power plant of the Sichuan power grid was used to empirically evaluate the model. The pricing mechanism of reservoir power plants proposed in this paper considered the power grid benefits, flood control benefits, shipping benefits, and emission reduction benefits of hydropower, and allowed for the internalization of the positive externality. The hydropower grid prices based on our recommendations did not cause a dramatic impact on the local power grid; furthermore, the model helped promote the social responsibility of power companies through the pricing guidance for improving economic benefits by increasing positive externalities. © 2020 The Authors","Hydropower; Positive externality; Pricing mechanism; Social benefits; Value quantification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089580976

To combat this form of air pollution, many different strategies and policies are investigated: from reducing the emission of particulate matter to finding ways of filtering the air. In this study, we explore the idea of using trees in an urban area to reduce particulate matter concentration. Since the absorption of fine dust by trees is a complex problem, influenced by many factors, we use a computer model to simulate the effect of various trees throughout the year to find the optimal candidate. We find that coniferous trees have a significant advantage, since they also absorb during the winter months, where the air quality is worse. We also conclude that a large enough area of a well-suited tree species is a feasible way to increase air quality and in some cases even to reduce the particulate matter pollution to an acceptable level. © 2019, The Author(s).","Fine dust; Molecular dynamics; Particulate matter; Pollution absorption; Urban pollution","absorption; air quality; computer simulation; coniferous tree; feasibility study; health risk; particulate matter; pollution control; urban area; Coniferales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072101917

These are readily detected on seismic profiles by definable direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI). However, the presence of residual gases causes many production failures. Two shallow (< 1500 m) pay zones were investigated in this study; both display seismic flat bright spots. The shallower pay zone (pay zone 1) comprises prograding distributary channel-fill sandstones, whereas the deeper pay zone 2 constitutes the transgressive distal sand bars. Pay zone 1 sandstones have better reservoir quality in terms of porosity (Av. 25.68%), permeability (86 md), water saturation (Av. 43.26%), and hence host thick gas accumulation (~ 15 m) with high net/gross (N/G) ratio ~ 0.98. On the other hand, pay zone 2 has a significant reservoir heterogeneity and contains only residual gases with N/G ratio of 0.26. The eodiagenetic infiltration of clays (Av. 31.46%), authigenic precipitation of glauconite (Av. 7%), and formation of pseudomatrix materials (Av. 2%) in pay zone 2 sandstones have the most detrimental impact on their reservoir quality. Elevated water saturation in pay zone 2 (Av. 64%) reduced the movable hydrocarbon content and results in accumulation of residual gases. Mild mechanical compaction preserved the intergranular porosity of the pay zone 1 sandstones, and incursion of meteoric water facilitated the dissolution of feldspars, the neoformation of secondary pore spaces (Av. 2.9%), and thus increased the reservoir storage and flow capacities.

In a spray visualization and particle number (PN) measurement experiment, injection timing and engine load were varied to examine their effects on the spray behavior including cylinder wetting that causes the emission of particulate matter. The analysis was based on the time-averaged spray images, spray variations between the cycles, combustion, and PN emission characteristics. The spray structure in the cylinder under the engine operating conditions used in the present study was a collapsed spray that was evident at high pressure injection under atmospheric conditions. For an injection timing of before top death center (BTDC) 300 deg, at the initial stage of the intake process, the magnitude of spray deflection formed by the in-cylinder flow interacting with the spray in the reverse direction increased owing to the high pressure injection promoting fuel atomization and increasing the effects of the in-cylinder flow. The spray variations between the cycles caused by the in-cylinder flow in the region of spray deflection were also increased by high pressure injection. When the weak in-cylinder flow was formed in the late intake process (BTDC 210 deg), increasing the injection pressure accelerated the initial droplet velocity and increased the amount of fuel reaching the cylinder wall opposite the injector, thus increasing the wall film and PN emissions. In contrast, for the conditions under which the wall film was formed on the piston top by fuel interaction, the large droplet momentum corresponding to high pressure injection increased in the amount of rebounded droplets at collision, thereby reducing the amount of wall film and PN emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Gasoline direct injection engine; In-cylinder flow; Particulate matter emission; Spray behavior; Spray impingement","Atmospheric structure; Drops; Engine cylinders; Fuels; High pressure effects; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Direct injection spark ignition engines; Emission characteristics; Engine operating conditions; Gasoline direct injection; High pressure injection system; High-pressure injection; Measurement experiments; Particulate matter emissions; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083655879

Therefore, AMF are currently considered to be effective partners in phytoremediation. However, AMF communities in high levels of petroleum pollution are still poorly studied. We investigated the community structures of AMF in roots and rhizospheric soils of two plant species, Eleocharis elliptica and Populus tremuloides, growing spontaneously in high petroleum-contaminated sedimentation basins of a former petrochemical plant (91,000 µg/Kg of C10–C50 was recorded in a basin which is 26-fold higher than the threshold of polluted soil in Quebec, Canada). We used a PCR cloning, and sequencing approach, targeting the 18S rRNA gene to identify AMF taxa. The high concentration of petroleum-contamination largely influenced the AMF diversity, which resulted in less than five AMF operational taxonomical units (OTUs) per individual plant at all sites. The OTUs detected belong mainly to the Glomerales, with some from the Diversisporales and Paraglomerales, which were previously reported in high concentrations of metal contamination. Interestingly, we found a strong phylogenetic signal in OTU associations with host plant species identity, biotopes (roots or soils), and contamination concentrations (lowest, intermediate and highest). The genus Rhizophagus was the most dominant taxon representing 74.4% of all sequences analyzed in this study and showed clear association with the highest contamination level. The clear association of Rhizophagus with high contamination levels suggests the importance of the genus for the use of AMF in bioremediation, as well as for the survey of key AMF genes related to petroleum hydrocarbon resistance. By favoring plant fitness and mediating its soil microbial interactions, Rhizophagus spp. could enhance petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant degradation by both plants and their microbiota in contaminated sites. © 2020 by the authors.

To achieve this goal, we investigated the spatial distribution of vegetation, differences in species composition and diversity among vegetation types different in damage degree, vegetation dynamics, the age structure and annual ring growth of two dominant plant species, and the landscape change that occurred in this area over the last 50 years. Plant communities tended to be spatially distributed in the order of grassland, shrubland (dominated by Styrax japonicus Siebold and Zucc. community), and forests (dominated by Pinus thunbergii Parl. and Pinus densiflora Siebold and Zucc. communities), with increasing distance from the pollution source. The result of stand ordination based on vegetation data reflected the trend of such a spatial distribution. Species richness evaluated based on the species rank dominance curve was the highest in shrubland and the lowest in grassland; species richness in forests was intermediate. The size class distribution of woody plant species in four plant communities composing three vegetation types showed the possibility of them being replaced by forest in the late successional stage. However, the density of successor trees was relatively low, whereas the density of shrubby plants, which are resilient to air pollution, was very high. The age class distribution of a dominant species forming shrubland and pine forest showed that most of them were recruited after industrialization in this area. The period when young individuals in both vegetation types were recruited corresponded to the period when the annual ring growth of the pine trees that survived air pollution was reduced. An analysis of the landscape change in this area indicated that coniferous forest and agricultural field decreased greatly, whereas industrial area, residential area, mixed forest, and broadleaved forest showed increasing trends since construction of the industrial complex. As a result, the decrease in coniferous forest is usually due to vegetation decline and partially to succession, as the pine trees dominating the forest are not only sensitive to air pollution but are also shade-intolerant. The increase in mixed and broadleaved forests reflects vegetation decline or succession. Vegetation decline progressed for about 30 years after the construction of the industrial complex; it has begun to be restored passively since then, although the change has been slow. These results are in line with the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis that environmental degradation increases in the early stages of economic growth to a certain point, and, after a turning point, economic development leads to environmental improvements-thus, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Industrial complex; Korea; Passive restoration; Vegetation damage","Agricultural robots; Air pollution; Conservation; Geomorphology; Industrial economics; Population distribution; Restoration; Vegetation; Broad-leaved forests; Dominant plant species; Environmental improvements; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Industrial activities; Passive restorations; Socio-economic change; Vegetation dynamics; Forestry; broad-leaved forest; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental restoration; forest cover; growth response; industrial district; industrial emission; Kuznets curve; plant community; pollutant source; population decline; spatial distribution; species diversity; species richness; Air Pollution; Conservation; Forestry; Korea; Plants; Restoration; South Korea; Pinus densiflora; Pinus thunbergii; Styrax japonicus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087769848

The results indicate that the LCOE for commercial solar power ranged from KRW115 (10 cents)/kWh to KRW 197.4 (18 cents)/kWh at a confidence level of 95%. The median was estimated at KRW 160.03 (15 cents)/kWh. The LCOE for residential solar power ranged from KRW109.7 (10 cents)/kWh to KRW 194.1 (18 cents)/kWh at a 95% confidence level and a median value of KRW 160.03 (15 cents)/kWh. A sensitivity analysis shows that capital expenditure has the most significant impact on the LCOE for solar power, followed by the discount rate and corporate tax. This study proposes that policymakers implement energy policies to reduce solar PV hardware and soft costs. © 2020 by the authors.","LCOE; Renewable energy; Solar PV; South Korea; Stochastic","Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Taxation; Capacity factors; Capital expenditures; Confidence levels; Levelized cost of electricities; Power plant operations; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaics; Stochastic approach; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088018583

Effects of the natural climate variability and colonization on the landscape have been described since the beginning of the 16th century but little is known about their effects on natural resources. Climate projections predict temperatures above 40 °C and an increase in the number and duration of droughts at the end of the 21st century with strong societal impacts. Here, we analyze the influence of public policies, human activities and natural climate variability on the environment over the last 60 years. Our study is based on sedimentological and environmental reconstructions from two sediment cores collected in two dam lakes on the river Acaraú in the State of Ceará. Multiproxy analyses of both cores (inorganic geochemistry, pollen, charcoal, remote sensing) at an annual resolution showed that 1) at interannual scale composition and distribution of the dry forest (known as Caatinga) were not affected by the alternance of drought and high moisture episodes; 2) at decadal scale human activities such as agriculture were reflected by changes in vegetation cover and fishery by progressive changes in lake trophic status; 3) public policies were able to promote changes in the landscape e.g., land colonization with the regression of the dry forest and irrigation plan able to amplify the deforestation and change the floristic composition. Thanks to paleo-science approach, our environmental diagnosis should help future decision-making and provide guidelines for preservation of resources and wellbeing of the inhabitants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Caatinga; Drought; Human impact; Lake reservoir; Land degradation; Sediment","Arid regions; Charcoal; Climatology; Decision making; Deforestation; Drought; Lakes; Public policy; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Caatinga; Environmental diagnosis; Environmental reconstruction; Floristic compositions; Human impact; Inorganic geochemistries; Land degradation; Natural climate variabilities; Sediments; biodiversity; climate variation; core analysis; decision making; deforestation; drought; environmental policy; guideline; human activity; land degradation; paleoclimate; policy analysis; sediment core; semiarid region; twenty first century; Article; Brazil; climate change; Constant Flux Constant Sedimentation model; deforestation; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental recolonization; geochemistry; hydrography; image processing; landscape; mathematical model; moisture; paleolimnology; priority journal; remote sensing; sea surface temperature; sediment; sedimentation; sedimentology; semiarid climate; vegetation; Brazil; Ceara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082503942

This article analyzes the situation of Madrid Central (Spain), a LEZ subject to controversy. We apply statistical and regression analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of this measure to reduce air pollution and outdoor noise.

Nevertheless, spatialized meteorological data are now available with different spatial resolutions, temporal frequencies, and time depths. Here with the Paris area as a case study, three products were selected for their comparable spatial resolution of 1 km, their daily frequency, and a minimum 15-year time period with substantial common overlap: the MODIS products for land surface temperature (2000–2016), daily maps of minimum and maximum 2-m air temperatures (2000–2017) based on a statistical method of spatialization, and the COMEPHORE analysis for precipitation (1997–2012). Several spatialized indicators were used to monitor the urban climate and its impact on local climate. The intensity and spatial extent of both the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and the urban heat island of urban canopy layer (UHI), as well as the effect of the city on precipitation, were characterized. Based on these indicators, a climatological study was made for the Paris urban area and its surroundings. The comparison of (S)UHI climatologies showed that both phenomena (qualified by their intensity and spatial extent) have comparable seasonalities and orders of magnitude at night. The maximum intensity is reached in July, with more than 60% of the city affected by high temperatures. However, the phenomena differ during the day: the SUHI is mostly driven by the differences in surface properties between urban and rural environments, whereas the UHI is more influenced by general wind circulation and local atmospheric turbulence. Finally, the COMEPHORE analysis highlighted the influence of the Paris urban area on rainfall. It is observed throughout the year with an excess in daily precipitation of 29% downwind of the city, with some seasonal variability showing a more pronounced effect in summer. © 2019 The Authors.

To allow these new diffusion scenarios of electric vehicles, adjustments to the electricity grid are needed, including an increase in charging points and financing mechanisms. The spread of electric vehicles will contribute to urban sustainability, thanks to the delocalization of air pollution, the reduction of noise pollution, the implementation of the use of renewable sources in widespread generation.However, uncontrolled recharging could increase the peak load in the smart grid, which therefore requires distribution-level controls and correct planning for the recharging stations is needed in order to power the EVs avoiding network congestion. In fact, if electric vehicles are charged at the same time in an uncontrolled way, this would lead to an increase in energy demand, with the possible peak increase on the network, contributing to the overload and the need for updates at the distribution level, if not the need to adapt the generation capacity, with modified cost profiles. This opens new models for charging, business and regulatory systems, for managing the fleet of electric vehicles.

We found only 13% of threatened species and 24% of threatened ecological communities have climate change identified as a threat. Amphibians had the highest proportion of species with a climate change threat identified (37%), followed by mammals (25%), birds (17%), reptiles (15%) and plants (10%). The sample sizes of freshwater algae and marine mammals were too small to be considered. Threatened species and ecological communities that had climate change listed as a threat were predominately associated with wet and montane habitats, highlighting the vulnerability of these environments. The estimates of the extinction threat from climate change to species and ecological communities in NSW are likely to be highly conservative.

This Industrial Internet of Things (MoT, also called Industry 4.0) is beginning to shape the way aluminum processors are designed and operated, introducing new ways of working, with increased data access for all levels of personnel, from maintenance to management. Smart systems, incorporating sensors and wireless communication, together with internet-enabled data storage and processing technology (commonly referred to as the Cloud) are making more and more data available, which brings about new challenges in analyzing and managing large data sets. In-depth process knowledge is key to filtering through the data to identify key performance in-dicators ana interpret trends and associations correctly, leading to the creation of computer models of the aluminum processing equipment (or digital twins). The growth of self-learning computer programs (i.e., machine learning and artificial intelligence), along with the increased computing power that tne Cloud brings, has led to capabilities that can be used to streamline data analysis and improve the understanding of relationships between key parameters in aluminum manufacturing processes.

Buildings, mobility, and energy systems are closely linked, and assessing their nexus by aiming for Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZENs) provides a unique chance to contribute to climate change mitigation. We conducted a life-cycle assessment of a Norwegian ZEN and designed four scenarios to test the influence of the house size, household size, and energy used and produced in the buildings as well as mobility patterns. We ran our scenarios with different levels of decarbonization of the electricity mix over a period of 60 years. Our results show the importance of the operational phases of both the buildings and mobility in the neighborhood's construction, and its decline over time induced by the decarbonization of the electricity mix. At the neighborhood end-of-life, embodied emissions then become responsible for the majority of the emissions when the electricity mix is decarbonized. The choice of functional unit is decisive, and we thus argue for the use of a primary functional unit “per neighborhood,” and a second “per person.” The use of a “per m2” functional unit is misleading as it does not give credits to the precautionary use of floor area.

In response to sea ice reductions due to climate change, parturient polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation are increasingly accessing coastal topography for suitable denning habitat. Land-denning bears are more susceptible to anthropogenic stressors, chiefly in areas with high levels of energy exploration, extraction, and production. For over 30 years, denning polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation have been monitored directly or through opportunistic observations. Scientists have opportunistically recorded polar bear responses to aircraft, snow machines, track vehicles, heavy machinery, trucks, dogs, and humans afoot within the denning area. The long-term nature of this work and associated human-bear interaction observations represent a unique dataset that provides insight to wildlife managers into the way polar bears have responded to anthropogenic stimuli in active oil fields. Our objective here is to analyze the different disturbance stimuli at den sites and the associated bear responses. To do so, we subdivided potential stimuli into four groups based on the size, noise levels, and motion of each. Both field notes and video recordings of interactions were analyzed and ranked by response intensity where available. We found significant probabilities for disturbance among all stimulus classes, with aircraft showing the highest potential for initiating den abandonment. However, while all human activities elicited varying degrees of response, the overall response intensity was less than anticipated, even under high-use scenarios. Our data indicate that the current guideline of a 1.6 km (1 mile) buffer zone effectively minimizes disturbance to denning polar bears. These data will provide both wildlife managers and industry with information that can be used to promote polar bear conservation through minimizing disturbance and informing the development of alternative actions for dealing with bears denned near industrial activity. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Anthropogenic stressors; Arctic; Disturbance; Human-bear conflict; North Slope; Polar bears; Ursus americanus; Ursus maritimus","action plan; bear; buffer zone; conservation planning; guideline; human activity; oil field; probability; videography; wildlife management; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; North Slope; United States; Canis familiaris; Ursus americanus; Ursus maritimus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087567527

The performance of the proposed model is first critically assessed against experimental and simulation data from the literature before being applied to design a multi-device EAT system for a diesel engine. The target EAT system is composed of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), an ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) device and a diesel particulate filter (DPF). The steady state behaviour of various EAT designs under operating conditions across the engine map are examined. The DOC-DPF-SCR layout is found to be more beneficial than the alternative DOC-SCR-DPF for the specific engine studied. Furthermore, the DPF-front system is more robust with respect to changes in emission regulations. Flux analysis is applied to study the chemical interaction in the SCR and explain the disadvantage of the SCR-front system. In addition, it is demonstrated in the study that future catalyst investigations should consider more realistic feed compositions. © 2020","Ammonia-based Selective Catalytic Reduction (NH3-SCR); Diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC); Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF); Exhaust After-Treatment (EAT); Numerical model","Ammonia; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical analysis; Diesel engines; Selective catalytic reduction; After treatment devices; Automotive powertrains; Chemical interactions; Computational modelling; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Diesel particulate filters; Exhaust aftertreatment; Operating condition; Exhaust systems (engine); catalyst; detection method; diesel engine; exhaust emission; experimental study; modeling; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082870126

Aluminium alloys in the 6000-series, containing Mg and Si are ideal candidates for these applications but lack the formability found in commonly used steels, providing a need to more fully understand the factors influencing the formability of these alloys at high strains. Conventionally, a high strain rate sensitivity (SRS) is tied to increased formability because it retards the increase in the local strain rate found in the diffuse neck interior. However, most experimental work neglects that the regions exterior to the neck will undergo a local decrease in the strain rate which causes a corresponding material softening. Observations of an asymmetry between up-change and down-change SRS of these alloys in the natural aged condition show that different mechanisms are controlling the SRS depending on the direction of rate change. Following a characterization of the state of clustering by differential scanning calorimetry, continuous tensile and precision strain rate sensitivity testing results are presented, elucidating the differences between the up-change and down-change SRS tests. It is shown that these differences are due to the activation of different thermal obstacles during the two directions of rate changes. The role of a change in Si content on the mechanical properties is explored and its suspected role on the asymmetric SRS is discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Mg–Si; Natural ageing; Necking; Recovery; Strain hardening; Strain rate sensitivity","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coated steel; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Formability; Silicon; Tensile testing; 6000 series aluminium alloys; Different mechanisms; Fuel emissions; High strain rates; Material softening; Passenger vehicles; Strain rate sensitivity; Two directions; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085123585

It has been shown that a green aiming beam excites stone autofluorescence. This fluorescence signal can be used for calculi detection to check the correct fiber position before triggering the IR laser, thus preventing damage to soft tissue and application devices. However, also the directly reflected green light from the fiber tip gives valuable information on fiber position and its surface condition. Materials and Methods: An external fiber-fiber-coupling-box (fiber core diameter 365 µm) for pulsed holmium laser radiation (2.1 µm) was set up containing a green diode laser module (520 nm, average power on the sample <0.5 mW) and optics and detectors for measuring the reflected light of this aiming beam as well as the fluorescence excited with it. Measurements were done via a lock-in technique with more than 20 human calculi samples and porcine calix in vitro. After the implementation of automatic data storage signals during ongoing in vitro lithotripsy procedures were recorded with the fiber positioned on tissue, stone, or in/on medical equipment (working channel of an endoscope, stone retrieval basket). Results: Stone fluorescence signals measured were a factor of 7 to >100 higher than those of tissue. Stone fluorescence was detectable in “non-contact mode” with a linear signal decrease over a distance up to ~1 mm in front of the fiber tip (core diameter 365 µm) and with severely damaged fibers (max. decrease: 75% with pinched off fiber). Reflection signals of the fiber tip surface in air and water surrounding decreased significantly when the fiber was damaged; measured ratios of intact to damaged fiber found in the air were (5–17):1 and in water (1.6–3.7):1. Surfaces in front of the fiber aggravated the evaluation of fiber condition due to reflections but enabled to detect, for example, the working channel of a flexible endoscope in combination with the (missing) fluorescence signal. Conclusions: Autofluorescence induced by a green aiming beam can be exploited for stone detection in laser lithotripsy. A reflection measurement can give further information on fiber condition and position. Implementing this kind of safety features for an automatic block of IR laser emission in case of weak or missing fluorescence and un-normal reflections can assist the surgeon by avoiding tissue perforation, and damage to medical devices such as endoscopes.

This article explores the reasons for this limited response, taking a comparative political economy lens to identify national constraints that actively hinder climate policy progress. We discuss different metrics of climate policy progress, including emissions trends, climate legislation adoption, policy adoption, policy stringency, and policy outcomes. We then review literatures that explain varying national outcomes along these dimensions. Identified constraints include (but are not limited to) exposure to fossil fuel extraction activities, supply-side coal dependency, a lack of democratic norms, exposure to corruption, a lack of public climate awareness, and low levels of social trust. Correlation and principal component analysis of these variables demonstrates strong co-dependencies, including a North-South divide in institutional quality, trust and climate awareness that limits full participation in climate legislation and the removal of fossil subsidies. Recent trends indicate stability in corruption across the whole sample, and the continued durability of autocratic and extractivist states. We identify common constraints for five distinct country groups using cluster analysis: ‘oil & gas states’, ‘fragile states’, ‘coal-dependent development’, ‘fractured democracies’ and ‘wealthy OECD’. We highlight the need to scrutinise architectures of constraint – combinations of political economic factors that are mutually reinforcing and highly resistant to intervention. © 2020","Climate legislation; Climate policy; Ideas; Institutions; Interests; Political economy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078798655

These non-technical challenges often remain outside the scope and responsibility of engineers’ assessments. This study uses early-stage stakeholder engagement to examine the non-technical barriers to siting of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) along traffic corridors throughout the United States. Stakeholder feedback is analyzed in terms of Niklas Luhmann's social system theory via the Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework to assess broader, system-wide feasibility. By identifying points of resonance—situations in which the logics of different systems overlap, allowing interaction—the knowledge and capacities of different stakeholder groups can support development of new technologies. This method of stakeholder engagement occurs at earlier stages of project development and includes larger socio-political scales than typical site-level analysis. Stakeholder feedback—from a variety of fields, including engineering, transportation, project management, and law—is incorporated into a multi-criteria and analytic hierarchy tool to aid in turbine siting. This paper argues that early stakeholder engagement beyond a strictly technical focus creates a more robust account of project feasibility, shown through the potential for right-of-way VAWT arrays. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Renewable energy-systems; Site assessment tool; Socio-political evaluation of energy deployment; Stakeholder engagement; Technology development; Wind turbine siting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079010467

Spinel NiCo2O4 mixed oxides have drawn considerable attention recently due to their outstanding advantages including large specific surface area, high permeability, short electron, and ion diffusion pathways. Because of the rapid development of non-enzyme biosensors, the current state of methods for synthesis of pure and composite/hybrid NiCo2O4 materials and their subsequent electrochemical biosensing applications are systematically and comprehensively reviewed herein. Comparative analysis reveals better electrochemical sensing of bioanalytes by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NiCo2O4 nano-/microstructures than other morphologies. Better biosensing efficiency of NiCo2O4 as compared to corresponding individual metal oxides, viz. NiO and Co3O4, is attributed to the close intrinsic-state redox couples of Ni3+/Ni2+ (0.58 V/0.49 V) and Co3+/Co2+ (0.53 V/0.51 V). Biosensing performance of NiCo2O4 is also significantly improved by making the composites of NiCo2O4 with conducting carbonaceous materials like graphene, reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes (single and multi-walled), carbon nanofibers; conducting polymers like polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI); metal oxides NiO, Co3O4, SnO2, MnO2; and metals like Au, Pd, etc. Various factors affecting the morphologies and biosensing parameters of the nano-/micro-structured NiCo2O4 are also highlighted.

Prediction of malaria, in advance, is an urgent need for reporting rolling cases of disease throughout the year. The climate condition do play an essential role in the transmission of malaria. Hence, the current study aims to develop and assess a simple and straightforward statistical model of an association between malaria cases and climate variates. It may help in accurate predictions of malaria cases given future climate conditions. For this purpose, a Bayesian Gaussian time series regression model is adopted to fit a relationship of the square root of malaria cases with climate variables with practical lag effects. The model fitting is assessed using a Bayesian version of R2 (RsqB). Whereas, the predictive ability of the model is measured using a cross-validation technique. As a result, it is found that the square root of malaria cases with lag 1, maximum temperature, and relative humidity with lag 3 and 0 (respectively), are significantly positively associated with the square root of the cases. However, the minimum and average temperatures with lag 2, respectively, are observed as negatively (significantly) related. The considered model accounts for moderate amount of variation in the square root of malaria cases as received through the results for RsqB. We also present Absolute Percentage Errors (APE) for each of the 12 months (January–December) for a better understanding of the seasonal pattern of the predicted (square root of) malaria cases. Most of the APEs obtained corresponding to test data points is reasonably low. Further, the analysis shows that the considered model closely predicted the actual (square root of) malaria cases, except for some peak cases during the particular months. The output of the current research might help the district to develop and strengthen early warning prediction of malaria cases for proper mitigation, eradication, and prevention in similar settings. © 2020, Indian Society for Parasitology.","Bayesian statistical modeling; Climate; Forecasting; Gaussian time series regression; Malaria; MCMC; Odisha","Article; Bayes theorem; climate change; cross correlation; cross validation; data analysis; disease transmission; forecasting; human; humidity; India; malaria; malaria control; Odisha; priority journal; public health; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082805714

To solve the proposed fuzzy multi-objective mixed integer programme model, a methodology is designed using Jimeniz’s uncertainty approach, Chang’s fuzzy AHP approach to determine weights, Mirakhorli’s membership function formulation approach, Liou and Wang’s desirable achievement degree computation of each goal approach and Chen and Tsai’s Fuzzy goal programming. Numerical experiments imparts important policy intelligence for industry specialists and the government: (1) formulated human-regional forwardness index to decide regional carbon tax for economic growth of backward areas, (2) formulated social benefit weight of a region and social benefit indicator of facilities in various regions for social dimension assessment, (3) analysed the possible influence of carbon tax rate with various carbon emission policies on sustainable strategic tyre retreading supply network planning, (4) suggested appropriate carbon emission policies for tyre retreading supply network and government, (5) suggested the admissible national carbon tax rate in a country on tyre retreading supply network and (6) decided an appropriate regional tax rate in a country for carbon emission using human-regional forwardness index to promote economic growth of backward areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Carbon tax policy; Fuzzy goal programme; Reverse logistics; Sustainable supply network; Tyre retreading supply network","Carbon; Computer programming; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Integer programming; Linear programming; Membership functions; Public policy; Retreading; Sustainable development; Taxation; Economic growths; Fuzzy goal programming; Government legislations; Group Decision Making; Numerical experiments; Social dimensions; Supply network designs; Three dimensions; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086449390

Results show that the premixed CH4-NH3/air flames are thicker and propagate slower than the pure CH4/air flames, with reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Meanwhile, both flames are cellularly stable for the present various test conditions, showing 0.3 &lt; Ma &lt; 2.1, and this observation is weakly affected by the concentration of NH3 in the fuel blend. Moderate reduction in SL∞, i.e., reasonable burning intensity for practical applications, of the CH4-NH3/air flames even with reduced CO2 emissions supports the possible use of CH4-NH3 blends as a low carbon fuel. However, the problem of high local nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the present flame configuration should be resolved for their practical application. The quantitative discrepancies between the measurements and predictions for a few conditions despite their generally and qualitatively good agreement indicate that a new mechanism optimized for the oxidation of CH4-NH3 blends at atmospheric condition is needed since no reaction mechanism for it is currently available. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 reduction; Expanding spherical flames; Methane-ammonia blends; Premixed flames","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Flame research; Fuels; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Atmospheric conditions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion characteristics; Flame configuration; Laminar burning velocity; Low carbon fuels; Markstein number; Reaction mechanism; Ammonia; carbon dioxide; combustion; concentration (composition); measurement method; methane; nitrogen oxides; optimization; oxidation; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083319886

Its dissemination in Poland faces barriers in the form of high purchase prices in relation to electricity productivity. In this work 1% of the household population in Poland was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method. It was found that for mCHP to become economically profitable for a group of at least 10,000 households, its price should fall from around 18,000 euros (711.5 euros/kWth and 18,000 euros/kWe) to 4800 euros (189.7 euros/kWth and 4800 euros/kWe) and for 100,000 households to 4100 euros (162.1 euros/kWth and 4100 euros/kWe). These calculations were made for fixed gas and electricity prices. The analysis also included cases of various changes in gas and energy prices. Faster growth of electricity prices than gas prices reduce the profitability barrier. In addition, a building located in Lesser Poland region was analyzed, with an above average demand for electricity and heat.

The primary sources of air pollution in Chelyabinsk are industry (concrete product plants, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy such as zinc production plants, and pulp production), thermal power stations, and transport. People have known that trees can help to reduce air pollutants for a long time. We studied 8 zones within a radius of one kilometer from state air pollution monitoring stations. Eight land-use types such as industrial category, residential category, natural and semi-natural broadleaved vegetation, natural and semi-natural coniferous vegetation, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, artificial broadleaved vegetation, and artificial coniferous vegetation, were obtained. The response of air pollution to land-use and urban greening was analyzed. Analysis results showed that there was no correlation between industrial and residential categories of land-using and concentrations of the most dangerous air pollutants in Chelyabinsk (formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride, and nitrogen dioxide).

These challenges are evaluated with regard to the state of the art, research interest, and regulatory issues, providing an assessment of the advances and defining research gaps in the literature review. The review shows that climate resilience mainly deals with larger systems, whereas the field is still developing at the building level. One of the main challenges identified is the institutional response. Many publications state that it is necessary to revise policies and develop legislation; however, this is sometimes hindered by uncertain climate change predictions. The EU legislation currently provides partial coverage of resource efficiency and climate mitigation in the building sector, while the national legislation is delayed. The current situation can impair the competitiveness of the national building sector, causing it to lag behind the goals set for achieving sustainability. From the cost perspective, immediate short-term actions are seen as more expensive, because delays can result in increased risks for major investments. The authorities are currently choosing between rapid and delayed actions, balancing the costs of early actions and the reciprocal costs of delay. © 2020 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

They differ in raw materials, porous structure characteristics and chemical state of the surface. TCE adsorption isotherms were found to have a concave shape, which is characteristic of a sorbent—sorbate weak interaction. It can be a result from electrostatic repulsion of organic matter molecule from polar groups on carbon surface and adsorbed water molecules. The basic parameters of adsorption were calculated by the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation. We determined that for AG-OV-1 and SKD-515 in the coordinates of the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation, there are two linear plots suggesting adsorption in pores of different sizes or reorientation of adsorbate molecules on the activated carbon surface. The efficiency of TCE removal by the activated carbons was evaluated. To reduce the TCE to the maximum allowable, the lowest sorbent consumption was observed for AC with the highest values of surface area and micropore volume. However, the high cost and hydrophobicity of these adsorbents make it impractical to use them in adsorption columns with a fixed layer. We offered an adsorbent that reasonably combines extraction efficiency, ease of operation and economic feasibility. © 2019, Korean Carbon Society.","Activated carbons; Adsorption; Trichloroethylene",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074594636

We divided the spatially heterogeneous site into six microform classes based on plant species composition and measured their net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using chamber method over the growing seasons in 2012–2014. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was applied to assess how the contributions of microforms with different vegetation change temporally, and to upscale NEE to the ecosystem level to be compared with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Both ecosystem respiration (R) and gross photosynthesis (PG) were the largest in high hummocks, 894–964 (R) and 969–1132 (PG) g CO2 m−2 growing season−1, and decreased toward the wetter microforms. NEE had a different spatial pattern than R and PG; the highest cumulative seasonal CO2 sink was found in lawns in all years (165–353 g CO2 m−2). Microforms with similar wetness but distinct vegetation had different NEE, highlighting the importance of vegetation composition in regulating CO2 sink. Chamber-based ecosystem-level NEE was smaller and varied less interannually than the EC-derived estimate, indicating a need for further research on the error sources of both methods. Lawns contributed more to ecosystem-level NEE (55–78%) than their areal cover within the site (21.5%). In spring and autumn, lawns had the highest NEE, whereas in midsummer differences among microforms were small. The contributions of all microforms to the ecosystem-level NEE varied seasonally and interannually, suggesting that spatially heterogeneous vegetation composition could make bog CO2 uptake temporally more stable. © 2019, The Author(s).","bog; carbon; carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; net ecosystem exchange; peatland; photosynthesis; respiration; vegetation","annual variation; bog; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; community structure; eddy covariance; error analysis; growing season; net ecosystem exchange; photosynthesis; plant community; respiration; seasonal variation; spatial variation; temporal variation; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073835880

Pathologically, T2D and AD are characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques consisting primarily of toxic human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and amyloid beta (Aβ). It has been recently revealed that the gut microbiome plays key functions in the pathological progression of neurological disorders through the production of bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we examined the catalytic effects of LPS on IAPP and Aβ amyloidoses, and further demonstrated their mitigation with zero-dimensional carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Whereas LPS displayed preferred binding with the N-terminus of IAPP and the central hydrophobic core and C-terminus of Aβ, CQDs exhibited propensities for the amyloidogenic and C-terminus regions of IAPP and the N-terminus of Aβ, accordingly. The inhibitory effect of CQDs was verified by an embryonic zebrafish model exposed to the peptides and LPS, where impaired embryonic hatching was rescued and production of reactive oxygen species in the organism was suppressed by the nanomaterial. This study revealed a robust synergy between LPS and amyloid peptides in toxicity induction, and implicated CQDs as a potential therapeutic against the pathologies of T2D and AD. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon Quantum Dots; Nanocrystals; Neurodegenerative diseases; Peptides; Semiconductor quantum dots; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid peptides; Bacterial endotoxins; Catalytic effects; Embryonic zebrafish; Inhibitory effect; Lipopolysaccharides; Neurological disorders; Glycoproteins; amyloid; amyloid beta protein; carbon; lipopolysaccharide; quantum dot; amyloidosis; animal; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; zebra fish; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloidosis; Animals; Carbon; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; Quantum Dots; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086749878

Genetic and physiological studies demonstrated that at least three CO2 physiological states, a high CO2 (0.5–5% CO2), a low CO2 (0.03–0.4% CO2) and a very low CO2 (&lt; 0.02% CO2) state, exist in Chlamydomonas. To acclimate in the low and very low CO2 states, Chlamydomonas induces a sophisticated strategy known as a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) that enables proliferation and survival in these unfavorable CO2 environments. Active uptake of Ci from the environment is a fundamental aspect in the Chlamydomonas CCM, and consists of CO2 and HCO3– uptake systems that play distinct roles in low and very low CO2 acclimation states. LCI1, a putative plasma membrane Ci transporter, has been linked through conditional overexpression to active Ci uptake. However, both the role of LCI1 in various CO2 acclimation states and the species of Ci, HCO3– or CO2, that LCI1 transports remain obscure. Here we report the impact of an LCI1 loss-of-function mutant on growth and photosynthesis in different genetic backgrounds at multiple pH values. These studies show that LCI1 appears to be associated with active CO2 uptake in low CO2, especially above air-level CO2, and that any LCI1 role in very low CO2 is minimal. © 2020 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CCM; Chlamydomonas; CO2; CO2-concentrating mechanism; inorganic carbon; LCI1; photosynthesis","Algae; Cell membranes; Physiological models; Physiology; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; CO2 concentration; CO2-concentrating mechanism; Environmental variability; Genetic backgrounds; Loss-of-function mutants; Physiological state; Plasma membrane protein; Carbon dioxide; Air; Algae; Carbon Dioxide; Concentrating; Environments; Impact; Physiology; Survival; algal protein; carbon dioxide; carrier protein; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; metabolism; photosynthesis; Western blotting; Algal Proteins; Blotting, Western; Carbon Dioxide; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Membrane Transport Proteins; Photosynthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083524828

Biochar (bio-charcoal) was applied in the amounts of 1 kg/m2 and 3 kg/m2 in combination with organic and mineral fertilizers to drained and drain-free fields during the vegetation season, and the five-gas analyzer G2508 (Picarro) was used. Cumulative flows of N2O were estimated. The analysis revealed that biochar reduces the emissions and the cumulative flow of nitrous oxide. The higher the dose of biochar, the lower the emission and cumulative flows of nitrous oxide, regardless of a drainage system. Biochar (1 kg/m2) reduced the cumulative N2O flow from the soil by 52.2% throughout the experiment conducted, while a dose of 3 kg/m2 allowed for 97.8% reduction.

However, most actions only try to assuage the impacts of climate change without improving the resource flows generated by human activities. In this paper, we propose a semi-quantitative assessment of the impacts of biowaste-based energy transition by engaging all relevant social stakeholders' evaluation in the strategic plan. This holistic approach models a Decision Support System (DSS) to effectively evaluate the interplay of local and sectoral low-carbon actions. Regional energy alliances and stakeholders are used for participatory modeling to promote the buildup of the learning base of this DSS. The core pillar of the DSS involves the application of advanced features of soft computing for the development of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) that elicits the inter-causalities of the critical factors affecting the energy transitions towards bio-economy options. The concepts participating in the map are established by experts, and their interrelations via a learning process that utilizes survey statistics. The strands of research include scenarios to highlight the effect of energy provision to urbanization and the increase of urban actors (social, technological, political) in influencing the decision making related to low-carbon policies. Particularly, we study a use case of a Greek region that, despite its munificent agricultural production, also disclosures a stimulated manufacturing economy sector. The proposed decision making tool uses analytics and optimization algorithms to guide competent authorities and decision makers to sustainable energy transitioning towards decarbonization. © 2020","Biowaste; Circular bio-economy; Decision Support System (DSS); Energy transition; Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) modeling; Sustainable low-carbon environment","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Climate change; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Fuzzy rules; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Soft computing; Sustainable development; Bio-waste; Circular bio-economy; Decision support system (dss); Energy transitions; Fuzzy cognitive map; Low carbon; Learning systems; carbon; agricultural production; algorithm; alternative energy; decision making; decision support system; environmental economics; fuzzy mathematics; holistic approach; manufacturing; numerical model; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; sustainability; Article; biomass; carbonization; decision making; decision support system; energy; environmental management; Fuzzy Cognitive Map model; fuzzy logic; geography; greenhouse gas; petrochemical industry; policy; priority journal; quantitative analysis; socioeconomics; urbanization; waste; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081134264

However, since electricity generation involves using fossil fuels, it is not established where and when the replacement of fossil-fuel-based technologies by electric cars and heat pumps can effectively reduce overall emissions. Could electrification policies backfire by promoting their diffusion before electricity is decarbonized? Here we analyse current and future emissions trade-offs in 59 world regions with heterogeneous households, by combining forward-looking integrated assessment model simulations with bottom-up life-cycle assessments. We show that already under current carbon intensities of electricity generation, electric cars and heat pumps are less emission intensive than fossil-fuel-based alternatives in 53 world regions, representing 95% of the global transport and heating demand. Even if future end-use electrification is not matched by rapid power-sector decarbonization, it will probably reduce emissions in almost all world regions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heating; Life cycle; Pumps; Carbon intensity; Electricity generation; Global transport; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Integrated assessment models; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Net emission reductions; Policy framework; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083366870

However, in Korea, up to 30% of the transportation of passengers and cargo still uses diesel locomotives and diesel vehicles. Many studies have shown that exhaust gas from diesel locomotives poses a threat to human health. This study examined the characteristics of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons in diesel locomotive engine exhaust. Emission concentrations were evaluated and compared with the existing regulations. In the case of PM and NOx, emission concentrations increased as engine output increased. High concentrations of CO were detected at engine start and acceleration, while hydrocarbons showed weakly increased concentrations regardless of engine power. Based on fuel consumption and engine power, the emission patterns of PM and gaseous substances observed in this study were slightly higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tier standard and the Korean emission standard. Continuous monitoring and management of emissions from diesel locomotives are required to comply with emission standards. The findings of this study revealed that emission factors varied based on fuel consumption, engine power, and actual driving patterns. For the first time, a portable emission measurement system (PEMS), normally used to measure exhaust gas from diesel vehicles, was used to measure exhaust gas from diesel locomotives, and the data acquired were compared with previous results. This study is meaningful as the first example of measuring the exhaust gas concentration by connecting a PEMS to a diesel locomotive, and in the future, a study to measure driving characteristics and exhaust gas using a PEMS should be conducted. © 2020 by the authors.

Full-scale data from two Korean ""wastewater treatment plants"" (WWTPs), which operated boilers and CHP plants fueled by biogas, were used in order to estimate the reduction potential of GHG emissions based on a ""life cycle assessment"" (LCA) approach. The GHG emissions of biogas energy facilities were divided into pre-manufacturing stages, production stages, pretreatment stages, and combustion stages, and the GHG emissions by stages were calculated by dividing them into Scope1, Scope2, and Scope3. Based on the calculated reduction intensity, a comparison of GHG reduction effects was made by assuming a scenario in which the amount of biogas produced at domestic sewage treatment plants used for boiler heating is replaced by a CHP plant. Four different scenarios for utilizing biogas are considered based on the GHG emission potential of each utilization plant. The biggest reduction was in the scenario of using all of the biogas in CHP plants and heating the anaerobic digester through district heating. GHG emissions in a life cycle were slightly higher in boilers than in CHP plants because GHG emissions generated by pre-treatment facilities were smaller than other emissions, and lower Scope2 emissions in CHP plants were due to their own use of electricity produced. It was confirmed that the CHP plant using biogas is superior to the boiler in terms of GHG reduction in a life cycle. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogas; Biogas utilization; CHP; GHG emissions","anoxic conditions; biogas; combined heat and power; comparative study; digestibility; equipment component; greenhouse gas; heating; life cycle analysis; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086914178

Based on the lead month of forecast, 10 climate indices with high correlations were selected and combined to construct four-variable multiple regression models for monthly precipitation forecasting. The forecast results for the analytical period (2010-2019) showed that predictability was low for some summer seasons but satisfactory for other seasons and long periods. In the goodness-of-fit test results, the Nash-Sutclie eciency (0.48-0.57) and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the observation (0.66-0.72) were evaluated to be satisfactory while the percent bias (9.4-15.5%) was evaluated to be between very good and good. Due to the nature of the statistical models, however, the predictability is highly likely to be reduced if climate phenomena that are dierent from the statistical characteristics of the past appear in the forecast targets or predictors. The forecast results were also presented as tercile probability information (below normal, normal, above normal) through a comparison with the observation data of the past 30 years. The results are expected to be utilized as useful forecast information in practice if the predictability for some periods is improved. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate indices; Large-scale teleconnections; Monthly precipitation forecasting; Multiple regression models","Logistic regression; Mean square error; Watersheds; Weather forecasting; Forecast information; Goodness-of-fit test; Multiple regression model; Precipitation forecasting; Probability informations; Root mean square errors; Standard deviation; Statistical characteristics; Climate models; forecasting method; multiple regression; precipitation assessment; probability; river basin; satellite data; teleconnection; Han Basin [Far East]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087459138

We first consider the cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity test in the panel, and we observed from the results that there is substantial heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. We employed the results of the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator and determined that for all 65 BRI economies, foreign direct investment inflow, gross domestic product (GDP) squared and urbanization had a positive and significant impact on carbon emissions (CO2). Moreover, this study found that foreign direct investment inflow led to an increase in carbon emissions in BRI countries across South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Europe. Finally, on the basis of the panel causality test, we found evidence of various causality associations among the selected variables across the regions. These findings are significant for the related policymakers in BRI countries, as they can assist in developing appropriate carbon emission, trade and energy policies with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Belt and Road Initiative; CO2emissions and international trade; EKC; environmental impact; FDI","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission inventory; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental impact; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; international trade; Kuznets curve; spatial analysis; trade policy; trade-environment relations; Europe; Far East; South Asia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068392543

A better understanding of N application rates and crop and environmental response is needed to optimize management of agroecosystems. Here we show an orchard agroecosystem with high N use efficiency promoted substantial gains in carbon (C) storage, thereby lowering net global warming potential (GWP). We conducted a 5-year whole-system analysis comparing reduced (224 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and intensive (309 kg N ha−1 yr−1) fertilizer N rates in a California almond orchard. The intensive rate increased net primary productivity (Mg C ha−1) and significantly increased N productivity (kg N ha−1) and net N mineralization (mg N kg−1 soil d−1). Use of 15N tracers demonstrated short and long-term mechanisms of soil N retention. These low organic matter soils (0.3–0.5%) rapidly immobilized fertilizer nitrate within 36 h of N application and 15N in tree biomass recycled back into soil organic matter over five years. Both fertilizer rates resulted in high crop and total N recovery efficiencies of 90% and 98% for the reduced rate, and 72% and 80% for the intensive rate. However, there was no difference in the proportion of N losses to N inputs due to a significant gain in soil total N (TN) in the intensive rate. Higher soil TN significantly increased net N mineralization and a larger gain in soil organic carbon (SOC) from the intensive rate offset nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, leading to significantly lower net GWP of −1.64 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1 compared to −1.22 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1 for the reduced rate. Our study demonstrates increased N cycling and climate mitigation from intensive fertilizer N use in this orchard agroecosystem, implying a fundamentally different result than seen in conventional annual cropping systems. © 2020 The Authors","15N tracers; N immobilization; N mineralization; N use efficiency; Net productivity; Soil organic C","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Global warming; Magnesium; Mineralogy; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Orchards; Organic carbon; Water pollution; Water quality; Environmental response; Global warming potential; N immobilization; N mineralization; N use efficiency; Net primary productivity; Soil organic C; Whole-system analysis; Soils; ammonium nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; organic matter; carbon cycle; global warming; immobilization; mineralization; nitrogen; nitrogen cycle; soil carbon; soil organic matter; almond; Article; biomass; carbon storage; concentration (parameter); crop production; fertilizer application; greenhouse effect; harvest; immobilization; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; nitrogen mineralization; nonhuman; orchard; priority journal; productivity; soil; California; United States; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081693265

In this paper, to implement a hybrid P2P energy trading market, a blockchain-based solution is proposed. A blockchain-based system is fully decentralized and it allows the market members to interact with each other and trade energy without involving any third party. Smart contracts play a very important role in the blockchain-based energy trading market. They contain all the necessary rules for energy trading. We have proposed three smart contracts to implement the hybrid electricity trading market. The market members interact with main smart contract which requests P2P smart contract and prosumer to grid (P2G) smart contract for further processing.

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying responses to biomass smoke in human lungs. Objectives: This study had two objectives: First, to quantify ""reallife"" exposures to particulate matter,2 mmin diameter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) measured during cooking on stoves in rural areas of Nepal in different geographical settings; and second, to assess the effect of biomass smoke extracts on inflammatory responses in ex vivo human lung tissue. Methods: Personal exposures to PM2.5 and indoor near-stove CO concentrations were measured during cooking on a range of stoves in 103 households in 4 different Nepalese villages situated at altitudes between z100 and 4,000 m above sea level. Inflammatory profiles to smoke extracts collected in the field were assessed by incubating extracts with human lung tissue fragments and subsequent Luminex analysis. Results: In households using traditional cooking stoves, the overall mean personal exposure to PM2.5 during cooking was 276.1 mg/m3 (standard deviation [SD], 265 mg/m3), and indoor CO concentration was 16.3 ppm (SD, 19.65 ppm). The overall mean PM2.5 exposure was reduced by 51% (P = 0.04) in households using biomass fuel in improved cook stoves, and 80% (P,0.0001) in households using liquefied petroleum gas. Similarly, the indoor CO concentration was reduced by 72% (P,0.001) and 86% (P,0.0001) in households using improved cook stoves and liquefied petroleum gas, respectively. Significant increases occurred in 7 of the 17 analytes measured after biomass smoke extract stimulation of human lung tissue (IL-8 [interleukin-8], IL-6, TNF-a [tumor necrosis factor-a], IL-1b, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL13). Conclusions: High levels of real-life exposures to PM2.5 and CO occur during cooking events in rural Nepal. These exposures induce lung inflammation ex vivo, which may partially explain the increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in these communities. © 2020 American Thoracic Society.

The literature has emphasized the importance of national delegation size (NDS) for states' formal and informal participation in climate change negotiations. To our knowledge, however, this is the first paper to comprehensively examine the determinants of NDS from 1995-2015. The findings highlight a country's resources and its interest in the mitigation of fossil fuel emissions as important determinants of its NDS. In contrast, the evidence for a connection between vulnerability to climate change and NDS is limited. Interest group politics appear more important than civil society or bureaucratic influence in determining NDS. In terms of policy implications, the distance between the country and the COP location is a robust deterrent of larger delegations, and there is a nonlinear relationship between NDS and financial capacity.

These three-dimensional hybrid structures were used as cold cathodes to perform field emission tests under DC bias application. Field emission response of CNTs grown on metallic foams was compared with rGO coated CNTs samples. Field emission results demonstrate that the emission current density and field enhancement factors were significantly enhanced after rGO deposition on CNTs due to the formation of sharp protrusions in rGO sheets. Local field enhancement at the apex of sharp protrusions allows tunneling and hence emission of electrons from tips at considerable lower voltage. rGO coated CNTs based field emitters on nickel foam, among all studied emitters, demonstrated the highest emission current density of 64 mA/cm2, lowest turn-on field of 0.71 and the highest field enhancement factor of 15,999.

Yet, observations of the phenomenon are sparse and many standardresolution models represent these features poorly, if at all. We use a fully coupled, synoptic-scale preindustrial control simulation of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv0-HR) to effectively simulate open-ocean polynyas and investigate their role in the climate system. Our approach employs statistical tests of Granger causality to diagnose local and remote drivers of, and responses to, polynya heat loss on interannual to decadal time scales. First, we find that polynya heat loss Granger causes a persistent increase in surface air temperature over the Weddell Sea, strengthening the local cyclonic wind circulation. Along with responding to polynyas, atmospheric conditions also facilitate their development.When the Southern Ocean experiences a rapid poleward shift in the circumpolar westerlies following a prolonged negative phase of the southern annular mode (SAM), Weddell Sea salinity increases, promoting density destratification and convection in the water column. Finally, we find that the reduction of surface heat fluxes during periods of full ice cover is not fully compensated by ocean heat transport into the high latitudes.

Our results indicated that the effectiveness of carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton varied from 0.0005% to 0.14%, which is much lower than the theoretical 10%. The highest efficiency of carbon transfer occurred in the mesotrophic lakes due to the higher hypolimnetic zooplankton production, while the lowest efficiency was observed in the dystrophic lakes and in one eutrophic lake that was dominated by cyanobacteria. Inedible algae (e.g. Gonyostomum semen) and cyanobacteria appeared to be the main factors reducing the efficiency of the transfer of matter in pelagic food webs. The results of our study showed that plankton communities are a key component of the nutrient cycle in freshwater food webs. Phytoplankton were a very effective nitrogen sink, and in the mesotrophic lakes, up to 99% of the total nitrogen was sequestrated in phytoplankton. As a result, there was a depletion of inorganic nitrogen in the upper water layer. Furthermore, zooplankton were an important phosphorus sink, thus significantly influencing the nutrient cycles. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon; Lakes; Phosphorus and nitrogen; Plankton; Stoichiometry; Trophic status","cyanobacterium; dominance; eutrophication; food web; humification; inorganic nitrogen; lake water; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; phytoplankton; trophic structure; zooplankton; Poland [Central Europe]; algae; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084134932

The concept of primary energy for energy resources plays a critical role in how different energy technologies appear in the context of this policy. This study shows how the calculation methodologies of primary energy content and primary energy factors pose a possible negative implication on the future development of geothermal energy when comparing against EU's key energy policy targets for 2030. Following the current definitions of primary energy, geothermal utilization becomes the most inefficient resource in terms of primary energy use, thus contradicting key targets of increased energy efficiency in buildings and in the overall energy use of member states. We use a case study of Hellisheidi, an existing geothermal power plant in Iceland, to demonstrate how the standard primary energy factor for geothermal in EU energy policy is highly overestimated for efficient geothermal power plants. Moreover, we combine life cycle assessment and the commonly utilized combined heat and power production allocation methods to extract the non-renewable primary energy factor for geothermal and show how it is only a minimal fraction of the total primary energy factor for geothermal. The findings of the study apply to other geothermal plants within the coverage of the European Union's energy policy, whether from high- or low-temperature geothermal resources. Geothermal has substantial potential to aid in achieving the key energy and climate targets. Still, with the current definition of the primary energy of geothermal resources, it may not reach the potential. © 2020 by the authors.","Allocation; Combined heat and power (CHP); Energy policy; European Union (EU); Geothermal; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Primary energy","Climate change; Energy policy; Energy resources; Geothermal fields; Geothermal power plants; Life cycle; Power generation; Public policy; Temperature; Climate change mitigation; Combined heat and power production; Energy efficiency in buildings; European energy policy; Geothermal resources; Geothermal utilizations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-temperature geothermal; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087963448

Field data was collected from more than 1000 farmers (involved in over 50 varieties of crops) in 22 riverine and coastal case study areas. Data was collected through site visits, surveys and five workshops conducted between November 2018 and June 2019. Based on the collected data sets, a new Agricultural Coastal Vulnerability Index (AGCVI) was developed and applied to the 22 sites located in two districts (Krishna and Guntur) of Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The analysis revealed that the areas with three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) per year are highly vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, sites with one crop season (Kharif) per annum are the least vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, grains (particularly rice), flowers and fruit crops are more susceptible to climate change and its induced impacts. Rice is no longer a profitable crop in the case study areas partly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions, inadequate insurance provision and lack of government support for farmers. Cumulatively, all these circumstances impact farmers' incomes and socio-cultural practices: this is leading to a marriage crisis, with a reduction in the desirability of matrimony to farmers. These findings provide valuable information that can support climate and agriculture policies, as well as sustainable cropping patterns among farmers' communities in coastal areas of India in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture; Coastal Andhra Pradesh; Coastal areas; Crops; Farmers; New index; Vulnerability","assessment method; climate change; climate conditions; coastal zone; crop plant; cropping practice; farming system; index method; nature-society relations; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; Andhra Pradesh; Guntur; India; Krishna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086385141

Also, comparing the differences in NH3 emission levels between the developed emission factors, which reflect the characteristics in Korea, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) values currently applied in Korea. The estimation showed that the NH3 emission factor for the LNG power plants was 0.0054 ton NH3/106Nm3, which is approximately nine times less than the EPA NH3 emission factor of 0.051 ton NH3/106Nm3 for LNG fuels of the industrial energy combustion sector currently applied in national statistics in Korea. The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission factor for LNG power plants was 0.0010 ton NH3/106Nm3, which is considerably lower than the EPA NH3 emission factor of 0.146 ton NH3/106Nm3 currently applied in national statistics in Korea for the LNG fuels of the industrial process sector. This indicated the need for developing an emission factor that incorporates the unique characteristics in Korea. The uncertainty range of the LNG stack NH3 emission factor developed in this study was ±10.91% at a 95% confidence level, while that of the SCR NH3 emission factor was –10% to +20% at a 95% confidence level, indicating a slightly higher uncertainty range than the LNG stack. At present, quantitative analysis of air pollutants is difficult because numerical values of the uncertainty are not available.

This evaluation was made after correcting for the interannual meteorological variability (IAV) by using the regional atmospheric chemistry model simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models (collectively WRF/CMAQ) with the constant emissions. This resolves the current fundamental disagreements about the sign of the BC emissions trend from China over the past decade as assessed from bottom-up emission inventories. Our analysis supports inventories reflecting the governmental clean air actions after 2010 (e.g., MEIC1.3, ECLIPSE versions 5a and 6b, and the Regional Emission inventory in ASia (REAS) version 3.1) and recommends revisions to those that do not (e.g., Community Emissions Data System - CEDS). Our estimated emission trends were fairly uniform across seasons but diverse among air mass origins. Stronger BC reductions, accompanied by a reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, occurred in regions of south-central East China, while weaker BC reductions occurred in north-central East China and northeastern China. Prior to 2017, the BC and CO emissions trends were both unexpectedly positive in northeastern China during winter months, which possibly influenced the climate at higher latitudes. The pace of the estimated emissions reduction over China surpasses the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs with reference to SSP1, specifically) scenarios for 2015-2030, which suggests highly successful emission control policies.

GBD 2017 Oesophageal Cancer Collaborators","Background Oesophageal cancer is a common and often fatal cancer that has two main histological subtypes: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Updated statistics on the incidence and mortality of oesophageal cancer, and on the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by the disease, can assist policy makers in allocating resources for prevention, treatment, and care of oesophageal cancer. We report the latest estimates of these statistics for 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, by age, sex, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD). Methods We used data from vital registration systems, vital registration-samples, verbal autopsy records, and cancer registries, combined with relevant modelling, to estimate the mortality, incidence, and burden of oesophageal cancer from 1990 to 2017. Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) were estimated and fed into a Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) including risk factors. MIRs were used for mortality and non-fatal modelling. Estimates of DALYs attributable to the main risk factors of oesophageal cancer available in GBD were also calculated. The proportion of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma to all oesophageal cancers was extracted by use of publicly available data, and its variation was examined against SDI, the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and available risk factors in GBD that are specific for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (eg, unimproved water source and indoor air pollution) and for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease). Findings There were 473 000 (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 459 000-485 000) new cases of oesophageal cancer and 436 000 (425 000-448 000) deaths due to oesophageal cancer in 2017. Age-standardised incidence was 5.9 (5.7-6.1) per 100 000 population and age-standardised mortality was 5.5 (5.3-5.6) per 100 000. Oesophageal cancer caused 9.78 million (9.53-10.03) DALYs, with an age-standardised rate of 120 (117-123) per 100 000 population. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised incidence decreased by 22.0% (18.6-25.2), mortality decreased by 29.0% (25.8-32.0), and DALYs decreased by 33.4% (30.4-36.1) globally. However, as a result of population growth and ageing, the total number of new cases increased by 52.3% (45.9-58.9), from 310 000 (300 000-322 000) to 473 000 (459 000-485 000); the number of deaths increased by 40.0% (34.1-46.3), from 311 000 (301 000-323 000) to 436 000 (425 000-448 000); and total DALYs increased by 27.4% (22.1-33.1), from 7.68 million (7.42-7.97) to 9.78 million (9.53-10.03). At the national level, China had the highest number of incident cases (235 000 [223 000-246 000]), deaths (213 000 [203 000-223 000]), and DALYs (4.46 million [4.25-4.69]) in 2017. The highest national-level agestandardised incidence rates in 2017 were observed in Malawi (23.0 [19.4-26.5] per 100 000 population) and Mongolia (18.5 [16.4-20.8] per 100 000). In 2017, age-standardised incidence was 2.7 times higher, mortality 2.9 times higher, and DALYs 3.0 times higher in males than in females. In 2017, a substantial proportion of oesophageal cancer DALYs were attributable to known risk factors: tobacco smoking (39.0% [35.5-42.2]), alcohol consumption (33.8% [27.3-39.9]), high BMI (19.5% [6.3-36.0]), a diet low in fruits (19.1% [4.2-34.6]), and use of chewing tobacco (7.5% [5.2-9.6]). Countries with a low SDI and HAQ Index and high levels of indoor air pollution had a higher proportion of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma to all oesophageal cancer cases than did countries with a high SDI and HAQ Index and with low levels of indoor air pollution. Interpretation Despite reductions in age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, oesophageal cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality and burden across the world. Oesophageal cancer is a highly fatal disease, requiring increased primary prevention efforts and, possibly, screening in some high-risk areas. Substantial variation exists in age-standardised incidence rates across regions and countries, for reasons that are unclear. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"adult; Africa south of the Sahara; alcohol consumption; Article; Asia; Australia; Austria; autopsy; biomass; body mass; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; China; demography; disability-adjusted life year; education; esophagus cancer; ethnicity; female; fertility; gastroesophageal reflux; Germany; global disease burden; health care access; health care quality; human; indoor air pollution; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Latvia; low income country; major clinical study; male; medical care; Middle East; middle income country; mortality rate; North Africa; priority journal; risk factor; smoking; South and Central America; squamous cell carcinoma; Turkmenistan; United States; Uzbekistan; Western Europe; adenocarcinoma; adolescent; aged; diet; drinking behavior; esophagus tumor; gastroesophageal reflux; middle aged; obesity; quality adjusted life year; risk factor; squamous cell carcinoma; tobacco use; very elderly; young adult; Adenocarcinoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollution, Indoor; Alcohol Drinking; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Diet; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Global Burden of Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Risk Factors; Tobacco Use; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084453707

Thus, any efforts to achieve efficiency would lead to significant reductions in the emissions. Transition to new technology vehicles with clean and alternative fuels is an important way of achieving such emission reductions. Countries that import vehicles rely on the technology improvements and laws of other countries to increase the fuel efficiency of their vehicle stock. This research investigates the impact of such a scenario by considering the case study of Qatar, which is a country that is oil- and gas-rich and imports all of its vehicle stock. The model developed in this study, by the combined use of system dynamics and vehicle cohort modeling, is the first of its type in this region. Moreover, it addresses the research gaps by comparing the market penetration and sales of gasoline, hybrid-electric, and battery electric vehicles. The results reveal that despite alternative vehicles dominating the sales, gasoline vehicles have remained in the stock for more than 10 years after the complete stoppage of their sales. This is because of the system inertia created by the volume of vehicles in stock owing to their long lifetime. Nonetheless, in the extreme scenario of battery electric vehicles dominating the market, hybrid-electric and battery electric vehicles significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with an estimated emission reduction of more than 8 million tons of carbon dioxide. These savings are not at the same level in terms of the fuel because one (gasoline) vehicle is replaced by another one (in which electricity is generated via natural gas), with the electricity consumption increasing by more than 8 TWh. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; System dynamics; Transportation sector","Alternative fuels; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fleet operations; Gasoline; Sales; Secondary batteries; System theory; Alternative vehicles; Efficiency measure; Electricity-consumption; Emission reduction; Market penetration; System Dynamics; Technology improvement; Transportation sector; Natural gas vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081062467

This study assessed supplementation of laying hens diet with beechwood biochar (BC, 1~2%) and BC–aluminosilicates–glycerin mixture (BCM, 1.5~3%) to lower the environmental impact while maintaining egg quality. The effect on feed intake, laying performance, egg quality, the sensory quality of hardboiled eggs, ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from excreta, and the excreta composition, were evaluated. A total of 90 hens were distributed into 30 cages and divided into five groups (n=6 replications). BC addition increased daily feed intake, while 1.5% BCM addition reduced it. The influence on egg parameters was positive, with a 6% increase in laying performance, up to 10% and 6% increase in shell resistance to crushing and shell thickness, respectively. The sensory analysis demonstrated no significant differences between all treatments. Excreta total N content was numerically lower due to the treatments (by 4~20%); its pH increased (not significantly), while no effect on ammoniacal N and dry matter content was observed. Most of the investigated treatments had a numerically positive (not statistically significant) effect on NH3 reduction. The reduction of VOC emissions was ambiguous and not statistically significant. © 2020 by the authors.

Although, tea is a major commercial crop in many countries in tropical and sub-tropical regions, including China, India and Sri Lanka, tea agroforestry systems (TAFS) have remained little studied for their role in carbon management and climate change adaptation/mitigation actions. We, therefore, undertook a detailed study on the storage of organic carbon in above- and below-ground vegetation and soil under age chronosequence of TAFS in North East India. The specific aim of this study was to quantify variations in soil physical and chemical properties, carbon storage in shade trees and tea bushes, and ecosystem carbon stocks under the chronosequence of TAFS. This study has established significant variations in soil properties and carbon storage in different aged TAFS. One of the salient findings is the decrease in soil bulk density and increase in water holding capacity with the age of TAFS in the 0–50 cm depth.

This dataset contains many missing values, particularly for periods before the mid-twentieth century, although recent years are also incomplete. Here we demonstrate that artificial intelligence can skilfully fill these observational gaps when combined with numerical climate model data. We show that recently developed image inpainting techniques perform accurate monthly reconstructions via transfer learning using either 20CR (Twentieth-Century Reanalysis) or the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) experiments. The resulting global annual mean temperature time series exhibit high Pearson correlation coefficients (≥0.9941) and low root mean squared errors (≤0.0547 °C) as compared with the original data. These techniques also provide advantages relative to state-of-the-art kriging interpolation and principal component analysis-based infilling. When applied to HadCRUT4, our method restores a missing spatial pattern of the documented El Niño from July 1877. With respect to the global mean temperature time series, a HadCRUT4 reconstruction by our method points to a cooler nineteenth century, a less apparent hiatus in the twenty-first century, an even warmer 2016 being the warmest year on record and a stronger global trend between 1850 and 2018 relative to previous estimates. We propose image inpainting as an approach to reconstruct missing climate information and thereby reduce uncertainties and biases in climate records. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"artificial intelligence; climate conditions; climate modeling; CMIP; global climate; nineteenth century; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; reconstruction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085894830

Microbial community composition and environment both potentially control the processes that release carbon from anoxic peat either as CH4 or as carbon dioxide (CO2), a less potent greenhouse gas than CH4. However, the respective roles of these controls remain unclear, which prevents incorporating microbes in the predictions of peatland CH4 emissions. Here, a reciprocal transplant experiment was carried out to separate the influences of microbial community and environment in CH4 and anaerobic CO2 production. Peat from an acidic Sphagnum bog and a sedge fen with higher pH was enclosed in membrane bags with a pore size of 0.2 µm, preventing microbial colonization from the outside, and transplanted in the field for 2 months. Potential CH4 production was primarily controlled by the environment. The conditions in the bog suppressed the initially higher activity of fen methanogens and reduced CH4 production by 79%. Against expectations, the inhibition was not specific to acetate-using Methanotrichaceae. Reciprocal transplantation favoured Methanosarcinaceae and potentially methylotrophic methanogenesis in general. Bog methanogens, mostly hydrogenotrophic Methanoregulaceae, retained their community structure and activity in the fen with a slight increase (+37%) in CH4 production. Anaerobic CO2 production was controlled by both the microbial community and the environment. Transplantation led to increased CO2 production in both bog (+50%) and fen peat (+57%) with distinct bacterial community, showing that the new environment directed more carbon to other anaerobic processes than methanogenesis. Taken together, these results relate differences in CH4 production of bogs and fens to ecophysiology of specific methanogen groups. The sensitiveness of fen methanogens to the acidic conditions in Sphagnum bogs can help explain the decrease in CH4 emission in the typical boreal peatland succession from young fens to older bogs. Increase in anaerobic CO2 versus CH4 production with transplantation shows that disturbances of boreal peatlands can activate poorly defined pathways of anaerobic decomposition.

This phenomenon can be explained as the effect of partial obscuration: the broad emission lines (BELs) in the ultraviolet waveband are heavily suppressed by the dust extinction, and thus the IELs become prominent; while the dust extinction is not significant in optical and infrared bands, and the IELs can hardly be detected due to the brightness of BELs. Using the IEL width and central supermassive black hole mass MBH∼5.75×108 M⊙ of J1516+1900, and assuming that the intermediate-width emission line region (IELR) is virialized, we estimate the distance of the IEL region to the central black hole is about 1.6 pc. On the other side, by combining the photoionization model calculations and observed IELs, we find that the IELR has a density of ∼1012 cm−3, and the ionization parameter of ∼10−0.65, and that its distance to the central region is ∼0.016 pc, which is only one percent of the virialized distance. This contradiction can provide an important clue for studying the geometry, physical condition, and origin of the IELRs in active galactic nuclei. © 2020","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: nuclei; quasars: emission lines; quasars: individual: SDSS J151653.22+190048.2; quasars: supermassive black holes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086664054

The individual effects of abiotic and biotic factors on peatland carbon exports and the interactions among all these factors are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a field study over two years in a peatland complex by selecting four habitats differing in their dominant vegetation (shrub, grass, sedge and moss) in order to assess the links between abiotic and biotic factors and carbon release at each habitat. Accounting for the wide variability across habitats allowed us to examine the direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on carbon cycling at the ecosystem level (i.e. the whole peatland complex). Results showed that the habitats dominated by vascular plants had the highest microbial and above-ground plant biomass, as well as the highest values of Acari and Collembola biomass, whereas Enchytraeidae biomass was dominant in the moss habitat. Furthermore, at ecosystem level, the SEM explained 75% of the total soil respiration variation and 33% of the DOC variation. Accordingly, soil respiration was directly linked to enchytraeid biomass, with these invertebrates being positively related to soil moisture. In contrast, both soil temperature and soil moisture had direct effects on microbial and Acari biomass, and the interaction between Acari biomass and below-ground plant biomass was responsible for DOC release. These findings provide new insights into the role of soil biota in carbon dynamics in peatlands, by showing that the direct effects of abiotic factors on biotic communities (both plants and soil organisms) determine how much carbon is lost from these systems (either as CO2 e or DOC). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved organic carbon; Plant biomass; Soil mesofauna; Soil respiration; Sphagnum; Vascular plants","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Wetlands; Dissolved organic carbon; Mesofauna; Plant biomass; Soil respiration; Sphagnum; Vascular plant; Biomass; abiotic factor; biomass; dissolved organic carbon; ecosystem approach; moss; peatland; soil fauna; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; vascular plant; Acari; Bryophyta; Collembola; Enchytraeidae; Invertebrata; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081234852

This response could have a significant impact on plant water use in a future climate. However, the regulation of the CO2-induced stomatal closure response is not fully understood. Moreover, the potential genetic links between short-Term (within minutes to hours) and long-Term (within weeks to months) responses of gs to increased atmospheric CO2 have not been explored. Methods: We used Arabidopsis thaliana recombinant inbred lines originating from accessions Col-0 (strong CO2 response) and C24 (weak CO2 response) to study short-and long-Term controls of gs. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to identify loci controlling short-and long-Term gs responses to elevated CO2, as well as other stomata-related traits. Key Results: Short-and long-Term stomatal responses to elevated CO2 were significantly correlated. Both short-and long-Term responses were associated with a QTL at the end of chromosome 2. The location of this QTL was confirmed using near-isogenic lines and it was fine-mapped to a 410-kb region. The QTL did not correspond to any known gene involved in stomatal closure and had no effect on the responsiveness to abscisic acid. Additionally, we identified numerous other loci associated with stomatal regulation. Conclusions: We identified and confirmed the effect of a strong QTL corresponding to a yet unknown regulator of stomatal closure in response to elevated CO2 concentration. The correlation between short-and long-Term stomatal CO2 responses and the genetic link between these traits highlight the importance of understanding guard cell CO2 signalling to predict and manipulate plant water use in a world with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. This study demonstrates the power of using natural variation to unravel the genetic regulation of complex traits. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

However, the effect differs based on plant developmental stage. We focused on the effect of three plant species (forbs, grasses, and N2-fixers) at an early stage of development on root C deposition and fate, soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization and soil microbial community composition at ambient (aCO2) and elevated (eCO2) CO2 levels. Plants were grown from seed, under continuous 13C-labelling atmospheres (400 and 800 µmol mol−1 CO2), in grassland soil for three weeks. At the end of the growth period, soil respiration, dissolved organic C (DOC) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were quantified and isotopically partitioned into root- and soil-derived components. Root-derived DOC (0.53 ± 0.34 and 0.26 ± 0.29 µg mL soil solution−1) and soil-derived CO2 (6.14 ± 0.55 and 5.04 ± 0.44 µg CO2-C h−1) were on average two times and 22% higher at eCO2 than at aCO2, respectively. Plant species differed in exudate production at aCO2 (0.11 ± 0.11, 0.10 ± 0.18, and 0.58 ± 0.58 µg mL soil solution−1 for Plantago, Festuca, and Lotus, respectively) but not at eCO2 (0.20 ± 0.28, 0.66 ± 0.32, and 0.75 ± 0.15 µg mL soil solution−1 for Plantago, Festuca, and Lotus, respectively). However, no differences among plant species or CO2 levels were apparent when DOC was expressed per gram of roots. Relative abundance of PLFAs did not differ between the two CO2 levels. A higher abundance of actinobacteria and G-positive bacteria occurred in unplanted (8.07 ± 0.48 and 24.36 ± 1.18 mol%) and Festuca-affected (7.63 ± 0.31 and 23.62 ± 0.69 mol%) soil than in Plantago- (7.04 ± 0.36 and 23.41 ± 1.13 mol%) and Lotus-affected (7.24 ± 0.17 and 23.13 ± 0.52 mol%) soil. In conclusion, the differences in root exudate production and soil respiration are mainly caused by differences in root biomass at an early stage of development. However, plant species evidently produce root exudates of varying quality affecting associated microbial community composition. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The optimized emission of resulted CDs progressively shifts from green to red with the adjustment of precursor solution from alkali to acid. The proposed three representative CDs entire green, yellow, and red fluorescences prepared separately on alkaline, neutral, and acidic aqueous solutions possess similar graphite structures in their carbon cores, while the diversification of PL emissions in these CDs are convinced to derive from the difference in their particle size and the content of nitrogen doping. Moreover, the regular variation of calculated band gaps for the three types of CDs are perfectly consistent with their PL emission characteristics. Further investigation of their radical scavenging activities based on the difference in surface states demonstrates that the CDs synthesized under alkaline conditions have stronger oxidation resistance. Thus, we can speculate that the amino groups on P-phenylenediamine precursors are more easily activated under acidic conditions, which results in an in-depth cross-linking that facilitates a long wavelength emission.

Most of the previous literature has studied the influence of green technology on carbon emission from the regional perspective. This paper discusses the direct role in terms of industry of seven green technologies under the International Patent Classification (IPC) Green Inventory classification standard on the reduction of carbon intensity and the indirect impact of technology vertical spillovers generated by transmission via the intermediate input products channel on carbon intensity. Based on empirical research that was conducted by adopting an improved regression on the population, affluence and technology (STIRPAT) model using the panel data of 17 categories of industries in China from 2000 to 2015, the indirect effect was more significant than the direct result, as every green technology innovation level and technology spillover capacity was increased by 1%, the carbon intensity reduced by 0.1303% and 0.1558%, respectively. Energy conservation technology played a direct role in the reduction of carbon intensity and achieved the best results, and its impact was 1.76 times that of waste management technology, which had the weakest effect. Transportation emission reduction technology played an indirect role in the reduction of carbon emission intensity and achieved the best results; its impact was 2.13 times the average value of all types of technology spillover effects. Finally, the paper analyzes seven types of green technology spillover capacities and the heterogeneity in the reduction of carbon intensity efficiency and provides some relevant policy suggestions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Green technology; Green technology vertical spillovers; Industrial carbon intensity; Inter-industry linkage","Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Population statistics; Waste management; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon intensity; China; Conservation technologies; Green technology; Inter-industry linkage; Inventory classification; Technology spillover effect; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079589003

This paper focuses on synergistic CO2 and air pollution emission reduction by implementing technical and structural measures, and explores the processes aimed at achieving the co-benefits of carbon reduction and air pollution control effectively in the power industry at a local level. The results of the analysis show that the structural measures achieve overall co-benefits, and the technical measures have a good effect in reducing the air pollution, but simultaneously increase CO2 emissions because of the additional electricity used for running air pollution control devices (APCDs). Based on the analysis of the power generation incremental cost and pollutant emission reduction cost, cost-effective approaches to attain different emission reduction targets are proposed to the power industry in four case regions.

This paper coordinates the fuel octane number and single-injection timing to operate gasoline compression ignition combustion with high efficiency in a wide load range, with the speed fixed at 1500 r/min. The primary reference fuels with octane numbers 60, 70, 80, and 90 were used, labeled as PRF60, PRF70, PRF80, and PRF90, respectively. The results proved that under steady-state conditions where the speed and load changed slightly, taking the fuel economy and combustion and emission performance into account, PRF60 and PRF70 should be applied at a load lower than 2 bar and 2–8 bar, respectively, and the start of injection timing should be set at 13 °CA before top dead center. When the load is higher than 8 bar, PRF90 should be applied at the start of injection timing of 11 °CA before top dead center. It is noteworthy that PRF70 under medium-load conditions could achieve the indicated thermal efficiency of up to 47%. The injection timing of PRF90 was limited to 9–1711 °CA before top dead center due to the limit of the peak value of pressure rise rate, whereas PRF60 had a wider injection timing boundary than PRF90. © IMechE 2020.","fuel reactivity; Gasoline compression ignition; injection timing; operation boundary; regulated and unregulated emissions","Efficiency; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Timing circuits; Compression ignition; Fuel reactivity; Injection timing; operation boundary; Unregulated emissions; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078917918

Based on 14 years of monthly data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System energy balanced and filled (CERES-EBAF) Ed4.1 dataset and atmosphere-only simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase6 (CMIP6/AMIP), this study investigates the ability of CMIP6/AMIP model in reproducing the observed inter-month changes, annual cycle and trend of PA at near-global and regional scales. Statistical results indicate that some persistent biases in the previous models continue to exist in the CMIP6 models; however, some progresses have been made. In CMIP6/AMIP, large negative correlations for PA between the model ensemble mean and observation are addressed over the subtropical stratocumulus regions. In addition, the simulation of PA in drylands and tropical oceans remains a challenge in CMIP6 models. Over the most regions, PA biases are governed by cloud albedo forcing biases. These results demonstrate the importance of improving cloud process simulations for accurately representing the PA in models. For the annual cycles, the model ensemble mean captures the difference in amplitude between the two peak values of PA (June and December), as well as the phase of the seasonal cycle, despite PA is systematically overestimated. The differences between different terrestrial climatic regions are also examined. Results indicate that the relative biases of PA are greatest in semi-arid (2.2%) and semi-humid (2.8%) regions, whereas the minimum relative bias occurs in arid regions (0.3%) due to compensating errors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CMIP6; Planetary albedo; Satellite observations","albedo; climatology; CMIP; radiation budget; satellite data; stratocumulus; Ceres",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085109866

This study aims to examine whether air pollution dropped in Memphis, a typical U.S. metropolitan city and transportation hub, during the lockdown from 25 March to 4 May, 2020. Daily air pollution data measured at five representative monitoring stations in the Memphis Metropolitan Area were downloaded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System. The mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone during the lockdown were compared with the baseline concentrations measured during the same periods in 2017-2019 using linear regression models. The average vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduced by 57% in this region during the lockdown compared to that during 1-24 March, 2020. The mean (standard deviation) concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and ozone were 7.5 ± 2.6 μg/m3, 16.5 9.4 ppb, and 44.5 3 8.4 ppb, respectively, during the lockdown. They did not statistically differ from the baseline concentrations, nor were they lower than the mean concentrations in the prior month (25 February-24 March, 2020), after accounting for meteorological conditions. The lack of effect could be explained by the small contribution of traffic emissions to air pollution.

In this paper, the Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) method is applied to the participants of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) from the global perspective to reveal the roles both China and Africa have played in the global supply chain as either the original emitter or the final consumer, and to depict the evolution pattern of carbon transfer via Sino-Africa trade from the year 2000–2015. The findings are as follows: 1) China has played the role of net exporter of embodied carbon-emission in Sino-Africa trade, for the amount of emitted carbon China had born yet resulted by consumption in Africa well surpassed that vice versa. 2) Compared to the carbon-emission flows embodied in EU-Africa and US-Africa trades, China has shouldered more carbon-emission derived from Africa's consumption. 3) The sectoral contribution and intensities of embodied carbon-emission correspond to the trading pattern between China and Africa, which stems from the two parties' comparative advantages and economic complementarity. 4) The intensities of embodied carbon-emission on both sides are declining towards a rosy prospect, which indicates an improving carbon-emission efficiency of both economies. From a global perspective, both China and Africa play a positive part in carbon-emission reduction.

Although the grid is seeing increasing deployments of clean, renewable sources of energy, a significant portion of the grid demand is still met using traditional carbon-intensive energy sources. In this paper, we study the problem of using energy storage deployed in the grid to reduce the grid's carbon emissions. While energy storage has previously been used for grid optimizations such as peak shaving and smoothing intermittent sources, our insight is to use distributed storage to enable utilities to reduce their reliance on their less efficient and most carbon-intensive power plants and thereby reduce their overall emission footprint. We formulate the problem of emission-aware scheduling of distributed energy storage as an optimization problem, and use a robust optimization approach that is well-suited for handling the uncertainty in load predictions, especially in the presence of intermittent renewables such as solar and wind. We evaluate our approach using a state of the art neural network load forecasting technique and real load traces from a distribution grid with 1,341 homes. Our results show a reduction of >0.5 million kg in annual carbon emissions - - equivalent to a drop of 23.3% in our electric grid emissions. © 2020 ACM.","carbon emissions; robust optimization; smart grid","Carbon footprint; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Optimization; Power plants; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Distributed energy storages; Distributed storage; Distribution grid; Intermittent renewables; Optimization problems; Renewable sources; Robust optimization; Storage scheduling; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088521059

To reduce the impact of air pollution and to plan and build sustainable cities, it is vital that research is translated into efficient decisions and practice. However, how do civil servants in a municipality access research results? How do they normally find relevant information, and what obstacles are there to accessing and applying research results? As part of the collaborative and transdisciplinary research project Air Pollution Research in Local Environmental Planning (ARIEL), these questions were explored through interviews and seminars with civil servants within the Malmö Municipality Environmental Office. We found that the civil servants generally have proficiency in processing research results, but often do not use such results as part of their everyday decision making and practices. Instead, the data and measurements used are mostly produced case-by-case within the municipal sector itself. Information about best practices is also collected via a number of knowledge access practices, involving the Internet or social networks within other municipalities. Lack of time, paywalls, and the insufficient applicability of research hinder the dissemination of up-to-date results.

The energy crisis in Pakistan has become the prime stumbling block in the economic development of the country. There are many industrial processes that need uninterrupted supply; even a trivial outage can cost millions of dollars. The main cause of ""load shedding"" in Pakistan is that it produces a major portion of its energy from fossil fuels, whose price and demand is constantly increasing. Most of the customers at industrial and commercial level use Diesel Generator (DiG) as a reliable alternative source of electrical power when grid supply is unavailable. The use of DiG during loading shedding hours would increase the Cost of Energy (COE) per kWh and also enhance environmental emissions. Pakistan has a wide range of renewable power sources like bioenergy, wind, solar, hydel, geothermal etc. The distinct emphasis on the implementation of an industrial microgrid in Faisalabad, Pakistan has been specified in this paper. The prospective benefits of the microgrid fall into three major kinds: cost reduction, fuel saving, and improved environmental emissions. The optimized objective of this work is to maximize these benefits. Moreover while designing the hybrid microgrid system it encounters many design challenges like sizing of the components, system feasibility, COE, system reliability etc. This study contributes to the ongoing studies about hybrid microgrid system and draws attention to the optimal design and sizing considering several techno-economic factors including Net Present Cost (NPC), COE, supply reliability, capacity shortage constraint, battery state of charge (SOC), dispatch strategy, PV power generation and PV array tracking systems. Different cases are studied; microgrid sizing, techno-economic exploration, sensitivity analysis and environmental effects are addressed using (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) HOMER. The results show that COE and environmental emissions have been significantly reduced for the proposed system. © 2020, Strojarski Facultet.

Within the administrative city borders several anthropogenic CO2 source types are located, including car traffic, household coal and natural gas burning, and industrial emissions. Additionally, the biosphere produces its own, seasonally variable, input to the local atmospheric carbon budget. In order to quantify each of CO2 budget contributions to the local atmosphere, a number of analytical and numerical techniques have been implemented. The seasonal variability of CO2 emission from soils around the city has been directly measured using the chamber method; CO2 net flux from an area containing several source types has been measured with a relaxed eddy accumulation-a variation of the eddy covariance method. Global emissions inventory, as well as local statistical data have been utilized to assess anthropogenic component of the budget. As other cities where CO2 budget was quantified, Krakow proved to be a net source of this greenhouse gas, and the calculated annual mean net flux of CO2 to the atmosphere equal 6.1 kg C m-2 is consistent with previous estimations. © 2020 by the author.","CO2 chamber measurements; CO2 net flux to the atmosphere; Urban CO2 budget","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Soil pollution; Anthropogenic components; Atmospheric carbon; Eddy covariance method; Global emissions; Numerical techniques; Relaxed Eddy accumulation; Seasonal variability; Statistical datas; Budget control; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); seasonal variation; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Cracow; Malopolskie; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087107901

The compounding effects of urbanization and climate change have caused reductions in coral cover and shifts in community composition that may limit the ability of reefs to maintain rates of vertical accretion in line with rising sea levels. Here we report on coral reef carbonate budget surveys across seven coral reefs in Singapore, which persist under chronic turbidity and in highly disturbed environmental conditions, with less than 20% light penetration to 2 m depth. Results show that mean net carbonate budgets across Singapore’s reefs were relatively low, at 0.63 ± 0.27 kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1 (mean ± 1 SE) with a range from − 1.56 to 1.97, compared with the mean carbonate budgets across the Indo-Pacific of 1.4 ± 0.15 kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1, and isolated Indian Ocean reefs pre-2016 bleaching (~ 3.7 kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1). Of the seven reefs surveyed, only one reef had a net negative, or erosional budget, due to near total loss of coral cover (&lt; 5% remaining coral). Mean gross carbonate production on Singapore’s reefs was dominated by stress-tolerant and generalist species, with low-profile morphologies, and was ~ 3 kg m−2 yr−1 lower than on reefs with equivalent coral cover elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. While overall these reefs are maintaining and adding carbonate structure, their mean vertical accretion potential is below both current rates of sea level rise (1993–2010), and future predictions under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. This is likely to result in an increase of 0.2–0.6 m of water above Singapore’s reefs in the next 80 yr, further narrowing the depth range over which these reefs can persist. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bioerosion; Carbonate budget; Reef growth; Singapore; Urbanization","carbonate platform; climate change; community development; community dynamics; coral bleaching; coral reef; environmental conditions; marine environment; morphology; sea level change; urbanization; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Singapore; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085581720

Since wind power was developed mostly in desolate areas that are remote from urban centers due to its nature conditions, Texas implemented the Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) project, the goal of which is to integrate the wind supply regions with the large demand centers. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. The first is to investigate the impact of the CREZ project on market price convergence. Specifically, this paper analyzes the extent that the transmission project affected wholesale price level, variance, and difference between the regions. The second is to measure environmental benefits obtained from displacement of fossil fuel generators by wind power. The results provide a strong evidence for price convergence across the ERCOT market following the completion of the CREZ project. As well as price convergence, wholesale price level and variance are also reduced significantly. Specifically, the results show that the price difference between Houston and West which diverged up to around $100/MWh converges to zero after the project completed. The impacts are more significant during the high demand hours. The results also document significant reductions in emissions, as NOx emissions was reduced by around 4000 pounds in Texas as a whole. Effects on SO2 and CO2 are also calculated. © 2020 by the author.","Environmental benefits; Transmission expansion; Wholesale electricity prices; Wind power","Commerce; Competition; Fossil fuels; Transmissions; Wind power; Environmental benefits; Fossil fuel generators; Price convergence; Price difference; Renewable energies; Transmission investments; Transmission projects; Whole sale prices; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087987638

Microalgae have an excellent ability to utilize all forms of dissolved inorganic carbon at different pH conditions. Water quality signature (WQS) using three different expressions with (i) pH; (ii) total alkalinity, hardness and total dissolved solids; and (iii) nitrate and conductivity of water was assessed in 32 wetlands distributed across 5 districts of West Bengal, India. Two zones were clearly discernible: coldwater (15–23°C) high-altitude lakes in Darjeeling, and tropical (31–32° C) low-altitude wetlands. Multivariate analysis of the Akaike information criterion (ACI) model revealed location-specific variability of agro-climatic and biogeochemical interactions. Dissolved inorganic carbon and inorganic nitrogen appeared to be important in regulating the phytocarbon content of microalgae. The wetlands located in the Gangetic alluvial tropical or semi-coastal areas (Hooghly, 24-Parganas, Nadia, Midnapore) were alkaline (pH ¼ 7.52–7.97) where half-bound carbon dioxide comprised the major component (18–26%) of total inorganic carbon, with moderate to eutrophic (PO4-P 0.16–0.23 mg/l) states which have a negative feedback to global warming. The heterogeneity of measured water quality signature consolidated the sanative nature of wetlands for their complex functional attributes with agro-climatic, biogeochemical and soil-water-biological interactions. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Climate change; Trophic state; Water quality signature; Wetlands","Algae; Alkalinity; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Global warming; Microorganisms; Multivariant analysis; pH; Soil moisture; Tropics; Water hardness; Akaike information criterion; Biogeochemical interactions; Biological interactions; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Multi variate analysis; Total dissolved solids; Total inorganic carbon; Water quality measurement; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolved inorganic carbon; feedback mechanism; heterogeneity; inorganic nitrogen; microalga; multivariate analysis; water quality; wetland; India; West Bengal; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086886988

As part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) - Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), it shares the broader goals of providing a model evaluation and climate projection framework and improving communication with both the General Circulation Model (GCM) and climate data user communities. EURO-CORDEX oversees the design and coordination of ongoing ensembles of regional climate projections of unprecedented size and resolution (0.11° EUR-11 and 0.44° EUR-44 domains). Additionally, the inclusion of empirical-statistical downscaling allows investigation of much larger multi-model ensembles. These complementary approaches provide a foundation for scientific studies within the climate research community and others. The value of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble is shown via numerous peer-reviewed studies and its use in the development of climate services. Evaluations of the EUR-44 and EUR-11 ensembles also show the benefits of higher resolution. However, significant challenges remain. To further advance scientific understanding, two flagship pilot studies (FPS) were initiated. The first investigates local-regional phenomena at convection-permitting scales over central Europe and the Mediterranean in collaboration with the Med-CORDEX community. The second investigates the impacts of land cover changes on European climate across spatial and temporal scales. Over the coming years, the EURO-CORDEX community looks forward to closer collaboration with other communities, new advances, supporting international initiatives such as the IPCC reports, and continuing to provide the basis for research on regional climate impacts and adaptation in Europe. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; CORDEX; EURO-CORDEX; Regional climate modelling; Regional climate models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082335018

Tehran is Iran’s biggest and most polluted city and air pollution in this city causes loss of human lives due to respiratory diseases. The effect of green area has been less studied in former researches in Tehran, and the reducing effects of green landscape on the mortality of respiratory diseases have not yet been evaluated. To measure the effects of green area landscape patterns (fragmentation, area-edge, shape, and aggregation) on public health, the current study evaluated the pathways and effects of green space on air pollution and the mortality of respiratory diseases using structural equation modeling approach and the partial least squares method. The results of the study indicated green space has a significant mitigating effect on air pollution and mortality of respiratory diseases and also air pollution has a meaningful increasing effect on mortality due to respiratory diseases in Tehran. The most important latent variable in green space is class area that indicates more area of green space is correlated with less mortality of respiratory diseases. The most important indicator of air pollution was the PM2.5 that needs to be considered and controlled by urban policymakers. Accordingly, maximizing the green area and its cohesion and minimizing fragmentation and green patch edge can contribute to a reduction in air pollution and consequently lower mortality of citizens. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Landscape metrics; Mortality of respiratory diseases; Partial least squares modeling; Tehran","Least squares approximations; Pulmonary diseases; Urban planning; Increasing effect; Landscape metrics; Landscape pattern; Mitigating effects; Partial least-squares method; Structural equation modeling; Urban environments; Urban green spaces; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; greenspace; landscape; mental health; mortality; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; respiratory disease; air pollution; Article; environment; environmental factor; green space; health care policy; human; Iran; landscape; mortality; mortality rate; particulate matter; prediction; public health; respiratory tract disease; structural equation modeling; urban area; analysis; breathing disorder; city; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; mortality; particulate matter; procedures; theoretical model; toxicity; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Cities; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Respiration Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085910013

The access elements include the right to development and basic needs satisfaction and the allocation issues include distribution of resources, risks and burdens and the assignment of responsibilities. The development pathways for many developing countries will be constrained by national level GHG emission reduction commitments as well as sub-national efforts. Yet, the current level of commitments is not sufficient to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 °C. Hence, an important question is what does a decadal review of the relevant literature tell us about how to conceptualize and define access and allocation in the area of climate change mitigation governance? The paper concludes that access and allocation issues of climate change mitigation are inextricably interlinked; calling for holistic&#8232;strategies for mitigating environmental impacts while addressing social problems. The access issues can be governed through market mechanisms, in combination with an equity and justice approach for the poorest communities, and technology and social innovation, while allocation issues are governed by public policies, institutions, bottom–up decision making, mainstreaming of climate policies and international cooperation. The main characteristics of developing countries have not been adequately incorporated in present-day mitigation models. Further multidisciplinary research is needed to foster efficient and equitable climate, energy and forest governance which should be consistent with sustainable, inclusive and low carbon development pathways. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Access; Allocation; Climate change; Developing countries; Governance; Justice; Mitigation","access restriction; basic needs; climate change; decision making; developing world; environmental impact; environmental policy; equity; greenhouse gas; innovation; policy implementation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085472149

Developing awareness about climate change have proven to be key in the climate change resilience-building process, as it encourages partnership and a transformation in behaviour. This paper presents a framework for developing city stakeholders' awareness in urban areas. The conducted triangulation approach composed by a systematic literature review, semi-structured interviews and a case study results with the framework that defines the ideal process for developing awareness in urban areas. The resulting framework encapsulates three main elements: awareness-development mechanisms (experience, attention and knowledge), awareness-development over time graphs and a learning ladder. The three mechanisms explain the behaviour of the awareness-development process, the awareness-development over time graphs illustrate the evolution of the mechanisms and their effect over time, and the learning ladder specifies the gradual process of developing awareness. After presenting the ideal path for developing awareness, we further discuss the contribution of the conducted triangulation approach to the framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Awareness mechanisms; Awareness-development process; Climate change; Urban systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081241561

In the hydrogen-natural gas blends, the fraction of hydrogen is taken from 0% to 20%, respectively, and the natural gas is reduced from 100% to 80% simultaneously to explore hydrogen addition effect in the combustion process. Although natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels, adding hydrogen to the natural gas makes it much cleaner and more environmental friendly. The blends of natural gas and hydrogen helps increase the combustion efficiency, decrease oxygen and reduce the emissions, in particular CO2. The results further reveal that the energetic efficiency of the combustion unit rises from 84.83% to 94.83% while the exergetic efficiency rises from 62.52% to 70.16% with the rise in hydrogen fraction from 0% to 20%. It is also found that the CO2 emissions decrease with the rise in hydrogen fraction in hydrogen-natural gas blends. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Combustion; Efficiency; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Solar energy; Wind energy","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Gas emissions; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Photovoltaic cells; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion pro-cess; Efficient combustions; Electrical power; Energetic efficiency; Environmental-friendly; Exergetic efficiency; Hydrogen addition; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082948187

We present observations from the short-term intensive optical campaign (from September 2019 to January 2020) of the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516. This active galactic nucleus is known to have strong optical variability and has changed its type in the past. It has been in the low-activity state in the optical since 2013, with some rebrightening from the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2016, after which it remained dormant. Aims. We aim to study the photometric and spectral variability of NGC 3516 from the new observations in U- and B-bands and examine the profiles of the optical broad emission lines in order to demonstrate that this object may be entering a new state of activity. Methods. NGC 3516 has been monitored intensively for the past 4 months with an automated telescope in U and B filters, enabling accurate photometry of 0.01 precision. Spectral observations were triggered when an increase in brightness was spotted. We support our analysis of past-episodes of violent variability with the UV and X-ray long-term light curves constructed from the archival Swift/UVOT and Swift/XRT data. Results. An increase of the photometric magnitude is seen in both U and B filters to a maximum amplitude of 0.25 mag and 0.11 mag, respectively. During the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines ([Fe VII] and [Fe X]) than reported before, as well as the complex broad Hα and Hβ lines. This is especially seen in Hα, which appears to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ∼10 000 km s-1 in width in the Balmer lines is appearing. The trends in the optical, UV, and X-ray light curves are similar, with the amplitudes of variability being significantly larger in the case of UV and X-ray bands. Conclusions. The increase of the continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate that the AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been for the last ∼3 years. © ESO 2020.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: Seyfert; Line: profiles; Quasars: emission lines; Quasars: individual: NGC 3516","Binary alloys; Photometry; Active galactic nuclei; Continuum emission; Emission lines; High-ionization; Light curves; Maximum amplitude; Spectral observations; Spectral variability; X rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089037492

It is unclear whether risks are similar in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and how outdoor PM2·5 contributes to the global burden of cardiovascular disease. In our analysis of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, we aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to PM2·5 concentrations and cardiovascular disease in a large cohort of adults from 21 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Methods: In this multinational, prospective cohort study, we studied 157 436 adults aged 35–70 years who were enrolled in the PURE study in countries with ambient PM2·5 estimates, for whom follow-up data were available. Cox proportional hazard frailty models were used to estimate the associations between long-term mean community outdoor PM2·5 concentrations and cardiovascular disease events (fatal and non-fatal), cardiovascular disease mortality, and other non-accidental mortality. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2003, and July 14, 2018, 157 436 adults from 747 communities in 21 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries were enrolled and followed up, of whom 140 020 participants resided in LMICs. During a median follow-up period of 9·3 years (IQR 7·8–10·8; corresponding to 1·4 million person-years), we documented 9996 non-accidental deaths, of which 3219 were attributed to cardiovascular disease. 9152 (5·8%) of 157 436 participants had cardiovascular disease events (fatal and non-fatal incident cardiovascular disease), including 4083 myocardial infarctions and 4139 strokes. Mean 3-year PM2·5 at cohort baseline was 47·5 μg/m3 (range 6–140). In models adjusted for individual, household, and geographical factors, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2·5 was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio 1·05 [95% CI 1·03–1·07]), myocardial infarction (1·03 [1·00–1·05]), stroke (1·07 [1·04–1·10]), and cardiovascular disease mortality (1·03 [1·00–1·05]). Results were similar for LMICs and communities with high PM2·5 concentrations (&gt;35 μg/m3). The population attributable fraction for PM2·5 in the PURE cohort was 13·9% (95% CI 8·8–18·6) for cardiovascular disease events, 8·4% (0·0–15·4) for myocardial infarction, 19·6% (13·0–25·8) for stroke, and 8·3% (0·0–15·2) for cardiovascular disease mortality. We identified no consistent associations between PM2·5 and risk for non-cardiovascular disease deaths. Interpretation: Long-term outdoor PM2·5 concentrations were associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 35–70 years. Air pollution is an important global risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a need exists to reduce air pollution concentrations, especially in LMICs, where air pollution levels are highest.

We estimated annual VOCs emissions, associated ozone-forming potential (OFP) and global warming potential (GWP) from gasoline stations in Vietnam for 2010–2016. Current emission control included submerged filling for underground tanks and no vapor recovery for refueling vehicles. Estimated VOCs emissions in 2016 of 20.9 Gg (54.8 Gg of OFP, 292 Gg of 20-yr GWP) were 1.4 times above those in 2010. Spatially, VOCs emissions had high intensity over large urban areas and large economic regions, with Southeast economic region and Red River Delta shared 30% and 25% of the national emissions, respectively. High OFP intensities found over large urban areas would worsen ozone pollution where VOC-sensitive regime presents. Monthly emissions were higher during summer and winter holidays coinciding with intensive transportation. Hourly emissions showed peaks in morning and afternoon rush hours. Implementation of vapor recovery of USEPA Stage I (underground tank filling) and Stage II (vehicle refueling) control, respectively, would reduce VOCs emissions by 38% and 45%, while simultaneous implementations of both reduce emissions by 83%. Equal reductions would be seen for associated OFP/GWP. Control of VOCs emissions from gasoline stations helps improve air quality by reducing ambient levels of toxic VOCs and secondary pollutants of ozone and fine particles, and gain climate co-benefits through GWP reduction. Prepared spatial and temporal VOCs emissions distributions are useful for local AQM and air quality modeling studies. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Emission control; Fugitive VOCs; Gasoline stations; Global warming potential; Ozone-forming potential; Vietnam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081722074

Despite extensive prior research to disentangle the relationship between ammonia and haze pollution, the role of ammonia in haze formation in high ammonia-emitting regions is still not well understood. Aiming to better understand secondary inorganic aerosol (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium-SNA) formation mechanisms under high-ammonia conditions, 1-year hourly measurement of water-soluble inorganic species (gas and particle) was conducted at a rural supersite in Shanghai. Exceedingly high levels of agricultural ammonia, constantly around 30 μgm-3, were observed. We find that gas-particle partitioning of ammonia (ϵNH+4), as opposed to ammonia concentrations, plays a critical role in SNA formation during the haze period. From an assessment of the effects of various parameters, including temperature (T ), aerosol water content (AWC), aerosol pH, and activity coefficient, it seems that AWC plays predominant regulating roles for ϵNH+4.

For mitigating the negative effects of climate change, climate smart agricultural policies should be developed, for example, through the improvement of crop adaptability, productivity and quality in environments impacted by climate change. Attempts to increase crop genetic variability must be sought to aid in mitigating adverse consequences of climate change. For that purpose, mutation breeding plays an important role since it can increase genetic variation of important crops. By selecting desired mutant genotypes, the plant breeder can advance his or her germplasm by progressing lines with good adaptability, high productivity and quality under adverse conditions. For Indonesia, significant adverse impacts of climate change have appeared in some agricultural regions, such as prolonged drought problems in the east. To face the worsening conditions brought about by climate change and variability, a crop was sought that would require less agricultural input, being drought tolerant, having good adaptability and with high economic value. The choice fell on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). In certain areas sorghum is recognized as a source of food, feed and fuel. Mutation breeding of sorghum has been conducted at the Center for Isotopes and Radiation Application (CIRA), the National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN). Sorghum mutation breeding is relevant to the National programme on food and energy diversification to support food and energy security in the country. The breeding objectives are to improve sorghum genotypes for improved yield and quality, and which tolerant to adverse conditions brought about by climate change, especially prolonged drought. Three sorghum mutant varieties have now been obtained and develop further by stakeholders. Sorghum cultivation in Indonesia has given significant impacts on mitigating the effects of climate change and supporting food and energy diversification program for maintaining food and energy security in the country. It has also promoted economic growth in the rural areas impacted by climate change. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Drought; Economic analysis; Energy security; Genes; Productivity; Agricultural fields; Agricultural policies; Breeding objectives; Energy diversification; Genetic variability; Global climate changes; National programme; Nuclear Energy Agency; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087330678

Switzerland is the empirical focus because it lags behind neighbouring European countries. We assess public support for seven policy instruments, identified by existing literature and expert interviews.

However, the quantitative relationships between tree canopy cover and thermal comfort remains unclear, particularly in areas with high temperature and high humidity. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the effects of different degrees of tree canopy cover on human thermal comfort in shallow street canyons in a high temperature, high humidity area of China. Microclimatic measurements and qualitative surveys were conducted on sunny summer days in a shallow street canyon in Wuhan. The results suggest that microclimate benefits are greater for areas with a high-percentage tree canopy cover compared to medium-and low-percentage tree canopy cover-especially at noon. In streets with a high-percentage tree canopy cover, afternoon air temperatures and mean radiant temperatures can be reduced by up to 3.3 °C and 13.9 °C, respectively, compared to a similar street with no tree shade. The thermal sensation prediction formula is proposed and the relationship between human thermal sensation and microclimate factors is established. Blocking solar radiation and increasing wind speed are more feasible than controlling air temperature and humidity as ways to improve human thermal comfort. © 2020 by the authors.","Mean radiant temperature; Physiologically equivalent temperature; Street canyon; Thermal comfort; Thermal sensation; Tree canopy cover","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Humidity control; Thermal comfort; Wind; Air temperature; High temperature; Human thermal comfort; Human thermal sensations; Mean radiant temperature; Qualitative surveys; Thermal sensations; Tree canopy covers; Forestry; canopy; climate change; microclimate; prediction; qualitative analysis; seasonal variation; temperature anomaly; urban climate; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087000426

While in recent years short-term intervention actions for better air quality during big events in China did present good opportunities to examine the effectiveness of control measures in reducing anthropogenic VOCs emission, it is highly challenging to interpret the real effect of a specific control measure based on field monitoring data when a cocktail of control measures were adopted. Here we took the air quality intervention actions during the 16th Asian Games (AG) in Guangzhou as a case study to explore the impact of short-term multiple measures on VOCs reduction. The average mass concentrations of VOCs decreased by 52–68% during the AG. These percentages could not reflect emission reduction rates as the concentration might be also heavily impacted by dispersion conditions. Diagnostic ratios, such as methyl tert-butyl ether to carbon monoxide (MTBE/CO) and i-pentane/CO, decreased by over 60% during the AG, suggesting a substantial reduction in gasoline related emissions. A method linking emission reduction rates of two sources with their contribution percentages before and during the AG by using a receptor model was further formulated. With the available reduction rate of 34% for vehicular exhaust obtained during the traffic restriction drill in our previous study, VOCs emissions from gasoline evaporation and solvent use reduced by 45.7% and 13.6% during the AG, respectively. Total VOCs emissions decreased by 25.3% on average during the AG, and the emission control of vehicular exhaust, oil evaporation, and solvent use accounted for 17.0%, 6.3% and 2.0% of total VOCs emission reduction, respectively. This study presented an observed-based method with diagnostic/quantitative approaches to single out the effectiveness of each control measures in reducing VOCs emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emission control; Observation-based evaluation; Positive matrix factorization; Source attribution; Volatile organic compounds","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Evaporation; Factorization; Gas chromatography; Gasoline; Volatile organic compounds; Emission control measures; Field monitoring data; Methyl tert butyl ether; Observation-based evaluation; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source attribution; Substantial reduction; Traffic restrictions; Quality control; carbon monoxide; gasoline; pentane; solvent; tert butyl methyl ether; volatile organic compound; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; emission control; ozone; quantitative analysis; source apportionment; sport; traffic emission; urban area; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dispersion; evaporation; exhaust gas; priority journal; traffic; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082539124

Long-range transport and local accumulation as well as chemical transformation have been deemed as key factors of heavy haze pollution; however, the formation mechanisms of regional long-lasting haze and the physical and chemical connections between different megacities clusters are still poorly understood. Here we present that long-range transport and aerosol–boundary layer feedback may interact rather than act as two isolated processes as traditionally thought by investigating typical regional haze events in northern and eastern China. This interaction can then amplify transboundary air pollution transport over a distance of 1,000 km and boost long-lasting secondary haze from the North China Plain to the Yangtze River delta. Earlier emission reduction before the pollution episodes would provide better air pollution mitigation in both regions. Our results show an amplified transboundary transport of haze by aerosol–boundary layer interaction in China and suggest the importance of coordinated cross-regional emission reduction with a focus on radiatively active species like black carbon. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; boundary layer; haze; long range transport; megacity; mitigation; physicochemical property; pollutant transport; transboundary pollution; transformation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085315770

Many innovative strategies for adapting to climate change have been implemented in developed countries. To achieve the goal of climate change adaptation for agricultural land, a vulnerability assessment of farmland is indispensable. Based on the research framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this study applied the structure of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation to build criteria and conduct an evaluation of a designated area in Southern Taiwan. We identified the key factors of the vulnerability of farmland, through mapping with spatial analysis, and by using geographic information system tools. The main purpose of the application of a vulnerability assessment is not to explicitly describe the status of agricultural land to climate change, but to help local government and farmers to identify the critical area, and to discuss the appropriated adaptive policies. According to the results of the vulnerability assessment of agricultural land, the entire study region can be divided into three patterns: Pattern 1, located in the western coastal zone, filled with various attributes of high vulnerability; Pattern 2, distributed on the central plain region in the east, with complete blocks of agricultural land and low vulnerability; and Pattern 3, located in the central plain region to the west, a region in which areas with various vulnerability levels. The following three types of adaptation strategies for climate change for farmland were established: (1) the enhancement of agricultural production, (2) the maintenance of agricultural production, and (3) the conservation of the agricultural environment. The current results can serve as valuable guidelines for governments to implement feasible local adaptation strategies in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation strategy; Agricultural land; Geographic information system; Taiwan; Vulnerability assessment","adaptation; agricultural land; climate change; GIS; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; local adaptation; local government; spatial analysis; vulnerability; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086366060

Yet scenario optimization for large-scale applications is limited by the computational expense of optimization over many control factors. In this study, a multi-pollutant cost-benefit optimization system based on a genetic algorithm (GA) in machine learning has been developed to provide cost-effective air quality control strategies for large-scale applications (e.g., solution spaces of ~1035). The method was demonstrated by providing optimal cost-benefit control pathways to attain air quality goals for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The GA was found to be &gt;99% more efficient than the commonly used grid searching method while providing the same combination of optimized multi-pollutant control strategies. The GA method can therefore address air quality management problems that are intractable using the grid searching method. The annual attainment goals for PM2.5 (&lt; 35 μg m−3) and O3 (&lt; 80 ppb) can be achieved simultaneously over the PRD region and surrounding areas by reducing NOx (22%), volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 12%), and primary PM (30%) emissions.

However, because of the high-temperature, dusty and dark environment inside the furnace, as well as limitations in terms of installation position and viewing angle of the image capturing equipment, it is difficult to obtain clear, continuous and complete images of the burden surface and reconstruct accurate 3D topography in real time. To overcome these limitations, a novel 3D topography measurement and completion method of the burden surface is proposed in this study. First, a high-temperature industrial endoscope is designed and installed to capture the burden surface images during the blast furnace ironmaking process. Then, the details of the burden surface images are enhanced using image sharpening methods and the regions of interest of the images are extracted based on texture energy features. Next, a method based on the depth from defocus is used to calculate the depth of burden surface. Finally, considering that most of the images are incomplete because of the limitations above, a new 3D completion model is established to complete the burden surface topography based on a variational auto encoder and a generative adversarial network. On-site experiments and their validation demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain complete and accurate 3D burden surface topography and provide highly reliable topography data to optimize blast furnace operations. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3D burden surface topography; 3D completion model; Blast furnace; depth from defocus; generative adversarial network; texture energy features; variational auto encoder","3D modeling; Blast furnace practice; Blast furnaces; Endoscopy; Energy utilization; Flow of gases; Gas emissions; Image enhancement; Surface topography; Textures; Adversarial networks; Blast furnace burdens; Blast furnace iron-making; Blast furnace operation; Depth from defocus; Gas flow distribution; Installation position; Regions of interest; Topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085086144

At the same time, the major changes in China's natural resource management system have put forward new requirements for forest surveys. Efficient and accurate grasp of the spatial distribution of forest resources and the type of forest in China have become an important part of all-weather remote sensing survey and monitoring of natural resources. In recent years, with the strong promotion of the national high-scoring project, the extraction of forest based on high-resolution remote sensing image (HSRI) has become one of the main technical means of forest resource survey in China. However, HSRI contains abundant detailed information and spatial characteristic information, and spectral heterogeneity within the object is increased, which significantly causes difficulties in HSRI processing and information extraction. Therefore, aiming at the problem of extracting forest types from China's domestic GF-1 satellite image, this paper proposes a classification method based on feature learning using an object-oriented convolution neural network (CNN). First, the study area was under-segmented using the Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm and referred Estimation of Scale Parameter algorithm to determining the segmented scale. Then, a CNN model was obtained for identifying forest type by parameter adjustment. Finally, the multi-layer feature learning of the CNN and the regional Majority Voting algorithm were combined to classify the forest types within the study region. The overall extraction accuracy of the proposed method in this paper was 0.88. The object-oriented method can avoid the ""salt and pepper"" phenomenon that exists in the pixel-based classification. CNN can extract the deep features contained in HSRI, which is effectively conductive to category identification. In addition, the method proposed in this paper has a greater applicability to forest extraction from HSRI. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","CNN; forest extraction; high spatial resolution images; multi-resolution segmentation","Image processing; Machine learning; Natural resources management; Remote sensing; Surveys; Classification methods; Convolution neural network; Forest resource survey; High resolution remote sensing images; Majority voting algorithm; Natural resource management; Pixel based classifications; Spatial characteristics; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086271996

Seasonal concentration and emission profiles were acquired by monthly measurements, while diurnal profiles were generated in different seasons. The indoor air quality was evaluated considering both the individual and the additive health effect (respiratory irritation) of the three air pollutants. In winter, both 8-h and 15-min exposure limits (threshold concentrations) of NH3 were exceeded in the broiler barn; the highest additive level was more than two times of the limit. Seasonal average emissions of NH3, H2S, and respirable dust were 57 g d−1 AU−1, 1.35 g d−1 AU−1, and 1.99 g d−1 AU−1, respectively, for the layer barn, all with higher levels in the mild and warm seasons than in the cold season.

As an important urban form, precincts have been increasingly focused on as the context for urban redevelopment planning and at the forefront for trialling carbon reduction measures. However, due to interplays between the built forms and the occupancy, the carbon performance of a precinct is significantly affected by morphological variations, demographical changes, and renewable energy system deployment. Despite much research on the development of low-carbon precincts, there is limited analysis on aggregated effects of population growth, building energy efficiency, renewable energy penetration, and carbon reduction targets in relation to precinct carbon signature and carbon neutral potential for precinct redevelopment and decarbonisation planning. In this paper, an integrated carbon assessment model, including overall precinct carbon emissions and carbon offset contributed by precinct-scale renewable energy harvesting, is developed and applied to examine the lifecycle carbon signature of urban precincts. Using a case study on a residential precinct redevelopment, scenario analysis is employed to explore opportunities for decarbonising densification development and the carbon neutral potential. Results from scenario analysis indicate that redevelopment of buildings with higher-rated energy efficiency and increase of renewable energy penetration can have a long term positive impact on the carbon performance of urban precincts. Meanwhile, demographical factors in precinct evolution also have a strong influence on a precinct's carbon neutral potential. Whilst population size exerts upward pressure on total carbon emissions, changes in family types and associated consumption behaviour, such as travelling, can make positive contributions to carbon reduction. The analysis also highlights the significance of embodied carbon to the total carbon signature and the carbon reduction potential of a precinct during densification, reinforcing the notion that ""develop with less"" is as important as carbon offsetting measures for decarbonising the precinct toward carbon neutrality. © 2020 by the authors.

Different land use policies and climate change scenarios may have great implications on water yield and soil erosion. In this paper, four land development scenarios and two climate change scenarios are designed and applied to the Shaanxi-Gansu Loess Plateau. The InVEST model is applied to quantitatively evaluate the water yield and soil erosion modulus in 2030. It showed: (1) Arable land and grassland is always the dominant land types in the Shaanxi-Gansu Loess Plateau and cover more than 76% of the area. The business-as-usual and ecological protection priority scenarios may lead to increases in the local food security risks, with 1.9% and 1.4% gaps in the total food requirements. (2) Under the RCP2.6 scenario, the annual water yield and annual soil erosion amount increased by more than 63% (2.84*109 m3) and 22% (96.0*106 t), respectively. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the annual water yield and annual soil erosion decreased by more than 48% (2.17*109 m3) and 26% (114.3*106 t), respectively. (3) The influence of climate change on water yield and soil erosion is far greater than that of land use change. The contribution of climate change to the water yield changes is 92.8–99.6%, while the contribution of land use change is 0.4–7.2%. The contribution rate of climate change to soil erosion changes is 84.8–91.1%, while the contribution rate of land use change is 8.9–15.2%. The key ecological services, such as food production, water yield, soil and water conservation, should be carefully weighed and coordinated in the Loess Plateau and areas with limited land surfaces, such as small island development states. © 2019 The Authors","Ecological services; Food security; Regional water yield; Scenario simulation; Soil erosion; Trade-off",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076496610

This paper mainly explores the correlations between environmental regulation and carbon productivity in China. The study first measures and analyzes carbon productivity and its changes. The results indicate that China's carbon productivity experienced several fluctuations during the study period. Overall, the carbon productivity is currently in a stable rising phase. According to the empirical research on the basis of the spatial spillover effect, a positive spatial correlation exists between carbon productivity in the different regions of China, and there is a threshold for the impact of environmental regulation on carbon productivity. As the intensity of environmental regulation changes from weak to strong, its effect on carbon productivity in local regions will be affected and change from negative to positive. Similar effects will be seen in neighboring regions. At present, the average intensity of China's environmental regulation has not yet reached this threshold. The eastern region's average intensity of environmental regulation is closest to its threshold, while the average intensities of the central and western regions are far from their respective thresholds. There is great potential to improve China's carbon productivity through the implementation of appropriate environmental regulations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon productivity; Environmental regulation; Spatial correlation; Spatial spillover","Carbon; Climate change; Productivity; Carbon productivities; Eastern regions; Empirical analysis; Empirical research; Rational implementation; Spatial correlations; Spatial spillover; Spillover effects; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079342832

Here, we investigate how the temperature extremes in China change with different global warming levels using large ensemble runs from Canadian Earth System Model version 2. With the global mean near-surface temperature increasing from 1.5 to 5°C above the preindustrial level, the absolute intensity of the warmest and coldest temperatures in China will change linearly, while the percentile-based frequency of warm and cold temperatures will change nonlinearly. All the changes in the intensity and the frequency show clear regional differences, with the most obvious changes observed in northeastern China. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the intensity indices show clear shifts but with little change in shape, while the PDFs for the frequency indices show changes in both position and shape. Quantified analyses of risk ratio show that the risk changes in the frequency of temperature extremes will be larger than those for the intensity indices. The changes in the nighttime extremes are faster than those in the daytime extremes. The rarer the event is, the larger the change in the risk ratio. At the 2°C warming level, the cold days and nights with return periods of 5, 10, and 50 years in the current climate will become almost disappeared.

The characteristics of long-term periodic management of irrigation and drainage intensely affect the redox cycling of iron in paddy soil and could be one of the major factors regulating CH4 production. Currently, this regulatory effect is rarely applied to CH4 mitigation during straw returning to fields. To clarify the influences of iron on CH4 emissions induced by straw incorporation, an laboratory incubation experiment was conducted with the addition of rice straw and two different concentration levels of ferrous iron (3.7 and 7.4 g of Fe2+ kg-1 of soil) to two paddy soils (collected from Luotian, Hubei Province, and Changsha, Hunan Province, China, hereafter called LT and CS soils, respectively). Our result showed that CH4 emissions from straw addition treatment were 125.4 and 45.5 times greater than the amount without straw addition in LT and CS soils, respectively. Fe2+ addition significantly decreased CH4 emissions induced by rice straw by over 50% in both soil samples. Moreover, the stimulation of straw on CH4 emission was almost offset by twice the content of Fe2+ amendment in LT soil. Fe2+ addition significantly decreased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content, with 21-39% in LT soil and 31-42% in CS soil, compared to the straw addition treatment. The Fe(II) accumulation rate, microbial biomass carbon content, and CO2 emissions were also suppressed by Fe2+ addition. These results indicate that the addition of Fe2+ suppressed the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), leading to less DOC release from Fe-organic matter associations. The microbial activity and biomass could be influenced by the DOC availability, leading to further inhibition of CH4 emissions.

But easy quenching of phosphorescence induced by oxygen or instability of matrices remained a tricky problem. Herein, we reported a Si-doped-CD (Si-CD)-based RTP materials with long lifetime by embedding Si-CDs in sulfate crystalline matrices. The resultant Si-CD@sulfate composites exhibited a long lifetime up to 1.07 s, and outstanding stability under various ambient conditions. The intriguing RTP phenomenon was attributed to the C=O bond and the doping of Si element due to the fact that sulfates could effectively stabilize the triplet states of Si-CDs, thus enabling the intersystem crossing (ISC). Meanwhile, we confirmed that the ISC process and phosphorescence emission could be effectively regulated based on the heavy atom effect. This research introduced a new perspective to develop materials with regulated RTP performance and high stability. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,"Nanocrystalline materials; Phosphorescence; Stability; Sulfur compounds; Ambient conditions; Crystalline matrices; Heavy atom effects; Intersystem crossing; Long lifetime; Room temperature phosphorescence; Triplet state; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087512468

Prominent features of these systems are sulfide chimneys emanating high-temperature hydrothermal fluids. While several studies have investigated the microbial diversity in both active and inactive sulfide chimneys that have been extinct for up to thousands of years, little is known about chimneys that have ceased activity more recently, as well as the microbial succession occurring during the transition from active to inactive chimneys. Results: Genome-resolved metagenomics was applied to an active and a recently extinct (~ 7 years) sulfide chimney from the 9-10° N hydrothermal vent field on the East Pacific Rise. Full-length 16S rRNA gene and a total of 173 high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were retrieved for comparative analysis. In the active chimney (L-vent), sulfide- and/or hydrogen-oxidizing Campylobacteria and Aquificae with the potential for denitrification were identified as the dominant community members and primary producers, fixing carbon through the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. In contrast, the microbiome of the recently extinct chimney (M-vent) was largely composed of heterotrophs from various bacterial phyla, including Delta-/Beta-/Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Gammaproteobacteria were identified as the main primary producers, using the oxidation of metal sulfides and/or iron oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction to fix carbon through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Further analysis revealed a phylogenetically distinct Nitrospirae cluster that has the potential to oxidize sulfide minerals coupled to oxygen and/or nitrite reduction, as well as for sulfate reduction, and that might serve as an indicator for the early stages of chimneys after venting has ceased. Conclusions: This study sheds light on the composition, metabolic functions, and succession of microbial communities inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vent sulfide chimneys. Collectively, microbial succession during the life span of a chimney could be described to proceed from a ""fluid-shaped""microbial community in newly formed and actively venting chimneys supported by the oxidation of reductants in the hydrothermal fluid to a ""mineral-shaped""community supported by the oxidation of minerals after hydrothermal activity has ceased. Remarkably, the transition appears to occur within the first few years, after which the communities stay stable for thousands of years.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the expected impacts, in terms of air quality and health effects, of various hypothetical low-emission zone (LEZ) scenarios in Greater Paris for a planned intervention in 2018/2019 which combine two different perimeters and two levels of vehicles ban, and to assess those impacts according to the socioeconomic status (SES) of the population. Methods: We evaluated the effects of four hypothetical LEZ scenarios on various stages of the full-chain model, more specifically, road traffic modelling (traffic flow, type of vehicles and related number of kilometers driven), emissions, fine scale PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations, related resident population exposure, and health effects. We computed the overall benefits of expected air pollution improvements in terms of preventable deaths and a decrease in new cases of the following three major chronic diseases: ischemic heart diseases in adults, asthma in children and low weight in full-term newborns. Results: The most stringent LEZ scenario would lower the maximum level of exposure from 55 μg/m3 to 42 μg/m3 in Paris. In one year, this scenario would help prevent: 340 deaths (−0.6%) representing 114,300 life years gained, 170 low-weight full-term births (−4.9%), 130 new cases of ischemic heart disease (IHD) (−1.8%) and 2930 new cases of asthma (−3.0%) among 9.4 million residents. Residents outside the LEZ would also benefit from this scenario. Results indicated that the intervention could contribute to increasing inequalities. The comparison of scenarios underlined the value of extending the LEZ to include a wider zone (including 80 more municipalities surrounding Paris). This would lead to a more equitable spread of the benefits over the population. Conclusion: Traffic control policies such as LEZ are difficult to accept for some categories of commuters and economic stakeholders. As of June 2019, the concertation process for the proposed Paris LEZ is still ongoing. This work provides authorities with detailed analyses of the options for this measure as well as information on related implications.

Therefore, looking for innovative low-cost insulation materials represents a key challenge. This paper presents a development of a new enhanced cement-based building material using local by-products and describes its impact on the energy efficiency of residential buildings. An experimental study on the effect of adding plaster and Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) with different volume fraction on the thermal properties of cement is presented. The thermal transport properties of the developed mixtures are investigated using the Hot Disk method. The results obtained showed that the addition of 5 vol.% and 40 vol.% of plaster and EPS respectively decreases the thermal conductivity of cement by nearly 40%, which highlights the importance of the proposed mixture for enhancing the thermal resistance of the building compounds. For comparison purposes a dynamic thermal simulation was carried out for a typical Moroccan house located in Oujda city, Morocco. The numerical results show that up to 40% of cooling and 31% of heating loads required to reach thermal comfort could be reduced, if the proposed material substitutes the conventional one. © 2020 IEEE.","Cement; Energy-Plus; Expanded polystyrene; Simulation; Thermal insulation; Thermal properties","Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Cements; Construction industry; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Heating; Mixtures; Plaster; Polystyrenes; Thermal comfort; Thermal conductivity; Building envelopes; Construction sectors; Dynamic thermal simulations; Expanded polystyrene; Insulation materials; Residential building; Thermal characterization; Thermal transport properties; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091973317

However, these wall assemblies often require initial, upfront investments in material cost and manufacturing energy. To this end, this study assessed the total life cycle energy (LCE) and life cycle cost (LCC) of five Passive House-inspired building envelopes in the United States via life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA), respectively, across four US climate zones. The results indicate that, regardless of climate, wood-framed wall systems were most cost-effective and exhibited lower LCE and LCC compared with the other wall assemblies investigated herein. Double-stud walls in particular were found most environmentally and economically cost-effective in all climates. In addition, the results specifically highlight the law of diminishing returns in terms of OE reduction through more insulative envelopes, as the impacts of embodied energy (EE) outweighed the benefits of a reduced OE in some cases. Finally, depending on climate and building archetype, the total EE of the residential buildings accounted for 22%-91% of the total LCE over a 60-year period - a result that highlights a grand opportunity to reduce the EE and, thus, total LCE of high-performance residential construction in the US. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building envelope; Embodied energy; Energy efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Operational energy; Passive House","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Housing; Investments; Life cycle; Solar buildings; Walls (structural partitions); High performance buildings; Law of diminishing returns; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costs (LCC); Life-cycle cost analysis; Operational energy; Residential building; Residential construction; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083241714

A comprehensive model is given for economic and environmental evaluation. Typical case studies show that the renewable-based DES systems can supply the energy in a cost-effective and environment-friendly way.

However, high engine efficiencies and the reduction of engine load, due to torque assists by an electric motor, cause a decrease of exhaust gas temperature levels. This leads to an increased time to catalyst light-off, resulting in an overall lower efficiency of the exhaust aftertreatment system (ATS). Especially in low load driving conditions, at cold ambient temperatures and on short distance drives, the tailpipe pollutant emissions are severely impacted by these low ATS efficiency levels. To ensure lowest emissions under all driving conditions, catalyst heating methods must be used. In conventional vehicles, internal combustion engine measures (e.g. usage of a dedicated combustion mode for late combustion) can be applied. A hybrid system with an electrically heated catalyst (EHC) enables further methods such as the increase of engine load by the electric motor or electric catalyst heating. Since these methods result either directly or indirectly in additional fuel consumption there is a conflict of objectives between a fast catalyst heat-up and the reduction of fuel consumption. This trade-off is addressed by an energy and emission management, which controls the split of the propulsion power between the combustion engine and electric motor, the electric catalyst heating and the selection of the combustion mode. Such a management system, based on offline-optimized rules, is presented in this paper. The results for different driving cycles are compared to those from a conventional non-hybrid vehicle in a detailed simulation framework, for a 48V P0 Diesel hybrid including an exhaust aftertreatment system with EHC. With the help of the EHC the NOx level was reduced significantly especially during city and short distance drives. On the WLTC a CO2 saving of 7 % was achieved, maintaining the same NOx emissions level. © 2020 SAE International.

The largest tracts of ecologically most valuable roadless areas refer to large unfragmented forests regions, both in the tropics and the boreal zone (Amazon, Congo basin, East and Southeast Asia). Among all terrestrial ecosystems, roadless forests are the single most important strongholds of regulating ecosystem services: among others, soil protection, water retention, buffering of the local and regional climate and mitigation of global climate change via capturing of atmospheric carbon. But roadless areas also comprise much demanded natural resource assets, such as timber, often also minerals and space for agricultural development. There is a substantial conflict between diverse short-term economic interests and the long-term conservation of roadless areas. Large roadless areas can serve as a measurable surrogate for the most pristine and functional ecosystems. Roadlessness is a property of areas, which are not impacted by roads; it can be used as a proxy for assessing ecosystem integrity and the absence of many anthropogenic disturbances. We recommend that policy-makers give roadless areas conservation priority over areas that have already been fragmented. It is essential to establish roadlessness as a criterion for the planning of ecosystem-based, cost-effective sustainable development. In parallel with measures to protect roadlessness, we recommend alternative approaches to mobility that can work under roadless conditions, e.g., related to railroads, blimps and other lowenergy technologies with low infrastructure requirements. Even if ""climate-friendly"" renewable energy was available for road transport on a large scale, the construction, existence and operation of roads would continue to severely impair ecosystem functionality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are few studies directly differentiating the regional effects of air pollution on specific causes of death from cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. It is important to target specific diseases and air pollutants for environmental management, in order to develop a sustainable environment. Therefore, a territory-wide register-based study was developed with cause-specific mortality data in Hong Kong between 2007 and 2014 (n = 257,090). Five groups of decedents were directly compared with the two control groups (cardiovascular and respiratory deaths), separately, based on binomial logistic regressions. Three air pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, black carbon (BC)) were selected to evaluate how spatial distribution of long-term air pollution exposure can induce the difference in mortality risks from two control groups. Based on the results, different air pollutants can contribute to different impact on mortality risk. PM2.5 and BC contributed to higher effects on mortality associated with mental and behavioral disorders than those linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. BC can contribute to a higher mortality risk for mortality associated with diseases of the nervous and digestive systems than with respiratory diseases. There was also a stronger influence of neighborhood PM2.5 on mortality associated with diseases of the genitourinary system than with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and a stronger impact of neighborhood NO2 and BC on cancer-related mortality than on respiratory mortality. In conclusion, several air pollutants have greater impact on cause-specific mortality than cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive and systematic investigation to evaluate how different types of air pollutants influence various types of cause-specific mortality. In addition, specific health protocols, enhancement of urban design and improvement of environmental hygiene should be conducted for specific types of air pollution and deprived populations, rather than targeting solely the people with cardiorespiratory diseases. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Cardiorespiratory diseases; Cause-specific mortality; Intra-urban; Long-term air pollution; Register-based study; Urban health","atmospheric pollution; black carbon; cardiovascular disease; hygiene; mortality risk; neighborhood; particulate matter; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; spatial distribution; spatial variation; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084301097

Many merits over AC grids, such as ease of control, higher efficiency and reliability make DC microgrid applications spread worldwide. Several researches address the control hierarchy and strategy in DC microgrids. On a local control level, Droop Control is a commonly used technique that ensures simultaneously DC bus voltage regulation and proper load sharing between operating converters. Yet, this paper investigates DC Microgrids control strategy from a different approach which is convenient, fundamentally, for remote islanded DC Microgrids. In such applications, the existence of the energy storage system (ESS) is substantial for a safe and stable Microgrid operation, especially, due to the intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy sources (RESs) generated power. Hence, this paper proposes a simple, local control level, technique which is applied to a standard islanded DC Microgrid topology including: RESs, ESS and a back-up Diesel Generator (DG) as a traditional polluting source. The adopted control strategy main goal is to stabilize DC bus voltage, through ESS, and prevent battery excess discharge by connecting, temporarily, a back-up DG to the Microgrid as an additional source. When connected to the common DC bus, the DG takes charge of stabilizing the DC bus voltage. Once the power flow balance equation is reached again, the DG is disconnected instantly in order to reduce Carbone emissions. Finally, simulation tests are conducted in order to prove the viability and robustness of the proposed method. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Developing countries; Diesel engines; Electric load flow; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Microgrids; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Voltage regulators; Dc-bus voltage regulations; Dc-microgrid applications; Energy storage systems; Environmental pollutions; Integrate renewable energies; Microgrid operations; Power flow balance; Renewable energy source; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091974100

Direct energy consumption was decomposed into energy use in order to consider the relationship with regional conditions. The results showed that CO2 emissions from direct energy consumption were almost as large as indirect CO2 emissions induced by consuming products and services, suggesting that lifestyle improvements are important for both energy savings and reducing CO2 emissions relating to product and service consumption. In addition, CO2 emissions fromdirect energy consumption varied widely between cities, making them susceptible to regional conditions. We also calculated CO2 emissions from direct energy consumption and examined the regional conditions for individual forms of energy use. CO2 emissions were higher in cold regions and lower in larger cities. In Japan, large cities are often located in relatively warm areas, so we conducted an analysis to distinguish the effects of climatic conditions from those of urbanization. This analysis allowed us to clarify the effects of regional conditions on factors such as heating/cooling and the ratio of detached houses to apartments. © 2020 by the authors.","Consumption behaviors; Household energy consumption; Indirect CO2 emission; Lifestyles; Low-carbon society; Regional characteristics","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; household energy; lifestyle; regional pattern; urbanization; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086389721

(2019) recently described the risk analysis process by which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) chooses species for listing as injurious wildlife. They further compared the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK) and the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), generally unfavorably, with their process/components. We assert that FISK and AS-ISK were largely misrepresented. The USFWS process is a risk analysis framework, whereas FISK and AS-ISK are hazard identification/risk screening tools, addressing only the initial step of a risk analysis scheme. Thus, to avoid an apples-to-oranges comparison as done in that paper, FISK/AS-ISK should be compared to the equivalent USFWS tool, the Ecological Risk Screening Summaries (ERSS). The remaining issues that we address concerning FISK/AS-ISK include: (1) need for expert opinion, (2) subjective climate matching, (3) need for regional calibration, and (4) narrower range of information inputs; and concerning the ERSS process: (5) peer-review. Both systems clearly use expert opinion, the FISK/AS-ISK arguably in a more structured and transparent manner. Guidance for FISK/AS-ISK recommends a climate-matching program, but allows for use of Köppen-Geiger climate types or physiological tolerances, potentially increasing subjectivity in some cases but improving climate-match quality in others. Calibration of FISK/AS-ISK follows from the regional nature of invasiveness risk and the use of questions unrelated to climate that are tailored to the risk assessment (RA) area. Climate match is the only element that the ERSS applies specifically to the RA area. The FISK and AS-ISK actually use a much wider range of information than does the ERSS, a system based on invasion history and climate match only. The peer review of ERSS consisted of a five-member expert panel that evaluated the method, whereas the ERSS reports posted online are not peer reviewed. Conversely, FISK applications have resulted in 37 peer-reviewed journal articles, including assessments from over 70 experts in 45 countries. We welcome constructive criticism and improvement of these decision-support tools, but we are concerned that managers may dismiss well-established approaches in favor of a framework that possesses its own method-specific limitations. We recommend that managers evaluate risk-based approaches and adopt systems to support decisions and improve invasive species management. © Hill et al.","Aquatic species invasiveness screening kit; ERSS; Fish; Fish invasiveness screening kit; Injurious wildlife; Risk assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086018080

Studies of these elements require spatial and temporal measurements relevant to appearance and disappearance of haze. One of the first of such studies was implemented in Denver, Colorado (USA), setting an example for follow-on efforts throughout the world. This winter 1978 campaign employed six ground stations and mid-day aircraft observations, supplemented with boundary layer meteorological observations and emissions data. Aerosol measurements employed 4-h sampling for mass concentration and composition. Results include a spatial and temporal interpretation of the observations, complementing results reported from a location NNE of the city. Fine, not coarse, particles were responsible for Denver’s “Brown Cloud”. Fine particles were composed of a mixture from local sources of carbon, dust, and atmospheric chemical reactions, especially SO2 and NOx oxidation, which is common knowledge today, but was unknown at the time. The distribution of particles varied with winds and inversion conditions. Receptor modeling found that light extinction depended on carbonaceous combustion byproducts from motor vehicles, power plants, industrial operations and residential activity. Subsequent studies of Denver’s winter haze showed similar source apportionment of extinction even with major reductions in emissions. © 2020, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.","Boundary layer meteorology; Carbon; Denver air pollution; Nitrate; Source apportionment; Sulfate; Visibility impairment; Winter aerosol chemistry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085264172

These intra-ring wood features were the most informative about local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity ofPinus halepensisMill. in a provenance trial. This highlights the importance of taking provenance into account when selecting forest reproductive material to mitigate the effects of climate change. Context: It is essential to disentangle the influence of climate from the effect of provenance on inter- and intra-annual wood traits to identify populations’ responses to climate changes. This will be even more relevant in the drought-prone Mediterranean region, where species have high genetic differentiation among populations. Aims: We investigated the effects of provenance and climate driving Pinus halepensis Mill. wood traits, as imprinted phenotypic adaptations to the Mediterranean climate. Methods: Inter- and intra-annual wood trait variation (ring-, early-, and latewood width, wood density) was studied by microdensitometry in 8 provenances from Spain, France, Greece, and Italy in a common-garden experiment. We related wood traits and density fluctuations with inter-annual climate variations at the trial site and the provenance origin. Results: Provenances showed distinct responses to climate regarding tree growth, wood density, and intra-annual fluctuations. Density fluctuations in latewood were more frequent than in earlywood. Climate at the provenance origin was a more important force for density fluctuations than climatic variations at the planting site, with different trends between coastal and inland provenances, and higher frequency of latewood fluctuations in provenances from arid and semiarid sites. Conclusion: Differences in P. halepensis wood density fluctuations confirmed the imprinted origin provenance control in response to climate variations and indicated a relation with local adaptation of these xylem anatomical features. Moreover, the position of these fluctuations in rings reflected the high plasticity of P. halepensis to cope with high intra-seasonal variability of climatic conditions. This underlines the importance of considering tree-ring features for the selection of provenances in reforestation material for conservation and silvicultural programs. © 2020, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Aleppo pine; Dendroecology; Intra-annual density fluctuations; ITRAX; Local adaptation; Mediterranean","adaptation; anatomy; bioindicator; climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; phenotypic plasticity; provenance; tree ring; wood; Pinus halepensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086166328

This study is the first to test statistically the association between network membership and progress in adaptation planning in 377 cities globally. The results show that network members are more likely to have started the adaptation process than other cities, and that being a member of multiple networks is associated with higher levels of adaptation planning. Moreover, cities in wealthier countries are more likely to be more advanced in adaptation planning than others. We consider the possible explanations for these results based on the previous literature and information gathered from the networks.

Groundwater is used as a drinking water source all over the world, and sustainable methods to remove pesticides at low concentrations are urgently needed since pesticide contaminations can adversely affect human health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether microbial bentazone degradation was associated with methane oxidation in full-scale drinking water treatment plants. To this end, we investigated bentazone biodegradation in microcosms with water and filter material from rapid sand filters, or biomass from aeration systems, and we investigated the statistical relation between the presence of methane and bentazone in groundwater abstraction wells. An array of evidence supported an association between bentazone degradation and methane oxidation in the biological treatment process. The biodegradation potential of bentazone was associated with the presence of methane in the raw water at 14 different water works. In contrast, no association was observed with any of the other investigated inorganic energy sources, e.g., ammonium. Addition of acetylene inhibited methane oxidation and the bentazone degradation in filter material from two investigated waterworks. Biomass from the aeration tanks degraded bentazone, but only while oxidizing methane. Bentazone removal rates and methane removal rates correlated significantly across all the experiments with biomass or filter material, with an overall transformation yield of 15 ± 1 × 10–5 moleBTZ/moleCH4. This demonstrated that the bentazone degradation was conducted by the same type of process in all the investigated communities, governed by methane oxidation. Furthermore, based on more than 10.000 water analyses from waterworks abstraction wells in Denmark, bentazone was detected significantly less frequent in wells with high methane concentrations (&gt;1 mg/L) than in wells without methane. This suggests that biological treatment of bentazone contamination in drinking water may be achieved using methanotrophs. © Copyright © 2020 Hedegaard, Schliemann-Haug, Milanovic, Lee, Boe-Hansen and Albrechtsen.","bentazone; co-metabolic biodegradation; drinking water treatment; groundwater; methane oxidation; pesticides; rapid sand filters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087481363

In recent years, vehicles with natural gas-powered engines have increasingly been used as an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel engines to reduce emissions. In addition to their lower emissions, these offer a high potential for waste heat recovery. A thermoelectric generator as a waste heat recovery system represents a cost-efficient technology for fuel and emission reduction. Integrated in the exhaust system, some of the otherwise lost heat can be converted to useful electrical energy. The advantages of thermoelectric generators compared to similar systems are low maintenance requirements and therefore a low cost-benefit ratio. This paper presents research on thermoelectric generator systems for heavy-duty natural gas vehicles on multiple levels. As a novelty, a holistic approach is applied, which includes interactions between all its components, all interactions with the overall vehicle system and the total cost of ownership. This approach is combined with a multiphysical numerical simulation model to obtain an economically suitable design. The solution of the simulation study is validated by an experimental investigation using a single channel system with commercially available thermoelectric modules. Approximately 70% of the simulated output power and the calculated efficiency could be measured. The proposed thermoelectric generator solution for heavy-duty natural gas vehicles achieves a peak power of 1507 W and a power density of up to 50 W kg−1. The results indicate a net fuel reduction of −0.54% (gross −1.04%). This is equivalent to a reduction of CO2 emissions of 4.9 (9.4) gCO2 km−1. The maximum system efficiency is simulative up to 4.2% (3.7% experimental). The overall system costs are estimated at 1811 EUR and thus represent a cost-benefit ratio of min. 1.2 EUR W−1. The results exceed the state of the art by more than 84%. The investigated commercially available thermoelectric modules with a power density of 1.1 W cm−2 are currently not application-oriented and are unable to fulfil the economic target of an amortization period of less than 3 years. New approaches are required and discussed. The new solution found with a power density of up to 3 W cm−2 and an efficiency of up to 9% indicates a high potential regarding the future cost-benefit ratio of the technology and will be adopted for further research and development activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive application; Energy recovery; Heavy-duty natural gas vehicle; Thermoelectric generator; Waste heat recovery system","Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Depreciation; Electronic equipment; Emission control; Engines; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Experimental investigations; Research and development; Single channel system; Thermo-electric modules; Thermoelectric generators; Total cost of ownership; Waste heat recovery systems; Natural gas vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082860998

There have been a large number of studies exploring NSC changes in individual plant species and individual organ under drought and showed different trends; however, an understanding of the universal pattern of the plant NSCs responses to drought, particularly to drought duration, is still lacking. Here, we compiled data from 47 experimental studies on 52 tree species and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of soluble sugars, starch, and TNSC (total nonstructural carbohydrates including both soluble sugars and starch) concentrations in different tree organs (leaf, stem, and root) to drought intensity and duration. We found that starch in all organs decreased and soluble sugars in leaf increased with prolonged experiment time, and the changes in soluble sugars in all organs were stronger under severe drought than under slight-to-moderate drought. Under slight-to-moderate drought, the NSC content of each organ varied with time, while with the extension of the drought duration, the NSCs gradually approached the control value (no drought stress); this trend remained in the late drought, which means that trees activated physiological regulation processes to increase carbon storage and reduce the risks of carbon starvation. In contrast, long-term severe drought could lead to a net loss of carbohydrates, especially in the root, implying that prolonged severe drought could lead to NSC depletion in the whole plant. As prolonged drought duration has occurred in and is projected for many regions, this paper could shed light into studies on how trees respond and adapt extending drought duration through nonstructural carbon production, transportation, and reallocation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","drought duration; drought intensity; meta-analysis; nonstructural carbohydrates; NSC depletion; roots","carbohydrate; concentration (composition); drought stress; experimental study; meta-analysis; physiological response; starch; sugar; tree; carbohydrate; starch; carbohydrate metabolism; drought; meta analysis; plant leaf; tree; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbohydrates; Droughts; Plant Leaves; Starch; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083050187

It is of significance to study the effects of wetland drying on microbial regulation of soil carbon (C) in the desert. In this study, we examined the impacts of wetland drying on microbial biomass, microbial community (bacteria, fungi) and microbial activity [basal microbial respiration, microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2)]. Relationships of microbial properties with biotic factors [litter, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP)], abiotic factors (soil moisture, pH and clay content) and biological processes (basal microbial respiration, qCO2) were also developed. Results showed that the drying of wetland led to a decrease of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content, microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) content and fungi and bacterial abundance, and an increase of the fungi:bacteria ratio. Wetland drying also led to increased soil basal respiration and increased qCO2, which was attributed to lower soil clay content and litter N concentration. The MBC:SOC ratios were higher under drier soil conditions than under virgin wetland, which was attributed to stronger C conserve ability of fungi than bacteria. The wetland drying process exacerbated soil C loss by strengthening heterotrophic respiration; however, the exact effects of soil microbial community structure on microbial C mineralization were not clear in this study and need further research. © 2020 by the authors.

Combining our laboratory data with ab initio calculations, we reveal that the methylidyne radical may add barrierlessly to the terminal carbon atom and/or carbon−carbon double bond of 1,3-butadiene, leading to doublet C5H7 intermediates with life times longer than the rotation periods. These collision complexes undergo non-statistical unimolecular decomposition through hydrogen atom emission yielding the cyclic cis- and trans-3-vinyl-cyclopropene products with reaction exoergicities of 119±42 kJ mol−1. Since this reaction is barrierless, exoergic, and all transition states are located below the energy of the separated reactants, these cyclic C5H6 products are predicted to be accessed even in low-temperature environments, such as in hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres of planets and cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the Guangzhou Ambient Air Quality Compliance Plan does not specify what constitutes compliance with this target. We investigated a range of ambition levels for emissions reductions required to meet different possible interpretations of compliance using a hybrid dispersion and land-use regression model approach. We found that to reduce average annual-mean NO2 concentration across all current monitoring sites to below 40 μg m−3 (i.e. a compliance assessment approach that does not use modelling) would require emissions reductions from all source sectors within Guangzhou of 60%, whilst to attain 40 μg m−3 everywhere in Guangzhou (based on model results) would require all-source emissions reduction of 90%. Reducing emissions only from the traffic sector would not achieve either interpretation of the target. We calculated the impacts of the emissions reductions on NO2-atttributable premature mortality to illustrate that policy assessment based only on assessment against a fixed concentration target does not account for the full public health improvements attained. Our approach and findings are relevant for NO2 air pollution control policy making in other megacities. © 2020 The Author(s).

Organic solvent-extractable compounds were recovered from soils collected at two sites differing in the degree of forest damage. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were applied in order to characterize solvent-extractable lipids. Raman spectroscopy was also applied as it provides distinct advantages for determining the structural order of carbonaceous materials. The organic matter measurement techniques were combined with an established simultaneous multi-element measurement technique. Variations in individual soil horizons from the sites were reflected in the crystallinity of epicuticular waxes, presence of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, concentrations of n-alkanes, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids, and in the content of aromatic structures, hydroxyl, ester, and carboxylic acid groups. The results are explained by differently transformed organic matter. The concentrations of elements in the soils were also affected by atmospheric depositions, including higher accumulations of arsenic and antimony, and lower contents of natural nutrients. These data have potential to be used as sensitive biogenic indicators of ecosystem damage by long-term atmospheric depositions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chromatography; Fatty acids; Soil lipids; Soil organic matter; Spectroscopy","arsenic; atmospheric deposition; border region; carboxylic acid; crystallinity; forest soil; montane forest; organic matter; soil degradation; Czech Republic; Germany; Poland [Central Europe]; Czech Republic; ecosystem; forest; Poland; soil; Czech Republic; Ecosystem; Forests; Poland; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084673260

When applied to soils, at suitable geochemical conditions, alkaline minerals lead to accumulation of soil inorganic carbon as pedogenic carbonates. Agricultural land covers 37 % of the Earth's land surface, thus offering a natural sink for atmospheric CO2. Wollastonite (CaSiO3) has been commercialized in Ontario as an agricultural soil amendment for several years, but it is not known if or how much CO2 is sequestered annually. In the present study, wollastonite-amended soils were collected from three commercial-scale fields located in Ontario: a leafy vegetables farm in the town of Paris (Field 1); a potato farm in the settlement of Alliston (Field 2); and a soybean farm in the city of Woodstock (Field 3). Chemical and mineralogical assessments of these soils were conducted to determine their carbonate content and the fate of the wollastonite. The soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content was higher in all soils that had been amended with wollastonite, compared to controls, and in Field 1 the SIC content was 2.6 times higher in soil amended thrice with wollastonite compared to a single application. Mineralogical analysis showed the presence of additional polymorphs of SiO2, which may originate from the wollastonite after the dissolution of calcium. This work provides further evidence, here for the first time at a regional scale, that soil amendment with alkaline silicates can be an effective geoengineering tool for climate change mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 sequestration; Field study; Pedogenic carbonates; Silicate weathering; Soil inorganic carbon","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Alkalinity; Atmospheric chemistry; Calcium; Calcium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Climate change; Magnesium powder; Silica; Silicate minerals; Silicon; Soils; Agricultural soils; Alkaline minerals; Calcium and magnesiums; Climate change mitigation; Geochemical conditions; Mineralogical analysis; Pedogenic carbonates; Soil inorganic carbons; Soil pollution; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; land cover; mineralogy; soil amendment; soil carbon; wollastonite; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Glycine max; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083047042

By identifying carbon emission flows among 31 domestic provincial administrative regions and 184 foreign countries/economies, this work examines the domestic and foreign carbon emission flows of Chinese provinces/municipalities based on the intra- and inter-national relations. Overall, the provinces and municipalities in China are divided into 4 patterns according to carbon emission flows, among which inland provinces mainly engage in domestic carbon emission transfers, western regions generally receive carbon emissions with main carbon outflows in northeastern and central provinces, and coastal regions play an essential role in balancing carbon emission surpluses and deficits between domestic and foreign regions. For different sub-regions in China, recognizing carbon emission transfer relations contributes to the synergetic and sustainable regional development from a tele-connected perspective. With the nested network analysis, the multi-scale and multi-regional assessments focusing upon China’s provinces and municipalities extend the existing research to both national and global scales, providing a solid foundation for sustainable regional development in China. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Embodied carbon emission; Input-output analysis; Multi-scale & multi-regional; Nested network","Emission control; Regional planning; Carbon emission flows; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Foreign countries; Nested networks; Sustainable regional development; Systematic assessment; Transfer relations; Carbon; carbon emission; emission control; network analysis; regional development; sustainable development; synergism; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084072349

The research aimed to investigate the effect of cinnamon bark meal as cinnamaldehyde source on methane production and methanogen diversity in the rumen. Substrate of fermentation consist of Pennisetum purpureum, wheat pollard and soybean meal. Cinnamon bark meal was added into feed sample equal to cinnamaldehyde level as much as 200, 400, 600, 800 mg based on dry matter (DM). Parameters recorded were dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), methane production, number of protozoa and communities of methanogen. Fermentation parameters were measured by incubating the sample in a rumen liquor buffer that was taken from a rumen fistulated Bali cattle. In vitro gas production was analyzed using Menke and Steingass gas production technique. Methanogenic communities were observed using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) technique. The bacterial diversity (H' index) and evenness (E index) were calculated from the peak value. Results showed that there was no significant (P>0.05) different among treatments on IVDMD, IVOMD, methane production and number of protozoa. Based on T-RFLP, methanogenic archaea diversity was not affected by the diet.

Literature shows that internal conditions and demand on environmental control systems can vary with height within buildings. However, an architectural trend towards highly glazed façades for tall buildings suggests the vertical gradient of performance is not always considered in the design process. By simulating a high-rise residential building in London, a comparative analysis of the overheating risks and daylighting at different levels in the building was conducted. In this study the model was able to consider the influence of surrounding built environment on solar gain and so influence of urban location on overheating risk was taken into account. Simulations were conducted using typical reference years as well as meteorological data for specific heat-wave periods experienced in London and that are expected to become more intense and frequent due to climate change. Passive mitigation options (external shading) are demonstrated to help reduce overheating occurrence by 74%, at the same time the impact of decreased daylighting (30%) is less problematic at higher levels where daylight factor is greater. © The Author(s) 2019.","Climate change resilience; Design and adaptation; High-rise building; Overheating risk; Vertical profile","article; built environment; climate change; England; heat; heating; simulation; sunlight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068312158

In order to increase the methane production, co-digestion of internal sludge with Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) might be feasible in the future. The objective of this study was therefore to find a beneficial solution for the utilization of OFMSW at the WWTP in Varberg, Sweden. The effects of co-digesting primary sludge (PS) and OFMSW collected in the municipality, in different mixing ratios, were investigated by semi-continuous anaerobic digestion assays. Furthermore, the effects of the addition of a commercial trace elements mixture solution (CTES), available on the market in Sweden, were also examined. Co-digestion of OFMSW and PS resulted in specific methane yields of 404, 392, and 375 Nml CH4/g volatile solids (VS), obtained during semi-continuous operations of 301, 357 and 385 days, for the reactors fed with OMFSW:PS ratio of 4:1, 3:1, and 1:1, and at maximum organic loading rates (OLRs) achieved of 4.0, 4.0 and 5.0 gVS/L/d, respectively. Furthermore, mono-digestion of OFMSW failed already at OLR of 1.0 gVS/L/d, however, an OLR of 4.0 gVS/L/d could be achieved with addition of 14 μL/g VS Commercial Trace Element Solutions (CTES) leading to 363 mL CH4/g VS methane production. These experiments were running during 411 days. Hence, higher process efficiency was obtained when using co-digestion of OFMSW and PS compared to that of OFMSW in mono-digestion. Co-digestion is a more feasible option where a balanced Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio and nutrient supply can be maintained. © 2020 by the authors.

Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs) play a key role in managing fisheries on the high seas and therefore are vital for supporting the successful implementation of SDG 14. SDG 14 is intrinsically linked with SDG 13 (the need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). As biophysical impacts arise from human-induced climate change affect oceans, and fisheries therein, it is important that RFOs take account of such impacts on the management of fisheries. This paper examines the engagement of RFOs with SDG 14 and climate change through an analysis of interviews with 36 RFO stakeholders. The results show that even though there is consensus concerning the importance of climate change and SDG 14, most of the RFOs are not directly engaging with these two SDGs. However, it was stated that the work done by RFOs, to end overfishing, positively contributes to the realization of climate change and SDG 14, although the actions taken by RFOs need to increase in scale and speed if they are to fulfil their responsibility to effectively manage human impacts on ocean resources. Furthermore, member countries play a key role in supporting or resisting progress.

Uncertainty remains about how these short-term plot-level responses might play out at landscape scales where climate change, competition, succession, and disturbances interact with tree-level responses. In this study, we used a recent physiology-based approach (PnET-Succession v3.1) within the forest landscape model LANDIS-II to scale the site-scale FACE results to landscape extents by mechanistically accounting for the globally changing drivers of CO2, ozone, temperature, and precipitation. We conducted a factorial simulation experiment to test five hypotheses about the effects of three treatments (CO2 concentration, cumulative ozone exposure, and disturbance). CO2 was clearly the dominant driver of landscape response, with disturbance also having a large effect. Ozone was not a dominant driver of landscape dynamics or total landscape biomass, but its negative effect on mean landscape biomass was nevertheless significant. We found that CO2 mitigation of water stress may not have a major effect on species composition or biomass accumulation. We found that species diversity was somewhat decreased by elevated CO2 as expected, but somewhat increased by O3, contrary to expectations. The spatial pattern of the landscape was minimally affected by the treatments. While rising CO2 concentrations have some mitigating effect on the negative O3 effect on the species studied, additional research is needed to confirm whether researchers and managers can be justified in disregarding O3 as a primary driver of forest dynamics in other ecosystems. Our results also add more support to the growing consensus that projections of climate change effects must include robust, direct links between CO2 and tree growth and competition; temperature effects (as demonstrated elsewhere) appear to be less by comparison.

The removal of CO2 from the ocean-atmosphere system is controlled by the burial of carbonate sediments (CaCO3), ultimately linking the global calcium and carbon cycles. This fundamental link has driven the development of the stable calcium isotope proxy with application to both ancient skeletal and non-skeletal bulk carbonate sediments. Calcium isotope ratios (δ44/40Ca) have been used to track long-term changes in seawater chemistry (e.g., aragonite vs. calcite seas) and to elucidate short-term climatic perturbations associated with mass extinction events. However, developments in the calcium isotope proxy have shown that δ44/40Ca values in carbonate minerals also are sensitive to changes in precipitation rates, mineralogy and diagenesis, thereby complicating the application of the proxy to the reconstruction of global cycles. First, inorganic carbonate precipitation experiments have demonstrated that carbonate δ44/40Ca values are sensitive to precipitation rates with higher rates generally leading to larger fractionation. Second, δ44/40Ca values are sensitive to carbonate mineralogy with inorganic aragonite and calcite being on average ~ 1.5‰ and ~ 0.9‰ depleted relative to contemporaneous seawater, respectively. The effects of both changes in carbonate mineralogy and precipitation rates affect primary and secondary minerals, but are particularly pronounced during carbonate diagenesis where relatively slow rates of recrystallization and neomorphism can lead to significant changes in bulk sediment δ44/40Ca values. Third, changes in faunal composition expressed in skeletal fossil archives can lead to large changes in carbonate δ44/40Ca values that are decoupled from changes in global cycles. Nevertheless, when these factors are appropriately considered the application of calcium isotopes in ancient carbonate sediments becomes a powerful tool for understanding biogeochemical processes that operate over many scales; from diagenetic changes within the sediment pore-space, to regional changes across ancient carbonate platforms, and to global changes in seawater chemistry through time. Importantly, the processes that contribute to variability in carbonate δ44/40Ca values are likely to impact other carbonate-bound proxies, highlighting the potential for calcium isotopes as a tool to better understand the variability of other isotope systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ca isotopes; Diagenesis; Earth history; Geochemical cycling; Paleo-environment; Proxy; δ44/40Ca; δ44/42Ca; δ44Ca","Biogeochemistry; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonate minerals; Earth (planet); Isotopes; Seawater; Sedimentology; Sediments; Space platforms; Biogeochemical cycle; Biogeochemical process; Carbonate mineralogies; Carbonate precipitation; Carbonate sediments; Mass extinction events; Ocean-atmosphere system; Precipitation rates; Carbonation; biogeochemical cycle; calcium; carbon cycle; carbonate platform; carbonate sediment; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077092225

Nitrogen fertilisation is an essential practice for the maintenance of pasture productivity, considering that a deficiency of this nutrient is a primary factor in triggering pasture degradation. In addition to directly influencing the photochemical and biochemical phases of photosynthesis, nitrogen stimulates enzyme activity and the synthesis of enzymes responsible for fixing CO2 (Rubisco in C3 plants and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in C4 plants), thus increasing the efficiency of atmospheric CO2 capture. All of these physiological processes are easily observed macroscopically in the characteristics of forage plants.

This mini-review considers the idea that conserved chemical modifications of wobble (U34) position tRNA uridines enable cells to sense nutrients and regulate their metabolic state. tRNA wobble uridines are chemically modified at the 2- and 5- positions, with a thiol (s2), and (commonly) a methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5) modification, respectively. These modifications reflect sulfur amino acid (methionine and cysteine) availability. The loss of these modifications has minor translation defects. However, they result in striking phenotypes consistent with an altered metabolic state. Using yeast, we recently discovered that the s2 modification regulates overall carbon and nitrogen metabolism, dependent on methionine availability. The loss of this modification results in rewired carbon (glucose) metabolism. Cells have reduced carbon flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway and instead increased flux towards storage carbohydrates—primarily trehalose, along with reduced nucleotide synthesis, and perceived amino acid starvation signatures. Remarkably, this metabolic rewiring in the s2U mutants is caused by mechanisms leading to intracellular phosphate limitation. Thus this U34 tRNA modification responds to methionine availability and integratively regulates carbon and nitrogen homeostasis, wiring cells to a ‘growth’ state. We interpret the importance of U34 modifications in the context of metabolic sensing and anabolism, emphasizing their intimate coupling to methionine metabolism. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Amino acid sensing; Metabolism; Methionine; Phosphate; S-adenosyl methionine; tRNA modification","amino acid; carbohydrate; carbon; carbonyl derivative; cysteine; methionine; methoxycarbonylmethyl; phosphate; thiol; transfer RNA; trehalose; unclassified drug; uridine; amino acid; nitrogen; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; transfer RNA; uridine; biosynthesis; carbon metabolism; cell metabolism; chemical modification; glucose metabolism; kwashiorkor; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; nutrient; pentose phosphate cycle; phenotype; priority journal; Review; wobble base pair; yeast; chemistry; genetics; growth, development and aging; homeostasis; metabolism; protein synthesis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acids; Carbon; Homeostasis; Nitrogen; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Transfer; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Uridine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075345932

A thorough understanding of how such substitutions affect reactive N losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cereal production systems in the North China Plain (a main livestock production region in China), is needed to achieve an environmental friendly and sustainable production. Based on a long-term field experiment, different manure/chemical fertilizer treatments were designed, i.e., non-fertilization control (CK), chemical fertilizers alone (NPK), and manure substitution for chemical N fertilizers (with equivalent N rate; NPKP, 50% N from pig manure; NPKC, 50% N from chicken manure). Crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), soil fertility, N losses, and GHG emissions were chosen as prominent indicators to evaluate the consequences of manure substitutions for N-based fertilizers. The replacement of synthetic fertilizers by livestock manure decreased NO3-N leaching and NH3 volatilization by 46.2% and 5.61–22.2%, respectively, while sustained the crop yields and improved NUE. However, both NPKP and NPKC treatments did not have any impact on N2O and CO2 mitigation. Compared with NPK, NPKC and NPKP meaningfully increased SOC by 9.56% and 19.6%, respectively. More specifically, NPKC increased TN content by 14.7% (P &lt; 0.05) compared to NPK treatment. The results showed that 50% substitution of manure for synthetic N fertilizers is a potential option in maize production systems to decrease N losses (including NH3, N2O emissions and N leaching) by approximately 45% (42.8–48.1%). However, only 1.81% of the total farmers surveyed (i.e., 16,595) have being applied livestock manure for maize cultivation in the North China Plain. Therefore, famers in this plain should be encouraged to use manure to improve ecological aspects of cereal cultivation and decrease the associated environmental pollutions. © 2020","GHG; Maize; Manure; North China Plain; Reactive N losses; Sustainable production","Ammonia; Crops; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Leaching; Mammals; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sustainable development; Environmental pollutions; Environmental-friendly; Long-term field experiments; Maize; N loss; Nitrogen-use efficiency; North China Plain; Sustainable production; Manures; ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; reactive nitrogen species; fertilizer; nitrogen; carbon emission; crop production; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; maize; manure; nitrogen; nutrient loss; sustainability; agricultural worker; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; crop production; environmental factor; field experiment; harvest; livestock; maize; manure; nitrate leaching; nonhuman; poultry manure; priority journal; soil fertility; swine manure; tillage; volatilization; agriculture; animal; greenhouse gas; livestock; maize; pig; soil; China; North China Plain; Suidae; Zea mays; Agriculture; Animals; China; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock; Manure; Nitrogen; Soil; Swine; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080043240

Subjects: One hundred patients who were admitted to the emergency department and seen to have an arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure above 45 mmHg were included as the study group and 48 healthy volunteers as the control group. Interventions: None Main outcome measures: Possible elevations in serum NSE and/or S100-β protein levels in the study group were main outcome measures. The levels of these markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits, and mean values of these parameters were compared between the study and the control groups. Results: Mean NSE level was found to be 69.45 ± 36.39 ng/ ml, and mean S100-β level was 160.57 ± 54.05 pg/ml in the study group. Mean NSE and S100-β levels of the control group were 30.99 ± 20.04 ng/ml and 129.31 ± 415.17 pg/ml, respectively. Mean NSE levels differed significantly between the study and control groups; however, mean S100-β levels did not. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that NSE can be used to predict CNS injury in patients with CO2 retention, but S100-β protein cannot.

The objective of this study is to implement a coupled hydrological-hydrogeological model under climate change scenarios in order to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of water balance and GW-SW interactions for the upper creek basin of Del Azul, which is located in the center of the province of Buenos Aires. The simulation was carried out for a baseline scenario calibrated and validated for the period 2003–2015 and contrasted with two scenarios of the regional climate model CCSM4, RCP (4.5 and 8.5) simulated for the period 2020–2050. First, the annual and monthly anomalies of precipitation, temperature, surface runoff, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, recharge, flow, as well as the discharge, head level and reserves of groundwater are studied. Then the spatio-temporal anomalies of the GW-SW interaction were analyzed and finally wet and dry periods by means of the standardized precipitation index and the annual water balance were studied. Simulation results show that climate change will significantly alter the spatio-temporal patterns of the GW-SW interaction as well as the water balance. These showed monthly, seasonal and annual variations. They show an increase in most of the components of the water balance towards the middle of the 21st century, except soil moisture. Regarding GW-SW interactions, the average annual discharge of the aquifer to the stream is expected to increase by 5% with RCP 4.5 while it will increase 24% with RCP 8.5. The recharge from the stream to the aquifer is expected to increase by 12% with RCP 4.5 while a decrease by 5% with RCP 8.5. Concerning the SPI related to the water balance for the period 2020–2050, alternations of both the time and the length of dry and wet periods are expected for the two scenarios, with RCP 4.5 low frequency of wet episodes, but with a greater severity and permanence in time in contrast to RCP 8.5 that presents less frequency in dry periods, but with high permanence and severity. Climate change could alter groundwater mainly through changes in the recharge, leading to modify groundwater levels and this will cause GW-SW flow to be reversed in some sectors of the stream by increasing or decreasing groundwater discharge into the stream. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Coupled numerical modeling; Plain areas; Stream-aquifer interaction; SWAT-MODFLOW coupling; Water balance","Aquifers; Climate models; Drought; Groundwater resources; Recharging (underground waters); Rivers; Runoff; Soil moisture; Surface water resources; Coupled numerical models; Plain areas; Stream-aquifer interaction; Swat-modflow; Water balance; Climate change; ground water; surface water; aquifer; climate change; climate effect; flow modeling; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydrogeology; numerical model; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; water budget; aquifer; Article; calibration; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; conceptual flow model; controlled study; dry season; dynamics; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; groundwater discharge; land use; mathematical analysis; physical parameters; plains; precipitation; priority journal; rainy season; recharge; regional climate model; seasonal variation; simulation; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; standardized precipitation index; stream (river); surface runoff; temperature; time; validation process; water flow; water interaction; water reserve; Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Del Azul Creek",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082115222

A field-emission scanning electron microscope was used to observe the morphology of the AAO template, which shows that the diameter of AAO template was 30 nm. TEM results confirm a thin oxide layer was formed on Fe NWs, confirming the core–shell nature of Fe NWs. The TEM analysis shows that with the increase in anodizing time, the oxide layer thickness was increased from 2.4, 4.6, 5.9 nm, respectively. The elemental composition of core–shell Fe NWs was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The oxide phase of Fe could not be easily distinguished by X-ray analysis, because of the line width broadening of nanocrystals; thus, the valence states of Fe in Fe@Fe2O3 and Fe@Fe3O4 NWs were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS results confirm the oxide nature of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 in core–shell Fe NWs. The influence of oxide layer thickness on the magnetic properties of core–shell Fe@Fe3O4 NWs was investigated by vibrating sample magnetometry. Magnetic measurement revealed that the coercivity and squareness values of core–shell Fe@Fe3O4 NWs gradually increased with the increase in the Fe3O4 shell thickness. Results clearly showed that the size and magnetism of the core–shell Fe@Fe3O4 NWs can be adjusted to a certain extent by this synthetic method, so as to meet different requirements in desired biomedical applications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AAO; Anodic oxidation; Core–shell; Magnetic hysteresis loops; Nanowires","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anodic oxidation; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Hematite; Magnetic properties; Magnetism; Magnetite; Medical applications; Nanowires; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray spectrometers; Anodic aluminum oxide; Biomedical applications; Elemental compositions; Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometers; Field emission scanning electron microscopes; Oxide layer thickness; Structural characterization; Vibrating sample magnetometry; Iron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085269920

However, in the assessment of the energy demand of the buildings, numerous factors are uncertain, i.e. layer thickness, material parameters, climatic conditions, etc. In the present study, mathematical model was developed for analyzing temperature distribution and heat flux in the wall with thermal conductivity of insulation as a random parameter. The results obtained employing a stochastic perturbation technique were compared against the results of the Monte Carlo simulation. Stochastic perturbation technique has been implemented using the tenth order Taylor series expansion. The direct differential method was used to determine the values of Taylor's coefficient. The obtained results indicate good accordance of the stochastic perturbation technique with the Monte Carlo method. Afterwards, the expected value of the heat flux and its variance were studied for the reference year for a city in the Central Europe. Two cases of the external wall were investigated, in which the thermal insulation was localized either on the internal or the external side of the wall. Performed analyses serve as a good method for assessing the reliability of results obtained using standard, deterministic approach. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Finite element method; Global warming; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Perturbation techniques; Stochastic systems; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Uncertainty analysis; Walls (structural partitions); Carbon dioxide emissions; Climatic conditions; Deterministic approach; Differential methods; Reliability of results; Stochastic finite element method; Stochastic perturbation technique; Taylor series expansions; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088432497

However, predicting ecosystem effects remains highly uncertain and governance responses to OA are not yet forthcoming. Adaptive governance can provide a means to deal with this uncertainty and we consider its application to the polycentric governance of adaptation responses to OA in Scotland, focussing on the aquaculture industry as a vulnerable sector. A workshop was used to develop potential responses to OA and to gain information about present and potential capacity for adaptive governance at national and regional levels. Scottish legislation, policy and planning documents were subsequently analysed to enable description of how governance and management arrangements constrain or enable adaptation responses. Legislative and policy analysis indicates convergence across emerging mechanisms in support of adaptive governance and identified interventions. Recent advances in climate change adaptation in Scotland promotes integration of adaptation into wider Scottish Government policy development and functions, based on iterative and collaborative processes across scales. Alongside this, new models of coastal and marine governance, including a partnership-led regional marine planning process and devolution of seabed management rights under Crown Estate Scotland, seek to advance new models of locally-led and learning-based planning and management which can support adaptation responses. However, adaptation measures at operational scale requires flexibility in the aquaculture licensing regime which is currently of low adaptive capacity. Further, expansion of the industry faces social and ecological constraints which limit spatial measures, and are complicated by uncertainty in predicting local OA effects. Expanding the use of holistic and co-operative management tools such as Aquaculture Management Areas could support adaptation across wider spatial scales. Better integration across policy and planning instruments is also needed to enhance adaptive capacity, including between climate change adaptation, marine planning and aquaculture planning and management. This could be enabled by establishing links between existing and proposed collaborative groups to enhance development of adaptation responses and through co-ordination of monitoring and review processes to promote learning across scales. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive governance; Aquaculture; Climate change adaptation; Ocean acidification","Acidification; Aquaculture; Ecosystems; Public policy; Adaptation to climate changes; Adaptive governance; Aquaculture industry; Aquaculture management; Climate change adaptation; Collaborative process; Ocean acidifications; Operative management; Climate change; adaptive management; aquaculture; climate change; governance approach; marine environment; ocean acidification; planning process; policy analysis; policy development; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082810901

Using 23 000 on-road remote sensing measurements of light-duty Euro 5 diesel vehicles in the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2018, VWG vehicles with the ""Dieselgate-affected""EA189 engine demonstrated anomalous NOx emission behavior between the pre- and post-Dieselgate periods which was not observed in other vehicle makes or models. These anomalous changes can be explained by voluntary VWG hardware and software fixes which have led to improved NOx emission control. The VGW 1.6 L vehicles, with a simple hardware fix and a software upgrade, resulted in a 36% reduction in NOx, whereas the 2.0 L vehicles that required a software-only fix showed a 30% reduction in NOx once controlled for ambient temperature effects.

Providing oxygen to breathe, watershed protection, erosion control, carbon storage, and opportunities for people to connect with nature. Science warns us that at the rate forests are being destroyed, humans will alter the planet so significantly, that many lives (human and other species) will be extirpated. Recognition of the true value of forests, for their carbon storage function, is driving global agreements and policies to promote emissions reductions from land use across all biomes, but particularly in the tropics. Sizable levels of financial support have been directed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, in the scope of USD 1.1-2.7 billion per year. But is this enough? This level of investment is still dwarfed by income from timber, agriculture, mining and palm oil cultivationdkey drivers of tropical forest loss. We describe opportunities for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, discuss risks in measuring emissions reductions and draw attention to key political, social and environmental challenges from a regional perspective of Southeast Asia; a region in the spotlight for the mass expansion of oil palm plantations and polluting wildfires. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, representations of silicate weathering used in current estimates of the effective outer edge of the HZ accounts for neither the thermodynamic limit on the concentration of weathering products in runoff set by clay precipitation nor the energetic limit on precipitation set by planetary instellation. We find that when the thermodynamic limit is included in an idealized coupled climate/weathering model, the steady-state planetary climate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming sensitive to temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to pCO2 through an effect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This increases sensitivity to land fraction, CO2 outgassing, and geological factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a profound effect on the position of the effective outer edge of the HZ. The interplay between runoff sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation leads to novel warm states in the outer reaches of the HZ, owing to the decoupling of temperature and precipitation. We discuss strategies for detecting the signature of the silicate weathering feedback through exoplanet observations in light of insights derived from the revised picture of weathering. © 2020.

This study presents the reaction of spore-bearing plants (liverworts and mosses) to the main thermal gradients in the snow-beds of the Tatra Mountains (Western Carpathians) and the mechanisms behind these response patterns. The results were based on direct, year-long temperature measurements in 47 permanent plots located at sites where the plant cover is formed largely by bryophytes. Data were gathered in 2010–2013 using Onset Hobo Pro v.2 temperature data loggers. Habitat variables i.e. seasonal snow cover duration (SCD), zero curtain period (ZC) and July mean ground surface temperature (MGST_VII) were determined using the ground surface temperature (GST) method. Additionally, the sum of potential incoming solar radiation in July (PISR_VII) was analysed on the basis of the localisation of permanent plots. Using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), we analysed the relationships between the species composition and the microclimatic variables. The generalised additive model (GAM) was employed to investigate the response curves of bryophyte species to snow parameters (SCD and ZC). Humidity (expressed as ZC temperature parameter) proved to have the highest impact on the distribution of bryophytes in snow-beds. Moreover, ground temperature in the vegetative season (in July, MGST_VII) and altitude had statistically significant effects. The responses of liverworts to microclimate gradients were more varied in comparison with those of the mosses. Humidity significantly affects the occurrence of the species of both groups in snow-beds. However, mosses respond to ground temperature (MGST_VII), whereas liverworts respond to SCD, and this distinguishes the niches of these groups. The ZC is a significant parameter affecting plant functional group composition, demonstrating a high relationship between cryptogamic plants and alpine climate.

The predicted changes of temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to alter the environmental conditions to which forest trees in Europe are adapted, and expose them to new pests and pathogens. This would unavoidably lead to a huge loss of ecosystem services provided to society, and at the local scale may potentially endanger the very existence of forests. In this study, we reviewed biological background and limits of mechanisms by which tree populations may cope with climate change: Adaptation by natural selection, gene flow, epigenetic phenomena and phenotypic plasticity, as well as forest management strategies, which rely on these mechanisms. We argue that maintaining genetic diversity is important in the long-term view but natural selection cannot ensure sufficiently rapid response to environmental change. On the other hand, epigenetic memory effects may change adaptively relevant traits within a single generation, while close-to-nature forestry practices are the basic requirement to make use of epigenetics. Assisted migration, as a frequently suggested mitigation option, relies primarily on the knowledge gained from provenance research; the review analyses potential pitfalls of this strategy. We suggest that all approaches, i.e., leaving a part of forests without management, close-to-nature forestry, and transfer of forest reproductive materials from sources presumably adapted to future climates are combined across the landscape in an integrative manner. © 2020 Dušan Gömöry et al., published by Sciendo.","adaptation; climate change mitigation; epigenetics; phenotypic plasticity; provenance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087860228

However, it is likely that ideological differences in climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy preferences are smaller when people have close friends and family members who care about climate change. Here, we use nine nationally representative survey samples (total N = 16,168) to evaluate this claim and test if perceived social consensus predicts a smaller difference in climate change beliefs between liberals and conservatives. We find that social consensus plays an important role in climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy preferences for people across the ideological spectrum, but especially among conservatives.

Most of this energy is conveyed by diesel engines. In Europe, release of NOx and particulate matter (PM) from shipping is expected to equal the road-transport one by the year 2020. This paper addresses a typical central Mediterranean city-port condition to evaluate the relative contribution of shipping activities to the local air quality. A 3-year long air quality dataset collected at the boundary between the port of Civitavecchia (the major port in central Italy) and the city itself was analyzed to evaluate the long-term, relative contribution of the port and of the city at determining the loads of EU-regulated pollutants (NO2, PM10 and SO2). In addition, black carbon and ultrafine-to-coarse particles data collected along a short-term, intensive campaign were used to assess the port's role at emitting these unregulated pollutants. Cross-analysis of the measurements, allowed to assess which shipping-related activities and port's sectors represent the principal emitters. At the city-port boundary, the annual share of regulated pollutants originating in the port area by shipping and ground movements is of 33% for PM10, 43% for NO2, and 60% for SO2. Analysis of non-regulated pollutants shows the in-port, high polluting potential of some ship categories, in particular those employing low-sulfur but poorly refined oils. These conditions appear to be more often associated with Ro-Ro passenger ships. Piers closest to the Civitavecchia urban settlements are also observed to host the largest emissions. Meteorology and location of the piers with respect to residential areas are confirmed to govern the port's share at impacting the city air quality. Even though air quality thresholds for regulated pollutants are not exceeded in Civitavecchia, constant consideration of an enlarged set of environmental variables should drive actions implemented to mitigate the port's impact onto the nearby city's air quality. © 2019 The Author(s)","Black carbon; Marine fuels; Port emissions; Port-city pollution; Ultra-fine particles","Digital storage; Marine pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Piers; Quality control; Ships; Black carbon; Central Mediterranean; Environmental variables; Marine fuels; Port city; Relative contribution; Ro-ro passenger ships; Ultrafine particle; Air quality; black carbon; fuel; nitrogen dioxide; oil; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; emission; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; port operation; shipping; air pollution; air pollution indicator; air quality; Article; city; controlled study; environmental impact; European Union; government regulation; information processing; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; meteorology; particle size; pollutant; priority journal; residential area; shipping; Southern Europe; urban area; Civitavecchia; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076566067

Vegetation is critical in regulating fluxes, providing a conduit for emissions and regular carbon inputs. However, plant roots also release oxygen, which might mitigate methane efflux through oxidation prior to emission from the peat surface. Here we show, using in situ mesocosms, that root exclusion can reduce methane fluxes by a maximum of 92% depending on species, likely driven by the significant decrease in root inputs of oxygen and changes in the balance of methane transport pathways. Methanotroph abundance decreased with reduced oxygen input, demonstrating a likely mechanism for the observed response. These first methane oxidation estimates for a tropical peatland demonstrate that although plants provide an important pathway for methane loss, this can be balanced by the influence of root oxygen inputs that mitigate peat surface methane emissions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Digital transformation projects are therefore in a unique position to realize the sustainable development agenda.Sustainability is a major social concern of our times and has been addressed extensively in the IS literature. Current discussions on sustainability are mainly following the United Nations report, focusing on goals around energy consumption, carbon footprint reduction and the like. We believe that a broad discussion on two fronts is needed: (1) ensuring that the development and use of information systems is in line with sustainability objectives, and (2) ensuring that th organization doesn't falls back to the old 'steady state' after transformation initiatives are completed. The first contribution of this paper is a holistic definition of sustainable digital transformation, based on an literature research. The second contribution is the development of a fractal sustainable object model and an exploration into the impact of this model on enterprise modeling in two small cases. The first case is about environmental accounting, the second on the enterprise engineering method. We consider this paper to be a first in a series.

Several policy measures have been implemented over the last decades to reduce EC emissions from anthropogenic sources, but still, long-term EC measurements to verify the efficacy of such measurements are limited. In this study, we analyze the concentration of EC suspended in fog water samples, collected over the period 1997-2016 in a rural background site of the southern Po Valley. The comparison between EC in fog water and EC atmospheric aerosol concentration measured since 2012 allowed us to reconstruct EC atmospheric concentration from fog water chemical composition dating back to 1997. The results agree with the EC atmospheric observations performed at the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP) station of Ispra in the northern part of the Po Valley since 2002, and confirm that the Po Valley is a pollution hotspot, not only in urban areas, but also in rural locations. The reconstructed trend over the period 1997-2016 indicates that EC concentration during the winter season has decreased on average by 4% per year, in agreement with the emission reduction rate, confirming the effectiveness of air quality measures implemented during the past 20 years. © 2020 by the author.

In recent years, multiple studies have sought to estimate the premature mortality burden from exposure to PM2.5 to inform policy decisions. However, different modeling choices have led to a wide array of results, with significant discrepancies both in the total mortality burden and in the confidence intervals. Here, we present a new comprehensive assessment of PM2.5-related mortality for China, which includes quantification of the main sources of variability, as well as of age and province-specific premature mortality trends during 2015-2018. Our approach integrates PM2.5 observations from more than 1600 monitoring stations with the output of a high-resolution (8 km) regional simulation, to accurately estimate PM2.5 fields along with their uncertainty, which is generally neglected. We discuss the sensitivity of mortality estimates to the choice of the exposure-response functions (ERFs), by comparing the widely used integrated exposure response functions (IERs) to the recently developed Global Exposure Mortality Models (GEMMs). By propagating the uncertainty in baseline mortalities, PM2.5 and ERFs under a Monte Carlo framework, we show that the 95% confidence intervals of mortality estimates are considerably wider than previously reported. We thus highlight the need for more epidemiological studies to constrain ERFs and we argue that uncertainty related to PM2.5 estimate should be also incorporated in health impact assessment studies. Although the overall mortality burden remains vast in China (∼1.6 million premature deaths, according to GEMMs), our results suggest that 200 000 premature deaths were avoided and 195 billion US dollars were saved in 2018 compared to 2015, bolstering the mounting evidence about the effectiveness of China's air quality policies. © 2020 The Author(s).

The broad contours of the agricultural production system in the country have been defined by the need to achieve food security which calls for close attention to rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system of the Indo- Gangetic Plains (IGP) whose sustainability is under threat. Degradation of natural resources, severe biotic and abiotic stresses specially drought, floods, pest infestations with accompanying impacts on biodiversity and agricultural productivity are the major constraints to agricultural development. Further, climate change has gained significant global attention over the past decade due to concerns of deleterious long-term impacts on agriculture, water supply, human welfare, regional and political stability. All the related issues need to be addressed on priority, with particular emphasis on soil-carbon through a holistic approach. As the strategy brings focus on income of farmers, the agricultural technology needs to move from “Production oriented-Green Revolution” to “Farmer’s Income oriented- Revolution” and environmentally sustainable farming. Therefore, for long-term sustainability in agriculture, 4 pillars/ components (good agricultural practices, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, diversification of highvalue crops and biodiversity management) needs to be addressed properly, more importantly good agricultural practices (GAP). The GAPs are based on the principles of risk prevention, risk analysis, sustainable agriculture, and integrated crop management (ICM), which are of utmost importance in present time. The GAPs for agricultural sustainability are reduced tillage, conservation agriculture, resource-conservation technologies (RCTs), erosioncontrol measures, diversified cropping system, micro-irrigation, balanced fertilization, manuring, watershed management, organic farming, and integrated farming systems etc. Now that the vision is to impart income security to the farmers of the country, diversification of the system across all the sub-sectors of agriculture assumes importance which is, indeed a de-risking mechanism capable of negotiating both endogenous and exogenous risks associated with the system. The effective and efficient management of agro-biodiversity is also essential through management of genebanks, science-led innovations; livelihood, food and nutrition security though crop diversification, use of lesser-known crops and wild relatives in crop improvement; dealing appropriately with quarantine, biosafety and bio-security. © 2020, Indian Society of Agronomy.

Additionally, a second objective was to identify the potential contribution of the office building stock in relation to New Zealand's 2050 climate change mitigation target. For this purpose, the study used Life Cycle Assessment in conjunction with stock aggregation modelling. The impacts of the building stock were calculated for non- refurbished building stock; refurbished building stock; refurbished building stock adopting resource and waste management measures and; refurbished building stock installed with photovoltaic panels. The results highlight the achievability of New Zealand's 2050 target in the office-building sector with a potential to reduce 40–98 % CO2 eq. emissions. Use of photovoltaic substantially increases the resource demand of refurbished buildings. Prioritizing the refurbishment of the building stock by adopting efficient resource use and waste management measures can contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without increasing environmental pressures from resource demand. Moreover, prioritizing refurbishment activities in major cities and/or in large buildings can be an effective measure to achieve 2050 target but not at the cost of increasing other environmental impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock aggregation; Climate change mitigation; Deep energy; Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Photo-voltaic; Refurbishment; Resource management","Climate change; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural resources management; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Restoration; Waste management; Building stocks; Climate change mitigation; Deep energy; Photovoltaics; Refurbishment; Resource management; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082330699

Linear programming (LP) finds the optimal capacities of DG units. Compared to commonly used artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which are computationally expensive, the proposed method is more efficient for finding the optimal capacity of DGs in large distribution systems.

This study aimed to review and summarise the findings from studies that have evaluated the effect of orthotic materials on plantar pressures. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of experimental studies that evaluated the effect of foot orthotic materials or shoe insole materials on plantar pressures using in-shoe testing during walking. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and SPORTDiscus. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality using a modified Quality Index. Peak pressure, pressure-time integral, maximum force, force-time integral, contact area, and contact time were variables of interest. Data were synthesised descriptively as studies were not sufficiently homogeneous to conduct meta-analysis. Standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) were calculated to provide the size of the effect between materials found in each study. Results: Five studies were identified as meeting the eligibility criteria. All five studies were laboratory-based and used a repeated measures design. The quality of the studies varied with scores ranging between 20 and 23 on the modified Quality Index (maximum index score 28). The included studies investigated the effects of polyurethane (including PORON®), polyethylene (including Plastazote®), ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) and carbon graphite on plantar pressures. Polyurethane (including PORON®), polyethylene (including Plastazote®) and EVA were all found to reduce peak pressure. Conclusion: Based on the limited evidence supplied from the five studies included in this review, some orthotic materials can reduce plantar pressures during walking. Polyurethane (including PORON®), polyethylene (including Plastazote®) and EVA reduce peak pressure beneath varying regions of the foot. Future well-designed studies will strengthen this evidence. © 2020 The Author(s).","Biomechanics; Foot; Kinetics; Orthoses; Orthosis; Orthotic device; Plantar pressure","adult; aged; biomechanics; equipment design; female; foot; foot orthosis; human; male; middle aged; physiology; plantar plate; pressure; walking; weight bearing; Adult; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Equipment Design; Female; Foot; Foot Orthoses; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plantar Plate; Pressure; Walking; Weight-Bearing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086425185

The region includes the southernmost extent of mangroves, over 500 estuaries and coastal embayments, home to extensive meadows of seagrasses and tidal saltmarsh. In areas of hard substrate, rocky reefs are abundant and productive with large forests of macroalgae. Coastal regions can be densely populated by humans and often habitats can be degraded, polluted or lost, while some remain relatively isolated and pristine. These habitats provide services to society including provision of food, regulate our climate through sequestration of carbon, treating our waste and protecting our shorelines from damage from storms. Coastal areas are culturally importantly hubs for recreation and tourism. Habitat mapping demonstrates diverse habitats throughout temperate Australia, but a formal investigation of services provided by these habitats has been lacking. This review of ecosystem services provided by coast and marine environments throughout temperate Australia reveals vast and productive ecosystems that provide multiple ecosystem services, substantial value to the Australian economy and contribute to the health and well-being of people who live in, visit of benefit from services or products from these regions. Some of these are considered within traditional economic metrics such as provision of wild catch fisheries, but this review demonstrates that regulation and maintenance services including waste treatment and protecting shorelines from extreme events are under recognized, and their value is substantial. However, consistent with many locations globally, coast and marine habitats are under threat from increasing development, sewage, agricultural, industrial discharges, urban runoff and climate change. Resultantly, temperate Australian coast and marine habitat extent and condition is generally declining in many regions, putting the provision of services and benefits to the community at risk. Continued degraded or lost habitats indicate current management frameworks are not capturing the full risk from development and there are winners and losers in trade off decision making. Incorporating ecosystem services in decision making may allow an integrated approach to management, and acknowledgment of services provided could prevent habitats from being undervalued against economic and social interests, a practice that often results in environmental degradation. © Copyright © 2020 Gaylard, Waycott and Lavery.","decision-making; ecological sustainable development; ecosystem services; trade off; value",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087524155

These indicators are encoded in different forms of oral knowledge. We explore whether people recognize and perceive as accurate one type of such forms of oral knowledge, climate-related proverbs. We conducted research in the Alta Alpujarra Occidental, Sierra Nevada, Spain. We collected locally recognized proverbs and classified them according to whether they referred to the climatic, the physical, or the biological system. We then conducted questionnaires (n = 97) to assess informant’s ability to recognize a selection of 30 locally relevant proverbs and their perception of the accuracy of the proverb. Climate-related proverbs are abundant and relatively well recognized even though informants consider that many proverbs are not accurate nowadays. Although proverbs’ perceived accuracy varied across informant’s age, level of schooling, and area of residence, overall proverb’s lack of reported accuracy goes in line with climate change trends documented by scientists working in the area. While our findings are limited to a handful of proverbs, they suggest that the identification of mismatches and discrepancies between people’s reports of proverb (lack of) accuracy and scientific assessments could be used to guide future research on climate change impacts. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Andalucía (Spain); Climate change impacts; Ethnoclimatology; Indigenous and local knowledge; Proverbs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084419120

With this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, driven by two global climate models (CCSM4 and MPI-ESM-LR) previously bias-corrected, was used to generate high-resolution climate information. Simulations were carried out for two periods, 1980–2014 and 2071–2100, and under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The analysis focused on changes in land-surface processes, their causes, and the potential impact on the climate system. To achieve this, seasonal projected changes of land-surface (soil moisture and surface evapotranspiration) and atmospheric variables involved in the hydrologic (i.e., precipitation and runoff) and energy balance (i.e., temperature and solar incoming radiation) were investigated. The results reveal that the IP is likely to experience a soil dryness by the end of the 21st century, particularly during summer and fall, more apparent in the southern IP, and stronger under the RCP8.5. However, such trends would have different implications throughout the year and directly affect the surface evapotranspiration. Moreover, soil-drying trends are mainly associated with reductions in the large-scale precipitation during spring, summer, and fall and by enhanced evapotranspiration particularly in spring over the northwestern IP. In addition, the results show notably changes in soil conditions at high altitude, particularly during winter, which may alter the land-atmosphere processes that currently occur in these regions. In this context, noteworthy changes in the climate system are expected, leading to adverse impacts on water resources and temperature. The results highlight the complex and nonlinear nature of land-atmosphere interactions in regions such as the IP, which is a tremendous challenge for adequately developing mitigation and adaptation strategies to anthropogenic climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate-change projections; Iberian Peninsula; Land-surface coupling; Soil moisture; Surface evapotranspiration; Weather Research and Forecasting","Climate models; Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture; Surface measurement; Weather forecasting; Climate change projections; Iberian Peninsula; Land surface; Surface evapotranspiration; Weather research and forecasting; Climate change; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; climate change; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; future prospect; land surface; soil moisture; weather forecasting; altitude; article; atmosphere; climate change; energy balance; evapotranspiration; forecasting; global climate; precipitation; runoff; simulation; soil moisture; soil treatment; spring; summer; water availability; weather; winter; Iberian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081662552

The laboratory catalyst is more active in both CO2 methanation (equilibrium is reached at 623 K with 100% selectivity) and methane steam reforming (92% hydrogen yield at 890 K) than the two commercial catalysts, likely due to its higher nickel loading. In any case, commercial steam reforming catalysts also show interesting activity in CO2 methanation, reduced by K-doping. The interpretation of the experimental results is supported by a one-dimensional (1D) pseudo-homogeneous packed-bed reactor model, embedding the Xu and Froment local kinetics, with appropriate kinetic parameters for each catalyst. In particular, the H2O adsorption coefficient adopted for the commercial catalysts is about two orders of magnitude higher than for the laboratory-made catalyst, and this is in line with the expectations, considering that the commercial catalysts have Ca and K added, which may promote water adsorption. © 2020 by the authors.

Climate, environmental, and economic policy can each individually impact the effectiveness of other policies in the process of implementation. Understanding synergies among policy measures and identifying the co-benefits of environmental sustainable development generated by them is the focus of the paper. Because of existing restrictions in current research methods, the research community lacks the capacity to detect the interrelation among environmental, economic, and social development. Co-benefit research has gradually become an important area on sustainable development. Based on endogenous economic growth theory, we build a modified endogenous growth model to determine the optimal rates of economic growth, environmental pollution, energy input, and other factors in the context of co-benefits. Further empirical analysis is given which is missing in previous studies in this field. The empirical analysis reveals that China’s actual GDP, consumption, energy input, and physical capital growth rates are much higher than the optimal growth rate. However, the human capital and environmental pollution control growth rates are slower than the optimal values. Although China has a rapid growth in economy, the optimal level of comprehensive co-benefits has not been reached yet. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Climate change; Co-benefits; Endogenous economic growth; Environmental protection","climate change; detection method; economic growth; economic policy; empirical analysis; endogenous growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; human capital; pollution control; Sustainable Development Goal; synergism; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072098002

Conservationists had bitterly opposed the continued logging of these natural areas while the Forest Service relied on unlogged roadless lands to supply a beleaguered timber industry. The clash was particularly noteworthy in the Pacific Northwest, home of most of the remaining intact forests, following immediately on the heels of the spotted owl crisis that was resolved in favor of conservation interests to severely limit further clearcutting of oldgrowth forests. The Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001) again resolved a consequential issue in favor of conservation interests by limiting commercial logging and roadbuilding in roadless areas. Lengthy litigation followed, culminating in 2013 when the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals supported the Rule. A notable but unexpected outcome of this dramatic policy shift is a significant increase in stored forest carbon following logging reductions. Such carbon gains team with other ""free"" environmental services like clean water and air, and high quality wildlife and fish habitat to illustrate important noncommercial forest values. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Especially the taxi sector is a promising field of application. First, their high driving distances are necessary for electric vehicles to economize against conventional vehicles. Second, taxis are operated predominantly in city centers, where the pressure to reduce local emissions is greatest. However, while the electrification potential of taxi fleets has gained great attention in literature, the question of whether charging infrastructure can be profitable if only used by taxis has not been answered yet. To answer this question, we analyze 161 taxis in Karlsruhe, Germany. We find that a high share of electric taxis would come at lower cost than their diesel counterparts. Thus, a 25-45% share of taxi driving could be electrified, if only the taxi user perspective would be taken into account. However, while ten charging sites would be necessary to do so, only one charging site could be refinanced through exclusive taxi use. Consequently, the electrification potential would fall to about 3%, if only this one profitable charging site was built. Yet, in the future, electric driving will become cheaper. In 2025, already 55% electrification potential would be possible, given that both electric driving and charging infrastructure operation would be profitable. Altogether, while currently taxi charging infrastructure would require public funding or other business models, in the medium to long term, an exclusive use by taxis would be sufficient. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Charging infrastructure; electric vehicle; taxi; total cost of ownership","Charging (batteries); Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Profitability; Business models; Charging infrastructures; City centers; Driving distance; Local emissions; Public funding; Taxi fleets; User perspectives; Taxicabs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086889635

To this end, national and international guidance on energy effciency for historic buildings advocate for the adoption of a 'whole house approach' that integrates heritage values in energy effciency plans. Most guidance, though, relies on non-evidence based, pre-assumptions of residents' heritage values. And yet, unless we understand how and why residents negotiate their decisions between energy effciency, thermal comfort, and heritage conservation, such guidance will not be applicable. Despite the urgency to decarbonize the building stock, research on how inhabitants of old buildings make such decisions is extremely limited. It is also case-study specific, often lacking the required depth. To address this gap, this paper offers the first international, in-depth study on the topic. It does so through a rigorous double-coded, thematic analysis of 59 in-depth semi-structured interviews (totaling 206,771 words) carried out in Greece, Mexico, and the UK. The thematic analysis is combined with system dynamic analysis, essential for unveiling what parameters affect inhabitants' decisions over time. Drawing on theories on the dynamics of social practices, we conclude that the process of decision-making on energy effciency, thermal comfort improvement, and heritage conservation is a socio-cultural, dynamic practice, the change and continuation of which depends on how the following elements are connected or disconnected: materials (e.g., original features), competencies (e.g., restoration skills), resources (e.g., costs), values, space/environment (e.g., natural light), senses (e.g., thermal comfort), and time (e.g., years living in the house). The connection or disconnection of those elements will depend on (a) the nature of the context (e.g., rural, urban, conservation area); (b) the listing status; (c) age and construction materials of building; (d) local climate; and (e) ownership status. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision-making; Energy effciency; Heritage conservation; Heritage values; Historic building; Original features; Social practices; System dynamics; Thermal comfort","Air navigation; Building materials; Buildings; Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Thermal comfort; Comfort improvement; Conservation areas; Heritage conservation; Historic buildings; Semi structured interviews; Social practices; Thematic analysis; Unintended consequences; Historic preservation; cultural relations; decision making; energy efficiency; heritage conservation; historic building; systems analysis; theoretical study; Greece; Mexico [North America]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086896398

I argue that storytelling allows cartographers to decide on basic map design elements by narrowing the focus of a map. First, cartographers decide on the driving story. The story is then used as a guide for every design decision, from what data to search for and use to the design of symbolism within the map. This research focuses on the case of climate change communication in the United States. Empirical evidence based on interviews with map-makers at major media organizations and government agencies creating maps of climate change illustrates how storytelling as a process provided these cartographers with a way to effectively convey the multidimensional and complex impacts of climate change across multiple scales.

The present study sought to test the hypothesis that systematic differences in fluid composition led to the differences in scale of mineralization. To conduct this test, fluid inclusions in trace MVT occurrences were characterized and compared to previously characterized fluid inclusions in mid-continent MVT ore deposits. Primary sphalerite-hosted fluid inclusions in trace MVT occurrences from across the U.S. mid-continent were analyzed using microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentile) of trace MVT fluid inclusion properties were found to be as follows: homogenization temperature = 78 to 107 °C, salinity = 13.8 to 23.9 equivalent weight percent NaCl, atomic ratios of K/Na = 0.017 to 0.038, Ca/Na = 0.18 to 0.31, Mg/Na = 0.0081 to 0.013, Sr/Na = 0.0093 to 0.015, Ba/Na = 0.00013 to 0.00041. Compared to MVT ore deposits, fluid inclusions in trace MVT occurrences have lower homogenization temperatures and K/Na and Ba/Na ratios, similar salinities and Ca/Na and Sr/Na ratios, and slightly higher Mg/Na ratios (excluding Mg-rich fluid inclusions from the Upper Mississippi Valley district). In addition, fluid inclusions in trace MVT occurrences have low to undetectable methane contents whereas MVT ore deposits have high methane concentrations on the order of 100's to 1000's of ppm. Sphalerite matrix trace metal concentrations of trace MVT occurrences generally overlap those of MVT ore deposits. Differences in elemental concentrations and temperature between trace MVT and MVT ore-forming fluids are insufficient to account for the differences in deposit size. This suggests that differences in the local availability of sulfide, which could not be measured in this study but may correspond with the large observed differences in methane content, may have governed MVT deposit size. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical composition; Fluid inclusion; Mid-continent; Mississippi Valley-type; Sphalerite; Trace mineralization","Deposits; Landforms; Laser ablation; Mass spectrometry; Methanation; Methane; Ore deposits; Ores; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Zinc sulfide; Chemical compositions; Fluid inclusion; Mid-continent; Mississippi; Sphalerite; Trace mineralization; Mineralogy; concentration (composition); fluid composition; fluid inclusion; geochemistry; mineralization; Mississippi Valley-type deposit; ore deposit; ore-forming fluid; sphalerite; trace metal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081663352

This applies to large scale deployments and on smaller to more intermediate scale sites. Data centres consume large quantities of energy and contribute to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Reducing CO2output using methods such as sustainable power generation and better energy efficiency can help mitigate against the effects of global warming. This paper proposes methods of saving energy in IT equipment by monitoring key power statistics such as power factor to determine the efficiency of the power being used by network equipment. This is achieved using an open-source power factor meter which is not only low cost but also accurate. The meter measures power factor as well as true power, apparent power, reactive power, mains voltage, current, and mains frequency to determine the energy efficiency of the installation or equipment. Readings are measured using three primary sensors; a current transformer, voltage transformer, and a mains frequency sensor. The system is designed for use with single-phase systems and incorporates a local HMI and a cloud-based CMS system. All of the software and hardware elements used are open source and therefore low cost. © 2020 IEEE.","Central Monitoring System; Current Transformer; Human Machine Interface; Message Queuing Telemetry Transport; Power Factor; Voltage Transformer","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power factor; Electric transformers; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Open source software; Carbon dioxide emissions; IT infrastructures; Large-scale deployment; Power factor meter; Single phase system; Software and hardwares; Sustainable power generation; Voltage transformer; Open systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092705824

As an example of low-intensity systems, the article will focus on olive land use dynamics occurring at different temporal and spatial scales in the island of Sicily. Sicilian olive intercropping systems have resulted in the formation of heterogeneous cultural landscapes and heritage that supports place-based and practice-based know-how, drawing on transmitted and new knowledge-what we call Biocultural Heritage. The domestication and continuous careful management of these trees by locals have been a crucial element for their longevity: they can thus be seen as stabilities in a changing landscape along time and space. The article crosscuts history and spatiality at different scales to allow the olive trees of Sicily to ""talk"" about their millennial entanglements with the other elements of local ecosystems, man included. Considered biocultural refugia able to preserve both agricultural biodiversity and traditional ecological knowledge, their social and ecological history is explored through the identification of breaking points in time and spatial nodes of connection. Such enduring landscapes are increasingly under threat due to climate change and intense land abandonment; their progressive fragmentation represents a huge threat for their ecological complexity, agricultural practices, biocultural heritage and socio- economic conditions of local communities.

As it is difficult to estimate the benefits of climate action in the short term due to often costly solutions, Smart City proposals could provide the economic incentive to create adaptive, energy-efficient, and sustainable societies. As the need for adaptive and resilient cities in the global context of climate change rises, the concept of Smart City might need to evolve into that of a Smart Sustainable City, positioning the environment at the core of its development. Results from this analysis suggest that the interaction between technology and nature can be enhanced when a Smart City approach promotes the integration of climate strategies and encourages the participation of citizens, something that is crucial since early adaptation efforts can safeguard smart infrastructure from climate impacts. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Environment; Smart Cities; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098606640

The North China Plain (NCP) is a highly populated and relevant agricultural region in China, experiencing some of the highest ozone (O3) concentrations worldwide. It produces ~24% of the total maize production of China in years 2014–2017. For these years, we used observational O3 data in combination with geostatistic methods to estimate county-level production and economic losses due to O3 in the NCP. AOT40 (accumulated ozone exposure over an hourly threshold of 40 ppb) values during the maize growing season (90 days before maturity) progressively increased in the four consecutive years: 13.7 ppm h, 15.4 ppm h, 16.9 ppm h and 22.7 ppm h. Mean relative yield losses were 8.2% in 2014, 9.2% in 2015, 10.4% in 2016 and 13.4% in 2017. These yield losses, derived from exposure-response functions, resulted in crop production losses of 530.3 × 104 t, 617.8 × 104 t, 713.8 × 104 t, and 953.4 × 104 t, as well as economic losses of 2343 million USD, 2672 million USD, 1887 million USD, and 2404 million USD from 2014 to 2017. The NCP is a key area in China for monitoring the effectiveness of the clean air action policies aiming at reducing emissions of air pollutants. Despite these measures, O3 concentrations have increased in NCP, and reduction of this pollutant are challenging. We suggest an increase in the number of rural air quality stations for better characterizing O3 trends in cropland areas, as well as the application of different mitigation measures. They may involve more stringent air quality regulations and changes in crops, breeding tolerant cultivars and a crop management taking into account O3 pollution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Economic loss; Maize; O3; Phenology; Yield loss","Air pollution; Air quality; Cultivation; Losses; Ozone; Plants (botany); Air quality regulations; Economic loss; Maize; Maize growing season; Mitigation measures; Phenology; Reducing emissions; Yield loss; Crops; ozone; ozone; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; geostatistics; maize; ozone; phenology; pollution monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; crop production; cropland; economic aspect; economic loss; environmental exposure; environmental policy; growing season; maize; plant yield loss; priority journal; China; North China Plain; Zea mays; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Ozone; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082104184

Recent seafloor drilling by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) provides an opportunity to study the transition across a larger region as archived in the Indus submarine fan. We present a multiproxy study of past vegetation change based on analyses of the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of bulk organic carbon, plant wax n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, and quantification of lignin phenols, charcoal, and pollen. We analyze the hydrogen isotopic composition (δD) of plant wax to reconstruct precipitation δD. We use the Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index to diagnose shifts between terrestrial versus marine lipid inputs between turbidite and hemipelagic sediments. We reconstruct ocean temperatures using the TEX86 index only where marine lipids dominate. We find evidence for the late Miocene grassland expansion in both facies, confirming this was a regional ecosystem transformation. Turbidites contain dominantly terrestrial matter from the Indus catchment (D-depleted plant wax), delivered via fluvial transport as shown by the presence of lignin. In contrast, hemipelagic sediments lack lignin and bear D-enriched plant wax consistent with wind-blown inputs from the Indian peninsula; these show a 7.4–7.2 Ma expansion of C4 grasslands on the Indian subcontinent. Within each facies, we find no clear change in δD values across the late Miocene C4 expansion, implying consistent distillation of rainfall by monsoon dynamics. Yet, a cooling in the Arabian Sea is coincident with the C4 expansion. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

In addition to the results for individual objects, we compared these characteristics with the bulk properties of other populations of the trans-Neptunian region.

This study predicts TC wind hazard curves in terms of design wind speed versus return periods for major coastal cities of China to facilitate TC-wind-resistant design and disaster mitigation as well as insurance-related risk assessment. The 10 min wind information provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) from 1977 to 2015 is employed to rebuild TC wind field parameters (radius of maximum winds Rmax's and shape parameter of radial pressure profile Bs) at surface level using a height-resolving boundary layer model. These parameters will be documented to develop an improved JMA dataset. The probabilistic behaviors of historical tracks and wind field parameters at the first time step within a 500 km radius subregion centered at a site of interest are examined to determine preferable probability distribution models before stochastically generating correlated genesis parameters utilizing the Cholesky decomposition method. Recursive models are applied for translation speed, Rmax;s and Bs during the TC track and wind field simulations. Site-specific TC wind hazards are studied using 10 000-year Monte Carlo simulations and compared with code suggestions as well as other studies. The resulting estimated wind speeds for northern cities (Ningbo and Wenzhou) under a TC climate are higher than code recommendations, while those for southern cities (Zhanjiang and Haikou) are lower. Other cities show a satisfactory agreement with code provisions at the height of 10 m. Some potential reasons for these findings are discussed to emphasize the importance of independently developing hazard curves of TC winds. © 2020 Author(s).",,"boundary layer; coastal zone; data set; estimation method; hazard assessment; Monte Carlo analysis; tropical cyclone; wind velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086244306

We aim to determine the properties of the central region of NGC 1052 using X-ray and radio data. NGC 1052 (z  =  0.005) has been investigated for decades in different energy bands and shows radio lobes and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Methods. We used X-ray images from Chandra and radio images from Very Large Array to explore the morphology of the central area. We also studied the spectra of the nucleus and the surrounding region using observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. Results. We find diffuse soft X-ray radiation and hot-spots along the radio lobes. The spectrum of the circum-nuclear region is well described by a thermal plasma (T  ∼  0.6 keV) and a power law with photon index Γ  ∼  2.3. The nucleus shows a hard power law (Γ  ∼  1.4) modified by complex absorption. A narrow iron Kα line is also clearly detected in all observations, but there is no evidence for relativistic reflection. Conclusions. The extended emission is consistent with originating from extended jets and from jet-triggered shocks in the surrounding medium. The hard power-law emission from the nucleus and the lack of relativistic reflection supports the scenario of inefficient accretion in an advection-dominated accretion flow. © ESO 2020.","Galaxies: jets; Galaxies: nuclei; X-rays: galaxies","X rays; Active galactic nuclei; Advection-dominated accretion flows; Photon index; Radio images; Soft x-ray radiation; Surrounding regions; Thermal plasma; Very large arrays; Luminance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089175594

In butterflies, the needs of larval stages are often the most specialised part of the life-cycle, but for many species information on this is lacking. The Mountain Ringlet Erebia epiphron is a cold-adapted butterfly found in alpine grasslands in mountainous regions of Europe. Efforts to devise conservation strategies for this climate change-threatened species are hampered due to its basic ecology being poorly understood. Here, we describe a study on the autecology of Mountain Ringlets at sites across its British distribution, focusing on the habitat preferences of egg-laying females as a proxy for larval preferences. Female Mountain Ringlets placed their eggs predominantly on Nardus stricta and Festuca ovina, but also on several other host plant species, suggesting larvae may be more broadly polyphagous than previously realised. Sites chosen for eggs had higher abundance of larval host plants, intermediate leaf litter cover, and lower cover of grass tussocks than random locations, as well as a shorter and sparser grass sward. Although the main host plant is ubiquitous in upland areas of Britain, our findings suggest that this butterfly’s egg and larval stages have specialised ecological requirements, requiring specific microhabitat features characterised by a narrow range of vegetation composition and structural characteristics. Many habitat associations are liable to be explicable as adaptations to ensure placement of eggs and larvae in sites within optimal (warm or buffered) microclimates. We tentatively suggest that the distribution of Mountain Ringlets in the landscape is thermally-constrained. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conservation; Habitat preferences; Sheep grazing; Uplands","alpine environment; autecology; butterfly; community composition; conservation management; grassland; habitat selection; microclimate; mountain region; oviposition; site selection; vegetation structure; United Kingdom; Coenonymphina; Erebia epiphron; Festuca ovina; Nardus stricta; Ovis aries; Papilionoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082774924

This study developed, psychometrically assessed, and validated an instrument to measure recovery climate and culture. Methods: Organizational theory and an evidence-based conceptualization of mental health recovery guided instrument development. Items from existing instruments were reviewed and adapted, and new items were developed as needed. All items were rated by recovery experts. A 35-item instrument was pilot-tested and administered to a national sample of mental health staff in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRCs). Analysis entailed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and inter-item reliability and scale correlation assessment. Blinded site visits to four PRRCs were performed to validate the instrument. Results: The EFA determined a seven-factor solution for the data. The factors identified were staff expectations, values, leadership, rewards, policies, education and training, and quality improvement. Seven items did not meet retention criteria and were dropped from the final instrument. The instrument exhibited good internal consistency (Cronbach's a=0.81; subscales, a=0.84-0.88). Scale correlations were between 0.16 and 0.61, well below the threshold (a=0.9) for indicating overlapping constructs. Site visitors validated the instrument by correctly identifying high-scoring and low-scoring centers. Conclusions: These findings provide a psychometrically tested and validated instrument for measuring recovery climate and culture in mental health programs. This instrument can be used in evaluation of mental health services to determine the extent to which programs possess the organizational precursors that drive recovery-oriented service delivery. © 2020 American Psychiatric Association.

This study applied linear optimization to develop a GHGE-reduced, nutritionally adequate, and affordable school lunch menu. The effects on food waste, consumption and pupils' satisfaction with the meals were evaluated. Methods: A pre-post design was employed to assess the effects of implementing an optimized lunch menu on daily food waste, consumption, and pupils' school meal satisfaction in three schools (grades 0-9) from one Swedish municipality. A food list containing amounts, prices, nutrient content, and GHGE-values of all foods used for a previously served (baseline) four-week lunch menu was created. Using linear programming, this food list was optimized for minimum deviation and constrained to ensure nutritional adequacy and a reduced climate impact. The optimized food list was developed into a new (intervention) four-week lunch menu by a professional meal planner, following the baseline menu as closely as possible. The baseline and intervention menus were served for four weeks, respectively, with a two week break in between. Prepared, wasted and leftover food were weighed daily by the school kitchen staff during both periods. Interrupted time series analysis assessed mean and slope differences in daily food waste and consumption between the two periods. School lunch satisfaction was assessed with an online questionnaire at baseline and during the intervention. Results: Optimization resulted in a food list that was 40% lower in GHGE, met all nutrient recommendations for school meals, and cost 11% less compared to baseline. The intervention menu was served as planned, with only minor changes required (for practical reasons). Plate waste, serving waste, consumption and school lunch satisfaction did not differ significantly from baseline, in any of the schools. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that school meals can successfully be improved regarding health and environmental sustainability using linear optimization, without negative effects on food waste, consumption or cost. This approach offers the necessary flexibility to tailor menus towards different priorities and could therefore be transferred to other types of meal services.

Food availability is a main factor to support sustainable agricultural activities. Concrete efforts are urged to support the Indonesian government targets to become the world food basket by 2045. Extreme climate events leading to climate related hazards such as floods and drought that significantly impact negatively planting area, harvesting, and production must be addressed so the risks can be minimized. Vulnerability and risk assessment of climate impacts on food farming system are completed to provide information on the vulnerability level in each district/city to determine contributing factors that influence the vulnerability level. Data on climate, land, and water resources as well as socio economic were selected to represent the indicators for vulnerability assessment. The indicators were grouped into Exposure and Sensitivity Index-Indeks Keterpaparan dan Sensitivitas (IKS) and Adaptation Capacity Index-Indeks Kapasitas Adaptasi (IKA). The vulnerability and risk assessments to floods for Sulawesi Island explain that there are about 8% of districts/cities grouped into the level of very high category and about 17% of the districts/cities grouped into the level of high category. As for the vulnerability and risk to drought, the assessments show that about 1% of districts/cities are included into the level of extreme high category, about 8% grouped into the level of very high category, and about 17% classified into the level of high category. The contributing factors to the IKA are the length of the road based on surface conditions and the ratio of the number of farmer groups per paddy area. The IKS dominant determinants that must be addressed are climate. The level of vulnerability and determinant factors are useful to assist in preparing strategies and recommended programs of adaptation actions compounded with priority districts/cities whose levels of vulnerability are categorized into high, very high, and extreme high. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Crops; Drought; Economics; Extreme weather; Floods; Landforms; Water resources; Adaptation strategies; Contributing factor; Determinant factors; Food availability; Sensitivity indices; Surface conditions; Sustainable agricultural; Vulnerability assessments; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087333501

The present study mainly aimed to determine the variables influencing farmers’ decisions on adaptation and to investigate the variables dictating the extent to which each adaptation strategy is used. So, data on production inputs, demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and institutional-cultural factors were collected from 360 rice farmers in the basins of Kamfiruz district, Iran and were analyzed by descriptive statistics, multinomial logit, and the Tobit Heckman two-stage models. The results indicated that the most common adaptation strategies included modifying crop cultivars and changing the area of land under cultivation. Besides, the estimation of the multinomial logit model implied that 13 variables could account for 51.42 % of the variance in the possibility of farmers’ adaptation. Moreover, cultivated land area, seed, fertilizer, pesticide, water, age, educational level, experience, income, land size, and training were the factors found to significantly affect farmers’ decision to apply adaptation practices. Of these explanatory variables, cultivated land area, water, and training were the key factors influencing adaptation strategies while labor and land tenure were not. Finally, a distinction was presented by the two-stage Tobit method between the variables influencing the selection of an adaptation strategy and the variables affecting the extent of the use of adaptation strategies. The policy recommendations for adaptation activities, training courses, land management, and the control of water input are suggested to enhance farmers’ adaptability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Cultivated land area; Kamfiruz; Land size; Multinomial logit model; Rice farmers","adaptive management; agricultural worker; climate change; cultivation; decision making; logit analysis; paddy field; rice; strategic approach; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082698273

The abandonment of rainfed cereal crops and their change of use as natural pastures grazed by milk sheep, have led to an improvement in the profitability of the farms, greater industrialisation and a positive impact on rural development. This paper calculates the carbon footprint (CF) of farms in the context of life cycle assessment with the objective to identify the system that accounts for the lowest CF while maintaining adequate levels of profitability and revitalising the rural environment. The data were obtained through surveys carried out on dairy sheep farms of different typologies, ranging from the semi-intensive farms with small grazing areas, to the extensive farms with large areas of natural pastures. Findings could help farmers evaluate the environmental impact of their activities, while at the same time provide consumers with valuable evidence to be used in further marketing actions. Greenhouse gas emissions vary from 1.77 to 4.09 Kg CO2eq/kg of milk, where the lowest values correspond to the most intensive farms and the highest values to the most extensive and least productive farms. Enteric fermentation, followed by feeding, are the emissions with the greatest impact. Enteric fermentation reaches its maximum value (52.22 % of the total emissions) in the most extensive farms. On other hand, this study found that carbon sequestration varies between 0.09 and 2.04 kg of CO2eq/kg of milk, a figure that can considerably reduce the carbon footprint calculation and justifies its inclusion in the Life Cycle Assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Extensive; Rangelands; Sheep farms","carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; grazing; land use; pasture; rangeland; semiarid region; sheep; Spain; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081688249

DATA AND METHODS: This study used the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort, a longitudinal cohort of 3.5 million individuals, of which 764,000 were classified as immigrants (foreign-born). Postal codes from annual income tax files were used to account for mobility among respondents and to assign annual PM2.5 concentrations from 1998 to 2016. Exposures were estimated as a three-year moving average prior to the follow-up year. Cox survival models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for cause-specific mortality, comparing the Canadian and foreign-born populations, with further stratification by year of immigration grouped into 10-year cohorts. RESULTS: Differences in urban-rural settlement patterns resulted in greater exposure to PM2.5 for immigrants compared with non-immigrants (mean = 9.3 vs. 7.5 μg/m3), with higher exposures among more recent immigrants. In fully adjusted models, immigrants had higher HRs per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration compared with Canadian-born individuals for cardiovascular mortality (HR [95% confidence interval] = 1.22 [1.12 to 1.34] vs. 1.12 [1.07 to 1.18]) and cerebrovascular mortality (HR = 1.25 [1.03 to 1.52] vs. 1.03 [0.93 to 1.15]), respectively. However, tests for differences between the two groups were not significant when Cochran's Q test was used. No significant associations were found for respiratory outcomes, except for lung cancer in non-immigrants (HR = 1.10 [1.02 to 1.18]). When stratified by year of immigration, differences in HRs across varied by cause of death. DISCUSSION: In Canada, PM2.5 is an equal-opportunity risk factor, with immigrants experiencing similar if not higher mortality risks compared with non-immigrants for cardiovascular-related causes of death. Some notable differences also existed with cerebrovascular and lung cancer deaths. Continued reductions in air pollution, particularly in urban areas, will improve the health of the Canadian population as a whole.","air pollution; demography; fine particulate matter; immigrant; immigrant health; mortality","adult; adverse event; aged; air pollutant; Canada; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; female; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; migrant; mortality; particulate matter; population research; risk factor; rural population; statistical model; urban population; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Canada; Cardiovascular Diseases; Censuses; Cohort Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Particulate Matter; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087818238

However, wetland protective services have not received sufficient policy action. We propose national wetland commissions, modeled after the concept of lake and river commissions, as one way to strategically link wetland protection to other societal objectives, including human disaster risk planning, infrastructure investments, and climate adaptation strategies. We offer an example applicable to the United States, describing an institutional design for a National Interagency Wetland Commission. We suggest it could be patterned after existing federal commissions statutorily created by Congress with delegated administrative and regulatory authority and designated independent agency status within the executive branch.

The present paper analyses a Solar Assisted Ground Source Heat Pump system and tries to fill the gap in the literature, where a direct comparison between the consolidated solar thermal technology and the emerging and widely discussed photovoltaic thermal technology is missing. Indeed, the two different devices for the exploitation of solar energy have been analysed through dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS environment. Through this approach, it is possible to investigate and predict in detail the thermal and electrical behaviour of the energy system, composed by a water-to-water heat pump, which withdraws from two thermal reservoirs that are connected to a solar loop, composed either of solar thermal collectors or of photovoltaic thermal panels and to a ground loop. The heat pump is used to provide space cooling and space heating to a residential building, through fan coil terminal units or radiant floor system. Furthermore, the heat pump system assists the solar field in the production of domestic hot water. This study looks at the development of a flexible system able to work in different operating conditions. The model's boundary conditions can be changed for simulating a variety of case studies as the weather condition, the building load and the domestic hot water profile can be easily changed, together with specific components’ parameters. The control strategy makes it possible to vary the setpoint temperatures for simulating different operating conditions and management choices. In this way, the user can easily adapt the model functions to a specific plant system. The operating conditions of the two systems layouts have been compared and the energy performances evaluated for three case studies characterised by the weather conditions of the European cities of Berlin (mild-cold climate), Venice (mild climate) and Barcelona (mild-warm climate), and the corresponding thermal load profile of a two-storey building with a useful floor area of 170 m2. The study shows the possibility to directly exploit the solar energy for the domestic hot water production and as a heat source for the heat pump. The results from the comparison between the two systems’ configurations, with photovoltaic thermal panels and with solar thermal collectors, prove that there is the possibility to obtain a relevant improvement in the efficiency of the heat pump using photovoltaic thermal panels. The investigated multi-source energy system, moreover, allows an optimal employment of the available renewable heat sources and could easily be applied to case studies characterized by different boundary conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","GSHP; Heat pump; PVT; Renewable energy; Solar energy; TRNSYS","Boundary conditions; Collector efficiency; Floors; Greenhouse gases; Hot water distribution systems; Meteorology; Photovoltaic effects; Pumps; Reservoirs (water); Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Water; Different boundary condition; Different operating conditions; Greenhouse gases emissions; Renewable energy source; Set-point temperatures; Solar thermal collector; Solar thermal technology; Solar-assisted ground-source heat pump systems; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083550995

The Arctic region comprises about 30 million km2 of land and sea north of the Arctic Circle (66° 33' 44″). The northern polar latitudes comprise an almost equal mix of land and sea. The land regions of the Arctic are divided into the northern sectors of the Eurasian and North American continents, the island of Greenland, and numerous high arctic island groups. The current environmental changes in the Arctic are happening at a pace and an amplitude hitherto unknown. Global warming from anthropogenic GHG emissions is probably having the greatest impacts on Arctic environments. Because of the intricate interactions between land, sea, and ice, the global warming signal is greatly amplified in the Arctic, and all but the most stringent scenarios to reduce GHG emissions will very likely lead to a complete transformation of Arctic environments.

Therefore, the use of photovoltaics (PV) is a viable, clean energy source for the GCC region. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic study for the implementation of a grid-connected rooftop photovoltaic and energy storage system (PV-ESS) in the State of Qatar. This study aims to present a detailed cost analysis as well as sizing information for a house in Qatar. A multi-objective optimization that considers generation and load profiles, cost of grid consumption, cost of materials, and house size is presented in the form of Pareto frontier curves. Load modulation is introduced as a method to lower capital expenditure and operational costs. The benefit to a developed country like Qatar is to improve the resilience of the electrical supply and reduce the carbon footprint. The benefit to a developing country is that it brings electricity to individual homes without needing an expensive utility grid. Although this paper is not intended to study energy policy, the techniques presented can be used to recommend energy policies. The results of this study are presented in the form of implementation steps to make rooftop PV-ESS systems feasible in Qatar based on factual information and detailed analysis. © 2020 IEEE.","cost analysis; Energy Storage Systems; multi-objective optimization; Photovoltaic; renewable energy systems; Residential rooftop installations","Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Curve fitting; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Multiobjective optimization; Capital expenditures; Clean energy sources; Developed countries; Energy storage systems; Factual information; Grid-connected photovoltaic; Implementation steps; Techno-economic studies; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099606146

Today such platforms are mostly designed to handle and analyze large and heterogeneous urban data sets from very different domains. Modeling and optimization functionalities are usually not part of the software concepts. However, such functionalities are considered crucial by the authors to develop transformation scenarios and to optimize smart city operation. An urban platform needs to handle multiple scales in the time and spatial domain, ranging from long term population and land use change to hourly or sub-hourly matching of renewable energy supply and urban energy demand. The paper discusses software architecture concepts for data and modeling urban platforms, which allow to analyze and optimize the urban infrastructure with their energy, water and further resources such as food or goods consumption. Building, commerce and industry as well as the transport sector are in the focus of the efficiency and renewable supply analysis. The main driver is to derive zero carbon strategies for cities while including all major sectors of CO2 generation. So far, two software architecture concepts have been implemented and tested, both using a 3D CityGML geometry data model: A workflow management system for city scale building energy modeling using a monthly energy balance calculation method and a micro service orchestration for dynamic building simulation modeling. The GIS based data analysis methodology and building energy workflow modeling method are applied to a case study district in New York City to demonstrate the implementation status and derive CO2 mitigation strategies. The results showed how data gathered from different sources for the relevant sectors can be translated into CO2-emissions. For a district in Brooklyn connected to a large electric substation with electricity monitoring data available, every individual building´s heating and cooling demand was simulated and resulted in a total annual heating demand of 1.72 TWh/a and 0.11 TWh/a of cooling. It could be shown that the building sector cooling demand can by reduced by 63% by a change of set point temperature for cooling and reduced infiltration rate, while reducing the heat demand by 12%. In addition, carbon accounting of the food and wastewater sector was done using the same GIS based modeling framework. The analysis showed that the food related electricity consumption for refrigeration corresponds to about 5% of the overall electricity consumption and requires 2.6 GWh/a for transport. Using food waste in co-digestion of wastewater treatment plants could contribute another 7.4 GWh/a of combined heat and power. Such quantification of demand and energy sources could contribute to prioritize actions for CO2 mitigation strategies in urban areas. © 2020","CO2-emissions reduction; Energy demand simulation; Software architecture; Urban data platform; Web-based orchestration","Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Computer aided manufacturing; Cooling; Electric power utilization; Electric substations; Emission control; Energy management; Food waste; Geographic information systems; Land use; Simulation platform; Software architecture; Software testing; Urban planning; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Work simplification; Building simulation model; CO2 emissions; Data platform; Energy balance calculations; Energy demands; Wastewater treatment plants; Web based; Workflow management systems; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082759260

Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the health endpoint of Ahvaz Megacity Criteria Air Pollutants (MCAP) in humans during 2010–2013. Criteria Air Pollutants (CAP) were monitored by Ahvaz Environmental Protection Agency (AEPA). Methods: This study, evaluated the health effects which are related to particle mater (PM10), Ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfide dioxide (SO2) by descriptive analysis and AirQ model. Sampling according to EPA guideline was done and baseline incidence (BI) and relative risk (RR) measures by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Middle East region were used in order to estimate the health endpoint association of CAP. Results: Result of this study is useful for better understanding of relationship between exposure to criteria air pollution and health effects. Hospital Admission (HA) were Hospital Admission Respiratory Disease (HARD), Hospital Admission for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (HACOPD), Hospital Admission Cardiovascular Disease (HACD). According to the result of this study, the annual cases of hospital admission during 2010–2013 were (PM10: 3116, 3246, 3026 and 2895; O3: 37, 42, 51 and 72; NO2: 10, 13, 21 and 25; SO2: 25, 31, 35 and 42), the average annual level of CAP in the same period were (PM10: 281.98, 288.38, 278.12 and 242.29; O3: 66.52, 72.67, 102.27 and 223; NO2: 28.7, 31, 37 and 41; SO2: 78.92, 91.07, 92.75 and 112.3 μg/m3), respectively. Based on the results, the average of 4-year study was higher than NAAQS and WHO values. The concentration of exposure to criteria air pollutants can increased morbidity and mortality between residential in Ahvaz megacity. Conclusion: Results of our study can be very important for government, medical, public health and scientific. Also, this study can help to government for adoption of laws which are related to air pollution and achieve international air quality standards. Hence, it is necessary to reduce emission of criteria air pollution sat national management level. © 2019 INDIACLEN","Ahvaz; Air pollution; Hospital admission; Humans; Iran","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur oxide; air pollution; air sampling; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; dust storm; environmental exposure; environmental protection; health hazard; hospital admission; human; incidence; maximum concentration; Middle East; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; World Health Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076861520

We evaluated recent climate-refugia management associated with water use and landscape modification by comparing efforts in the US states of Oregon and Massachusetts, for which there are contrasting resource use patterns. Using these examples, we discuss tools and principles that can be applied more broadly. Although many early efforts to identify climate refugia have focused on water temperature, substantial gains in evaluating other factors and processes regulating climate refugia (eg stream flow, groundwater availability) are facilitating refined mapping of refugia and assessment of their ecological value. Major challenges remain for incorporating climate refugia into water-quality standards, evaluating trade-offs among policy options, addressing multiple species’ needs, and planning for uncertainty. However, with a procedurally transparent and conceptually sound framework to build upon, recent efforts have revealed a promising path forward. © 2020 The Authors.

This has led to an urgent need for the inclusion of economic principles, models, and methods in water resources management. Although several studies have developed macro-economic models to evaluate the economic impacts of alternative water allocation strategies, many if not most ignore the hydrological boundaries of transboundary river basins. Furthermore, of those using input-output (IO) models, only a handful have applied supply-side IO models. In this paper, we present one of the first attempts to develop an inter-regional, supply-side IO modelling framework for a multi-jurisdictional, transboundary river basin to assess the direct and indirect economic impacts of water supply restrictions due to climate and policy change. Applying this framework to the Saskatchewan River Basin in Canada encompassing three provinces, we investigate the economic impacts of two different water supply restriction scenarios on the entire river basin and its sub-basins individually. We find that in the face of climate-change-induced water shortage, economic losses can be reduced by almost 50% by adopting appropriate management practices, including prioritization of water allocation, using alternative water sources, and water re-use technologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Economic impacts; Supply-side input-output model; Transboundary river basin; Water policy; Water supply restriction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080940964

These mechanisms are generally optimized and validated for specific ranges of operating conditions, which result in an abundance of models offering accurate nominal solutions over different parameter ranges. Under atmospheric conditions, and for methane combustion, relatively good agreement between models and experiments is currently observed. At engine-relevant pressures, however, a large variability in predictions is obtained as the models are often used outside their validation region. The high levels of uncertainty found in chemical kinetic rates enable such discrepancies between models, even if the reactions are within recommended rate values. This work investigates the effect of such kinetic uncertainties in NO predictions by propagating the uncertainties of 30 reactions that are both uncertain and important to NO formation, through the combustion model at engine-relevant pressures. Understanding the uncertainty sources in model predictions and their effect on emissions at these pressures is key in developing accurate thermochemical models to design future combustion chambers with any confidence. Lean adiabatic, freely propagating, laminar flames are therefore chosen to study the effect of parametric kinetic uncertainties. A nonintrusive, level 2, nested sparse-grid approach is used to obtain accurate surrogate models to quantify NO prediction intervals at various pressures. The forward analysis is carried up to 32 atm to quantify the uncertainty in emissions predictions to pressures relevant to the gas turbine community, which reveals that the NO prediction uncertainty decreases with pressure. After performing a reaction pathway analysis (RPA), this reduction is attributed to the decreasing contribution of the prompt-NO pathway to total emissions, as the peak CH concentration and the CH layer thickness decrease with pressure. In the studied lean condition, the contribution of the pressure-dependent N2O production route increases rapidly up to 10 atm before stabilizing toward engine-relevant pressures. The uncertain prediction ranges provide insight into the accuracy and precision of simulations at high pressures and warrant further research to constrain the uncertainty limits of kinetic rates to capture NO concentrations with confidence in early design phases. © 2020 by ASME.",,"Forecasting; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gas turbines; Kinetics; Methane; Accuracy and precision; Atmospheric conditions; Emissions prediction; Emissions regulations; Gas turbine industry; Prediction uncertainty; Premixed methane-air flames; Thermochemical models; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091815343

The reasons for this decline are unclear, although habitat loss, water quality reductions, climate change, and other environmental drivers likely play a role. Infectious disease can also cause precipitous species-specific declines in wildlife populations, but virtually nothing is known about infection in bonefish. We analyzed communities of bacteria on the gills of bonefish from the Florida Keys, where declines are pronounced, and the islands of Eleuthera and Inagua in The Bahamas, where no such declines have been recorded. Bacterial community composition varied significantly among island location (Keys, Eleuthera, Inagua) and among sites within island locations (e.g., tidal creeks, coves, inlets). Seventeen times more bacterial taxa were over-represented in the Florida Keys than in The Bahamas, and several bacterial genera over-represented in the Florida Keys have been linked to environmental contamination and disease (e.g., Corynebacterium; Acholeplasma; Staphylococcus; and Streptococcus). These results show that gill bacterial community signatures may prove useful for investigating bonefish spatial ecology and that communities of microbes on bonefish gills contain differentially abundant and potentially pathogenic bacteria that covary with the overall “health” of the population. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"abundance; bacterial disease; bacterium; community composition; fish; infectious disease; microbial community; pathogen; Bahamas; Eleuthera; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; United States; Acholeplasma; Albula vulpes; Albulidae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Corynebacterium; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085766454

In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR's L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI's footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding RMSEs of 57%, 75%, and 89% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI's power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87%). We also test the application of GEDI's biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion. © 2020 The Author(s)","Biomass errors; Biomass estimation; Data fusion; GEDI; ICESat-2; NISAR","Carbon; Data fusion; Earth (planet); Forestry; NASA; Optical radar; Orbits; Uncertainty analysis; Above ground biomass; Above-ground carbons; Biomass estimation; Climate mitigations; Environmental gradient; GEDI; ICESat-2; NISAR; Biomass; aboveground biomass; backscatter; biomass; data assimilation; forest ecosystem; forest management; ICESat; lidar; satellite altimetry; spacecraft; uncertainty analysis; California; Sonoma County; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082534754

We integrate agronomic and economic simulation models to determine the expected yield increase from biochar applications in the United States. We calculate the location-specific willingness to pay of U.S. farmers to apply biochar to their cropland if biochar increases yields over 20 years. In addition to the potential benefit of higher revenue for farmers, biochar applications also have policy implications if biochar production is combined with bio-fuel production or used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land-use change. Thus, the results are then combined with an agricultural outlook model to determine the effects on global land-use change and net carbon emissions. Our results indicate that biochar application is most profitable for croplands in the Southeast U.S. due to the combination of high yield increases and availability of biomass to produce biochar. An increase in U.S. yields above trend by 1% for corn, soybeans, and wheat would decrease net total global emissions by 25–87 Tg of CO2-equivalent. © 2020","Agricultural trade; Biomass; Carbon capture and utilization; Mitigation technologies; Net present value; Pyrolysis","Agriculture; Biomass; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Pyrolysis; Agricultural land; Carbon emissions; Economic simulation; Indirect land-use changes; Net present value; Policy implications; Potential benefits; Willingness to pay; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080040748

Here, we used drepanosiphine aphids as a model group to validate the ‘resource-dependent hypothesis’ based on the biotic interactions for specialist herbivorous insects, a hypothesis stating that their intricate relationship with host plants for resources might constrain their species diversity from being positively correlated with the species diversity of their hosts, and to assess the role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the global species diversity pattern of temperate organisms. Location: Global and regional. Time period: Current. Taxon: Drepanosiphine aphids (Insecta: Hemiptera: Aphidoidea). Methods: We first investigated the global species diversity pattern of drepanosiphine aphids. Then we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to conduct regression analyses to test for the relationships of global and regional species richness between drepanosiphine aphids and their host plants, and other predictor variables describing entire woody plants, environmental energy, water availability, climate seasonality, topographical heterogeneity and land cover. Finally, structural equation models (SEMs) were further used to test for direct and indirect effects of key ecological variables. Results: The distribution hotspots of species richness and endemism were both located in temperate zones, supporting the notion that drepanosiphine aphids were representative of temperate organisms. The specific host plant was the most important ecological variable in explaining global and regional drepanosiphine species richness, showing a strong positive relationship. The climatic variables mainly showed an indirect effect on global and regional drepanosiphine species richness via specific hosts. Main Conclusions: The global and regional drepanosiphine species richness was primarily shaped by specific host plants as opposed to all woody trees, with indirect effects of climatic factors via host plants, which supported the ‘resource-dependent hypothesis’ based on the biotic interactions for specialist herbivorous insects. This finding sheds new light on the ‘biotic interactions hypothesis’ that states biotic interactions can primarily affect the distributions and diversity patterns of both tropical and temperate organisms not only at the local scale but also at the regional to global scales. © 2020 The Authors.

While this has resulted in large ecological changes aboveground such as altered tree species composition and increased forest density, little is known about the long-term, belowground implications of altered, ecologically novel, fire regimes, especially on soil biological processes. To better understand the long-term implications of ecologically novel, high-severity fire, we used a 44-yr high-severity fire chronosequence in the Sierra Nevada where forests were historically adapted to frequent, low-severity fire, but were fire suppressed for at least 70 yr. High-severity fire in the Sierra Nevada resulted in a long-term (44 +yr) decrease (>50%, P < 0.05) in soil extracellular enzyme activities, basal microbial respiration (56–72%, P < 0.05), and organic carbon (>50%, P < 0.05) in the upper 5 cm compared to sites that had not been burned for at least 115 yr. However, nitrogen (N) processes were only affected in the most recent fire site (4 yr post-fire). Net nitrification increased by over 600% in the most recent fire site (P < 0.001), but returned to similar levels as the unburned control in the 13-yr site. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find a consistent effect of plant cover type on soil biogeochemical processes in mid-successional (10–50 yr) forest soils. Rather, the 44-yr reduction in soil organic carbon (C) quantity correlated positively with dampened C cycling processes. Our results show the drastic and long-term implication of ecologically novel, high-severity fire on soil biogeochemistry and underscore the need for long-term fire ecological experiments.

The parameterization of these processes in the models can have large impacts on the model outputs. In this study, the evaluation of a WRF/Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) forecast modeling system set up for Prague, the Czech Republic, within the project URBI PRAGENSI is presented. To assess the impacts of urban parameterization in WRF, in this case with the BEP+BEM (Building Environment Parameterization linked to Building Energy Model) urban canopy scheme, on Particulate Matter (PM) simulations, a simulation was performed for a winter pollution episode and compared to a non-urbanized run with BULK treatment. The urbanized scheme led to an average increase in temperature at 2 m by 2 °C, a decrease in wind speed by 0.5 m s-1, a decrease in relative humidity by 5%, and an increase in planetary boundary layer height by 100 m. Based on the evaluation against observations, the overall model error was reduced. These impacts were propagated to the modeled PM concentrations, reducing them on average by 15-30 μg m-3 and 10-15 μg m-3 for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. In general, the urban parameterization led to a larger underestimation of the PM values, but yielded a better representation of the diurnal variations. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Emissions; Particulate matter; Urban canopy; Validation; Weather prediction","Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Cell proliferation; Parameterization; Quality assurance; Wind; Air quality forecasting; Air quality modeling; Building energy model; Building environment; Particulate Matter; Planetary boundary layers; Pollution episodes; Urban environments; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); forecasting method; parameterization; particulate matter; seasonal variation; urban area; Czech Republic; Prague [Czech Republic]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087104366

This work had the objective of integrating refined and regionalized datasets of LUC in Brazil into the ecoinvent database, to better represent its dynamics and heterogeneity. We present the adaptations needs for having it suitable for crops, pasture and forestry in state-level and impacts of modelling assumptions and uncertainties. Methods: Adaptation and integration were based in ecoinvent version 3 guidelines and the database requirements to LUC modelling. BRLUC, a method for Brazilian LUC accounting, was the main data source. The workflow for the integration process consisted in identifying necessary adaptations in both sources to allow a better representation of Brazilian LUC. Four new reference products and 27 geographies were added in the database. Results and discussion: A total of 566 new datasets were integrated into ecoinvent version 3.6, allowing the incorporation of LUC in Brazilian products in state, regional and national level. GHG emissions reduced, being 42.2% and 99.9% lower to soybean and sugarcane than in ecoinvent v3.5. Four improvements were the main causes: (i) state-level LUC modelling with national official data; (ii) regionalizing carbon stocks; (iii) including pasture and forestry land use categories; (iv) and considering sugarcane as a perennial crop. The way to calculate national-level results based on subnational data was an important source of difference in emissions too. Uncertainties specifically associated with land use substitution patterns were not incorporated, and they can potentially have impacts as large as the uncertainties of all the remaining processes combined. Conclusions: Results showed that small changes in data sources and premises have large impacts on emissions associated with LUC in agricultural products. It also showed the large impacts of uncertainties of LUC patterns. Improving current models in better representing regional LUC patterns, regional carbon stocks and uncertainty accounting could reduce these impacts. Nonetheless, efforts in reducing the complexity of LUC accounting methods could enhance transparency and effectiveness. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beef; LUC; Maize; Mango; Mato Grosso; Soybean; Sugarcane; Timber","carbon; Article; biomass; Brazil; carbon footprint; crop production; data base; environmental aspects and related phenomena; forestry; land use; land use change; pasture; priority journal; soybean; sugarcane; uncertainty; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085296299

CETP aims to adjusting the consumption structure of clean energy and promoting the transformation of green technology to achieve regional CO2 and SO2 reduction. Using difference-in-difference (DID) and spatial panel model, we estimated the abatement effect of CETP, the influence mechanism of regional CO2 and SO2 policies, environmental and economic compatibility with provincial panel data in China from 2005 to 2017. The results show that the CETP can effectively decrease regional CO2 and SO2 emissions in pilot areas by 19.1% and 37.0% respectively when considering spatial correlation of CO2 and SO2 emissions. From 2014 to 2017, the values of CO2 reduction effect are −0.139, −0.146, −0.187 and −0.206 respectively, indicating the abatement effect increases gradually. CETP can promote 6.1% of the ratio of clean energy consumption and 4.6% of the rate of green technology. In addition, further benefit analysis shows that CETP can improve 12.4% of regional economic output and residents' health by reducing regional CO2 and SO2 emissions, and effectively benefit high-quality economic growth. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Carbon emission trading; Clean energy; Green technology; High-quality economic growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087358473

However, this in turn generates additional environmental costs through the impacts of materials and energy used in the treatment – these impacts are currently scarcely known. Therefore, this study uses life cycle assessment to estimate the impacts of different FGT systems typically found in modern MSW incinerators. A total of 12 scenarios are modelled to consider different combinations of the following eight technologies: electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters for removal of particulate matter; dry, semi-dry and wet scrubbers for acid gases; selective non-catalytic and catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx); and activated carbon for removal of dioxins and heavy metals. The data are sourced from 90 full-scale incinerators operating in France. The results reveal that a dry system using sodium bicarbonate and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) is the best option for seven out of 18 impacts, including climate change (37.1 kg CO2 eq./t MSW). By contrast, a dry system with calcium hydroxide and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has the highest impacts in six categories, including climate change (102 kg CO2 eq./t MSW). The wet systems have higher impacts than the dry alternatives, with the semi-dry options being in between. Compared to SNCR, the use of SCR decreases the NOx-related impacts (fine particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification and photochemical ozone formation) but increases other impacts. For example, the SCR systems have 49–284% greater climate change and 43–150% higher depletion of fossil resources than their SNCR counterparts. Overall, all FGT systems reduce significantly fine particulate matter formation (by 81–88%), photochemical ozone formation (76–90%) and terrestrial acidification (83–90%). However, they also cause 14 other impacts which would not be generated if the flue gas was left untreated, thus creating additional environmental costs. These include climate change, resource depletion and human and ecotoxicities. Therefore, these trade-offs should be considered carefully to minimise the unintended environmental consequences of flue gas treatment from incineration of MSW. © 2020 The Authors","Environmental impacts; Flue gas treatment; Incineration; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste","Acidification; Activated carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Electrostatic precipitators; Environmental regulations; Flue gases; Flues; Heavy metals; Hydrated lime; Inclusions; Life cycle; Lime; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Scrubbers; Selective catalytic reduction; Sodium bicarbonate; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Catalytic reduction; Environmental consequences; Environmental costs; Fine particulate matter; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Photochemical ozone; Selective non-catalytic reduction; Municipal solid waste; acidification; activated carbon; bicarbonate; climate change; detection method; incineration; inorganic compound; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082924392

In this Letter, we assess the feasibility of this planet to retain an atmosphere-one of the chief ingredients for surface habitability-over long timescales by employing state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic models to simulate the stellar wind and the associated rates of atmospheric escape. We take two major factors into consideration, namely, the planetary atmospheric composition and magnetic field. In all cases, we determine that the atmospheric ion escape rates are potentially a few orders of magnitude higher than the inner solar system planets, but TOI-700 d is nevertheless capable of retaining a 1 bar atmosphere over gigayear timescales for certain regions of the parameter space. The simulations show that the unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1 bar Earth-like atmosphere could be stripped away rather quickly (&lt;1 gigayear), while the unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1 bar CO2-dominated atmosphere could persist for many billions of years; we find that the magnetized Earth-like case falls in between these two scenarios. We also discuss the prospects for detecting radio emission of the planet (thereby constraining its magnetic field) and discerning the presence of an atmosphere. © 2020 The American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086923213

This paper proposes a method to optimally combine these technologies on cars or other road vehicles to improve their energy efficiency. The methodological difficulty is in the fact that these technologies have incompatibilities between them. Moreover, two conflicting objective functions are considered and have to be optimized to obtain Pareto optimal solutions: the CO2 reduction versus costs. For this NP-complete combinatorial problem, a method based on a metaheuristic with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) combined with a Local Search (LS) algorithm is proposed and generalized as the Technology Packaging Problem (TPP). It consists in finding, from a given set of technologies (each with a specific cost and CO2 reduction potential), among all their possible combinations, the Pareto front composed by those configurations having the minimal total costs and maximum total CO2 reduction. We compare the performance of the proposed method with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) showing the improvements achieved. Thanks to the increased computational efficiency, this technique has been deployed to solve thousands of optimization instances generated by the availability of these technologies by year, type of powertrain, segment, drive cycle, cost type and scenario (i.e., more or less optimistic technology cost for projected data) and inclusion of off-cycle technologies. The total combinations of all these parameters give rise to thousands of distinct instances to be solved and optimized. Computational tests are also presented to show the effectiveness of this new approach. The outputs have been used as basis to assess the costs of complying with different levels of new vehicle CO2 standards, from the perspective of different manufacturer types as well as vehicle users in Europe. © 2020 by the authors.","Ant colony optimization; CO2 reduction; Meta-heuristics; Multi-objective combinatorial optimization","Artificial intelligence; Automobile manufacture; Carbon dioxide; Computational efficiency; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Regulatory compliance; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Ant colony algorithms; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Combinatorial problem; Conflicting objectives; Greenhouse emissions; Local search algorithm; Minimal total costs; Pareto optimal solutions; Ant colony optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086381863

The objectives are to gain a better understanding of the central actors’ perspective and to explore the potential of scenario thinking as a pragmatic tool to provoke deep and practical reflections on business model innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a questionnaire survey conducted via email to senior personnel in the hotel industry across the region as well as to national and regional tourism and hospitality associations/agencies and government ministries. The questionnaire used a mix of close- and open-ended questions, as well as fictional scenarios to gain insight about perceptions from key actors in the tourism sector, including respondents’ personal beliefs about the reality of climate science and the need for action at the levels of individuals, governments, local, regional and multinational institutions. Findings: The study found that while the awareness of climate change and willingness to action is high, respondents perceive that hotels are not prepared for the climate crisis. Respondents had an overall view that the hotel sector in the Caribbean was unprepared for the negative impacts of climate change. Recommendations from the study include the need for immediate action on the part of all to both raise awareness and implement focused climate action to secure the future of tourism in the Caribbean. Research limitations/implications: The use of a survey has considerable challenges, including low response rates and the limitations of using perceptions to understand a phenomenon. The survey was conducted across the Caribbean from The Bahamas to Belize and down to Trinidad and Tobago so that views from across the similar, yet diverse, regions could be gathered, included and compared for a comprehensive view of perceptions and possible ideas for climate smart action. Practical implications: The 2030 Agenda for SDGs is based on policy and academic debates. This study helps to bridge the academic and policy discussion with the needs of the industry. Originality/value: This study contributes a consideration for climate-resilient business models for hotels in the tourism industry as a definitive action toward achieving SDG 13. This combined with the use of fictional climate change scenarios to access perceptions about the future of the hotel industry in the light of climate change, adds originality to the study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business models; Climate action; Fictional scenarios; Questionnaire survey; SDGs; Sustainable tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085035947

The evaluation helps to identify the level of water resources exposure to the changes that could help to plan for potential adaptive capacity. In this research, Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov in IDRISI software was used to predict the future LULC scenarios and the ensemble mean of four regional climate models (RCMs) in the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX)-Africa was used for the future climate scenarios. Distribution mapping was used to bias correct the RCMs outputs, with respect to the observed precipitation and temperature. Then, the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the watershed hydrological responses of the catchment under separate, and combined, LULC and climate change. The result shows the ensemble mean of the four RCMs reported precipitation decline and increase in future temperature under both representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures are higher for higher emission scenarios showing that RCP8.5 projection is warmer than RCP4.5. The changes in LULC brings an increase in surface runoff and water yield and a decline in groundwater, while the projected climate change shows a decrease in surface runoff, groundwater and water yield. The combined study of LULC and climate change shows that the effect of the combined scenario is similar to that of climate change only scenario. The overall decline of annual flow is due to the decline in the seasonal flows under combined scenarios. This could bring the reduced availability of water for crop production, which will be a chronic issue of subsistence agriculture. The possibility of surface water and groundwater reduction could also affect the availability of water resources in the catchment and further aggravate water stress in the downstream. The highly rising demands of water, owing to socio-economic progress, population growth and high demand for irrigation water downstream, in addition to the variability temperature and evaporation demands, amplify prolonged water scarcity. Consequently, strong land-use planning and climate-resilient water management policies will be indispensable to manage the risks. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate; Flow; Hydrology; RCP; Runoff; Water resources","Agricultural robots; Aquifers; Catchments; Climate models; Computer software; Cultivation; Economics; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Land use; Population statistics; Recharging (underground waters); Runoff; Surface water resources; Water management; Watersheds; Future climate scenarios; Hydrological response; Land use/land cover; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Regional climate models; Subsistence agriculture; Surface water and groundwaters; Water management policy; Climate change; air temperature; aquifer; cellular automaton; climate change; downscaling; experimental study; hydrological response; land cover; land use change; Markov chain; precipitation (climatology); recharge; river flow; runoff; software; upland region; water availability; water resource; watershed; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087861606

The spectral-temporal distribution of age structure indicated that the plantation stands in the study area were increasingly aging. Context: Plantations play a major role in China for ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration. Mapping plantation stand age distributions is essential for developing sustainable plantation forest management plans. Aims: The purpose of this study was to propose two new remote sensing based models for mapping plantation ages and to test the model feasibility and accuracy in determining the spectral-temporal patterns of forest ages. Methods: We first integrated vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm and spatial analysis (VCT-SA) for the pixels that were disturbed at least once from 1987 to 2017, and integrated VCT and random forest (VCT-RF) for the pixels were not disturbed during the study period. Then the forest age of these two parts were merged separately to generate annual forest age. Results: The spectral-temporal (30-m resolution, from 1987 to 2017) of forest age for the three typical plantations in Lishui were generated. The results indicated that the plantation stands in our large study area were increasingly aging. Conclusion: Our results revealed that it is reasonable to derive the distribution of plantation stand ages from combined remote sensing models. Besides, we confirmed that the stand ages of the plantations in our large study area of Lishui City are on the rise as the result of forest protection policies. © 2020, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Chinese fir; Landsat time series; Oak; Pine; Plantation disturbance; Plantation stand age","accuracy assessment; age structure; algorithm; assessment method; coniferous forest; disturbance; feasibility study; forest ecosystem; forest management; Landsat; pixel; plantation forestry; regression analysis; spatial analysis; stand dynamics; time series analysis; vegetation dynamics; China; Lishui; Zhejiang; Cunninghamia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082451029

GC is the intermediate material between graphite and diamond combining various properties such as high temperature resistance, hardness, good electrical conductivity, low density, low gases and liquids permeability, and excellent resistance to a wide range of aggressive chemical environments. These characteristics make it a very promising material for many applications, but unfortunately it is not widely used because of the high temperatures required for its synthesis. In this work, synthesis of glassy carbon thin films by means of laser ablation of carbon targets under vacuum or in gaseous helium, followed by a nanosecond laser irradiation of the deposited films, is presented. In particular, it is demonstrated that the amorphous structure of a thin film can be efficiently modified to the one of glassy carbon film by nanosecond UV laser irradiation. This method is valuable to prepare thin films similar to commercial glassy carbon with a completely different route which does not require the application of temperature beyond 1000∘C which is not compatible with the silicon substrate for example. This opens for glassy carbon the way to microengineering applications (mechanics, electronics). Particular attention is paid to characterize the vitreous carbon. In the literature, the vitreous nature of carbon layers is often highlighted on the basis of Raman spectroscopy measurements. However, as the Raman spectrum of glassy carbon is similar to that of pyrocarbon, multiwall carbon nanotubes, or functional graphene, this technique is not sufficient to safely characterize a carbonaceous material with a high degree of allotropy. To clear up any doubts, additional characterization methods, such as x-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, are discussed here. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Carbon films; Chemical elements; Density of gases; Gas permeable membranes; Glass; Glassy carbon; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Irradiation; Laser ablation; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Thin films; Ultrafast lasers; Ultraviolet lasers; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; X ray spectroscopy; Carbonaceous materials; Characterization methods; Electrical conductivity; High temperature resistance; Intermediate materials; Micro-engineering applications; Raman spectroscopy measurements; Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry; Density of liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093922248

Circular economy concepts can offer a unique opportunity to decouple growth from resource requirements. At the core of the circular economy, is the proposition of complete elimination of waste – i.e. waste not in its traditional sense, but any form of underutilization of assets and resources. A case study of the textile manufacturing industry in Surat, India is taken to compare the performances of traditional supply chain processes and the advantages of adopting circular economy concepts. Temporal sprawl of the textile industry is used to find the changes in trip lengths of urban freight trips over the last two decades. For estimating freight trips volume and patterns, roadside interviews of freight vehicles and establishment surveys of manufacturing and trading units were conducted. Overall urban freight transport contribution from the textile industry is estimated by modelling field data. Organized trip planning and optimized utilization of payload capacities can reduce vehicular emission generated from commercial goods movement in the textile industry to 2/3rd of its current levels. The paper asserts reinforces that the integration of circular economy principles with supply chain processes is beneficial from sustainability as well as a business point of view. The congestion mitigation due to the reduced number of trips offers a further reduction in the overall traffic emissions due to better traffic flows on the city’s road network. © Acta Logistica.","Circular economy; City logistics; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Urban freight",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087358488

In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the exhaust and non-exhaust emissions emitted from selected roads in Delhi city. Methods: Based on the vehicular density per hour and speed, three categories of roads have been considered in the present study: (a) low density road (≤1000 vehicles/hour, V ≥ 10 m/s); (b) medium density road (&gt;1000 vehicles/hour but ≤ 2000 vehicles/hour, V ≥ 7.5 m/s &lt; 10 m/s); and (c) high density road (&gt;2000 vehicles/hour, V &lt; 7.5 m/s). At the selected roads, real-world exhaust emissions were measured using AVL DiTEST 1000 analyser. The silt load measurements were also carried out as per EPA AP-42 methodology at the selected roads. Results: Results indicated real-world NO exhaust emissions of 0.5 g/m3 (2.03 g/km) on high-density roads and 0.23 g/m3 (0.67 g/km) on low and medium density roads. These values were significantly higher than the Bharat Standard (BS) IV (0.25 g/km). The silt load on the different types of roads indicated 3, 25 and 44 g/m2 -day dust deposition on, low, medium and high-density road, respectively. PM2.5 and PM10 emission rates were measured using US-EPA AP-42 methodology and were found to be least at low-density roads with values of 0.54 and 2.22 g/VKT (VKT -Vehicle Kilometer Travelled) respectively, and highest for high density roads with values of 12.40 and 51.25 g/VKT respectively. Conclusion: The present study reveals that both tailpipe (exhaust) and resuspend able road dust (non-exhaust) emissions contributes significantly and deteriorates local air quality. Although there exists emission standards, but there are no enforced regulations for non-exhaust emissions (resuspension of road dust). Hence, there is need to regulate non-exhaust emissions on urban roads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072531416

We collected data on species richness, composition and above-ground biomass (AGB) of trees, shrubs and herbs from 96 sample plots of 0.1 ha. Totals of 83 species from 26 families were recorded across the land-uses. Tree species richness, diversity and composition were significantly higher in evergreen forest (EGF) than in other land-uses. Similarly, stem density and basal area were greater in EGF compared to other land-uses. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) yielded three distinct groups along the land-use intensities and rainfall gradient on the first and second axes, respectively. The first DCA axis accounted for 45% and second axis for 35% of the total variation in species composition. Together the first two axes accounted for over 2/3 of the variation in species composition across land-use types. Across the land-uses, AGB ranged from 58.6 Mg ha−1 in rubber plantation to 327.3 Mg ha−1 in evergreen forest. Our results showed that species diversity and AGB were negatively impacted by the land-use changes. We found that coffee agroforests resembled natural forest and mixed species plantation in terms of tree diversity and biomass production, suggesting that traditional coffee farms can help to protect tree species, sustain smallholder production and offer opportunities for conservation of biodiversity and climate change mitigation. © 2019, Northeast Forestry University.","Above-ground biomass; Carbon; Coffee agroforest; Diversity; Land-use changes; Western Ghats","aboveground biomass; agroforestry; assessment method; basal area; biodiversity; coffee; evergreen forest; land use change; smallholder; species diversity; species richness; tropical environment; India; Karnataka; Kodagu; Western Ghats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061898241

Differently from classical extreme value modeling approaches, this paper develops a dynamic model of conditional, exponentiated Weibull distribution modeling and analysis of regional smog extremes, particularly for the worst scenarios observed in each day. To gain higher modeling efficiency, weather factors will be introduced in an enhanced model. The proposed model and the enhanced model are illustrated with temporal/spatial maxima of hourly PM2.5 observations each day from smog monitoring stations located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei geographical region between 2014 and 2019. The proposed model performs more precisely on fittings compared with other previous models dealing with maxima with autoregressive parameter dynamics, and provides relatively accurate prediction as well. The findings enhance the understanding of how severe extreme smog scenarios can be and provide useful information for the central/local government to conduct coordinated PM2.5 control and treatment. For completeness, probabilistic properties of the proposed model were investigated. Statistical estimation based on the conditional maximum likelihood principle is established. To demonstrate the estimation and inference efficiency of studies, extensive simulations were also implemented. © 2020 by the authors.","Conditional maximum likelihood; Conditional modeling; Hazard pollutants; Nonlinear time series; Risk control","Efficiency; Maximum likelihood estimation; Weibull distribution; Autoregressive parameters; Conditional maximum likelihoods; Exponentiated Weibull distribution; Extensive simulations; Inference efficiency; Probabilistic properties; Statistical estimation; Statistical learning; Air pollution; atmospheric dynamics; concentration (composition); extreme event; machine learning; particulate matter; smog; statistical analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086892885

Energy system analyses have recently gained the attention of urban policy makers due to their comprehensive and long-term perspective on the activities of the entire supply/demand chain, traditionally treated independently when shaping building urban energy strategies. This paper presents a spatial and temporally resolved urban energy system optimization model with specific features in order to describe the interactions between energy efficiency in buildings and heat supply strategies. A preliminary case study is proposed for offering numerical evidence to results. The results show that a planned combination of fuel switching, energy efficiency and building retrofit may complementary lead to meet ambitious climate targets at a reasonable added cost. From the results emerge that urban energy system models might help researcher and decision makers in generating robust holistic scenarios and in providing quantitative elements to exclude actions that are not economically affordable, technologically feasible and environmentally sustainable. Nevertheless, to be fully adoptable for real applications, existing barriers need to be overcome with special attention to the definition of input data protocols and the stakeholder involvement since the beginning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","building stock; demand-supply integration; heating strategies; scenarios analysis; TIMES model; urban energy planning","Buildings; Decision making; Economics; Energy utilization; Urban planning; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy system analysis; Long-term perspective; Low carbon energies; Stakeholder involvement; Temporally resolved; Urban energy systems; Urban Planning Strategies; Energy efficiency; building; decision making; energy efficiency; feasibility study; long-term change; stakeholder; sustainability; thermal power; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083663036

Empirical research for quantifying ecosystem services – nature's benefits to people – is essential for evaluating the range of benefits of ecological restoration and to support its use in natural resource management. Satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to monitor interventions, especially in large and remote areas. In this study we used field measurements, RS-based information from Sentinel-2 imagery together with soil and terrain data, to estimate ecosystem service supply and evaluate integrated ecological restoration interventions. We based our research on the arid, rural landscape of the Baviaanskloof Hartland Bawarea Conservancy, South Africa, where several integrated interventions have been implemented in areas where decades of small livestock farming has led to extensive land degradation. Interventions included i) long term livestock exclusion, ii) revegetating of degraded areas, iii) a combination of these two, and iv) essential oil production as alternatives to goat and sheep farming. We assessed six ecosystem services linked to the objectives of the interventions: erosion prevention, climate regulation, regulation of water flows, provision of forage, biomass for essential oil production, and the sense of place through presence of native species. We first estimated the ecosystem service supply based on field measurements. Secondly, we explored the relationships between ecosystem services quantities derived from the field measurements with 13 Sentinel-2 indices and four soil and terrain variables. We then selected the best fitting model for each ecosystem service. Finally, we compared the supply of ecosystem services between intervened and non-intervened sites. Results showed that models based on Sentinel-2 indices, combined with slope information, can estimate ecosystem services supply in the study area even when the levels of field-based ecosystem services supplies are low. The RS-based models can assess ecosystem services more accurately when their indicators mainly depend on green vegetation, such as for erosion prevention and provision of forage. The agricultural fields presented high variability between plots on the provision of ecosystem services. The use of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices and terrain data to quantify ecosystem services is a first step towards improving the monitoring and assessment of restoration interventions. Our results showed that in the study area, livestock exclusion lead to a consistent increase in most ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Essential oils; Rehabilitation; Revegetation; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Thicket; Vegetation indices","Agriculture; Erosion; Essential oils; Landforms; Natural resources management; Patient rehabilitation; Remote sensing; Restoration; Revegetation; Rural areas; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Vegetation; Monitoring and assessment; Natural resource management; Restoration intervention; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Thicket; Vegetation index; Ecosystems; arid region; biomass; conservation status; ecosystem service; essential oil; landscape; mapping method; NDVI; remote sensing; restoration ecology; revegetation; Sentinel; South Africa; Capra hircus; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079317849

The future hydrological projection indicated an increase in the monthly rainfall as well as a shift in the rainiest months from winter to spring. This change resulted in an increase in water balance components. The maximum discharges, as well as the modal discharge (Q50), may increase in the future, and the minimums corresponding to Q95 and Q98 may reduce for both emission scenarios. The results showed that a well-preserved upland watershed in a sub-tropical region might be capable of maintaining water availability at level that is enough for human activities in the future, even with the reduction of minimum permit discharge, which is supported by the increase of maximum and medium monthly discharges and a stable flow-duration curve. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Eta-HadGEM2-ES; Hydrological modeling; Landscape; SWAT","Landforms; Watersheds; Emission scenario; Hydrological impacts; Hydrological process; Monthly rainfalls; Temperate climate; Tropical regions; Water availability; Water balance components; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; concentration (composition); hydrological modeling; river discharge; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085033342

Vegetative and reproductive phenophases of 50 tree-shrub species were monitored monthly (12 months), and their relationship with climatic variables was tested using multiple linear regression. Time of leaf budding differed between areas for autochoric species and between autochoric and anemochoric species at LDF. Leaf fall in communities and functional groups was seasonal and highly synchronous during the dry season (95 % of species). Leaf budding peaked at the end of the dry season with > 80 % synchrony. In general, the species presented low synchrony or asynchrony for flowering phenophases, while fruiting phenophases were weakly seasonal but differed between functional groups. Temperature and precipitation were the regulating factors of vegetative phenophases in LDF, while daylength regulated them in SDF. Abiotic factors only influenced flowering phenophases at the dispersion group level. Only ripe fruits were related to reduced daylength. The phenophases of the deciduous forests of the Pantanal seem to be regulated not only by climatic factors but also by strong endogenous control. © 2020, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

Land surface temperature (LST) data obtained from satellite images were used to examine the relationship between land surface temperature and Local Climatic Zones in Sriniketan-Sanniketan Planning Area (SSPA) using GIS and remote sensing techniques. The effect of Surface Urban Heal Island was assessed using Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) quantitatively. The results show that land surface temperature increased by 0.34 °C per year and 0.55 °C per year during winter and summer season respectively and a significant variation of LST over the LCZs exist. The maximum and minimum LST is recorded in the month of April and January. The study landscape enjoys excellent to normal thermal conditions (UTFVI <0.000 and up to 0.010) where the presence of different natural land covers are adequate. From the results it is suggested that effect of LST on the ecological condition induced by urbanization can be regulated not only by balancing land use/ land cover types but also optimizing proper urban planning.

The consumer preferences are subject to changes quickly. New regulations and the climate of competitions among companies stimulate changes at the market placed product. New product development teams are challenged to accelerate their work to shorten product time-to-market. This is due to the product life cycle is getting shorter and to avoid change of preference before the product launched. The new product team's knowledge of the character of the previous product is needed to accelerate the process of developing new products. The involvement of supplier and user in preparing new product should not be forgotten. The knowledge they have about previous products must also be collected. Users may have complaints on the previous product, while suppliers may have difficulties in creating the supply. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework in developing new product in order to improve product quality and shorten time-to-market with involvement of user and supplier perspective. A model was developed based on literature review and expert interview. The proposed model has three dynamic processes: knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion, and knowledge storage. A design structured matrix (DSM) was created to analyze the relationship between stages in the framework. Experts state that the knowledge gained at the end of each project is reused as input to the next project. To test the framework, a case study is planned in an automotive company. Further research is suggested to validate the proposed framework in different industries. © 2020 ACM.","Knowledge Management; Knowledge Sharing; New Product Development; Supplier Involvement; Time-to-market","Commerce; Concurrent engineering; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Product development; Systems engineering; Automotive companies; Consumer preferences; Dynamic environments; Knowledge creations; Knowledge management framework; New product development; New product development projects; Product life cycles; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090955621

The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using monthly observed streamflow data of Layawan River. The SWAT model performed satisfactorily with R2=0.73, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)=0.59, RSR=0.64 and PBIAS=21.18% during calibration, and R2=0.60, NSE=0.56, RSR=0.66 and PBIAS=7.01% during validation. A total of 15 climate variability scenarios were formulated to mimic actual El Niño or La Niña occurrences based on observed weather station data nearest to the watershed. Extremely low and extremely high streamflow values were predicted under very strong El Niño and moderate La Niña scenarios, respectively. The decrease in streamflow under very strong El Niño reached 57.1% while the increase in streamflow under moderate La Niña went as high as 400% with respect to the baseline conditions. Results showed that rainfall had more influence on streamflow of the Layawan River watershed than temperature. The streamflow simulation results under climate variability scenarios also revealed that the after-effects of extreme El Niño events could last for two to three months after it has ceased and yet could continue to behave abnormally depending on the succeeding climatic condition. This study provided useful information for the development of extreme climate variability mitigation and adaptation strategies and water resources management for crop production in Layawan River basin and other regions in the Philippines. © 2020, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the matrix gathering physicochemical and microbiological data while the Common Components and SpecificWeight Analysis (CCSWA) or ComDim was used for fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). This approach provided complementary and valuable information regarding water quality in such complex ecosystem. As highlighted by the PCA and ComDim scores, the Kadisha-Abou Ali River is highly influenced by anthropogenic activities because its watershed districts are intensively populated. This influence reveals the implication of organic and bacteriological parameters. To the contrary, the El Jaouz watershed is less inhabited and is characterized by mineral parameters, which determines its water quality. This work highlighted the relationship between fluorescence EEMs and major water quality parameters, enabling the selection of reliable water quality indicators for the studied rivers. The proposedmethodology can surely be generalized to themonitoring of surface water quality in other rivers.

Satellite-derived sea surface temperatures increased in the period 1998–2017 by 1.0 °C as an average for the Barents Sea. We found significant positive relationships between ice-free conditions (open water area and duration) and satellite-based net primary production (NPP). The estimated annual NPP for the Barents Sea more than doubled over the 1998–2017 period, from around 40 to over 100 Tg C. The strong increase in NPP is the result of reduction of sea ice, extending both the area and period available for phytoplankton production. In areas where ice extent has decreased, satellite-derived chlorophyll a shows that the timing of the peak spring phytoplankton bloom has advanced by over a month. Our results reveal that phytoplankton dynamics in the ecosystem have been changing rapidly and that this change is driven mainly by bottom-up climatic processes. Autumn mesozooplankton biomass showed strong interannual variability in the 1990s, displaying an inverse relationship with capelin biomass, the most abundant planktivorous fish. In some regions, e.g. Central Bank, capelin biomass explained up to 50% of the mesozooplankton variability during 1989–2017. Though capelin biomass has varied considerably, mesozooplankton biomass has remained rather stable since the mid-2000s (6–8 g dry wt. m−2), resulting in a weakening of the negative relationship between capelin and mesozooplankton biomass in recent years. The stable zooplankton biomass indicates favorable conditions (prolonged/increased NPP) for mesozooplankton production, partly counteracting high predation levels. Overall, we observed trends in phytoplankton phenology that were strongly associated with changes in sea ice cover driven by fluctuations in temperature regime, a trend that may intensify should the ecosystem become even warmer due to climate change. Further reductions of sea ice and associated ice algae is expected to have adverse effects on sympagic fauna and ice dependent species in the Arctic food web. The ice-free conditions may promote further Atlantification (or borealization) of plankton and fish communities in the Barents Sea. © 2020 The Author(s)","Barents Sea; Bloom dynamics; Capelin predation; Climate effects; Key processes; Mesozooplankton; Phytoplankton","Biomass; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Fish; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface waters; Favorable conditions; In-situ observations; Interannual variability; Net primary production; Phytoplankton dynamics; Phytoplankton productions; Sea surface temperature (SST); Temporal and spatial dynamics; Plankton; biomass; climate change; community structure; food web; in situ measurement; net primary production; phytoplankton; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; zooplankton; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; algae; Mallotus (fish)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084796941

These contribute to eutrophication, reduced air quality, global warming, and odor nuisance. It is imperative that these gases are mitigated in an environmentally sustainable manner. We present the discovery of a microbial inhibitor combo consisting of tannic acid and sodium fluoride (TA-NaF), which exhibits clear synergistic inhibition of ammonia production in pure bacteria culture and in pig manure while simultaneously inhibiting methane and odorant (H2S and VOC) emissions. In laboratory headspace experiments on pig manure, we used proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry and cavity ring-down spectroscopy to measure the effect of TA-NaF on gaseous emissions. Ammonia emission was reduced by more than 95%, methane by up to ∼99%, and odor activity value by more than 50%.

Studies suggest that a positive school climate may prevent substance use while promoting healthy student behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine the longitudinal associations between school climate and substance use initiation in a group of middle school students. Parallel latent growth curve modeling was used to examine changes among study variables longitudinally using a sample of 2,097 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students across 16 regional schools located in three counties in West Virginia. Results suggest that a positive school climate may prevent substance use initiation (β = −0.07 to −0.25, p <.01). However, perceptions of school climate decreased on their own over time (β = −0.28 to −0.66, p <.01). Furthermore, substance use initiation also increased as students grew older (β = 0.96 to 0.99, p <.01) and reduced the effects of school climate longitudinally (β = −0.07 to −0.24, p <.01). Early substance use initiation may be a warning sign of other underlying student issues and requires additional school support to foster student success. Findings suggest that a positive school climate may delay substance use initiation and promote school success. School climate may, therefore, be useful as an intervention to support school-based health promotion. © 2020 Society for Public Health Education.","high school; middle school; parallel latent growth model; substance use prevention","adolescent; drug dependence; human; longitudinal study; school; school health service; student; Adolescent; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; School Health Services; Schools; Students; Substance-Related Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083380315

The investigation is performed by means of a two dimensional numerical model, experimentally validated, of an GAHX solved with finite element method. The results introduced in this paper are carried out by varying the length of the pipes and the air flow velocity; thus, also the number of tubes forming the GAHX is varied since the volumetric flow rate to be provided to the AHU must be kept constant. The energy performances of the above-mentioned HVAC system are analyzed, both in summer and in winter operation modes. Specifically, the reduction of the power of the heating and cooling coils in the AHU due to the pre-treatment of the air operated by the GAHX, the efficiency of the GAHX and the inlet-outlet temperature span are evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. These results lead to say that an GAHX for the geothermal pre-treatment of the air to be introduced into the AHU is energetically very convenient since it leads total thermal power savings in all the investigated cities, that makes this solution competitive. Specifically the best value of power reduction (61.5%) for a 100 m pipe-length GAHX is obtained in Ottawa, a city belonging to continental climate zone. The worst results in terms of power reduction are registered in Rio de Janeiro, a city belonging to the tropical or equatorial climates: this reduction, for a 100 m pipe-length ground to air heat exchanger, is 23.9%. © 2020 by the authors.","Air handling unit; CFD model; Energy recovery; GAHX; Geothermal energy; Köppen climatic areas","Air; Air conditioning; Flow velocity; Geothermal energy; Heat exchangers; Numerical methods; Office buildings; Sensitivity analysis; Air handling units; Continental climate; Energy performance; Equatorial climate; Heating and cooling; Outlet temperature; Two dimensional numerical models; Volumetric flow rate; HVAC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086411022

The trigeneration plants are required to produce electricity with 90 MWe (from steam-turbines), 2500 kg/s of chilled water at 7 °C and 10 bars, and 34.8 kg/s of industrial process steam at 500 °C and 27.6 bars. The hourly and yearly performance of the considered plants with different gas turbine and solar field sizes have been examined and presented. In addition, a conceptual procedure to identify the optimal solar integration configuration has been developed and presented. Furthermore, the off-design behavior and regional potential of the optimally solar integration configuration have been assessed. The study reveals that the optimal configuration is the integration of 126 ha of parabolic trough collector's solar field (46.2 ha of the total active aperture area) with the trigeneration plant of 130 MWe gas turbine size, which gives a levelled electricity cost of 5.75 USȻ/kWh with 114 k-tonne reduction of the annual CO2 emissions.

Here we analyse the SH jet stream response to 4×CO2 forcing in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, and find a substantially muted jet shift during winter compared with CMIP5. We suggest this muted response results from a more poleward mean jet position, consistent with a strongly reduced bias in jet position relative to the reanalysis during 1980-2004. The improved mean jet position cannot be explained by changes in the simulated sea surface temperatures. Instead, we find indications that increased horizontal grid resolution in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 has contributed to the higher mean jet latitude, and thus to the reduced jet shift under CO2 forcing. These results imply that CMIP6 models can provide more realistic projections of SH climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).

The tunnel traverses the main fault zones between two regionally important tectonic units, Getic and Danubian, allowing deep groundwater circulation and higher infiltration of groundwater into the tunnels. Water samples were collected at the surface and within the tunnels in four different sampling campaigns, depending on the tunnel operational regime in 2016, and measurements of physicochemical parameters (pH, ORP, EC, T) and groundwater sampling for chemical analysis (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Sr, Li, HCO3, SO4, Cl, NO3, H2S) were conducted. This was a unique opportunity to investigate hydrochemical processes based on groundwater leakage along the tunnel profile line. The main problem is compounded by the fact that it is a hydraulic tunnel that transports water under pressure, thereby interacting with the hydrogeological environment. Changes in the tunnel operational mode cause hydraulic changes in the hydrogeological environment, which is a key part of this research. The presence of different hydrochemical facies appearing in the tunnel (from Na–Cl through Na-HCO3 to Ca(Mg)–HCO3 water types) pointed to the complexity of the hydrogeological system in the shallow, and deep groundwater flow systems developed in karst and fissured aquifer. Heterogeneity of bedrock had an important influence on the hydrochemical conditions accompanied by processes revealed through hydrochemical and multivariate statistical analysis: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The main processes are defined as (1) dissolution processes in hypogenic conditions of the karst hydrogeological system, associated with high mineralization of groundwater, (2) cation exchange process, (3) the dissolution of different types of carbonate bedrock. A combined approach of multivariate statistical analysis and standard hydrochemical methods enabled the separation of groundwater with the highest compositional changes as points of the strongest artificial influence in the narrow tunnel zone. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hydrochemical changes; Hydrogeochemical processes; Karst aquifer; Multivariate statistical analysis; Pressurized water tunnel","aquifer; groundwater; hydrogeochemistry; karst hydrology; multivariate analysis; tunnel; water chemistry; water quality; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081246646

It appears to be unknown whether the use of a PM2.5 filtration device can improve small airway physiology and respiratory inflammation in children with asthma. Objective: To discover what pathophysiological changes in the small airways are associated with using a PM2.5-removing device in the bedrooms of children with asthma. Design, Setting, and Participants: Children with mild or moderate asthma were enrolled in this double-blind, crossover study. The participants used a true filtration device and a sham filtration device in their bedrooms in a random order for 2 weeks each with a 2-week washout interval. The study was conducted in a suburb of Shanghai, China, during a low-ozone season. Exposures: Ozone and PM2.5 were measured inside bedrooms and outside a window. Main Outcomes and Measures: Impulse oscillometry, spirometry, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide were measured at the beginning and the end of each intervention. Peak expiratory flow was measured twice daily at home. Results: Forty-three children (5-13 years old; 26 boys [60%]) participated. Outdoor 24-hour mean PM2.5 concentrations were moderately high, ranging from 28.6 to 69.8 μg/m3 (median, 53 μg/m3). During true filtration, bedroom PM2.5 concentrations were a mean (SD) of 63.4% (35.9%) lower than during sham filtration. Compared with sham filtration, true filtration was significantly associated with improved airway mechanics, reflected in a 24.4% (95% CI, 11.8%-37.1%) reduction in total airway resistance, a 43.5% (95% CI, 13.7%-73.3%) reduction in small airway resistance, a 22.2% (95% CI, 2.2%-42.2%) reduction in resonant frequency, and a 73.1% (95% CI, 0.3%-145.8%) increase in airway reactance. True filtration was also associated with significant improvements in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (a 27.6% [95% CI, 8.9%-42.4%] reduction) and peak expiratory flow (a 1.6% [95% CI, 0.8%-2.5%] increase). These improvements were significantly associated with bedroom PM2.5 reduction. Improvements in small airway function were nonsignificant (8.4% [95% CI, -1.4% to 18.3%]) in all participants but significant (13.2% [95% CI, 1.2%-25.1%]) in participants without eosinophilic airway inflammation at baseline. No improvements were observed for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume during the first second, and the ratio of these in all participants or subgroups. Conclusions and Relevance: Per these results, indoor PM2.5 filtration can be a practical method to improve air flow in an asthmatic lung through improved airway mechanics and function as well as reduced inflammation. This warrants a clinical trial to confirm. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03282864. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short-and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical. © 2020, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

For instance, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and network-enabled appliances/devices have escalated the expectations of what technology could do for the acceptance of DR programs. In this work, we design, deploy on a scalable pilot testbed, and evaluate a collaboration-based approach to the demand-side management of a community of electricity consumers that jointly targets green consumption. The design of the framework architecture is centralized via the so-called aggregator, which optimizes the demand scheduled by consumers along with their time frame preferences towards the maximization of the consumption of renewables. On the pilot, we opt for lightweight, yet efficient platforms such as Raspberry Pi boards,and evaluate them over a series of network protocols, i.e., MQTT-TLS and CoAP-DTLS, paying special attention to the security and privacy of the communications over Z-Wave, ZigBee, andWiFi. The experiments conducted are configured using two active Living Labs datasets from which we extract three community scenarios that vary according to the flexibility or rigidity of the appliances' operation time frame demand. During the performance evaluation, processing and communication overheads lie within feasible ranges, i.e., the aggregator requires less than 2 s to schedule a small consumer community with four appliances, whereas the latency of its link to households' controllers adds less than 100 ms. In addition, we demonstrate that our implementations running over WiFi links and UDP sockets on Raspberry Pi 4 boards are fast, though insecure. By contrast, secure CoAP (with DTLS) offers data encryption, automatic key management, and integrity protection, as well as authentication with acceptable overheads. © 2020 by the authors.","CoAP; Consumption scheduling; Cooperative demand response; MQTT; Performance evaluation; Raspberry Pi board; Renewable supply; TLS/DTLS","Carbon footprint; Cryptography; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Network protocols; Smart city; Testbeds; Communication overheads; Consumer communities; Electricity consumers; Framework architecture; Integrity protection; Internet of thing (IOT); Security and privacy; Technology sectors; Network security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086401858

This paper responds to these concerns through a distinctive longitudinal, whole sector analysis of the siting decisions of 111 gas-fired power station projects in England and Wales, from 1988 to 2019. Evidence shows that over 67,000 MW of new capacity has been consented, with few insurmountable siting problems, with place providing an important explanatory element. The fact that many projects were able to re-inhabit sites of former coal- and oil-fired power stations enabled developers successfully to mobilise arguments that gas power was a net environmental improvement, while obviating or deflecting objections based on place and landscape. The combination of site choice and consenting rules also helped gas-fired power stations nullify challenges based on the systemic risks of burning gas, and negotiate climate change policy constraints.

Exploiting solar energy implies a reduction of the network operation cost as well as of the carbon footprint of radio access networks. However, previous research works indicate that the area of the solar panels that are necessary to power a standard macro base station (BS) is large, making the solar panel deployment problematic, especially within urban areas.In this paper we use a modeling approach based on Markov reward processes to investigate the possibility of combining a connection to the power grid with small area solar panels and small batteries to run a macro base station. By so doing, it is possible to exploit a significant fraction of renewable energy to run a radio access network, while also reducing the cost incurred by the network operator to power its base stations. We assume that energy is drawn from the power grid only when needed to keep the BS operational, or during the night, which corresponds to the period with lowest electricity price. The proposed energy management policies have advantages in terms of both cost and carbon footprint. Our results show that solar panels of the order of 1-2 kW peak, i.e., with a surface of about 5-10 m2, combined with limited capacity energy storage (of the order of 1-5 kWh, corresponding to about 1-2 car batteries) and a smart energy management policy, can lead to an effective exploitation of renewable energy. © 2020 IEEE.","Base station; Energy consumption; Green networking; Radio access network; Renewable energy; Solar panel","Base stations; Carbon footprint; Computer networks; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy management; Macros; Microgrids; Radio access networks; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Electricity prices; Management policy; Markov reward process; Mobile network operators; Network operations; Power requirement; Renewable energies; Use of renewable energies; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092723816

The geological mapping of the outcropping volcanic rocks reveals that they follow three well marked lineaments of cortical weakness (Teruel, Caudiel and Alcublas Fault Zones), probably caused by the faulting related to the opening and sea‒floor spreading of the Ligurian and Alpine Tethys oceans. The present work introduces the results of the study, which aims to evaluate the tectonosedimentary evolution of a shallow submarine setting affected by volcanism during the Aalenian‒Bajocian boundary (Middle Jurassic). This site, known as “Caudiel volcanic outcrop”, is located at the southeastern part of the Caudiel Fault Zone. The presence of positive subaqueous volcaniclastic reliefs, added to shallow marine platforms, strongly affects the depth‒dependent carbonate sedimentation: it induces substantial changes in lithofacies compared to other neighboring areas, or even directly prevents the sedimentation. Moreover, episodic normal fault activity generated a dynamic topography over time, with variable rates of both subsidence and uplifting throughout different areas. The Caudiel outcrop represents a good ancient example of interaction between multiple factors (volcanism, tectonism and sedimentation) in shallow carbonate platforms, where the accommodation changes and the sedimentation rates seem to be subordinate to the local tectonic disturbances.

We present mock emission-line maps of highly resolved CGM gas from the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) project and link these maps back to physical and spatial properties of the gas. In particular, we examine the ionization source leading to most O vi emission and how resolution affects the physical properties of the gas generating the emission. Finally, when increasing the spatial resolution alone, the total luminosity of the line emission increases by an order of magnitude for some lines considered. Current integral field unit instruments like Keck Cosmic Web Imager and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer should be able to detect the brightest knots and filaments of such emission, and use this to infer the bulk kinematics of the CGM gas with respect to the galaxy. We conclude that the spatial resolution of simulated CGM gas can significantly influence the distribution of gas temperatures, densities, and metallicities that contribute to a given observable region. Greater spatial resolution than has been typically included in cosmological simulations to date is needed to properly interpret observations in terms of the underlying gas structure driving emission. © 2020.

Traditional “one-by-one” pattern refinement needs complementary approaches, useful to handle hundreds to thousands of X-ray patterns. Principal-component analysis (PCA) has been applied to these fields in the last few years to speed up analysis with the specific goals of assessing data quality, identifying patterns where a reaction occurs, and extracting the kinetics. PCA is applied to the adsorption/desorption of Xe and CO2 within a Y zeolite. CO2 sequestration is a key issue in relation to climate change, while Xe is a critical raw material, and its purification is an important topic for the industry. At first, results were compared to traditional sequential Rietveld refinement. CO2-Y data were also compared with in situ single crystal data to investigate the different potentialities of PCA in the two cases. Two CO2 adsorption sites were confirmed, while three Xe sites were identified. CO2 showed a more linear adsorption trend with decreasing temperature, while Xe showed a more sigmoidal-like trend. Xe only showed site-dependent behavior in adsorption. Finally, PCA and correlation analysis, applied to analyze the parameters obtained from Rietveld refinement, highlighted finer details: in particular, this approach showed that the Y zeolite framework responded differently to CO2 and Xe adsorption. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 sequestration; In situ X-ray powder diffraction; Principal-component analysis; Rietveld refinement; Xe purification; Y zeolite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086028696

The main results are as follows: daily variation in the PM10 and PM2.5 concentration had the similar trend with the lowest value at midday and relatively high values in the morning and at nightfall. In the forest ecosystem, the trend of PM10 concentration at three heights followed the order: 6 m &gt; 10 m &gt; 1.5 m, while that of the PM2.5 followed the order 1.5 m &gt; 10 m &gt; 6 m.

Results showed that around 80% of the influent ammonia was efficiently removed by the system when both N-SBR and S-SBR operated with volumetric nitrogen loading rate (vNLR) of 1.64–1.72 kgN/m3 d and 0.60–0.63 kgN/m3 d, respectively.

Anthropogenic climate-change compounds negative effects of land-use change on forest persistence and forest-dependent biodiversity. Habitat loss and climate change have an additive effect and drive species’ extinctions in similar ways, resulting in a homogenization of biodiversity. Connectivity is key in conservation planning for mitigating climate change effects and facilitating species’ abilities to disperse throughout remnant habitat and track their climate niches. We used three forest-specialized and habitat-specific bird species as focal species to understand avian connectivity and conservation of each of South Africa's three threatened forest classes, as each species is range-restricted to its respective forest type. Location: South Africa. Methods: We created ensemble models of species’ distributions and combined core home- and breeding-range patches with a hybrid of least-cost pathways and ecological circuit theory linkages to assess the success of corridors in facilitating connectivity of each of the three forest types. We then predicted the likelihood of niche persistence for each species under future climate-change scenarios, and the efficacy of our connectivity modelling to facilitate range expansion or climate-niche tracking. Results: The projected habitat loss under climate-change scenarios impacted core-habitat patch distribution, size and connectivity, exacerbated habitat fragmentation and increased resistance and the severity of pinch points and barriers along dispersal corridors. Forest systems and associated focal species projected to experience the highest levels of habitat loss/contraction occurred at mid- to high elevations. Climate-change resilience across ecosystems, and persistence of species therein, was dependent on connectivity, facilitating species’ ability to track specific climate niches. Main conclusions: Climate-change resilience of ecosystems, and persistence of biodiversity therein, is most likely to be a product of high functional biodiversity, connectedness and the ability of species to track specific climate niches. 2020 The Authors.

In this paper, the north slope of the Minfeng sub-sag in the Bohai Bay Basin was taken as an example. The Wells Yanxie 233, Yongxie 932 and Yan 22 were selected for on-site carbon isotope detection. Then, based on sufficient carbon isotope data which were acquired on the drilling site using the brand-new carbon isotopic measuring instrument, the carbon isotope data and composition data of natural gas produced in this area were compared. And combined with the evolution of source rocks, the geochemical characteristics of crude oil, the depositional environment of reservoirs and the physical properties, single-well charging characteristics and regional charging area of natural gas were analyzed. Finally, the feasibility of on-site carbon isotope detection method to discriminate hydrocarbon charging was discussed. And the following research results were obtained. First, deep hydrocarbon charging happened in the Purely Purely Lower Sha 4 Member in Well Yanxie 233, and its natural gas is the mixture of the oil cracking gas of deep layers and the thermal cracking gas of autochthonous source rocks. Second, the natural gas in the third and fourth Members of Shahejie Formation in Well Yongxie 932 is the thermal cracking gas of autochthonous source rocks, but deep gas charging occurred in particular hole sections. Third, the carbon isotope of associated gas in Well block Yan 22 is high in the central area and low in both sides and high in the south and low in the north, which is accordant with the distribution characteristics of reservoir physical properties, indicating that the charging of high-maturity natural gas is under the control of reservoir physical properties. Fourth, the oil in Well block Yan 22 is the product of autochthonous source rocks in the mature stage while the natural gas is the autochthonous oil-associated gas combined with the charging of deep high-maturity product. It is concluded that there is a high-maturity hydrocarbon charging area in the northwest of the northern slope of the Minfeng sub-sag, and it is a favorable hydrocarbon exploration target. What's more, the on-site carbon isotope rapid detection technology can provide a large number of continuous three-dimensional carbon isotope data, and it can be used to quickly analyze the characteristics of hydrocarbon charging and determine the source and origin of hydrocarbon, so as to provide reference for hydrocarbon development deployment. © 2020 Sichuan Petroleum Administration","Bohai bay basin; Carbon isotope of natural gas; Gas source; Hydrocarbon charging; Hydrocarbon origin; Minfeng subsag; On-site detection; Tight oil and gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085680394

Recently, studies regarding the economic advantages of adopting EVs as energy storages for commercial/residential buildings are emerging. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumes more energy than all of the other sectors combined, which is about 54% of the world's total delivered energy. The energy consumption pattern in manufacturing facilities is based on production schedules and the heat transfer between machines and the ambient surroundings, thus, differs greatly from commercial/residential buildings. However, little research attention has been given to analyse the synergies of integrating EVs and manufacturing facilities to improve energy efficiency. To fill this research gap, in this study, a comprehensive model is established to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of an energy sharing system that consists of the EVs, power grid, and manufacturing facilities (EPM) under Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity tariff. The model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming format by considering practical production schedules, heat exchange between machines and ambient surroundings, as well as the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The case study results indicate that the presented EPMenergy sharing system has great potential to reduce energy cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, compared to the results from winter scenarios, it is shown that more cost savings can be achieved in summer days. © 2020 by the authors.","Cost modelling; Electric vehicles; Manufacturing facility; Smart grid; Time-of-use electricity tariff","air conditioning; cost analysis; electric vehicle; electricity; energy use; heat transfer; manufacturing; tariff structure; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087789648

The results indicate that two clusters-""nature-seeking responsible tourists"" and ""wellness-seeking responsible tourists""-were selected as Bali's target clusters. Since both have higher motivation and a more responsible attitude than other clusters, they are capable of not only sustaining a symbiotic relationship between the ecotourism destination and the visitor, but also attracting potential tourists with similar characteristics, ultimately contributing to the sustainable tourism business in the region.

In this region, as much as 50% of near-surface permafrost is composed of thermally sensitive ground ice that when melted produces substantial changes in topography and microbiome conditions. We take advantage of natural variations in permafrost melt to conduct a space-for-time study on Ellesmere Island in northern Canada. We demonstrate that phenological timing can be delayed in thermokarst areas when compared to stable ground, and that this change is a function of shifting species composition in these vegetation communities as well as delayed timing within species. These findings suggest that a warming climate could result in an overall broadening of blooming and leafing windows at the landscape level when these delayed timings are taken into consideration with the projected advance of phenological timings in ice-poor areas. We emphasize that the impacts of geomorphic processes on key phenological drivers are essential for enhancing our understanding of community response to climate warming in the high Arctic, with implications for ecosystem functioning and trophic interactions. © Copyright © 2020 Chisholm, Becker and Pollard.","Arctic; flower phenology; geomorphology; ground stability; leaf phenology; permafrost; plant ecology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087688827

Women’s vulnerability to climate change has implications on agro-based livelihoods, especially the rural populace. The primary purpose of this study was to assess women’s vulnerability to climate change and the gender-skewed implications on agro-based livelihoods in rural Zvishavane, Zimbabwe. A qualitative approach that used purposive sampling techniques was adopted. Data was collected through 20 in-depth interviews with 11 de jure and 9 de facto small-scale female-headed farmer households. Two focus group discussions with mixed de facto and de jure small-scale female-headed farmer households were also conducted. Five key informant interviews were held with departmental heads of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Gender and Community Development; the Agriculture Technical Extension Service Department; the Livestock Production Department; the Runde Rural District Council and the Meteorological Services Department. Gendered effects were noted in terms of increased roles and responsibilities for women. Observations showed that there was an increase in distances travelled by women to fetch water owing to a depleted water table. Climate-induced migration of men due to depleted livelihoods in rural areas has also increased roles and responsibilities for women. The traditional male responsibilities assumed by women included cattle herding and ox-driven ploughing. This study concluded that adaptation strategies towards vulnerability to climate change have to be gender-sensitive and area-specific. This study also recommended that response programmes and policies meant to curb existing gendered vulnerabilities should be informed by evidence because climate-change effects are unique for different geographical areas. Moreover, adaptation activities should be mainstreamed in community processes so as to reduce the burden on women and increase sustainability opportunities. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","Climate change; de facto household head; de jure household head; gender; smallholder farmers; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086575735

The association of PM exposure with deteriorating brain health is speculated to be driven by PM entry via the olfactory system. How air pollutants affect this key entry site remains elusive. In this study, we investigated effects of urban size-segregated PM on a novel cellular model: primary human olfactory mucosal (hOM) cells. Results: Metabolic activity was reduced following 24-h exposure to PM without evident signs of toxicity. Results from cytometric bead array suggested a mild inflammatory response to PM exposure. We observed increased oxidative stress and caspase-3/7 activity as well as perturbed mitochondrial membrane potential in PM-exposed cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction was further verified by a decrease in mitochondria-dependent respiration. Transient suppression of the mitochondria-targeted gene, neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1), was carried out, after being identified to be up-regulated in PM2.5-1 treated cells via RNA sequencing. Suppression of NPTX1 in cells exposed to PM did not restore mitochondrial defects resulting from PM exposure. In contrast, PM-induced adverse effects were magnified in the absence of NPTX1, indicating a critical role of this protein in protection against PM effects in hOM cells. Conclusion: Key mitochondrial functions were perturbed by urban PM exposure in a physiologically relevant cellular model via a mechanism involving NPTX1. In addition, inflammatory response and early signs of apoptosis accompanied mitochondrial dysfunction during exposure to PM. Findings from this study contribute to increased understanding of harmful PM effects on human health and may provide information to support mitigation strategies targeted at air pollution. © 2020 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Inflammation; Mitochondria; NPTX1; olfactory system; oxidative stress; particulate matter","caspase 3; caspase 7; gamma interferon; lactate dehydrogenase; mitochondrial DNA; pentraxin; pentraxin 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; C reactive protein; cytokine; nerve protein; neuronal pentraxin; transcriptome; air pollution; apoptosis; Article; controlled study; cytokine release; gene; human; human cell; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial respiration; mucosa cell; olfactory mucosa; oxidative stress; particulate matter; pentraxin 1 gene; priority journal; RNA sequencing; transcriptomics; urban area; aged; air pollutant; animal; cell culture; cell culture technique; city; drug effect; genetics; immunology; inflammation; male; metabolism; middle aged; mitochondrion; olfactory mucosa; particle size; pathology; toxicity; urbanization; Aged; Air Pollutants; Animals; Apoptosis; C-Reactive Protein; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Cities; Cytokines; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Middle Aged; Mitochondria; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Olfactory Mucosa; Oxidative Stress; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Transcriptome; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085854107

The presence of an acid-base disturbance can affect clinical outcomes and is usually caused by an underlying disease. It is, therefore, important to assess the acid-base status of patients, and the extent to which various therapeutic treatments are effective in controlling these acid-base alterations. In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of the physiological regulation of an HCO3 =CO2 buering system, an abundant and powerful buering system, using Henderson-Hasselbalch kinetics. We simulate the normal physiological state and four cardinal acidbase disorders: Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. We show that the model accurately predicts serum pH over a range of clinical conditions. In addition to qualitative validation, we compare the in silico results with clinical data on acid-base homeostasis and alterations, finding clear relationships between primary acid-base disturbances and the secondary adaptive compensatory responses. We also show that the predicted primary disturbances accurately resemble clinically observed compensatory responses. Furthermore, via sensitivity analysis, key parameters were identified which could be the most effective in regulating systemic pH in healthy individuals, and those with chronic kidney disease and distal and proximal renal tubular acidosis. The model presented here may provide pathophysiologic insights and can serve as a tool to assess the safety and effcacy of different therapeutic interventions to control or correct acid-base disorders. © 2020 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Cold releases from the reservoir hypolimnion can depress downstream river temperature during warm seasons. Recent large-scale climate change studies on stream temperature have largely ignored reservoir thermal stratification. In this study, we used established models to develop a framework which considers water demand and reservoir regulation with thermal stratification and applied this model framework to the southeastern United States. About half of all 271 reservoirs in our study area retain strong thermal stratification by the 2080s (2070–2099) under RCP8.5 even as median residence times decrease to 60 days from 69 days in the historic period (1979–2010). Reservoir impacts on downstream temperatures become slightly weaker in the future because of higher air temperature and stronger solar radiation. We defined a “cooling potential” to quantify the thermal energy that a water body can absorb before exceeding a water temperature threshold. In the future, higher river temperatures will reduce the cooling potential for all river segments, but more so for river segments minimally impacted by thermal stratification. Reservoir impacts on cooling potential remain strong for river segments downstream of reservoirs with strong thermal stratification. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of our findings to errors in the hydrological simulations. Although river segments subject to reservoir regulation are more sensitive to errors in hydrology than those without regulation impacts, our overall findings do not materially change due to these errors. ©2020.

At initial pressures between 10.0 bar and 60.0 bar, initial temperatures between 750 K and 1350 K and equivalence ratios between 0.5 and 2.0, the ignition delays and key species profiles (C2H5OH, CO2, O2) of the reduced mechanism deviated by 0.5 order and 40%, respectively as compared to the experimental measurements.

As an area that accounts for more than 50% of China's economy, east region of China has taken the lead in developing and focusing on promoting industrial upgrading based on the innovation-driven development strategy. The potential solution of transforming China's manufacturing industry is to enhance the capability of independent innovation by increasing the investment in research and development. Research on the sustainable development capacity of east region manufacturing industry has been giving important guidance for upgrading the manufacturing industry all over China. However, few studies explore the research and development effect on the energy-saving potential of manufacturing at the regional level, and study the individual dynamic behavior to reflect industry heterogeneity. In this paper, the dynamic panel data research method is employed to explore the influence of the research and development on energy conservation while introducing macroeconomic variables. Additionally, block bootstrap-based scenario analysis is employed to predict the energy conservation of manufacturing in east region in 2020 and 2025 based on historical annual data from 1990 to 2016.

PM2.5 is the primary air pollutant across China. Quantifying interactions between meteorological conditions and PM2.5 concentrations are essential to understand the variability of PM2.5 and seek methods to control PM2.5. Since 2013, the measurement of PM2.5 has been widely made at 1436 stations across the country and more than 300 papers focusing on PM2.5-meteorology interactions have been published. This article is a comprehensive review on the meteorological impact on PM2.5 concentrations. We start with an introduction of general meteorological conditions and PM2.5 concentrations across China, and then seasonal and spatial variations of meteorological influences on PM2.5 concentrations. Next, major methods used to quantify meteorological influences on PM2.5 concentrations are checked and compared. We find that causality analysis methods are more suitable for extracting the influence of individual meteorological factors whilst statistical models are good at quantifying the overall effect of multiple meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) have the potential to provide dynamic estimation of PM2.5 concentrations by considering anthropogenic emissions and the transport and evolution of pollutants. We then comprehensively examine the mechanisms how major meteorological factors may impact the PM2.5 concentrations, including the dispersion, growth, chemical production, photolysis, and deposition of PM2.5. The feedback effects of PM2.5 concentrations on meteorological factors are also carefully examined. Based on this review, suggestions on future research and major meteorological approaches for mitigating PM2.5 pollution are made finally. © 2020 The Authors","Causality model; CTM; Interaction mechanism; Meteorological condition; PM2.5; Statistical model","Air pollution; Photolysis; Anthropogenic emissions; Chemical production; Chemical transport models; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Meteorological influence; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial variations; Atmospheric movements; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution control; seasonal variation; spatial variation; China; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; photolysis; pollutant; quantitative analysis; review; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; meteorology; particulate matter; season; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082815991

Therefore, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) footprint reductions in agroecosystems have become an increasingly popular topic related to global climate change and agricultural adaptation. The LCA method was used to calculate the product and farm C footprint (CF) and N footprint (NF) of double rice, rice-wheat and wheat-maize production based on governmental statistical datasets and published results. The spatial and temporal patterns of CF and NF were analyzed in China during 2004–2017, and their driving factors were analyzed to identify potential mitigation strategies. The results showed that of the various inputs, fertilizer application and diesel oil consumption contributed the most to both GHG and Nr emissions from farm inputs in the grain crop production process. The CFs for double rice, rice-wheat and wheat-maize were 0.83, 0.74, and 0.37 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1 at the yield scale, respectively. In addition, the NFs were 11.6, 13.4, and 15.4 gN-eq kg−1 year−1 at the yield scale for double rice, rice-wheat and wheat-maize, respectively. The largest fraction of CF and NF was the share of CH4 emissions and NH3 volatilization from the field soil, respectively. The annual CFs and NFs of the multiple crop in the southwestern provinces were higher than those in the central and northern provinces. The annual GHG and Nr emissions from the multiple crop maintained a relatively stable state from 2004 to 2017. The proportion of CO2/Nr production was partly reflected a soil C/N ratio, suggesting a higher C abundance for the double rice production, which could be used as a reference parameter for crop structure adjustment in the future. Based on our results and other studies, some effective solutions, especially optimized fertilization, farm machinery operation efficiencies and changes in regional allocation of grain cropping areas, are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and eutrophication on the main grain crop production in China. © 2019","Carbon footprint; China; Crop production; Cropland; Nitrogen footprint; Spatial and temporal patterns",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078989549

Trees can mitigate GHG emissions as a result of CO2 uptake during growth; but GHGs are emitted when the branches and/or leaves are used as compost or fuel for energy production at the end of its life. A 41-year period (1976–2017) of the street trees along the sidewalks of the Tianliao river in Keelong city in Taiwan was taken a case study. The results showed that planting street trees helps mitigate climate change by reducing total GHG emissions (15 661 t CO2-eq) and producing an amount of renewable energy ((Formula presented.) kWh), that is around 1% of the renewable energy generated by 24 waste-to-energy plants in Taiwan. The GHG mitigation during the lifespans of street trees can efficiently compensate for the GHG emissions that occur during end-of-life treatment (including both incineration and composting). On average, around 40 t CO2-eq of GHG mitigation would be achieved by planting a street tree.

Here, we first used a fuzzy-logic expert system to quantitatively estimate the vulnerability and potential impact risks of climate change for fish species in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea (BSYS). The mean (±s.d.) vulnerability and the impact-risk indices for 25 dominant fish species were 51 ± 22 and 62 ± 12 respectively (with the highest possible value being 100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario). Miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) was found to have the highest impact risk, whereas the glowbelly (Acropoma japonicum) had the lowest. Demersal fishes tended to be more vulnerable than pelagic fishes, whereas the opposite was found for impact risks. No significant correlation was found between species biomass and vulnerability (P > 0.05). The assessment provided a comprehensive framework for evaluating climate effects in the BSYS and suggested that interspecific and habitat group differences should be considered when developing future climate-adaptive fishery policies and management measures in this region, as well as similar systems elsewhere in the world. © 2020 CSIRO.","dominant fish species; fishery management; vulnerability assessments","assessment method; climate change; climate effect; fishing mortality; perciform; sustainability; vulnerability; Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; Miichthys miiuy; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076413842

The study developed spatial analysis models in ArcGIS with a high-resolution elevation data set (1 m raster base map) and summarized the scenario assessments of the associations between healthcare and the populations vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The results reveal that 34.3% of low-income households could reach hospitals in the baseline scenario. In the peak water level (PWL) (140) scenario, 33.3% of low-income households were within 30 min of the nearest hospital. In the baseline scenario, hospitals were accessible to 35.9% of the general population, whereas in the PWL (140) scenario the percentage was slightly lower, with 35.1% having access to hospitals. Healthcare reform increased the accessibility of hospitals to low-income households, and these populations had equal access in the PWL (140) scenario. However, access to healthcare is controlled by distance and other variables, including income, insurance, spatial distribution, and transportation mobility.

In recent years, with the economic growth of the Greater Mekong Sub-region countries, the demand for electricity has been growing rapidly, and that might lead larger CO2 emissions. Fortunately, there are abundant hydroelectric power resources in this region, and huge potential for complementarity in the supply and demand of electricity among countries. In this paper, an economic optimal dispatching model for thermal and hydroelectric generating units is introduced, and the effects of interconnections and cross-border power trade on the CO2 emissions in the Greater Mekong Sub-region are investigated. Finally, through a concrete example, it can be proved that after the implementation of interconnection and cross-border electricity trade in the Greater Mekong Sub-region, the CO2 emissions will be greatly reduced. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Hydroelectric power; Economic growths; Electricity trade; Hydroelectric generating unit; Member countries; Optimal dispatching; People's Republic of China; Supply and demand; Yunnan province; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087075235

However, climatic effects of land management practices have been little discussed and compared to land-use impacts. As land-atmosphere interactions via surface fluxes are particularly strong during the warm season, we investigate the impacts of historical land use and present irrigation practices on summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere using the most recent version of Community Earth System Model. Our results suggest that historical land use leads to an overall cooling in the middle latitudes and a warming in the tropics, and the sign and magnitude of the changes in temperature depend on the type of land cover change. On the other hand, summer irrigation leads to a significant cooling over many irrigated areas due to enhanced evapotranspiration, and the local cooling is comparable to and even stronger than the land-use effects. Both land use and irrigation can also significantly influence the intensity and frequency of hot extremes. Land use shows stronger impacts during the night through ground heat flux feedback, while irrigation shows stronger impacts during the day through latent heat flux feedback. Our comparison demonstrates the importance of irrigation in local and regional climate, highlighting the necessity of considering such land management practices in future assessments of regional climate change and climate mitigation. © Copyright © 2020 Chen and Dirmeyer.","CESM2; climate modeling; irrigation; land use – land cover change; land-atmosphere interaction","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Heat flux; Irrigation; Anthropogenic forcing; Climate mitigations; Irrigation practices; Land atmosphere interaction; Land management practices; Northern Hemispheres; Regional climate changes; Summer temperature; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087681528

This study attempts to fill this gap by researching the regional disparity and influencing factors of CP of China’s transportation industry over the 10th, 11th, and 12th Five-Year plan periods. Specifically, we developed an integrated CP decomposition approach by combining the Log Mean Decomposition Index approach and production-theoretical decomposition approach. As such, CP was first decomposed into technological innovation effect, regional adjustment effect, CO2 emission efficiency effect, and technical change of CO2 emissions effect. The results revealed the following: (1) during the study period, China’s transportation CP showed a general downward trend; (2) regional disparity in CP narrowed primarily because of intragroup inequity; (3) technological innovation effect and total-factor regional adjustment effect on CP change did not play a significant role in prompting CP.

The accuracy of the air quality prediction also affects the planning of people's outdoor activities. How to mine effective information from historical data of air pollution and reduce unimportant factors to predict the law of pollution change is of great significance for pollution prevention, pollution control and pollution early warning. In this paper, we take into account that there are different trends in air pollutants and that different climatic factors have different effects on air pollutants. Firstly, the data of air pollutants in different cities are collected by a sliding window technology, and the data of different cities in the sliding window are clustered by Kohonen method to find the same tends in air pollutants. On this basis, combined with the weather data, we use the ReliefF method to extract the characteristics of climate factors that helpful for prediction. Finally, different types of air pollutants and corresponding extracted the characteristics of climate factors are used to train different sub models. The experimental results of different algorithms with different air pollutants show that this method not only improves the accuracy of air quality prediction, but also improves the operation efficiency. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Additives applied to the swine manure surface are popular, marketed products to solve this problem and relatively inexpensive and easy for farmers to use. There is no scientific data evaluating the effectiveness of many of these products. We evaluated 12 manure additive products that are currently being marketed on their effectiveness in mitigating odor and gaseous emissions from swine manure. We used a pilot-scale system simulating the storage of swine manure with a controlled ventilation of headspace and periodic addition of manure. This dataset contains measured concentrations and estimated emissions of target gases in manure headspace above treated and untreated swine manure. These include ammonia (NH3 ), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and odor. The experiment to test each manure additive product lasted for two months; the measurements of NH3 and H2 S were completed twice a week; others were conducted weekly. The manure for each test was collected from three different farms in central Iowa to provide the necessary variety in stored swine manure properties. This dataset is useful for further analyses of gaseous emissions from swine manure under simulated storage conditions and for performance comparison of marketed products for the mitigation of gaseous emissions. Ultimately, swine farmers, the regulatory community, and the public need to have scientific data informing decisions about the usefulness of manure additives. © 2020 by the authors.

This situation is forcing farmers in the region of Murcia in Spain to modernize their irrigation systems to optimize use of the scarce water they have and seek a circular water economy using the recovered water. Moreover, an associated problem is the need for energy that these facilities require in order to pressurize the required water. The use of photovoltaic generation contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Food produced in this region tends to have guaranteed markets in Europe and, geographically, due to the high quality of phytosanitary controls and traceability during their marketing, their optimal cultivation, and selection and labelling is verified, specifying valuable information such as: collection date, origin, the use of organic fertilizers among others. To maintain market access, it is important to continue implementing other environmental improvements, i.e., reductions in either hydro or carbon footprints. Previous studies have failed to include the prospect of environmental use of isolated facilities to replace existing consumption, seeking the monetarization of the facility as well as prioritizing the reduction of GHG. Previous studies have failed to include the perspective of environmental use of isolated photovoltaic installations, based on existing consumption, thus, going beyond the monetarization of the facility, to prioritize the reduction of GHG applied in practice by environmentally sensitized farmers.

To bridge this gap in the literature, our research analyzes how climate-related variability affects different livelihood activities involving management of natural resources in Madre de Dios in Peru, located in the southwestern Amazon. Madre de Dios fell within the epicenters of both the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts. We examine one key question: What are the effects of extreme climatic events on different livelihood activities in communities located across Madre de Dios? We apply the key concepts of livelihood vulnerability to guide our conceptual framework. This concept organized our field inquiry, which consisted of survey questionnaires applied to rural producers and workshops with diverse stakeholders. Results show that climatic variability has affected many local livelihood activities and thereby increased the vulnerability of rural communities in Madre de Dios. The greatest impacts were felt in agriculture due to increased temperatures and fires followed by high winds and heavy rains. Our findings bear implications for science communication for policy. Climate politics will advance action on climate change if the tactic is to focus on how climate change means extreme climatic events that will cause damage to people, property, and livelihoods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change variability; Fire; Madre de Dios; Peru; Rural livelihood; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085976025

The objective of this study was to evaluate the environmental performance of different dietary patterns among U.S. adults using life cycle assessment (LCA). A “typical” dietary pattern was compared with those recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including “healthy U.S.”, Mediterranean and lacto-ovo vegetarian. Supplemental functional units (FUs) were applied to incorporate the functions of food to provide nutrition and satiety, namely Nutrient Rich Foods Index 9.3 (NRF9.3), Nutritional Quality Index (NQI), and Fullness Factor™ (FF). Life cycle inventory data was collected for 14 food categories consisting of 76 component foods, and their midpoint environmental impacts were calculated, with particular focus on global warming potential. Diets in accordance with different patterns were constructed from selected component foods at a reference energy amount of 2000 kcal. Vegetarian diets on average generated the lowest carbon footprint regardless of the FU. However, large possible variations in the environmental profiles of the compared diets were identified due to the wide range of food choices within a pattern, which showed highly different nutrition and satiety scores even within the same food category. Animal products, including meat and dairy especially, and discretionary foods were identified as the specific food categories that contributed the most to the global warming potential. Discretionary foods consistently exhibited higher impacts on the basis of nutritional FUs due to their low nutrient density. The results can be implied as practical guidelines to help reduce the carbon footprint associated with current U.S. diets without compromising their nutritional adequacy and satiety. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dietary pattern; Functional unit; Life cycle assessment; Nutrition; Satiety; Sustainability","Carbon footprint; Emission control; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Nutrients; Sustainable development; Dietary patterns; Environmental performance; Environmental profile; Functional units; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory datum; Satiety; Nutrition; adult; carbon footprint; diet; environmental impact; food production; guideline; nutrition; sustainability; adult; American; animal product; article; carbon footprint; controlled study; dietary pattern; greenhouse effect; human; lactoovovegetarian; life cycle assessment; nutrient; nutritional value; practice guideline; satiety; vegetarian diet; animal; diet; meat; nutrition policy; United States; United States; Animalia; Spondias purpurea; Animals; Diet; Meat; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Value; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081680826

This study estimates the carbon emissions in the BREC from 2005 to 2017. To evaluate the impact of energy consumption structure on carbon emission performance in this region, a directional distance function is constructed, and two scenarios are assumed. Then, a two-stage allocation model is established to allocate the carbon emission quotas in 2030. The results indicate the following: (1) Carbon emission intensity tends to decrease and there are large differences among provinces. (2) Energy consumption structure has a great effect on carbon emission performance, ignoring energy consumption structure will underestimate carbon emission performance. (3) Total accumulated carbon emission targets are 85.20 billion tons, 82.36 billion tons and 79.62 billion tons at the high, medium and low economic growth rates.

Consequently, alleviating the effects of global warming and climate change necessitates substantial reductions in the use of fossil fuel energy. This paper uses a financial market-based approach to investigate whether positive stock returns cause changes in CO2 emissions, or vice-versa, based on the Granger causality test to determine cause and effect, or leader and follower. If Granger causality can be determined in any direction, this will enable a clear directional statement regarding temporal predictability between stock returns and CO2 emissions. The empirical data include annual CO2 emissions from fuel combustion of the three main fossil energy sources, namely coal, oil and gas, based on 18 countries with sophisticated financial markets that are in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)World Index from 1971 to 2017. The empirical results show clearly that all the statistically significant causality findings are unidirectional from the stock market returns to CO2 emissions from coal, oil and gas, but not the reverse. More importantly, the regression results suggest that when stock returns rise by 1%, CO2 emissions from coal combustion decrease by 9% among the countries that are included in MSCI World Index. Furthermore, when stock returns rise 1%, CO2 emissions from oil combustion increase by 2%, but stock returns have no significant effect on CO2 emissions from gas combustion. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Granger causality; Predictability; Sophisticated financial markets; stock market returns","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Commerce; Financial markets; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Investments; Statistical tests; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; Fossil energy sources; Global warming and climate changes; Granger causality test; Market-based approach; Substantial reduction; Temporal predictability; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086380671

Habitability depends on temperature, which is set by insolation and the greenhouse effect, due mainly to CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 level is increased by volcanic outgassing and decreased by continental and seafloor weathering. Here, I examine the climate evolution of Earth-like planets using a globally averaged climate model that includes both weathering types. Climate is sensitive to the relative contributions of continental and seafloor weathering, even when the total weathering rate is fixed. Climate also depends strongly on the dependence of seafloor weathering on CO2 partial pressure. Both these factors are uncertain. Earth-like planets have two equilibrium climate states: (i) an ice-free state where outgassing is balanced by both weathering types, and (ii) an ice-covered state where outgassing is balanced by seafloor weathering alone. The second of these has not been explored in detail before. For some planets, neither state exists, and the climate cycles between ice-covered and ice-free states. For some other planets, both equilibria exist, and the climate depends on the initial conditions. Insolation increases over time due to stellar evolution, so a planet usually encounters the ice-covered equilibrium first. Such a planet will remain ice covered, even if the ice-free state appears subsequently, unless the climate receives a large perturbation. The ice-covered equilibrium state covers a large fraction of phase space for Earth-like planets. Many planets conventionally assigned to a star's habitable zone may be rendered uninhabitable as a result. © 2020. The American Astronomical Society.

Indigenous peoples may be highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they rely on ecosystem goods and services, such as traditional foods, hunting, timber production, nontimber forest resources, and cultural resources. However, there are few assessments that have examined the potential impact of climate change on these goods and services and even less that examine ecological, socio-economic, and cultural resources in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Our approach uses four basic steps: (1) identify 78 tribally important ecosystem services (species and resources), (2) relate those ecosystem services with biologically relevant vegetation projections from a dynamic global vegetation model, (3) identify appropriate timeframes and future climate scenarios, and (4) assess future changes for vegetation types and ecosystem services. We then highlight how model uncertainty can be explored to better inform resilience building and adaptation planning. We found that more than half of the species and resources analyzed may be vulnerable to climate change due to loss of potential habitat, including aridland species and grazing quality. We further highlight our findings for tribally important species, huckleberries (genus Vaccinium) and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentate (Pursh) DC.), and show how this information can be applied to help inform resource management and adaptation planning. We have demonstrated a generalizable approach that identified tribally important ecosystem services and related them with biologically relevant vegetation projections from a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. Although our assessment is focused in the Pacific Northwest, our approach can be applied in other regions for which model data is available. We recognize that there is some inherent uncertainty associated with using model output for future scenario planning; however, if that uncertainty is addressed and applied as demonstrated by our approach, it then can be explored to help inform resource management and adaptation planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation planning; Climate change exposure; Indigenous peoples; Native American; Tribes","Climate models; Ecosystems; Information management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Cultural resources; Ecosystem services; Future climate scenarios; Model uncertainties; Potential impacts; Resource management; Scenario Planning; Timber production; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem service; future prospect; resource management; stakeholder; vegetation; vulnerability; Adaptation; Ecosystems; Planning; Plants; Resource Management; Resources; Services; Pacific Northwest; United States; Purshia; Purshia tridentata; Vaccinium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087507233

While the adverse health effects concerning aerosols have traditionally been assessed with data of particle mass concentrations, it appears that the number concentration is also another important indicator of toxicity. Thus, to holistically evaluate one’s exposure to aerosol particles, assessments should be based on mass concentrations and number concentrations. In order to assess individual cyclists’ exposure as they move through space and time, spatiotemporal high-resolution approaches are needed. Therefore, a mobile, fast-response monitoring platform was developed that uses a cargo bicycle as a base. Data of particle mass concentrations (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) and particle number concentrations (PN10) were collected along two different routes, one characterized by high-intensity vehicle traffic and one by low-intensity vehicle traffic. While high spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed for all measured quantities, the PN10 concentrations fluctuated the most. High concentrations of PN10 could be clearly associated with vehicle traffic. For PM2.5, this relation was less pronounced. Mean particle concentrations of all measures were significantly higher along the high-traffic route. Comparing route exposures, the inhalation of PM2.5 was similar between both routes, whereas along the high-traffic route, cyclists were exposed to twice the particle number. We conclude that the cargo bike, featuring high-frequency mobile measurements, was useful to characterize the spatial distribution of mass concentrations and number concentrations across an urban environment. Overall, our results suggest that the choice of route is a key factor in reducing cyclists’ exposure to air pollution. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cargo bike; Exposure assessment; Particle mass concentration; Particle number concentration","Aerosols; Bicycles; Adverse health effects; Mobile measurements; Monitoring platform; Number concentration; Particle concentrations; Particle number concentration; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities; Urban environments; Air pollution; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); cycle transport; in situ measurement; pollution exposure; public health; toxicity; Article; concentration (parameter); cyclist; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; health hazard; inhalation; measurement; particle size; particulate matter; risk assessment; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; cycling; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bicycling; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087032786

Yet housing quality remains a problem even in high income countries such as England. In particular, hazards such as excess cold, excess heat and lack of ventilation leading to damp and mould have been identified as a major issue in homes. Research shows that these hazards can lead to a range of health conditions, such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, infections and mental health problems. This article explores the use of public health research and evidence in policy to regulate new buildings in England to deliver improved public health, climate resilience and a reduced carbon footprint, in particular exploring the policy drivers and awareness of the public health evidence. Findings show that public health evidence is hardly referenced in policy and that the focus on other evidence bases such as on climate mitigation in building regulations results in both positive and negative impacts on health. This reflects a lack of a systems approach around urban interventions leading to weaknesses in standards regulating the private development sector. In conclusion, this paper recommends: 1. the consideration of health impact in future building regulations; 2. the integration and coordination of key policies covering various scales and phases of the development processes and 3. the better education of residents to understand advances in new energy performance technologies. © 2020","Building regulations; English planning; Evidence base; Hazards; Health; Housing","Building codes; Carbon footprint; Hazards; Health; Health risks; Houses; Housing; Public health; Building regulations; Cardio-vascular disease; Climate mitigations; Development process; Evidence base; Health condition; Healthy buildings; Systems approach; Health hazards; building code; environmental factor; hazard assessment; health impact; health policy; performance assessment; policy approach; public health; regulatory framework; standard (reference); sustainable development; air conditioning; Article; building; carbon footprint; cardiovascular disease; city; climate resilience; England; environmental policy; government regulation; health care delivery; health hazard; high income country; housing; infection; medical research; mental disease; priority journal; public health; respiratory tract disease; risk reduction; sustainable development; United Nations; urban area; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081118982

The risk of drought for alpine wetlands and temporary pools, which rely on water from snowmelt and provide habitat for specialist plant and amphibian biodiversity, is largely unknown and understudied in this context. Here, we test and validate a novel application of Sentinel-2 imagery aimed at quantifying seasonal variation in water surface area in the context of 95 small (median surface area &lt;100 m2) and shallow (median depth of 20 cm) alpine wetlands in the French Alps, using a linear spectral unmixing approach. For three study years (2016-2018), we used path-analysis to correlate mid-summer water surface area to annual metrics of snowpack (depth and duration) and spring and summer climate (temperature and precipitation). We further sought to evaluate potential biotic responses to drought for study years by monitoring the survival of common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles and wetland plant biomass production quantified using peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found strong agreement between citizen science-based observations of water surface area and Sentinel-2 based estimates (R2 = 0.8-0.9). Mid-summer watershed snow cover duration and summer temperatures emerged as the most important factors regulating alpine wetland hydrology, while the effects of summer precipitation, and local and watershed snow melt-out timing were not significant. We found that a lack of summer snowfields in 2017 combined with a summer heat wave resulted in a significant decrease in mid-summer water surface area, and led to the drying up of certain wetlands as well as the observed mortality of tadpoles. We did not observe a negative effect of the 2017 summer on the biomass production of wetland vegetation, suggesting that wetlands that maintain soil moisture may act as favorable microhabitats for above treeline vegetation during dry years. Our work introduces a remote sensing-based protocol for monitoring the surface hydrology of alpine wetland habitats at the regional scale. Given that climate models predict continued reduction of snow cover in the Alps during the coming years, as well as particularly intense warming during the summer months, our conclusions underscore the vulnerability of alpine wetlands in the face of ongoing climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Drought; Ecohydrology; French alps; Linear spectral unmixing; Mountain temporary pools; Multitemporal; NDVI; Optical remote sensing; Rana temporaria","Biodiversity; Climate models; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Snow; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Vegetation; Watersheds; Wetlands; Biomass productions; Linear spectral unmixing; Normalized difference vegetation index; Novel applications; Snow cover durations; Snow-cover dynamics; Summer precipitation; Wetland vegetation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086997840

To inform the growing expectations for rangeland management activities to promote such services, we conducted an evidence synthesis assessing how four commonly suggested practices (silvopasture, prescribed grazing, compost application and riparian restoration) affect a suite of soil properties and plant-related metrics throughout the state. We extracted data on soil properties that are potentially responsive to management and relevant to soil health. We also extracted data on aboveground forage production, forage nitrogen content and herbaceous species richness. Our search resulted in 399 individual soil observations and 64 individual plant observations. We found that the presence of oaks had the largest effects on soil properties, with soil organic carbon, microbial biomass and other measures of soil fertility increasing beneath oak canopies. The presence of grazing increased compaction and total nitrogen, and decreased pH. Compost applications did not significantly affect any of the measured soil properties, but did boost forage production. Due to a lack of published data, we were unable to characterize the influence of rangeland riparian restoration on any of the soil or plant metrics in our review. © 2020 University of California, Oakland.

Given that cities and renewable energy are explicit thematic lines in the conference the current paper focus on that. Link between cities and solar energy affects stakeholders such as the real estate agents and community so they are both concerns of the public policy. Real estate agent needs to be aware of a technical matter that affects resident lives at the neighbourhood scale. To address climate change two approaches has been declared by IPCC: mitigation and adaptation measures. The former focus on reduction of CO in which building sector plays a fundamental role in this task. Solar energy is a source of clean energy for heating and lighting the buildings. Therefore, it might be protected from solar obstruction coming from building surrounding. The purpose of the study is to discuss and old concept as solar access in a new context real states development giving some quantitative and qualitative assessments on facades under and none solar obstructions. Methodology consists of daily monitoring of insolation on building facades besides of modelling and simulation in Nuoa neighbourhood in Santiago in winter. Results reveal that a significant reduction of intensity in radiation is observed in those circumstances. Obstruction and no obstruction are the scenes analysed to compare irradiation on building facades. In addition, a qualitative analysis is made based on residents perceptions. Urbanism normative about shadows cast are also analysed to set out current limitations and possibilities to improve the legal instrument in the future. Conclusions state that a new focus is recommended for the public policy: think in surrounding energy effects rather than the building alone if mitigation measures want to be applied for sustainable urban planning. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Facades; Regional planning; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Current limitation; Legal instruments; Mitigation measures; Modelling and simulations; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative and qualitative assessments; Real estate agents; Renewable energies; Public policy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087327705

The effect of different shaking frequencies applied to the radial and the longitudinal battery axes are investigated. Moreover, both short-term and long-term (aging) tests are conducted. The results showed that no significant effect on capacity fade can be observed. However, a slightly different capacity, calculated for charge and discharge processes, was observed under vibrating tests, thus suggesting that mechanical vibrations can possibly interact with the ion-transfer mechanism. © 2020 IEEE.","Battery Aging; Energy Storage; Lithium Batteries; Vibration","Battery management systems; Emission control; Energy storage; Green manufacturing; Greenhouse gases; Lithium batteries; Automotive sector; Charge and discharge; Electric sources; Mechanical behavior; Pollutant emissions reduction; Preliminary analysis; Renewable energies; Shaking frequency; Vibration analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091706572

Hudson Bay is a large shelf sea in northern Canada whose location at the margin of the cryosphere places it in the vanguard of global climate change. Here, we develop a four-compartment box-model and carbon budget using published and recently collected measurements to estimate carbon inputs, transformations, and losses within Hudson Bay. We estimate the annual effects of terrestrial carbon remineralization on aragonite saturation (ΩAr, a proxy for ocean acidification) and on the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2, a proxy for air-sea CO2 flux) within each compartment, as well as the effects of marine primary production, marine organic carbon remineralization, and terrestrial calcium carbonate dissolution. We find that the remineralization of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon is the main driver of CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation in coastal surface waters, but this is largely offset by marine primary production. Below the surface mixed layer, marine organic carbon remineralization is the largest contributor to CO2 accumulation and aragonite under-saturation, and is partially offset by terrestrial CaCO3 dissolution. Overall, the annual delivery and processing of carbon reduces ΩAr of water flowing through HB by up to 0.17 units and raises pCO2 by up to 165 µatm. The similarities between Hudson Bay and other Arctic shelf seas suggest these areas are also significantly influenced by terrestrial carbon inputs and transformation. © 2020","Aragonite; Arctic; Carbon-cycle; Carbon-dioxide; Ocean acidification","Acidification; Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Climate change; Dissolution; Oceanography; Coastal surface waters; Dissolved organic carbon; Global climate changes; Ocean acidifications; Primary production; Sensitive regions; Surface mixed layers; Terrestrial organic matter; Organic carbon; absorption; calcium carbonate; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; coastal water; cryosphere; global change; global climate; ocean acidification; organic matter; partial pressure; remineralization; saturation; Arctic Ocean; Canada; Canada; Hudson Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084457110

In this study, we introduce alternative futures analysis and coupled land-atmosphere modeling to investigate the effect of landscape patterns on moderating projected climate change in northern China. Three future landscape scenarios are developed, and their impacts on regional climate in the context of climate change are examined. A reference scenario, Business-as-Usual, follows recent landscape trajectory; the Conservation scenario puts greater emphasis on ecosystem protection and restoration to ultimately achieve sustained socioeconomic development; the Degradation scenario ignores current policy to allow broad cropland expansion. The landscape impacts on regional climate under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are substantial and dependent on background climate. The Conservation scenario shows considerable decreases in near-surface temperature and extensive increases in rainfall during summer as compared with Business-as-Usual under RCP8.5 (i.e., a high emissions scenario), thus representing a preferred landscape pattern for climate moderation. However, trade-offs between temperature reduction and rainfall enhancement exist under RCP4.5 (i.e., a low-to-moderate emissions scenario), which necessitates careful evaluation.

The focus of the study was the commercial maize farms of the Free State Province given their importance in the National economy. The Regional Integrated Assessment (phase I) was implemented to assess climate change and adaptation that links climate, crops, economic data and tools developed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP). In this context, the “system” is defined as a whole of agronomic and socio-economic factors. Within that framework three core questions were being evaluated: (i) Impacts of climate change under current system; (ii) Impacts of climate change under future system; (iii) The role of adaptation under climate change and the future system. Maize production will decrease between 10% to 16% as a result of projected climate impacts. Also, current agricultural production systems are negatively affected by climate change with an increase in poverty rates between 2% to 3%. The projected adoption of the adapted technology would result in positive increased net returns and a decrease in poverty rate of between 12% and 22%. The results of this study show that implementing adaptation measures, including strategies indicated by the local stakeholders, will have positive impacts on the agricultural production systems and can contribute to support and inform climate change policy decision making such as the development of National Adaptation Plans. © 2020, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate models; Crop modelling; Economic modelling; Integrated assessment","adaptation; agricultural modeling; climate change; climate effect; commercial activity; crop production; decision making; integrated approach; maize; poverty; stakeholder; Free State; South Africa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084132667

Future plantations should be located in the warmer, wetter regions of northern China. Abstract: The adaptability of fragile plantation ecosystems to environmental change, especially in our currently warming climate, has become an important issue. We studied the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis, a tree species endemic to China and widely used in plantations, along a climate–latitude gradient. We established a regional tree ring data network for P. tabulaeformis based on 1340 cores from 28 plantations at the northern limits of its natural range in China and studied the association between the radial growth of the pines and climate factors in a changing environment. Our results show that increasing temperatures have led to changes in the distribution of P. tabulaeformis, with plantations expanding in the southern sub-regions and shrinking in the northern sub-regions. An increase in temperature and the subsequent effect on the availability of water is the most important factor in the different responses of P. tabulaeformis growth to climate change. Relatively wetter regions, such as the southern part of our study area, may be better locations to develop future P. tabulaeformis plantations. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental suitability; Growth change; Pinus tabulaeformis; Regional response; Tree rings","Forestry; Changing environment; Environmental change; Environmental suitability; Geographical locations; Increasing temperatures; Pinus tabulaeformis; Regional response; Tree rings; Climate change; China; Cores; Ecosystems; Forestry; Growth; Pinus Tabulaeformis; Plantations; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077557265

Yet increases in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are reducing the capacity of coral reefs to keep up with sea-level rise. We use ensemble species distribution models of four coral species (Porites rus, Porites lobata, Acropora hyacinthus and Acropora digitifera) to gauge potential geographic differences in gross carbonate production. Net carbonate production was estimated by considering erosional rates of ocean acidification, increasing cyclone intensity, local pollution, fishing pressure and the projected burdens of increases in SSTs (under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) through to the year 2100. Our models predict that only 4 ± 0.1% (~60 000 km2) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs are projected to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100 under RCP 8.5 – most of which will be located near the Equator. However, with drastic reductions in emissions (under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0 Wm−2), we predict that 15 ± 0.3% (~250 000 km2) (under RCP 4.5 Wm−2) and 12 ± 0.7% (~200 000 km2) (under RCP 6.0 Wm−2) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs, have the potential to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100. Yet the burdens of fishing pressure and its cascading effects are projected to be responsible for substantial reef erosion, nearly halving the number of reefs able to keep up with sea-level rise. If action is taken immediately and emissions are drastically reduced to RCPs 4.5 or 6.0 Wm−2, and reef management reduces the burdens of local pollution and fishing pressure, then our model predicts that 21–27% (~350 000–470 000 km2) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs – most of which will be located near the Equator – would have the potential to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100. © 2020 The Authors.

This can lead to an increase in burned area and emissions from fire activity, and socio-economic, and environmental losses. Previous studies using satellite observations to assess the impacts of the recent 2015/16 El Niño found an increase in burned area in some regions compared to La Niña years. Here, we use the dynamic land surface model JULES to assess how conditions differed as a result of the El Niño by comparing simulations driven by observations from the year 2015/16 with mean climatological drivers of temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, air pressure, and short and long-wave radiation. We use JULES with the interactive fire module INFERNO to assess the effects on precipitation, temperature, burned area, and the associated impacts on the carbon sink globally and for three regions: South America, Africa, and Asia. We find that the model projects a variable response in precipitation, with some areas including northern South America, southern Africa and East Asia getting drier, and most areas globally seeing an increase in temperature. As a result, higher burned area is simulated with El Niño conditions in most regions, although there are areas of both increased and decreased burned area over Africa. South America shows the largest fire response with El Niño, with a 13% increase in burned area and emitted carbon, corresponding with the largest decrease in carbon uptake. Within South America, peak fire occurs from August to October across central-southern Brazil, and temperature is shown to be the main driver of the El Niño-induced increase in burned area during this period. Combined, our results indicate that although 2015/16 was not a peak year for global total burned area or fire emissions, the El Niño led to an overall increase of 4% in burned area and 5% in emissions compared to a “No El Niño” scenario for 2015/16, and contributed to a 4% reduction in the terrestrial carbon sink. © Copyright © 2020 Burton, Betts, Jones, Feldpausch, Cardoso and Anderson.","burned area; carbon sink; El Niño; emissions; fire","Carbon; Economics; Oceanography; Surface waters; Equatorial Pacific Ocean; Land surface modeling; Modeling project; Satellite observations; Sea surface temperature anomalies; Short and long wave radiation; Socio-economics; Southern Brazil; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087013488

Many social and ecological systems have resilience mechanisms to accommodate and recover from such events. Yet, in an era of directional climate change, adaptation (rather than recovery to the same state) may be the most logical path. In such cases, disturbances, while often unwelcome, may function as opportunities for change. We synthesize the literature on disturbances and adaptation to climate change for both ecological and social systems, attempting to find commonalities and situations where disturbances present adaptation opportunities. We also identify three major characteristics of systems that may drive differential potential for success going forward: their overall richness of actors, their functional overlap in diversity, and their temporal rate of change. Social systems are better positioned to successfully take advantage of disturbance-generated opportunities to adapt when they support collaboration of diverse interests and engage in pre-disturbance response planning to seize opportunities when they arise. Ecological systems are well-positioned for adaptation when they are diverse, populated with species that are tolerant of post-disturbance environments, and when life-history traits are well-matched with the temporal and spatial distribution of those disturbances. Social systems with a lack of planning and inclusive participation and where powerful actors are resistant to change are less able to take advantage of disturbances as adaptational opportunities; ecological systems that are less diverse (spatially and in regards to species composition), especially those dominated by late successional species, are similarly constrained. Overall, we find that disturbances can create opportunities for adaptation when the ecology and social systems are aligned but there are also many situations where this is not true, depending on initial conditions, temporal pace of disturbance and system characteristics. Policy implications. Disturbances, while damaging and often catastrophic in the short term, present climate adaptation opportunities because they can spur reorganization towards climatically suitable systems. Policy makers and advocates should carefully consider current social and ecological conditions, specifically how they will reorganize post-disturbance, and explore the options available to prepare and take advantage of (inevitable) future disturbances. © 2020 British Ecological Society","adaptation; climate change; disturbance; ecology; natural disaster; resilience; social-ecological systems; transformation","climate change; disturbance; ecosystem resilience; life history trait; policy making; spatial distribution; species complex; species diversity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083847228

The long execution state of large number of computing devices consumes a significant amount of power, which emits an equivalent amount of heat in the environment. The performance of the devices is compromised in heating environment. The high powered cooling systems are installed to cool the data centers. Accordingly, data centers demand high electricity for computing devices and cooling systems. Moreover, in Smart Grid (SG) managing energy consumption to reduce the electricity cost for consumers and minimum rely on fossil fuel based power supply (utility) is an interesting domain for researchers. The SG applications are time-sensitive. In this paper, fog based model is proposed for a community to ensure real-time energy management service provision. Three scenarios are implemented to analyze cost efficient energy management for power-users. In first scenario, community's and fog's power demand is fulfilled fromthe utility. In second scenario, community's Renewable Energy Resources (RES) basedMicrogrid (MG) is integrated with the utility to meet the demand. In third scenario, the demand is fulfilled by integrating fog's MG, community's MG and the utility. In the scenarios, the energy demand of fog is evaluated with proposedmechanism. The required amount of energy to run computing devices against number of requests and amount of power require cooling down the devices are calculated to find energy demand by fog's data center. The simulations of case studies show that the energy cost to meet the demand of the community and fog's data center in third scenario is 15.09% and 1.2% more efficient as compared to first and second scenarios, respectively. In this paper, an energy contract is also proposed that ensures the participation of all power generating stakeholders. The results advocate the cost efficiency of proposed contract as compared to third scenario. The integration of RES reduce the energy cost and reduce emission of CO2.

The goal of this study was to design the unit processes of an existing drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), evaluate the associated energy consumption, and then offset it using solar photovoltaics (PVs) to reduce carbon emissions. The selected DWTP, situated in the southwestern United States, utilizes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination to treat 3.94 m3 of local river water per second. Based on the energy consumption determined for each unit process (validated using the plant's data) and the plant's available landholding, the DWTP was sized for solar PV (as a modeling study) using the system advisor model. Total operational energy consumption was estimated to be 56.3 MWh day-1 for the DWTP including water distribution pumps, whereas energy consumption for the DWTP excluding water distribution pumps was 2661 kWh day-1. The results showed that the largest consumers of energy-after the water distribution pumps (158.1 Wh m-3)-were the processes of coagulation (1.95 Wh m-3) and flocculation (1.93 Wh m-3). A 500 kW PV system was found to be sufficient to offset the energy consumption of the water treatment only operations, for a net present value of $0.24 million. The net reduction in carbon emissions due to the PV-based design was found to be 450 and 240 metric tons CO2-eq year-1 with and without battery storage, respectively. This methodology can be applied to other existing DWTPs for design and assessment of energy consumption and use of renewables. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Drinking water treatment; Energy consumption; Photovoltaics; System advisor model; Treatment plant design","Carbon; Coagulation; Design; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Flocculation; Ostwald ripening; Potable water; Pumps; Solar power generation; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; Water supply systems; Carbon emissions; Model study; Net present value; Operational energy; Renewables; River water; Solar photovoltaics; Water distributions; Chemical water treatment; chlorination; coagulation; design method; drinking water; energy efficiency; filtration; flocculation; photodegradation; photovoltaic system; river water; wastewater treatment; water treatment plant; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087705066

The system is designed to integrate a thermal storage unit based on phase change material with the rSOC stack by mzedeans of heat pipes. At times of low electricity price, the plant produces hydrogen via electrolysis fed preferentially by a dedicated wind farm. Hydrogen is stored as compressed gas and used for the public transportation and electricity production during peak-demand hours. The goal of the study is to investigate the performance and environmental indicators of this novel rSOC configuration and to identify which operating strategy best fits with the analyzed district application. The operating points of the overall system are mapped with a steady-state model and interfaced with thermal storage and loads by a time-resolved dynamic model. The feasible schedules of the system are defined considering the rSOC switching dynamics between fuel cell and electrolysis, and constraints on plant self-sufficiency for both heat and hydrogen vectors. Simulations at different levels of hydrogen demand for mobility (ranging between 10 and 1,000 ton/year) were performed. Results showed an annual efficiency range of 55–70% (including heat to DH) of the polygeneration plant. The environmental analysis showed that the rSOC plant emits 5–50% less CO2 than the current energy system (gas boilers, grid electricity, diesel buses), when electrolysis is fed by grid-electricity with the present UK carbon intensity in case of wind power shortages. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic modeling; Environmental analysis; Hydrogen; Polygeneration; Power-to-X; Reversible Solid Oxide Cell","Dynamic models; Electrolysis; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Phase change materials; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Wind power; Electricity production; Environmental analysis; Environmental indicators; Performance assessment; Poly-generation; Power-to-X; Reversible solid oxide cells; Time-resolved dynamics; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080041578

Consequently, understanding what research has been conducted and what knowledge gaps remain regarding NTDs and climate change is crucial to informing public health interventions and climate change adaptation. We conducted a systematic scoping review to describe the extent, range, and nature of publications examining relationships between NTDs and climatic factors in East Africa. We collated all relevant English and French publications indexed in PubMed®, Web of Science™ Core Collection, and CAB Direct© databases published prior to 2019. Ninety-six publications were included for review. Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia had high rates of publication, whereas countries in the Western Indian Ocean region were underrepresented. Most publications focused on schistosomiasis (n = 28, 29.2%), soil-transmitted helminthiases (n = 16, 16.7%), or human African trypanosomiasis (n = 14, 14.6%). Precipitation (n = 91, 94.8%) and temperature (n = 54, 56.3%) were frequently investigated climatic factors, whereas consideration of droughts (n = 10, 10.4%) and floods (n = 4, 4.2%) was not prominent. Publications reporting on associations between NTDs and changing climate were increasing over time. There was a decrease in the reporting of Indigenous identity and age factors over time. Overall, there were substantial knowledge gaps for several countries and for many NTDs. To better understand NTDs in the context of a changing climate, it would be helpful to increase research on underrepresented diseases and regions, consider demographic and social factors in research, and characterize how these factors modify the effects of climatic variables on NTDs in East Africa. © 2020 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

We challenge this notion by analysing climate velocity, which provides expectations for species’ range shifts. We find that contemporary (1955–2005) climate velocities are faster in the deep ocean than at the surface. Moreover, projected climate velocities in the future (2050–2100) are faster for all depth layers, except at the surface, under the most aggressive GHG mitigation pathway considered (representative concentration pathway, RCP 2.6). This suggests that while mitigation could limit climate change threats for surface biodiversity, deep-ocean biodiversity faces an unavoidable escalation in climate velocities, most prominently in the mesopelagic (200–1,000 m). To optimize opportunities for climate adaptation among deep-ocean communities, future open-ocean protected areas must be designed to retain species moving at different speeds at different depths under climate change while managing non-climate threats, such as fishing and mining. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biodiversity; climate effect; concentration (composition); deep-sea benthos; future prospect; global warming; greenhouse gas; mesopelagic zone; sea surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085348405

However, a fuller understanding of the effects that these changes in land use and soil amendment could have on soil biodiversity and processes is needed. We performed a 2-year field experiment to determine the consequences of adding three different amounts of biochar (10 t ha−1, 25 t ha−1 and 50 t ha−1) to a commercial Miscanthus bioenergy plantation on soil invertebrate community structure and abundances of enchytraeids, collembolans, mites and earthworms. We also used stable isotope analyses to determine shifts in feeding preferences and to quantify C assimilation by those soil organisms most likely to be affected by soil amendments (i.e. soil ingesters: earthworms and enchytraeids). Results showed that biochar additions to the soil had a negative effect on larger-sized soil fauna (earthworms) significantly reducing their population sizes and species richness whereas, in contrast, mesofauna appeared to benefit from the input of the biochar. Although significant assimilation of new C by anecic earthworms was observed, it was clearly insufficient to support population growth and, more importantly, the dominant ecological group in these agricultural soils (endogeics) showed the lowest assimilation values. These results indicate that biochar additions might result in the loss of some of the ecosystem services provided by earthworms, an important concern in these intensively managed agricultural soils. Finally, our findings highlight the need for more field research at species level to fully elucidate the mechanisms driving the biological responses to these types of ecosystem management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Miscanthus; Pyrolised carbon; Soil invertebrates; Stable isotopes","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Population statistics; Bioenergy plantation; Biological response; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Energy productions; Management strategies; Soil invertebrates; Stable-isotope analysis; Soils; abundance; agricultural soil; biochar; biodiversity; bioenergetics; bioenergy; cropping practice; earthworm; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; microbial activity; microbial community; mite; population size; soil ecosystem; soil fauna; Acari; Enchytraeidae; Invertebrata; Miscanthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083073304

Hourly temperature and relative humidity readings collected by data loggers, together with rainfall data from a local meteorological station, have been comparatively assessed to better understand the consequences of sheltering in dry and warm areas.

Deposits resulting from both tidal inundation after coseismic subsidence and from tsunamis can be radiocarbon dated to infer patterns of earthquake and tsunami recurrence. Yet, finding suitable plant material for radiocarbon dating is not always easy. Luminescence dating provides a more ubiquitously applicable approach, but in such settings remains challenging due to three main reasons: (i) The quartz and feldspar minerals formed on active subduction zones tend to show inadequate luminescence properties; (ii) tsunami deposits may be affected by incomplete resetting of luminescence signals; and (iii) the dosimetry in sequences of tsunami and tidal sand sheets intercalated in marsh soils is often complicated. To evaluate the impact of these factors on luminescence dating accuracy, we re-date previously historically-constrained and radiocarbon dated tsunami and post-earthquake tidal deposits marking some predecessors of the giant 1960 Chile earthquake. While the impact of complex dosimetry on luminescence ages was negligible for both quartz and feldspar, the selection of an appropriate luminescence signal and aliquot size was crucial for generating robust chronologies. Due to unstable luminescence signals, quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages and fading corrected infrared-stimulated (IR50) feldspar ages significantly underestimate the control ages. Only post-infrared-infrared (pIRIR150) signals of feldspar provide ages without any systematic age underestimation. Incomplete signal resetting was successfully addressed by using small aliquots in combination with the bootstrapped minimum age model. Remaining remnant ages of a few decades to a few centuries for the historical 1960 and 1575 tsunami sand sheets reflect a combination of laboratory residuals and incomplete signal resetting. Our results show that low-temperature pIRIR dating of feldspar is a valuable tool for reconstructing late Holocene earthquake chronologies in regions where quartz is geologically young, volcanic in origin, and holds few transportation cycles, as it occurs in active subduction zones. Although relatively large residual doses introduce dating uncertainties for sediments younger than a few centuries, feldspar pIRIR dating appears to be a good alternative to radiocarbon dating. On the contrary, quartz OSL and feldspar infrared ages were associated with systematic age underestimation, making them problematic for obtaining adequate chronologies in this type of geologic setting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","1960 Chile earthquake; Dose rate heterogeneity; Luminescence dating; Paleoseismology; Post-infrared-infrared; Tsunami deposit","bootstrapping; earthquake event; earthquake recurrence; feldspar; luminescence dating; quartz; Quaternary; tsunami; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083359615

In this study we exposed plant-peat mesocosms planted with four Cyperaceae species to 400 and 800 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentrations and measured plant and peat properties as well as CH4 fluxes. Above ground biomass for plants grown at 800 ppm CO2 increased for E. angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex brunnescens, but the total biomass of C. acuta decreased relative to the ambient CO2 treatment. The plant species and elevated CO2 treatment affected both peat redox potential and pore water chemistry. There was no overall effect of the elevated CO2 on CH4 emissions, however, CH4 emissions were related to above ground biomass and redox potential, both of which were significantly altered by elevated CO2. Our study shows that species composition poses an important control on how wetland communities will respond to elevated CO2 and that plant mediated changes of peat biogeochemical processes, in response to elevated CO2 levels, may affect CH4 emissions from sub-arctic wetlands, but any such responses will differ among species. © 2019, The Author(s).","Elevated CO2; Methane; Plant species; Subarctic; Wetland","aboveground biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; community composition; mesocosm; methane; pine; redox potential; wetland; Carex brunnescens; Cyperaceae; Eriophorum vaginatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085122176

Specific CSF strategies are viewed as a way forward for developing suitable management responses and enhancing the provision of ecosystem services. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive and cohesive assessment to implement CSF. This paper describes the step-by-step process that developed a comprehensive and shared definition of CSF, and the process for selecting indicators that assess the “climate-smartness” of forest management. Adaptation, mitigation and social dimensions are the core focus of the CSF definition, which recognises the need to integrate and avoid development of these aspects in isolation. An iterative participatory process was used with a range of experts in forest-related fields from the CLIMO project, this was subsequently supported by a network analysis to identify sustainable forest management indicators important to CSF. The definition developed here, is an important first step in to promote CSF that will aid practice in the forestry sector. It can be used as a template across Europe, tailored to local contexts. Further work communicating CSF to practitioners and policy-makers will create a CSF practice and culture that will help to safeguard future forest economies and communities. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Bioeconomy; Indicator; Mitigation; Social dimension; Sustainable forest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085121365

The more electric aircraft (MEA) can take advantage of the drives based on wide bandgap (WBG)-based power modules that are lighter and can bear higher voltages and currents. However, the fast-rise and repetitive voltage pulses generated by WBG-based systems can endanger the insulating property of dielectric materials due to the partial discharges. PDs cause the local breakdown of insulation materials in regions with high electric field magnitude. In the case of power electronic modules, silicone gel, which is a predominant type of encapsulation material, is susceptible to these PDs. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the impact of rise time on various PD characteristics including PD true charge magnitude, inception and extinction fields, duration, and so forth. Besides, those systems that are anticipated to operate under harsh environmental conditions - such as naval or aviation industries - may expect additional threat. Therefore, this paper puts forth the combination of low-pressure conditions and fast-rise, high-frequency square wave pulses. The results demonstrate that more intense and more intense ones are going to be imposed at lower pressures.

Here, we integrate climate change anomaly with a land-use change model both projected for 2050 to identify refugia areas for 103 bird species that occur in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that 13% of the Cerrado may serve as refugia for the bird species. In contrast, nearly 35% of the biome might become areas of high risk for those species. Most species (74%) will held from 34% to 85% of their current geographic distribution in areas with less native vegetation, but with low climate anomaly. Apart from the protection of the refugia areas, we suggest restoration of native vegetation in regions that are likely to maintain climate conditions more adequate in the future. These areas should be prioritized to protect places with higher species richness and ease the establishment of corridors that would support climate-induced dispersal from high risk areas to suitable ones.

A recurring question raised amongst strategic policy makers tackling climate-related risks in both sectors asks: Can reducing these divergences and seeking new streamlining synergies assist in closing the implementation gap and deliver better integrated Disaster Risk Management (DRM) policies? Specifically, can such synergising action extend to strengthening of trans-border and trans-disciplinary resilience? The ESPREssO Project explores these questions through a two-year stakeholder engagement process-collecting opinion from European CCA and DRR stakeholders, using novel methods such as crisis simulation exercises (serious games), questionnaires, interviews and international Think Tanks to identify mutual barriers and recommend ways both sectors can overcome them. We prioritise the various solutions with stakeholders, drawing on international and intersectoral CCA and DRR perspectives to refine a set of key recommendations for synergising action. Results prioritise the importance of clear communication, maintaining political support and inclusion of the currently under-utilised private sector in positively establishing closer cooperation between CCA and DRR. The benefits of strengthening CCA-DRR inter-sectoral links are explored as essential pathways for better-informing hazard mitigation planning under a changing global climate and in aligning localised and strategic efforts.

This study proposes a modified version (mCCI) of the Catchment Connectivity Index (CCI), theorized by Quiñonero-Rubio, Boix-Fayos, and de Vente (2013). The modified index improves the calculation procedure, providing a more efficient description of the hydrological and geomorphological factors of CCI and making easier its applicability for the operators with less field experience. The mCCI is applied to evaluate the sediment connectivity at the catchment scale in a torrent of Calabria (Southern Italy). This case study has shown how and by what extent the natural (climate changes) and human impacts (land-use changes and check dam installation) have influenced the geomorphic processes influencing sediment circulation in the studied basin throughout six decades. From 1955 to 2012, a general decrease in sediment connectivity has been caught by mCCI. This was the combined effects of greening-up processes of the catchment (due to both natural afforestation and human-induced reforestation) and the installation of check dams, which have decreased the catchment potential to circulating sediments. Overall, the mCCI can be used as an analytical tool to evaluate the influence of past or future changes in natural and human-induced changes in land use and climate actions by comparing scenarios of torrent connectivity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","check dams; connectivity index; land use change; sediment transport; sedimentation; soil erosion","anthropogenic effect; catchment; climate change; connectivity; fluvial geomorphology; Mediterranean environment; sediment transport; semiarid region; torrent; Calabria; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081007847

They are found on all continents and in a variety of landscape settings. Although accurate estimates of the abundance of temporary wetlands are available in only a few countries, global estimations identify a decline in number and quality. The key environmental factors driving the structure of ecological communities in temporary wetlands are the duration, timing, frequency and predictability of the aquatic and dry phases, which varies greatly with region and hydrogeomorphic setting. Temporary wetlands have been historically neglected, but improved social awareness of the functions and values of, and increases in scientific interest, suggest that this is changing. They play an ecological role in both global cycles (i.e., CO2 emissions) and biodiversity (in proportion to their size, they contribute disproportionately to regional and global biodiversity). Moreover, they provide valuable ecosystem services including wildlife habitat, nutrient flux to adjacent ecosystems, flood control, water filtration, and cultural services. Effective conservation of temporary wetlands requires addressing threats (i.e., inconsistent and inadequate regulatory protections; climate change; changes in land use) and management challenges (i.e., management at both local and landscape scales; incomplete understanding of the ecosystem services provided by them; the need to enhance inventories). The most suitable approaches for conserving temporary wetlands include (1) regulations or other forms of protection; (2) sustainable management; (3) restoration and creation; and (4) collaborative conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, as activities related to CO2 reduction are of special attention in the European Union (EU), sustainable use of resources plays an important role in climate change mitigation. In this paper, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the integrated value chain from peach pruning residues for electricity generation is presented and compared with the common practice including the mulching process of the pruned biomass in an orchard. It was shown that biomass harvesting, chipping and its delivery to a power plant-the Pruning-to-Energy (PtE) scenario - is feasible from an environmental point of view. The total global warming potential (GWP) of this value chain was 200 kg CO2 eq.·ha-1 (or 27 kg CO2 eq.·GJ-1). In turn, the mulching and leaving of the pruned biomass in an orchard-the pruning-to-soil (PtS) scenario - is characterized by a CO2 equivalent of 2360 kg-ha-1. Other impact categories showed a lower environmental impact for the PtE scenario as well. When considering the Spanish electricity-mix instead of coal-based electricity, the PtS scenario score better in most impact categories, but the GWP for the PtE scenario remains lower. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper aims to critically examine how a contested Gold Standard certified project in Western Uganda has been justified, opposed and adapted during its implementation. Using a political ecology approach, this article sheds new light on the complexity of global-local interlinkages regarding carbon forestry projects and examines discursive power struggles. Taking a social constructivist perspective, I assume that due to their different values and experiences, actors have differing perceptions of the tensions and power relations arising during the carbon forestry project. Building on interviews and project-relevant certification documents, practices, narratives and counter-narratives were analyzed. The results show that while local actors were excluded from the forest, local communities and civil society actors have resisted against the company's management regime. Although the company remains the most powerful actor, more collaborative and moderate practices have lowered the conflict level. The case study shows that carbon markets need to be legitimated not only at the global level but also during the implementation in interaction with local constituencies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Commerce; Ecology; Reforestation; Timber; Carbon markets; Carbon offsets; Climate policy; Gold standards; Local community; Management regime; Political ecology; Power relations; Carbon; Carbon; Commerce; Ecology; Forestry; Planning; Power; Reforestation; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081004483

In this work, we explore ways to optimize the HVAC controls in factories. Unfortunately, this is a complex problem as it requires computing an optimal state considering multiple variable factors, e.g. the occupancy, manufacturing schedule, temperature requirements of operating machines, air flow dynamics within the building, external weather conditions, energy savings, etc. We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy optimization model that has been applied in our factories. We show that RL is a good fit as it is able to learn and adapt to multi-parameterized system dynamics in real-time.

Their contribution however, varies depending on a number of factors including elevation gradients. In this study, we quantified the carbon (C) stock and woody species diversity in tree-ensete dominated homegarden agroforestry practice along an elevation gradient in Hawassa Zuria District, southern Ethiopia. The elevation was stratified into upper, middle and lower gradient and two hamlets were randomly selected from each elevation category. Data on number, diameter and height of woody species were collected from 42 sample home gardens. Soil samples were also taken at 0–60 cm soil depth from each sample home garden for soil organic carbon (SOC) determination. A total of 49 woody species belonging to 31 families were recorded. The diversity differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) along the elevation categories. The mean total biomass and soil carbon stocks were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in the upper elevation category (156.17 ± 13.78 Mg ha−1), followed by middle (128.66 ± 7.16 Mg ha−1) and lower (91.75 ± 4.31 Mg ha−1) elevation categories. The corresponding SOC accounted for 68%, 76% and 78%. Correlation between woody species diversity and C stock was not significant (r = − 0.16). The tree-ensete dominated home garden agroforestry practices can play an important role in climate change mitigation and conservation of woody species diversity.

Within this context, the paper compares the economic and environmental benefits of utilizing two renewable energy production sources: algae building technology (ABT) and solar PV panels. A case study site for retrofitting a specified area on the front façade of a multi-storied building at the University of Technology Sydney, City Campus, Australia was thus chosen for the study. A cost and benefit analysis model using the following performance indicators; return on investment, payback period as well as net present value of the two systems, was thus initiated. Annual revenue generation of both systems which included tangible and intangible benefits of both systems were simultaneously calculated. The investment and operation and maintenance costs of both systems were calculated based on market research as well as quantitative data adapted from our literature review.

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities.

Long continued urbanization and tourism activities have been responsible for fragmentation and deterioration of the original woodlands of this mountainous area. Ecological surveys have been carried out along quadrats and transect to evaluate each of the habitat types in terms of species diversity and species richness. Results show that the Marglef’s Index, has received highest value (4.03) for the woodlands of Ranipol locality, located at the lower part of the study area, where more than 19 plant species have been enumerated. The lowest (1.89) value of the index has been obtained in case of Lower M.G. road woodland habitat located as the middle slope of the spur over which the Gangtok urban area extends. Closely similar results have been obtained from computation of Menhinick’s Index, value of which ranges between 0.02 and 0.09. Highest species dominance (Simpson’s index value = 0.90) and species diversity (Shannon’s index value = 0.83) have been found in case of Tadong woodland area while the lowest value of 0.47 for both the indices has been obtained for M.G. road. In Gangtok Municipal area the most dominant species is Dhupi (Cryptomeria japonica) particularly abundant in the upper part of the area namely in Burtok and Chandmari. In the middle part, namely in Deorali and Lower M.G. Marg the dominant species is Chilouni (Schima wallichii) and in the lower part i.e. in Ranipol and Tadong the dominant species is Utis (Alnus nepalensis).

Goal of the present research is therefore to develop an on-line powertrain management strategy accounting also for TWC temperature, in order to reduce the time needed to reach TWC light-off temperature. A catalyst model is incorporated into the model of the powertrain where torque-split is performed by an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (a-ECMS). The developed a-ECMS operates on a domain of power-split combinations between electric machine and internal combustion engine, which, aside from satisfying the torque demand, also ensure a controlled ICE torque derivative as well as a controlled ICE start-and-stop frequency. Hence, the algorithm, which is extended for TWC thermal management, incorporates a penalty on the deviation of the TWC temperature from its optimal temperature range. The strategy has been tested on a gasoline P2 FHEV platform whose components (internal combustion engine, electric machine, battery and three-way catalyst) have been experimentally characterized. In particular, the battery current limitations have been modelled as a function of energy transfer. The effects deriving from the strategy, in terms of fuel consumption and catalyst efficiency, have been analyzed on the WLTC (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycles), the new homologation cycle enforced by European legislation. The control algorithm enhances a sufficient catalyst heating within a timespan comparable to the one of a conventional ICE case. The control strategy that integrates TWC thermal management causes an increase of about 2% in fuel consumption, compared to an only fuel economy-oriented a-ECMS strategy. © 2020 SAE International.

The objective of this study was to explore the economic costs of unintentional and intentional poisoning in children in the region of Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, Morocco. Methods: A prospective study of children younger than 15 years with a poisoning diagnosis conducted between March and July 2016 in the Children's University Hospital of Rabat, Morocco. The source of data for this study was questionnaire that collected information on the costs, the epidemiological and the socio-economic characteristics of childhood poisoning. Results: Eighty-seven patients were interviewed during the study period (39 females and 48 males). The majority of poisoning cases (98.85%) were accidental and 1.15% were intentional. Drugs, snake bites and scorpion stings, carbon monoxide, food, plants, household products, illegal drugs, pesticides, petroleum and industrial chemicals products were caused the poisoning. Of all the hospitalized patients, 77 (88.5%) were admitted to the emergency department and 5 (5.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. The average direct medical costs and the average direct non-medical costs of providing poison treatment were USD 127 and USD 30 per child, respectively. Total average direct cost of USD 157 (127 + 30) represented 60% of the national minimum wage per month in Morocco. Total direct medical costs accounted for 80%, as against 20% direct non-medical costs. The mean ± SD length of stay (LOS) for children with poisoning was 2.15 ± 1.87 days with a range variated between 0 day and 10 days. Conclusions: Overall, this study confirms that the costs of childhood poisoning are not negligible costs in Morocco. Therefore, the prevalence and the costs of childhood poisoning can be reduced by monitoring an open communication between parents, the Poison Control Centre of Morocco (MPCC) and physicians in order to increase the vigilance of parents against the risks related to unintentional poisoning that can be prevented with more awareness. © 2020 The Author(s).","Childhood poisoning costs; Direct costs; Morocco; Poisoning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088553661

The default management outcome of abandonment is natural regeneration through ecological succession. However, several different management strategies and new land uses for abandoned agricultural lands have been recommended by the scientific community in recent years. This paper reviews the foremost proposed strategies and compares their soil carbon sequestration potentials. Six major categories have been proposed globally. Each proposal has positive and negative outcomes depending on site-specific factors and management objectives. Accordingly, no single strategy is ideal in all scenarios and a combination of strategies addresses multiple rural development goals concurrently. A combination of passive and active management techniques is the most effective approach for maximizing soil carbon sequestration over large geographic scales, while other strategies can be designed to also promote low-carbon land use practices and fossil fuel substitution. The implications of each proposal highlighted here demonstrates the positive role that abandoned agricultural lands can serve in climate change mitigation efforts, supporting policymakers tasked with planning the future of regions undergoing abandonment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural land abandonment; Climate change mitigation; Land use change; Soil carbon sequestration","carbon; fossil fuel; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; geographic and geological parameters; land use; priority journal; Review; soil management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083189482

An Elman recurrent neural network (RNN) model and an exponential model are developed for electric energy consumption prediction in an IoT-driven building environment. The models predict electric energy consumption by electric loads in the near future by: 1) recognizing the existence of a relationship between the net electric energy consumption of the building's electric loads and the ambient temperature along with the occupancy state of the building and 2) employing the detected relationship to predict electric energy consumption using the forecasted temperature and the scheduled occupancy state. The building environment under consideration is the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems (RTPIS) laboratory integrated with intelligent monitoring and control capabilities using IoT devices and technologies. The electric loads under consideration include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units and light panels. The developed Elman RNN and exponential models are also compared. These prediction capabilities are beneficial in overcoming variabilities in electric energy consumption by supplying electric energy as needed to meet the demands of the electric loads, thereby minimizing wasted electric energy, reducing carbon emissions, and generating cost savings. © 2014 IEEE.","Computational intelligence; Electric energy consumption prediction; Elman recurrent neural network (RNN); Internet of Things (IoT); Smart building","Air conditioning; Buildings; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Real time systems; Recurrent neural networks; Building environment; Electric energies; Electric energy consumption; Elman recurrent neural network; Exponential models; Intelligent monitoring; Internet of thing (IOT); Prediction capability; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086587851

More specifically, the more complex the typology of (land cover) classes, the lower the resulting accuracies, since the common measures only consider whether a sample was correctly classified or not. To overcome this, a weighted accuracy measure was introduced in 2017 for the case of Local Climate Zone (LCZ) mapping. This method was recently criticized by Johnson and Jozdani and an alternative method was proposed. In this comment, we explain the weighted accuracy measure in more detail and reject the criticism.

Despite evidence that on-demand automotive fleets are ripe for electrification, adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in fleet applications has been hindered by lack of charging infrastructure and long charging times. Recent research on electrification programs in Chinese megacities suggests that top-down policy targets can spur investment in charging infrastructure, while intelligent charging coordination can greatly reduce requirements for battery range and infrastructure, as well as revenue losses due to time spent charging. Such capability may require labor policy reform to allow fleet operators to manage their drivers' charging behavior, along with collection and integration of several key data sets including (1) vehicle trajectories and energy consumption, (2) charging infrastructure installation costs, and (3) real-time charging station availability. In turn, digitization enabled by fleet electrification holds the potential to enable a host of smart urban mobility strategies, including integration of public transit with innovative transportation systems and emission-based pricing policies.

The DH2018 differed from previous events in being preceded by extreme spring warming and brightening, but moderate rainfall deficits, yet registering the fastest transition between wet winter conditions and extreme summer drought. Using 11 vegetation models, we show that spring conditions promoted increased vegetation growth, which, in turn, contributed to fast soil moisture depletion, amplifying the summer drought. We find regional asymmetries in summer ecosystem carbon fluxes: Increased (reduced) sink in the northern (southern) areas affected by drought. These asymmetries can be explained by distinct legacy effects of spring growth and of water-use efficiency dynamics mediated by vegetation composition, rather than by distinct ecosystem responses to summer heat/drought. The asymmetries in carbon and water exchanges during spring and summer 2018 suggest that future land-management strategies could influence patterns of summer heat waves and droughts under long-term warming. © 2020 The Authors.",,"Carbon; Climatology; Ecosystems; Soil moisture; Springs (components); Vegetation; Ecosystem carbons; Ecosystem productivity; Ecosystem response; Influence patterns; Moisture depletion; Vegetation composition; Vegetation growth; Water use efficiency; Drought",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086628448

While prosumers can contribute to emissions reduction efforts by using PV energy, the utilization of these technologies can also bring about several problems in the grid such as congestion and voltage variation. These problems could be mitigated if intermittent energy can be consumed where it is produced or alternatively converted to gas using power-to-gas (P2G) technology. In this regard, a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market with an integrated gas-energy storage system (GESS) is relevant to enhancing the utilization of locally produced energy. This can also minimize grid congestion and other problems due to reduced import (export) from (to) the grid. GESS consists of a P2G unit, gas storage unit and hydrogen fuel cell unit for storing surplus PV energy in gaseous form.

It was used for quantifying soil inorganic carbon (SIC) concentration in France based on a national library, and performances were evaluated on an independent regional set. Our objective was to improve the accuracy of MIRS predictions based on common multivariate regression, through spiking (enrichment of the national library with some representative target samples) with possible extra-weighting (replication of spiking samples) and local calibration (only using calibration samples that are spectral neighbours of each target samples), which have not been fully explored yet, in combination especially. Global (i.e. common) calibration yielded accurate prediction (standard error of prediction, SEP, was ≈ 5 g kg−1), which could be improved when the library was completed with spiking samples (optimally 10 samples extra-weighted 40 times; SEP = 3.3 g kg−1). Using spiking samples only (without the library) yielded slightly less accurate results (SEP = 3.6 g kg−1). Prediction was more accurate using local calibration without spiking, but on a validation set that was reduced because some validation samples lacked calibration neighbours (SEP = 2.5–2.7 g kg−1). Local calibration with spiking (optimally 10 samples without extra-weight) yielded somewhat less accurate prediction but for the full validation set when few calibration neighbours were required (SEP = 2.7 g kg−1), or higher accuracy on the reduced validation set when many neighbours were required (SEP = 2.3 g kg−1). These accurate predictions demonstrated the usefulness of representative spiking and local calibration for rendering large soil spectral libraries fully operational, while extra-weighting had no additional benefit. Along with more exhaustive spectral libraries, this paves the way for extensive use of MIRS for SIC determination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonates; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; France; National spectral library","Carbon; Carbonates; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Infrared spectroscopy; Libraries; Reflection; Regression analysis; Soils; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; France; Mid-infrared reflectances; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Multivariate regression; Soil inorganic carbons; Spectral libraries; Standard error of prediction; Calibration; calibration; carbonate; database; inorganic carbon; multivariate analysis; prediction; soil property; spectroscopy; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082013610

Identification of refugia typically includes modeling the distribution of a species’ current habitat and then extrapolating that distribution given projected changes in temperature and precipitation, or by mapping topographic features that buffer species from regional climate extremes. However, the function of those hypothesized refugia must be validated (or challenged) with independent data not used in the initial identification of the refugia. Although doing so would facilitate the incorporation of climate-change refugia into conservation and management decision making, a synthesis of validation methods is currently lacking. We reviewed the literature and defined four methods to test refugia predictions. We propose that such bottom-up approaches can lead to improved protected-area designations and on-the-ground management actions to reduce influences from non-climate stressors within potential refugia. © 2020 The Authors.

Shortsightedness and uncertainty have hindered progress in resolving this collective action problem and have been recognized as important barriers to cooperation among humans. Here, we propose a coupled social–ecological dilemma to investigate the interdependence of three well-identified components of this cooperation problem: 1) timescales of collapse and recovery in relation to time preferences regarding future outcomes, 2) the magnitude of the impact of collapse, and 3) the number of actors in the collective. We find that, under a sufficiently severe and time-distant collapse, how much the actors care for the future can transform the game from a tragedy of the commons into one of coordination, and even into a comedy of the commons in which cooperation dominates. Conversely, we also find conditions under which even strong concern for the future still does not transform the problem from tragedy to comedy. For a large number of participating actors, we find that the critical collapse impact, at which these game regime changes happen, converges to a fixed value of collapse impact per actor that is independent of the enhancement factor of the public good, which is usually regarded as the driver of the dilemma. Our results not only call for experimental testing but also help explain why polarization in beliefs about human-caused climate change can threaten global cooperation agreements.This work was developed in the context of the project on Coevolutionary Pathways in the Earth System at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), within the Princeton–Humboldt Cooperation and Collective Cognition Network, and the Princeton–Stockholm Resilience Centre–PIK Resilience Network.

Multiple experimental serpentinization studies attempted to identify the parameters that control the abiotic production of H2, CH4, and light HC. H2 is systematically and significantly formed in experiments, indicating that its production during serpentinization is well established. However, the large variance in concentration (eight orders of magnitude) is difficult to address because of the large number of parameters that vary from one experiment to another. CH4 and light HC production is much lower and also highly variable, leading to a vivid debate on potential role of metal catalysts and organic contamination. We have built a dataset that includes experimental setups, conditions, reactants, and products from 30 peer-reviewed articles reporting on experimental serpentinization and performed dimensionality reduction and network analysis to achieve an unbiased reading of the literature and fuel the debate. Our analysis distinguishes four experimental communities that highlights usual experimental protocols and the conditions tested so far. As expected, H2 production is mainly controlled by T and P though a strong variability remains within a given P-T range. Accessory metal-bearing phases seem to favor H2 production, while their role as catalyst or reactant is hampered by the lack of mineralogical characterization. CH4 and light HC concentrations are highly variable, uncorrelated to each other, and much lower than concentrations of potential reactants (H2, initial carbon). Accessory phases proposed as FTT catalysts do not enhance CH4 production, confirming the inefficiency of this reaction. CH4 only displays a positive correlation with temperature suggesting a kinetic/thermal control on its forming reaction. The carbon budget of some experiments indicates contamination in agreement with available labeled 13C studies. Salts in initial solutions are possible sources of organic contaminants. Natural systems certainly exploit longer reaction time or other reactional paths to form the observed CH4 and HC. The reducing potential of serpentinization can also produce intermediate metastable carbon phases in liquid or solid as observed in natural samples that should be targeted in future experiments. © Copyright © 2020 Barbier, Huang, Andreani, Tao, Hao, Eleish, Prabhu, Minhas, Fontaine, Fox and Daniel.","abiotic hydrogen; data and network analysis; experimental serpentinization; hydrothermal; methane","Budget control; Carbon; Catalysts; Dimensionality reduction; Hydrocarbons; Metal analysis; Metastable phases; Abiotic production; Experimental protocols; Hydrocarbon formation; Mineralogical characterization; Orders of magnitude; Organic contaminant; Organic contamination; Positive correlations; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087169524

However, combined 4R practices have not been assessed for their potential to reduce N2O emissions at the provincial-scale while also considering trade-offs with other N losses such as leaching or ammonia (NH3) volatilization. The objectives of this study were to develop, validate, and apply a Denitrification-Decomposition model framework at 270 distinct soil-climate regions in Ontario to simulate corn yield and N2O emissions across eleven fertilizer management scenarios during 1986–2015. The results show that broadcasting fertilizer at the surface without incorporation had the highest environmental N loss which was primarily caused by NH3 volatilization. When injected at planting or at sidedress, the NH3 loss was reduced considerably. However, because more N was left in the soil, injection and sidedressing induced more losses by nitrate leaching and N2O emissions. Reduction of N rate as proposed by the DNDC model did not affect crop yield but decreased leaching and N2O emissions. Addition of inhibitors promoted a further reduction in N2O emission (11–16%) although lesser than the reduction in N rate. Overall, our results emphasize that N rate adjustment following improvements in placement, use of inhibitors, and application timings can mitigate N2O emissions by 42–57% and result in 3–4% greater yields compared to baseline scenario in Ontario corn production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Corn; Fertilizer management; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide emission; Temperate climate","Ammonia; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Leaching; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen oxides; Application method; Application timing; Corn; Decomposition model; Fertilizer management; Nitrate leaching; Nitrous oxide emissions; Temperate climate; Nitrogen fertilizers; ammonia; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; crop production; crop yield; decomposition; denitrification; fertilizer application; maize; nitrogen; temperature effect; yield response; Article; climate change; computer simulation; cropping system; decomposition; denitrification; fertilizer application; maize; nitrate leaching; nonhuman; Ontario; plant growth; plant yield; priority journal; soil analysis; soil property; validation study; agriculture; maize; soil; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Zea mays; Agriculture; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Ontario; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081371832

The mesic grassland and shrubland biome in Hawai'i receives between 1200 and 2500 mm of rainfall each year. It exists on both windward and leeward slopes of the main Hawaiian islands, and is found in both lowland and montane-subalpine zones (Gagne and Cuddihy, 1999). The lowland and montane mesic zones vary by elevation and climate which influences the composition of species within each of the mesic grassland and shrubland ecotypes (Gagne and Cuddihy, 1999). Mesic grasslands and shrublands were distributed across all of the main Hawaiian islands historically, with the majority occurring on the islands of Hawai'i and Maui. This biome is still found on all of the main Hawaiian islands however it is now composed of a mixture of both native and non-native grassland and shrubland ecotypes. Current ecotypes include, the native lowland and montane-subalpine mesic grasslands and shrublands, and three introduced ecotypes: perennial grasslands, evergreen shrublands and deciduous shrublands. Stressors to the mesic grasslands and shrublands are introduced weeds and ungulates, fire, natural disasters (i.e., hurricanes), climate (i.e., drought), plant diseases, and human development/ agriculture. Ongoing conservation efforts are helping to protect the mesic grassland and shrubland biome in Hawai'i and depend on the combined efforts of the state and federal government, private landowners, and non-profit organizations. Management efforts are primarily focused on the removal of invasive species (weeds and ungulates) and protection of native grasslands and shrublands through the construction of fenced conservation areas. Our assessment of mesic grassland and shrubland viability is based on the likelihood of persistence over the long term, using the ecological concepts of representation, redundancy, and resiliency. We have evaluated the condition of the mesic grassland and shrubland biome in the foreseeable future (to year 2035) based on different scenarios involving the conservation management parameters of funding and public support for conservation management activities; conservation and biosecurity-related laws; and state/civic planning for conservation planning and land use and development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Plant functional traits are often used to predict plant performance and can offer a window into potential outcomes of restoration efforts across environmental gradients. We analyzed a database including 15 yr of seeding outcomes across 150 sites on the Colorado Plateau, a cold desert ecoregion in the western United States, and analyzed the independent and interactive effects of functional traits (seed mass, height, and specific leaf area) and local biologically relevant climate variables on seeding success. We predicted that the best models would include an interaction between plant traits and climate, indicating a need to match the right trait value to the right climate conditions to maximize seeding success. Indeed, we found that both plant height and seed size significantly interacted with temperature seasonality, with larger seeds and taller plants performing better in more seasonal environments. We also determined that these trait–environment patterns are not influenced by whether a species is native or nonnative. Our results inform the selection of seed mixes for restoring areas with specific climatic conditions, while also demonstrating the strong influence of temperature seasonality on seeding success in the Colorado Plateau region. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","climate suitability; dryland; height; plant functional traits; restoration; seed mass; temperature seasonality","anthropogenic effect; climate conditions; desert; disturbance; dryland farming; ecoregion; environmental gradient; plant; restoration ecology; seasonality; seed size; seeding; Colorado Plateau; United States; Colorado; ecosystem; plant; plant seed; temperature; Colorado; Ecosystem; Plants; Seeds; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083449610

Among the various transition metals, copper has attracted attention as it yields more reduced and C2 products even while using mononuclear copper center as catalysts. In addition, it is found that reversible formation of copper nanoparticle acts as the real catalytically active site for the conversion of CO2 to reduced products. Here, it is demonstrated that the dinuclear molecular copper complex immobilized over graphitized mesoporous carbon can act as catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons (methane and ethylene) up to 60%. Interestingly, high selectivity toward C2 product (40% faradaic efficiency) is achieved by a molecular complex based hybrid material from CO2 in 0.1 m KCl. In addition, the role of local pH, porous structure, and carbon support in limiting the mass transport to achieve the highly reduced products is demonstrated. Although the spectroscopic analysis of the catalysts exhibits molecular nature of the complex after 2 h bulk electrolysis, morphological study reveals that the newly generated copper cluster is the real active site during the catalytic reactions. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study attempts to develop a new composite drought vulnerability index (CDVI) comprising both crop and dairy indicators for 30 districts of Tamil Nadu, India. The computation of index was based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach using exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Initially, indicators were normalized to make sure that all the indicators are comparable and weights were assigned to each indicator based on principal component analysis. Then, the districts were classified as high, moderate and less vulnerable on the basis of magnitude of the index. Coimbatore has the highest exposure to drought vulnerability (0.58) and the lowest was in Krishnagiri (0.35). In case of sensitivity, the highest was in Kancheepuram (0.69), while the lowest was in Tiruppur (0.26). The highest adaptive capacity was observed in Nagapattinam (0.52) and the lowest was in Tiruppur (0.24). None of the districts had higher adaptive capacity than sensitivity and exposure, combinedly. Overall, CDVI was highest in Kanchipuram (0.88), lowest in Erode (0.45) and moderate in Thanjavur (0.73). District level vulnerability mapping showed that twelve districts were categorized as highly vulnerable to drought; eight districts as moderately vulnerable; and ten districts as less vulnerable. Most of the districts in north eastern and southern agro-climatic zones; a few districts in Cauvery delta and western zones of Tamil Nadu had come under high vulnerable category, while a majority of the districts in north western, western and high rainfall zones were less vulnerable. To mitigate drought vulnerability, government should focus and aid in developing regional level adaptation strategies such as water conserving techniques/farm pond and appropriate policy measures to safeguard the livelihood from agriculture and dairying. Also, special attention may be given to local people's understandings about drought including traditional practices to cope-up vulnerability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Composite drought vulnerability index (CDVI); Principal component analysis; Vulnerability mapping","Agriculture; Drought; Mapping; Principal component analysis; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Climatic zone; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Policy measures; Regional levels; Vulnerability index; Vulnerability mappings; Climate change; climate change; drought; index method; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mapping method; principal component analysis; vulnerability; India; Tamil Nadu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079864026

The studied mechanism consists of a discrete block that is separated from the rock mass by a tension crack filled with a wedge block or rock fragments. Irreversible block sliding is assumed to develop down a gently dipping sliding plane in response to climatic thermal fluctuations and consequent contraction and expansion of the sliding and wedge block materials. A concrete block assembly representing the rock mass is placed in a specially designed climate controlled room. An integrated measurement system tracks the block displacement and temperature evolution over time. Results of the numerical 3DEC model and an existing analytical solution are compared with the experimental results and the sensitivity of the numerical and analytical solutions to the input thermo-mechanical parameters is explored. To test the applicability of our physical and numerical models to the field scale, we compare our numerical simulations with monitored displacements of a slender block that was mapped in the East slope of Mount Masada, as up until recently the governing mechanism for this block displacement has been assumed to be seismically driven. By application of our numerical approach to the physical dimensions of the block in the field we find that, in fact, thermal loading alone can explain the mapped accumulated displacement that has surpassed by now 200 mm. We believe this new, thermally-induced, failure mechanism may play a significant role in slope stability problems due to the cumulative and repetitive nature of the displacement, particularly in rock slopes in fractured rock masses that are exposed to high temperature oscillations. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","3DEC; Climate controlled room; Coupled thermo-mechanical response; Discrete element method; Rock slope stability; Wedging mechanism","Concrete blocks; Finite difference method; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Slope protection; Slope stability; Stress analysis; 3DEC; Climate controlled room; Contraction and expansion; Coupled thermo-mechanical; Distinct element methods; High-temperature oscillations; Rock slope stability; Thermo-mechanical parameters; Failure (mechanical); accretionary prism; displacement; failure mechanism; high temperature; numerical model; rock mechanics; sliding; slope dynamics; slope stability; three-dimensional modeling; Israel; Masada; Southern District",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081682144

To achieve a green economic transformation, China urgently needs to develop renewable energy technologies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the relationship among income inequality, renewable energy technological innovation (RETI) and CO2 emissions has not received sufficient attention in the current literature. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2000 to 2015, this paper adopts a panel fixed effect regression model and a panel threshold model to perform an analysis on the nonlinear relationship among these factors. The results show that (1) RETI is conducive to reducing per capita CO2 emissions (PCE). However, with an increase in income inequality, the abatement effect of RETI on per capita CO2 emissions will be hindered, and RETI will even positively contribute to PCE. (2) The panel threshold model shows that the impact of RETI on PCE has a significant single-threshold effect with regard to income inequality. When income inequality is lower than the threshold value, the impact of RETI on PCE is not significant. However, above the threshold value, that is, within the interval of higher income inequality, an increase in RETI will positively contribute to PCE. Finally, from the perspectives of income inequality and RETI, relevant policy implications are put forward for achieving the transformation of a low-carbon economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Income inequality; Panel threshold model; Renewable energy technological innovation","carbon dioxide; abatement cost; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental policy; equity; income distribution; innovation; panel data; pollution control; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; income; model; renewable energy; technology; China; economic development; income; invention; renewable energy; socioeconomics; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Income; Inventions; Renewable Energy; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082681685

In order to reach this goal, it is crucial to reduce GHGEs that result from energy consumption in apartment buildings, which account for approximately 65% of all buildings in the capital region where the population is concentrated. Moreover, as apartment buildings not only have high window-to wall area ratios, but also use insulating glazing (IG) with low thermal performance, an advanced window system with low heat transmittance (U-value), such as a concrete structure, is necessary for effective GHGE reduction. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the GHGE reduction effects from replacing existing IG vacuum insulating glazing (VIG) with low U-values in the apartment housing located in the capital region. The analysis revealed the possibility of a GHGE reduction by 45%-79% with the application of commercial VIG with U-values of 0.7W/m2·K in lieu of the existing IG with U-values ranging from 1.2 to 3.3W/m2·K for all apartment buildings located in the capital region. Furthermore, GHGEs could be reduced by 82%-93% by replacing the existing IG with VIG with U-values of 0.2 W/m2·K. © 2020 by the authors.","Apartment buildings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Insulating glazing (IG); Vacuum insulating glazing (VIG)","Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Glazes; Greenhouse gases; Insulation; Apartment buildings; Apartment housings; Building sectors; Business-as-usual; Potential effects; Reduction effects; Thermal Performance; Window system; Apartment houses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086375681

The dormancy period is induced by low temperatures, but also dormancy release results from quantitative and cumulative perception of chilling. This trait is highly genotype-dependent, and an important limiting factor for production in a climate change scenario. Peach has been widely used for studying seasonal dormancy in adult tissues at physiological and molecular level, as a model for other perennial plants from temperate climates. Molecular studies of buds from cultivars that differed in chilling requirements are needed to study correlation between bud characteristics during dormancy with genetic chilling requirements, physiology status and transcriptomic studies of genes linked to dormancy release. This study reviews the different genes identified whose expression correlates with the dormancy status of buds. Studies of DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) whose expression is upregulated during dormancy are presented. Also, PpSAP1 gene coding for a stress associate protein (SAP) with two zinc-finger domains correlates its expression in dormant buds with dormancy release. PpSAP1 is repressed in flower buds after dormancy release, but hydric stresses induce its expression, similarly to other SAP genes in plants. The constitutive expression of PpSAP1 in plum increases its tolerance to water stress. Sorbitol is the primary photosynthetic product and the major phloem-translocated form of carbon in the Rosaceae. PpeS6PDH encodes a sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase involved in sorbitol synthesis that is expressed in dormant flower buds concomitantly with sorbitol accumulation. PpeS6PDH gene expression is affected by cold and water deficit stress suggesting a role of this gene in protection of buds against abiotic stresses, particularly chilling and desiccation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy release will become crucial to manage tree crop production under warmer conditions. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Policy makers are interested in the macroeconomic consequences of such decarbonization pathways and often rely on integrated modelling studies. However, the underlying modelling assumptions and uncertainties often remain unquestioned or invisible, although they may govern the models' results. For the case of a zero-process emission pathway of the European iron and steel industry, we demonstrate how different assumptions on different “layers” of uncertainty influence results. We show that effects strongly depend on technology choice, prevailing macroeconomic states as well as regional characteristics. The underlying socio-economic development and the climate policy trajectory seem to play a less important role. Particularly, we find that the choice of model, i.e. which macroeconomic theory strand it arises from, influences the sign and magnitude of macroeconomic effects and thus should be well understood in terms of appropriate interpretations by both modelers and policy makers. We emphasize that model assumptions should be transparent, results sought as to be robust across a range of possible contexts, and presented together with the conditions under which they are valid. To that end, co-design and co-production in research would support its relevance and applicability. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change mitigation; Iron and steel; Low carbon transition; Macroeconomic modelling; Process emissions; Uncertainty","emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; international agreement; iron and steel industry; magnitude; technological change; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080147703

We tested whether the ratio of CO2 elimination at the lung and the V-A ECMO (V CO2 E C M O /V CO2 Lung) would reflect the ratio of respective blood flows and could be used to estimate changes in pulmonary blood flow (Q Lung), i.e., native cardiac output. Four healthy pigs were centrally cannulated for V-A ECMO. We measured blood flows with an ultrasonic flow probe. V CO2 E C M O and V CO2Lung were calculated from sidestream capnographs under constant pulmonary ventilation during V-A ECMO weaning with changing sweep gas and/or V-A ECMO blood flow. If ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (V /Q ) of V-A ECMO was not 1, the V CO2 E C M O was normalized to V /Q = 1 (V CO2 ECMONorm). Changes in pulmonary blood flow were calculated using the relationship between changes in CO2 elimination and V-A ECMO blood flow (Q ECMO). Q ECMOcorrelated strongly with V CO2 ECMONorm(r2 0.95- 0.99). Q Lungcorrelated well with V CO2 Lung (r2 0.65- 0.89, P &lt; = 0.002). Absolute Q Lungcould not be calculated in a nonsteady state. Calculated pulmonary blood flow changes had a bias of 76 (-266 to 418) mL/min and correlated with measured Q Lung(r2 0.974 -1.000, P = 0.1 to 0.006) for cumulative ECMO flow reductions. In conclusion, V CO2 of the lung correlated strongly with pulmonary blood flow. Our model could predict pulmonary blood flow changes within clinically acceptable margins of error. The prediction is made possible with normalization to a V /Q of 1 for ECMO.

Water is the primary medium through which the impacts of climate change will be felt. Securing the water sector and enhancing water security is, therefore, imperative for any adaptive response to climate change. A precursor in improving water security is to first establish a mechanism to measure it. Only then can incremental and progressive actions be evaluated. This study has developed such a mechanism in the form of a water security assessment framework using an indictor-based methodology. The framework is developed for city-scale analysis because analyses at this scale is more useful in operationalizing water security enhancement. The framework has a three-layered structure comprising five dimensions (broad elements of water security), twelve indicators (areas of interest within the dimensions), and a set of potential variables that can be used to quantify the indicators. The framework has been developed to foster practical interventions for water security enhancement and not as a comparative tool for benchmarking. Hence, while the dimensions and indicators of the framework are fixed, the choice of variables is up to the city depending upon its context. This aspect of the framework, therefore, is meant to help cities introspect internally and move up the water security ladder. The framework culminates into a Water Security Index (WSI), measured on a scale from one to five. The scale is linear and hierarchical in its grade value. The framework was successfully used to assess the water security situation of Bangkok. The study also makes a case for scaling up this intervention for other major cities in Thailand, which can then help implement some of Thailand's key climate change adaptation initiatives such as the Nationally Determined Contributions and the National Climate Change Master Plan. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bangkok; Climate change; Frameworks; Indicators; Water security","ground water; surface water; water; adaptive management; analytical framework; climate change; environmental indicator; methodology; water planning; aquatic environment; Article; city; climate change; economic aspect; evolutionary adaptation; extreme weather; hygiene; natural disaster; priority journal; risk reduction; sanitation; scale up; Thailand; waste water management; water availability; water conservation; water pollution; water quality; water supply; water treatment; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; Cities; Climate Change; Thailand; Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082192472

The CDM has successfully produced certified emission reductions (CERs); however, the sustainable development outcomes of CDM projects especially their socio-economic impacts on communities have been widely debated. This study introduces the implementation process for CDM FCSPs in China. We employ actor-centered power (ACP) theory as our main analytical framework to analyze the power process between actors and how this alters project outcomes. The results of our analysis demonstrate that the Provincial Forestry and Grassland Bureau, the County Forestry and Grassland Bureau, village cadres, and rural households were all powerful actors during the implementation process. Each actor had different power sources and influenced the behavior of other actors, which altered project outcomes at different stages.

Thus, a thorough identification and characterization of the many factors of change is key for an adequate assessment of the effectiveness of policies adopted at the local level, as well as for future planning. Such thorough identification and characterization of the factors that are determinant for the evolution of the local energy system is the content of this paper. The identification is performed through a systematic literature review, followed by a synthesis process. The factors identified are grouped into the categories of local context, local socioeconomic and cultural evolution, higher-level governance framework, and local climate change mitigation actions. They are represented through a set of measurable variables. The factors and respective variables can be used to improve the disaggregation of changes in the local energy system into individual causes, leading to a better assessment of the evolution over time. © 2020 by the authors.","Local climate policy; Local GHG emissions; Multilevel governance; Municipal authorities; Municipal energy planning","Climate change; Cultural evolution; Economic trends; Future planning; Local energy systems; Local policies; Measurable variables; Synthesis process; Systematic literature review; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089206119

Malaysia has devoted to reduce the carbon dioxide emission by the year of 2020. Therefore, the Interlocking Compressed Earth Bricks (ICEB) has been introduced as an alternative for low carbon building material. This paper studies the carbon footprint of Interlocking Compressed Earth Bricks as a walling structure in buildings or residential houses. The Interlocking Compressed Earth Bricks system is an improvement from the conventional brick production where the brick is fabricated by compressed method (not fired), thus reducing the carbon emissions. This paper presents a cradle-to-gate carbon emission study of a multi-story residential building in a Community house in Tawau, Sabah by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The total carbon of the buildings using conventional FCB and ICEB construction are 405.75 kgCO2/m2 and 264.50 kgCO2/m2, respectively, which are comparable with the results of similar studies found in the literature. In order to achieve low-carbon buildings for the residential houses in Sabah, the use of ICEB as alternative materials with low carbon intensities and sustainable construction practices are suitable and recommended. The result shows that the implementation of Interlocking Compressed Earth Bricks contributes to carbon footprint reduction of 35% from the conventional and suitable to be used as a low carbon footprint building material. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Brick; Carbon dioxide; Construction; Emission control; Global warming; Houses; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Alternative materials; Building construction; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprint reductions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-Carbon Buildings; Residential building; Sustainable construction; Carbon footprint",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086758697

Measurements were made from the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146-301 atmospheric research aircraft with the aim to sample, characterise and quantify the impact of megacity outflow pollution on air quality in the surrounding region. Conditions were extremely favourable for airborne measurements, and all three flights were able to observe clear pollution events along the flight path. A small change in wind direction provided sufficiently different air mass origins over the 2 d such that a distinct pollution plume from London, attributable marine emissions and a double-peaked dispersed area of pollution resulting from a combination of local and transported emissions were measured. We were able to analyse the effect of London emissions on air quality in the wider region and the extent to which local sources contribute to pollution events. The background air upwind of London was relatively clean during both days; concentrations of CO were 88-95 ppbv, total (measured) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were 1.6-1.8 ppbv and NOx was 0.7- 0.8 ppbv. Downwind of London, we encountered elevations in all species with CO>100 ppbv, VOCs 2.8-3.8 ppbv, CH4>2080 ppbv and NOx>4 ppbv, and peak concentrations in individual pollution events were higher still. Levels of O3 were inversely correlated with NOx during the first flight, with O3 concentrations of 37 ppbv upwind falling to 26 ppbv in the well-defined London plume. Total pollutant fluxes from London were estimated through a vertical plane downwind of the city. Our calculated CO2 fluxes are within the combined uncertainty of those estimated previously, but there was a greater disparity in our estimates of CH4 and CO. On the second day, winds were lighter and downwind O3 concentrations were elevated to 39-43 ppbv (from 32 to 35 ppbv upwind), reflecting the contribution of more aged pollution to the regional background. Elevations in pollutant concentrations were dispersed over a wider area than the first day, although we also encountered a number of clear transient enhancements from local sources. This series of flights demonstrated that even in a region of megacity outflow, such as the south-east of the UK, local fresh emissions and more distant UK sources of pollution can all contribute substantially to pollution events. In the highly complex atmosphere around a megacity where a high background level of pollution mixes with a variety of local sources at a range of spatial and temporal scales and atmospheric dynamics are further complicated by the urban heat island, the use of pollutant ratios to track and determine the ageing of air masses may not be valid. The individual sources must therefore all be well-characterised and constrained to understand air quality around megacities such as London. Research aircraft offer that capability through targeted sampling of specific sources and longitudinal studies monitoring trends in emission strength and profiles over time. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

However, public confidence in the reliability of charging infrastructure remains a fundamental barrier to adoption. Using large-scale social data and machine-learning based on 12,720 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, we provide national evidence on how well the existing charging infrastructure is serving the needs of the rapidly expanding population of EV drivers in 651 core-based statistical areas in the United States. We deploy supervised machine-learning algorithms to automatically classify unstructured text reviews generated by EV users. Extracting behavioural insights at a population scale has been challenging given that streaming data can be costly to hand classify. Using computational approaches, we reduce processing times for research evaluation from weeks of human processing to just minutes of computation. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we find that stations at private charging locations do not outperform public charging locations provided by the government. Overall, nearly half of drivers who use mobility applications have faced negative experiences at EV charging stations in the early growth years of public charging infrastructure, a problem that needs to be fixed as the market for electrified and sustainable transportation expands. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Charging infrastructures; Computational approach; Ev charging stations; Fundamental barriers; Negative experiences; Supervised machine learning; Sustainable transportation; Transportation sector; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085901678

The present study aims to present specific underground energy and CO2 storage sites in Greece. Thermal capacity calculations from twenty-two studied aquifers (4 × 10-4-25 × 10-3 MJ) indicate that those of Mesohellenic Trough (Northwest Greece), Western Thessaloniki basin and Botsara flysch (Northwestern Greece) exhibit the best performance. Heat capacity was investigated in fourteen aquifers (throughout North and South Greece) and three abandoned mines of Central Greece. Results indicate that aquifers present higher average total heat energy values (up to ∼6.05 ×106 MWh(th)), whereas abandoned mines present significantly higher average area heat energy contents (up to ∼5.44 × 106 MWh(th)). Estimations indicate that the Sappes, Serres and Komotini aquifers could cover the space heating energy consumption of East Macedonia-Thrace region. Underground gas storage was investigated in eight aquifers, four gas fields and three evaporite sites. Results indicate that Prinos and South Kavala gas fields (North Greece) could cover the electricity needs of households in East Macedonia and Thrace regions. Hydrogen storage capacity of Corfu and Kefalonia islands is 53,200 MWh(e). These values could cover the electricity needs of 6770 households in the Ionian islands.

Air masses originating from the Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BB), and southern Asia (SA) exhibited distinct characteristics of timeresolved sub-micron non-refractory PM1 (NRPM1) species, size distributions, and CCN number concentrations. The SA air mass had the highest NRPM1 loading with high chloride and organics, followed by the BB air mass, which was more contaminated than AS, with a higher organic fraction and nitrate. The primary sources were identified as biomassburning, thermal power plant emissions, industrial emissions, and vehicular emissions. The average hygroscopicity parameter (k), calculated by the mixing rule, was approximately 0.3 (varying between 0.13 and 0.77) for all the air masses (0:32± 0:06 for AS, 0:31 ± 0:06 for BB, and 0:32 ± 0:10 for SA). The diurnal variations in k were impacted by the chemical properties and thus source activities. The total, Aitken, and accumulation mode number concentrations were higher for SA, followed by BB and AS. The mean values of estimated CCN number concentration (NCCN; 3669-28926 cm-3) and the activated fraction (af; 0.19-0.87), for supersaturations varying from 0.1 % to 0.8 %, also showed the same trend, implying that these were highest in SA, followed by those in BB and then those in AS. The size turned out to be more important than chemical composition directly, and the NCCN was governed by either the Aitken or accumulation modes, depending upon the supersaturation (SS) and critical diameter (Dc). af was governed mainly by the geometric mean diameter (GMD), and such a high af (0:71±0:14 for the most dominant sub-branch of the SA air mass-R1-at 0.4 % SS) has not been seen anywhere in the world for a continental site. The high af was a consequence of very low Dc (25-130 nm, for SS ranging from 0.1 % to 0.8 %) observed for Delhi. Indirectly, the chemical properties also impacted CCN and af by impacting the diurnal patterns of Aitken and accumulation modes, k and Dc. The high-hygroscopic nature of aerosols, high NCCN, and high af can severely impact the precipitation patterns of the Indian monsoon in Delhi, impact the radiation budget, and have indirect effects and need to be investigated to quantify this impact. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; climate forcing; cloud condensation nucleus; concentration (composition); formation mechanism; hygroscopicity; long range transport; physicochemical property; pollutant transport; radiative forcing; size distribution; Delhi; India; New Delhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089582265

Even the renewable energy portion is increasing in a developing country. Coal is still the majority as the main fuel of power plant because of abundant availability and low price that makes energy production cost becomes cheap. Besides its advantages, coal also contributes most of the emissions from the power generation sector. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that in 2019 emissions of electricity sector contribute to 33% of the global sulfur dioxide (SO2), 14% of the nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 5% particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Coal-fired power plants generate 75% of SO2, 70% of NOx, and over 90% of its PM2.5 emissions. The implementation of Life cycle assessment in this research contained in ISO-14040 and ISO-14044. The four LCA steps are goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and interpretation. One of the typical LCA gate to gate LCA method is used to calculate the global warming potential and acidification potential with the parameter of ton CO2-eq/ GWh and ton-SO2 eq/ GWh. The object of this research is emphasized in the study on one of the biggest coal power plants in Indonesia with unit size 300 MW, which are using medium calory coal for its fuel. The result is the power plant global warming potential is 800-ton CO2 eq/ GWh and Acidification Potential (AP) is 0.6-ton SO2 eq/ GWh. The novelty in this research was to create a database of emissions per electricity produce from a coal power plant in Indonesia. From the database, people can clearly understand the condition of energy production of coal power plant in Indonesia and comparing with another coal power plant in the world. © 2020 ACM.","Coal; Emissions; GHG; LCA; Power Plant","Acidification; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Costs; Developing countries; Fuels; Global warming; Industrial research; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Systems engineering; Coal-fired power plant; Global warming potential; International energy agency; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle inventories; Particulate Matter; Renewable energies; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090966033

The study of the relationship between fire and climate could provide new approaches for understanding fire dynamics in semiarid regions, which could be useful for strategically managing the loss and recovery of natural resources under threat. Here, we evaluated the patterns of fires occurrence in a semiarid Caatinga-Cerrado ecotone in the Northeast Region of Brazil by characterizing their spatiotemporal dynamics associated with climatic conditions. Using a temporal series of 306 Landsat images, we mapped a burned area database at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) from 1999 to 2017 in the Capivara-Confusões Mosaic of protected areas and their surroundings. Fire seasonality was analyzed through climatic seasons, distinguishing between the rainy season (RS), early dry season (EDS), middle dry season (MDS) and late dry season (LDS), by analysis of the daily precipitation of ground-based stations in the area. We created yearly, seasonal and recurrence maps of burned areas to assess fire regimes. The results showed that the 48% of the area was burned during the 19-year long period considered. Serra das Confusões National Park (SCoNP) had 302,644 ha burned, Serra da Capivara National Park (SCaNP) had 2056 ha burned and the ecological corridor had 215,718 ha burned. Most of the burned area was registered during the MDS (36% of the study area), there was almost no burned area in the EDS (<0.01%), while the LDS (7%) and the RS (4%) had similar dimensions burned. The years that burned the most (2001, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015) were followed by years with considerably less burned area. We identified a multiple-year process, consisting of a climatological year with above-average precipitation and consequent low burned area, followed by a climatological year with below-average precipitation and resulting in large extensions of burned area (periods: 1999–2001, 2008–2010, 2010–2012). Fire recurrence reached a maximum value of ten, with 47% of the area burned presenting some degree of recurrence. SCaNP presented no fire recurrence, while SCoNP had a maximum recurrence parameter of four. Areas with moderate fire recurrence were near roads, settlements or cities. Some recurrently burned areas presented similar shapes, which were associated with topography limiting the spread of the fires. The patterns that we described here constitute the first step toward understanding the fire regimes of the region to establish directions for improving management strategies and orienting policies in the area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Caatinga; Cerrado; Fire recurrence; Precipitation; Seasonality","Arid regions; Conservation; Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Precipitation (chemical); Topography; Tropics; Caatinga; Cerrado; Daily precipitations; Ground-based stations; Management strategies; Seasonality; Seasonally dry tropical forests; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Fires; caatinga; cerrado; dry season; ecotone; fire history; Landsat; precipitation assessment; satellite imagery; savanna; seasonality; tropical forest; wet season; Brazil; Piaui; Serra da Capivara National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079179665

Economic outlook and gender are frequently identified as two sources of this variation, as Americans often view the climate change issue as a tradeoff between economic and environmental risk, and women tend to express more concern than men about this issue. Much of the existing literature links the two by focusing on the role of economic outlook and worldview differences between genders to explain this gender gap. In short, economic concern overrides environmental concern, and males are more sensitive to economic concern, even with appropriate socioeconomic controls. However, little research has empirically investigated this interplay between gender and economic outlook. Using a large sample survey, this study investigates the relationships between economic outlook, gender, and support for climate change mitigation strategies. Findings suggest that economic outlook has a significant effect, and that it moderates gender effects. We find large gender effects among those who feel most economically vulnerable, but these differences dissipate as economic outlook improves. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Economic outlook; Gender; Global warming; Public opinion","climate change; gender discrimination; gender disparity; socioeconomic status; trade-off; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081903245

This paper has developed a methodology for designing a roof extension and renovating an existing residential building as a measure of housing creation in already consolidated neighborhoods, and achieve a nZEB and ZEB renovated buildings. Based on typological classification of residential buildings, a single solution applicable to a multiple number of cases is provided to maximize the potential of the proposed solution. This solution was implemented in Chantrea neighborhood in Pamplona, Spain. The results show that it is possible to carry out the renovation of a residential building with a rooftop extension that complies with requirements for models nZEB and ZEB, and to apply this solution on 27 % of the neighborhood stock residential buildings. This would provide a reduction of total primary energy consumption of 62 % (nZEB) and 74 % (ZEB). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock; Building typology; Nearly Zero Energy Building; Residential building renovation; Rooftop stacking; Urban regeneration","Emission control; Energy utilization; Housing; Building stocks; Building typologies; Residential building; Rooftop stacking; Urban regeneration; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081702294

Biodiesel is otherwise referred as “neat” fuel. It is a fuel derived from a chemical reaction of alcohol (methyl, ethyl, butyl, propyl, isopropyl) and vegetable or animal oils, fats, or greases. These oils or fats are chemically altered in order to use in any diesel engine, with little or no modification. A process called transesterification removes the glycerin component of the oil (which is a triglyceride molecule), resulting in a much thinner, or less viscous product, which stays down to much lower temperatures. It significantly reduces harmful pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide gas and reduces our vehicles contribution to climate change. Current oil and gas reserves are sufficing to last only a few more decades. The scarcity of known petroleum reserves will make renewable energy sources more attractive. To meet the rising energy demand and replace petroleum reserves, fuels, natural gas etc., Biodiesel is in the forefront of alternative technologies. The first record of Biodiesel usage was in 31st August 1937, by the University of Brussels, Belgium who conducted transesterification of vegetable oil using ethanol in order to separate the fatty acids from glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short liner alcohols. More recently Renault and Peugeot have approved the use of biodiesel in some of their own truck engines. In 1991, the European Community (EC) proposed a 90% tax deduction for the use of biofuels, including biodiesel. Now a days each of the plant are producing up to &gt;1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. The European Union accounted for nearly 89% of all biodiesel production worldwide in 2005.

The atmospheric pollen season was similar in duration, except for some types belonging to the genera Plantago and Urticaceae, which showed divergent values most probably due to the influence of climatic conditions. The meteorological parameter most significantly correlated to pollen concentration was temperature, being negative for winter species and positive for plants preferring warmer climates.

Although developing countries – especially fossil-fuel exporters – may be most concerned by this issue, its analysis in development (economics) has so far been limited. We aim at enhancing the understanding of stranded assets by investigating its relevance in the resource sectors of three case study regions –the Middle East, China, and Latin America. For this, we analyse the regional dimensions of four interdisciplinary global energy scenarios. Specifically, we extract results from a numerical energy model (energy production, energy consumption, electricity generation) for the three regions and introduce a novel index for stranded assets. The index identifies which fossil fuel sector in each region is most prone to asset stranding and should receive the most attention from national and international policymakers. We find that considerable uncertainty exists for the Chinese coal sector as well as the Middle Eastern and Latin American crude oil sectors. We finally put our results into perspective by discussing aspects that are closely related to stranded assets for resource-rich economies such as the uncertainty in global energy and climate policy, the resource curse and diversification, economic resilience, and unequal burden-sharing of climate policy efforts between industrialised economies and latecomers. We conclude that China is more likely to engage in a green transformation than the Latin Americas or, still less, the Middle East. © 2020 The Author(s)","China; Climate policy; Green transformation; Middle East; Scenarios; Stranded assets","crude oil; developing world; electricity generation; energy use; environmental policy; fossil fuel; scenario analysis; sustainable development; China; Latin America; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081217883

Here, the findings of research from the past decade into thermal requirements for germination are synthesised for more than 100 plant species from southern Western Australia. This global biodiversity hotspot is predicted to suffer major plant collapse under forecast climate change. A temperature gradient plate was used to assess the thermal requirements underpinning seed germination in both commonly occurring and geographically restricted species. The results suggest that the local climate of the seed source sites does not drive seed responses, neither is it indicative of temperatures for optimal germination. The low diurnal phase of the temperature regime provided the most significant impact on germination timing. Several species germinated optimally at mean temperatures below or close to current wet quarter temperatures, and more than 40% of species were likely to be impacted in the future, with germination occurring under supra-optimal temperature conditions. This research highlights both species vulnerability and resilience to a warming climate during the regeneration phase of the life cycle and provides vital information for those aiming to manage, conserve and restore this regional flora. © 2020 by the author.

Driving cycle represents traffic behaviour in a specific area or city. Objectives of this paper are; to characterize and validate the parameters of BAS KITe driving cycle with existing driving cycle, to develop BAS KITe driving cycle using k-means method, and to analyse the energy consumption and emissions of BAS KITe driving cycle for conventional and plug-in hybrid electric types using AUTONOMIE software. The methodology consists of data collection, route selection and cycle development. From the validation, it can be concluded that the MATLAB code is acceptable for further analysis. The BAS KITe driving cycle is developed with 36 final micro-trips and 21.49 km/h of average speed. Hence, energy consumption and emissions analysis shows that the PHEB powertrain gives the best result with reduced energy consumption and emissions thereby minimizing the impact on the environment and economy. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; MATLAB; Transportation routes; Data collection; Impact on the environment; K-means method; Plug-in hybrids; Public transportation; Reduced energy; Route Selection; Specific areas; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086799732

Although site energy metrics are paramount in these standards, the roots are in reducing carbon emissions. This article describes the influence that using regional, rather than broad (i.e., continent-wide), energy supply carbon emission factors can have on the life cycle operating carbon emission outcome for single-family dwellings designed according to a passive house standard for three climatic locations across Canada, using two mechanical systems with different fuels. All three cities significantly differ when using regional carbon emissions factors, compared with a broad average. Recommendations are made to generate a hybrid carbon intensity factor balancing national and regional electrical grid carbon intensities.

The aim of this paper is to identify their potential use for the thermal renovation of opaque facades of buildings in order to reach climate adaptivity. Adaptive facade concept offers a huge potential for thermal renovation, by improving occupants’ comfort, promoting sector decarbonization, and being an opportunity for adapting facades to climate change. A literature review permitted the systematization of thermal renovation adaptive strategies (TRAS) in which ARTs can be useful. The facade reversible changes (outputs) required for each strategy were identified, as well as the possible adaptation mechanisms to obtain them. The technologies responding within the recognized adaptation mechanisms were described and compared, their readiness level identified and their role within the TRAS was assigned. An approach to assess the suitability of each ART regarding TRAS for existing facades was conceived. It uses the criteria of aesthetic change, additional space and demolition needs, localization and area of intervention. The role of each ART within each TRAS, here systematized, will support the definition of the ART's operational range for each application and climate, and will promote the research and development of these technologies for thermal renovation of buildings’ facades. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive envelope; Adaptive strategies; Auto-responsive technologies; Opaque facades; Thermal Renovation","Climate change; Adaptation mechanism; Adaptive strategy; External stimulus; Literature reviews; Operational range; Readiness levels; Research and development; Reversible change; Facades",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083332795

Here, we present evidence that the form of nitrogen governs the partitioning of carbon among members in a genome-sequenced, model phototrophic biofilm of 20 members. Consumption of NO3- as the sole nitrogen source unexpectedly resulted in more rapid transfer of carbon to heterotrophs than when NH4- was also provided, suggesting alterations in the form of carbon exchanged. The form of nitrogen dramatically impacted net community nitrogen, but not carbon, uptake rates. Furthermore, this alteration in nitrogen form caused very large but focused alterations to community structure, strongly impacting the abundance of only two species within the biofilm and modestly impacting a third member species. Our data suggest that nitrogen metabolism may coordinate coupled carbon-nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in benthic biofilms and, potentially, in phototroph-heterotroph consortia more broadly. It further indicates that the form of nitrogen inputs may significantly impact the contribution of these communities to carbon partitioning across the terrestrial-aquatic interface. Importance: Anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen into aquatic ecosystems, and especially those of agricultural origin, involve a mix of chemical species. Although it is well-known in general that nitrogen eutrophication markedly influences the metabolism of aquatic phototrophic communities, relatively little is known regarding whether the specific chemical form of nitrogen inputs matter. Our data suggest that the nitrogen form alters the rate of nitrogen uptake significantly, whereas corresponding alterations in carbon uptake were minor. However, differences imposed by uptake of divergent nitrogen forms may result in alterations among phototroph-heterotroph interactions that rewire community metabolism. Furthermore, our data hint that availability of other nutrients (i.e., iron) might mediate the linkage between carbon and nitrogen cycling in these communities. Taken together, our data suggest that different nitrogen forms should be examined for divergent impacts on phototrophic communities in fluvial systems and that these anthropogenic nitrogen inputs may significantly differ in their ultimate biogeochemical impacts. © 2020 Anderton et al.","Carbon cycling; Cyanobacteria; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen cycling; Stable isotopes","carbon; nitrogen; aquatic environment; Article; benthos; biofilm; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycling; carbon metabolism; carbon partitioning; community dynamics; community structure; cyanobacterium; eutrophication; heterotroph; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen uptake; nonhuman; phototroph; phototrophic bacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087179136

Methods: In this study, we estimated human health impacts from long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 through application of linear RR and integrated exposure-response (IER) functions and the AirQ + software. Results: In 2014, on average 1189, 348, 43, 301 and 387 cases of IHD, COPD, LC, stroke and WDL, respectively could be avoided in Rome if the annual mean PM2.5 concentration was reduced from 15.6 to 10.0 μg m−3. In 2014, 27.67% of IHD, 15.9% of COPD, 9.5% of LC, 19.9% of stroke as well as 2.5% of WDL are attributed to the long-term exposure to PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 10 μg m−3.

Globally, it is estimated that 15% of energy consumption can be attributed to refrigeration and air conditioning systems in fishing activities. There is a real need to understand energy usage in fishery ports to help identify areas of improvements, with a view to optimize energy usage and minimize carbon emissions. In this study, we elaborate on ways in which a simulation capability can be developed at the community level with a fishery port, using a real-world case study seaport in Milford Heaven (Wales, UK). This simulation-based strategy is used to investigate the potential of renewable energy, including local solar farms, to meet the local power demand. This has informed the development of a simulation-based optimization strategy meant to explore how smart energy communities can be formed at the port level by integrating the smart grid with the local community energy storage. The main contribution of the paper involves a co-simulation environment that leverages calibrated energy simulation models to deliver an optimization capability that (a) manages electrical storage within a district an environment, and (b) promotes the formation of energy communities in a fishery port ecosystem. This is paving the way to policy implications, not only in terms of carbon and energy reduction, but also in the formation and sustained management of energy communities. © 2020 by the authors.

With inspiration from research on “ecologically unequal exchange” (EUE), we demonstrate the drawbacks of present “green growth” strategies by considering how pollution- and resource-intensive industries are distributed unevenly in the world economy, with large and increasing negative impacts on the periphery. The situation may only be exacerbated if the reduction of emissions in the center is based on shifting heavy industries and extractive enterprises to low-cost producers in the periphery. In this way, existing research likely overemphasizes the capacity of “green” investment policy to achieve sustainable outcomes.

In this paper, the prosumer is assumed to be an autonomous vehicle equipped with different distributed energy resources (e.g., solar panel, battery) that cannot only provide but also consume energy. An integrated vehicle routing and energy scheduling decision model is developed to adaptively dispatch vehicles to balance the temporally and spatially distributed energy requests subject to vehicle mobility constraints, and thus to maximally exploit the potentials of mobile prosumer network for cost savings and carbon emission reductions. The performances of the integrated decision model are evaluated using three metrics including operational costs, energy requested from power grids, and carbon emissions. The simulation results demonstrate that compared to disjoint vehicle routing and energy scheduling model, the proposed integrated decision model (i) is more efficient to shift energy loads at both temporal and spatial scales, and (ii) can save up to 38% of operational costs, reduce up to 29% of energy requested from power grids, and reduce up to 27% of carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy resource; Energy prosumer; Energy scheduling; Mobile energy provider; Vehicle routing","Carbon; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Carbon emission reductions; Distributed energies; Distributed Energy Resources; Integrated decision; Scheduling and routing; Scheduling decisions; Spatio-temporal complexity; Temporal and spatial scale; Network routing; autonomy; carbon emission; cost analysis; decision making; energy efficiency; energy planning; operations technology; power plant; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083104903

Effects of long-term cultivation on soil carbon sequestration were studied at the western edge of the Nile Delta near Alexandria, Egypt. Seven agricultural fields of different ages (0-50 years in use) were selected and compared with the surrounding desert (virgin soil) and desert shrub-land. Samples were taken at three horizons, 0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm, and tested for differences in physical and chemical properties. The results of long-term cultivation reveal that the European Commission (EC) value was 11.77 dS/m in virgin soil, while the EC values decreased to 5.82, 4.23, 3.74, 2.40, and 2.26 dS/m after 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 years of cultivation, respectively. The calcareous rock fraction smaller than 50 μm in size revealed another phenomenon, where active calcium carbonate content increased with cultivation practices from 1.15% (virgin soil) to 5.42%, 6.47%, 8.38%, and 10.13% after 5, 10, 20, and 30 years of cultivation, respectively, while shrub-land also showed a low amount of active CaCO3 with 1.38%. In fifty years of cultivation, soil bulk density decreased significantly from 1.67 to 1.11 g/cm3, and it decreased to 1.65, 1.44, 1.40, and 1.25 g/cm3 after 5, 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. These results reveal that the increase in soil carbon stock in the upper 90 cm amounted to 41.02 tons C/ha after five years of cultivation, compared to virgin soil with 13.47 tons C/ha. Soil carbon levels increased steeply during the five years of cultivation, with an average rate of 8.20 tons C/ha per year in the upper 90 cm. After the first five years of cultivation, the carbon sequestration rate slowed, reaching 4.68, 3.77, 2.58, and 1.93 tons C/ha per year after 10, 20, 30, and 50 years, respectively, resulting in sequestration-potential values of 46.78, 75.63, 77.43, and 96.45 tons C/ha. These results indicate that potential soil carbon sequestration resembles a logarithmic curve until the equilibrium state between carbon application and decomposition by microorganisms is reached. © 2020 by the authors.

The ‘4 per mille Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate’, highlighted agricultural soil as a major lever for climate action and the need to assess SOC stock at different spatial and temporal scale. Infrared spectroscopy appeared as a promising tool to address this methodological issue. This work aimed to evaluate the potential of visible-near-infrared (VNIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic measurement methods to predict SOC stock and its variables (SOC content and bulk density) in tropical volcanic soils of ‘La Réunion’ island. The diversity of agricultural soils of ‘La Réunion’ was captured in the sample set (n = 95) with soil orders such as Andosols, Cambisols and Ferralsols. Partial least squares regressions (PLSR) with leave-one-out cross validation were used to build prediction models. With RPD higher than 2, the present study showed good prediction accuracy of models by MIR and VNIR spectroscopy of SOC content, bulk density and SOC stock for measurements in the laboratory or in the field. Accurate and direct SOC stock predictions were achieved on dried and sieved soil samples with MIR spectroscopy (RPD = 2.25; R2 cv = 0.80; RMSEcv = 0.69 KgC m−2) and VNIR spectroscopy (RPD = 2.74; R2 cv = 0.87; RMSEcv = 0.61 KgC m−2) but also directly on cores in the field with VNIR spectroscopy (RPD = 3.29; R2 cv = 0.91; RMSEcv = 0.51 KgC m−2). This unexpected ability to predict directly SOC stocks by infrared spectroscopy can be partly explained by the high SOC content coupled with the large variation of SOC content and bulk density, providing a large range for those variables, and then a higher predictability. Yet these results questioned the underlying drivers of the bulk density and SOC stock, both being largely physical parameters supposed to be hardly predictable by infrared spectroscopy. Analyses of mean spectra and regression coefficients, combined with amorphous product (Alo, Feo, Sio, Alp, Fep) prediction models, demonstrated that these were detected in the spectra and were the drivers of SOC stock accurate predictions by infrared spectroscopy. Short-range ordered minerals, especially allophanes, appeared as proxy of the bulk density, and amorphous products such as Alp and Fep indicated the presence of organo-mineral complexes involved in SOC storage. Such promising results for SOC stock predictions from near- and mid-infrared volcanic soil spectra, confirmed that VNIR and MIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy are an appropriate tool, rapid, low cost and non-destructive, to study SOC stocks in tropical volcanic soils. Upscaling of SOC stocks across the agricultural soils of the island is now just a step ahead, following external validation with additional data to validate the robustness of the prediction models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bulk density; Infrared spectroscopy; PLSR models; SOC stock; SRO minerals; Volcanic soils","bulk density; carbon sequestration; infrared spectroscopy; model; organic carbon; soil carbon; volcanic soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079013186

Although several robust precipitation responses have been identified under continued increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs), considerable uncertainty remains. This is particularly the case at regional scales, including the West Coast of the United States and California. Here, we exploit idealized, single forcing simulations from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to address how climate drivers impact California wintertime precipitation. Consistent with recent work, GHGs including carbon dioxide and methane, as well as solar forcing, yield a robust increase in California wintertime precipitation. We also find robust California precipitation responses to aerosols but with opposite responses for sulfate versus black carbon aerosol. Sulfate aerosol increases California wintertime precipitation, whereas black carbon reduces it. Moreover, California precipitation is more sensitive to aerosols, particularly regional emissions from Europe and Asia, than to GHGs. These precipitation responses are consistent with shifts in the jet stream and altered moisture fluxes. Although the idealized nature of PDRMIP simulations precludes a formal attribution, our results suggest that aerosols can perturb precipitation and fresh water resources along the West Coast of the United States. ©2020.

To contribute to this discussion, we estimated the carbon balance from logging natural tropical forests in Costa Rica through a life cycle accounting approach. Our system included all major life cycle processes at a regional level during one rotation period (15 years). We used mass flow analysis to trace biogenic carbon. Data were gathered from all logging operations in the Costa Rican NW region (107 management plants), a sample of industries transforming wood into final products (20 sawmills), and national reports. We estimated a surplus of −3.06 Mg C ha−1 15 year−1 stored within the system. When accounting for uncertainty and variability in a Monte Carlo analysis, the average balance shifted to −2.19 Mg C ha−1 15 year−1 with a 95% CI of −5.26 to 1.86. This confidence interval reveals probabilities of a net increase in atmospheric carbon due to harvesting although these are smaller than those from a system that acts as a reservoir. Our results provide evidence for the carbon neutrality of bio-materials obtained from natural forests. We found that anthropogenic reservoirs play a determinant role in delaying carbon emissions and that these may explain differences with previous carbon balance studies on tropical forest management. Therefore, the climate mitigation potential of forest-derived products is not exclusive to forest management, but measures should be considered throughout the processes of wood transformation, use, and disposal. © 2019 The Authors.

A possible scalable solution to tackle this problem is through the analysis of building stock databases. Such databases can support and assist with building energy benchmarking and potential retrofit performance analysis. However, developing a building stock database is a time-intensive modeling procedure that requires extensive data (both geometric and non-geometric). Furthermore, the available data for developing a building database is sparse, inconsistent, diverse and heterogeneous in nature. The main aim of this study is to develop a generic methodology to optimize urban scale energy retrofit decisions for residential buildings using data-driven approaches. Furthermore, data-driven approaches identify the key features influencing building energy performance. The proposed methodology formulates retrofit solutions and identifies optimal features for the residential building stock of Dublin. Results signify the importance of data-driven retrofit modeling as the feature selection process reduces the number of features in Dublin's building stock database from 203 to 56 with a building rating prediction accuracy of 86%. Amongst the 56 features, 16 are identified to be recommended as retrofit measures (such as fabric renovation values and heating system upgrade features) associated with each energy-efficiency rating. Urban planners and energy policymakers could use this methodology to optimize large-scale retrofit implementation, particularly at an urban scale with limited resources. Furthermore, stakeholders at the local authority level can estimate the required retrofit investment costs, emission reductions and energy savings using the target retrofit features of energy-efficiency ratings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy performance; Building energy retrofit; Building energy stock; Data-driven approach; Retrofit modeling; Urban building energy analysis","Benchmarking; Database systems; Emission control; Housing; Investments; Planning; Retrofitting; Urban planning; Building energy efficiency; Building energy performance; Data-driven approach; Developing strategy; Performance analysis; Residential building; Residential building stocks; Sustainable urban environments; Energy efficiency; building; policy making; stakeholder; urban area; urban planning; Dublin [(CTY) Leinster]; Ireland; Leinster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082855114

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the effect of watershed management on selected soil properties, wheat grain yield, farmers income and climate change adaptation strategies in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia. Two treated and untreated watersheds were selected, and data were collected at representative locations (upper, middle and lower slope positions) in both watersheds. Soil samples were collected to determine the soil physical and chemical properties. Wheat grain yield was collected in the field. To identify climate change adaptation strategies and to evaluate households’ income field survey and questionnaire were administered using random sampling technique. The result shows that total nitrogen, available phosphorous, soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, soil reaction and moisture contents were significantly affected positively by watershed management. In the treated watershed, the wheat crop yield was increased by 33.2% and household income increased by 13.77% due to the watershed management interventions. The communities were practicing planting multipurpose trees and shrubs on their farmland, practicing irrigation development, implementing different soil and water conservation practices on their farms and communal lands, intensifying crop productivity and destocking in the two watersheds to adapt climate change. In this regard, this watershed management approach should be up-scaled to other areas and research work has to be extended to show the effect of watershed management on climate change adaptation. © 2020, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate adaptation; Income; Soil conservation; Soil physico-chemical Properties; Watershed management","climate change; crop yield; household income; physicochemical property; soil property; water management; watershed; wheat; Ethiopia; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086032252

These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 ffiC higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.","Ecosystem services; GIS; Irrigated agriculture; Land surface temperature; Landsat; Water","Crops; Economic and social effects; Ice; Irrigation; Land surface temperature; Land use; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Change in land use; Geographically weighted regression models; Multivariate regression method; Ordinary least squares; Regulation services; Remote sensing images; Socio-economic indicators; Spatial dependence; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; cooling; cultivation; dicotyledon; ecosystem service; environmental indicator; irrigation; land surface; least squares method; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; socioeconomic indicator; surface temperature; Campo de Cartagena; Cartagena [Murcia]; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; Citrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087437013

The buildings are occupied by students and located in Tampere, Finland, which is within the northern climate zone. The studied buildings are connected to the local district heating network. The presented demand response system takes into account weather forecasts, indoor temperatures and decreases in space heating temperatures when demand for domestic hot water is the highest. The owner of the buildings benefits from peak demand control and can save in fixed fees. If enough buildings would have this kind of demand response control system, there would be a decreased need for utility companies to use peak power plants that typically use fossil fuels for heat production. In this field test, the peak load decrease was 14%–15% on average. During the test, the heating period of February and March, the normalized energy consumption of eight buildings was reduced by 11%, which represents a 9% annual cut in energy, costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

The treatments were conducted according to a 5 × 3 factorial arrangement in a completely randomised design formulated to contain corn (corn-based diet, CBD) and barley grain (barley-based diet, BBD), or equal amounts of barley and corn (barley and corn diet, BCD), consisting of either basal diets alone (0) or basal diets with 250, 500, 750 or 1000 μL of WLEE (W0, W250, W500, W750 and W1000 respectively) per litre of buffered rumen fluid. Three fistulated cows fed diets containing alfalfa hay and concentrate mixes (same as the control diet) plus minerals and vitamins were used for collection of ruminal fluid. The asymptote of gas production and methane emission was decreased and lag time increased in a linear and quadratic manner with an increasing dose of WLEE (P &lt; 0.001). However, gas production rate reduced linearly as WLEE dose increased (P &lt; 0.001). Methane production was significantly reduced linearly (L) and quadratically (Q) when walnut ethanolic extract was increased from 250 to 1000 μL/L (L and Q; P &lt; 0.001). The addition of WLEE significantly altered the volatile fatty acid profile in comparison to control, reducing the molar proportion of acetate and increasing that of propionate (P &lt; 0.001), and also decreased the ammonia-N concentration (L, P &lt; 0.001). Dry-matter and organic-matter in vitro digestibility coefficients were negatively affected by WLEE supplementation (L and Q; P &lt; 0.001). Although anti-acidosis potential of WLEE was significantly lower than that of monensin, W1000 increased medium culture pH compared with uncontrolled acidosis and the lower doses of WLEE. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and R. albus were significantly reduced by WLEE, although to different magnitudes, depending on the corn and barley grain proportions in the diet. Results of the present study indicated that increasing addition levels of WLEE have noticeable effects on rumen microbial population and fermentation characteristics.

The impact of different urban land-uses on air temperatures is well-documented by many studies focusing on the urban heat island phenomenon; however, an integrated study of air temperature and humidity, i.e., the human-perceived temperatures, in different land-use areas is essential to understand the impact of hot and humid tropical urban climates on the thermal comfort of urban dwellers for an appraisal of potential health risks and the associated building energy use potential. In this study, we show through near-surface monitoring how these factors vary in distinct land-use areas of Kuala Lumpur city, characterized by different morphological features (high-rise vs. low-rise; compact vs. open), level of anthropogenic heating and evapotranspiration (built-up vs. green areas), and building materials (concrete buildings vs. traditional Malay homes in timber) based on the calculated heat index (HI), apparent temperature (TApp) and equivalent temperature (TE) values in wet and dry seasons. The results show that the felt-like temperatures are almost always higher than the air temperatures in all land-use areas, and this difference is highest in daytime temperatures in green areas during the dry season, by up to about 8 °C (HI)/5 °C (TApp). The TE values are also up to 9% higher in these areas than in built-up areas. We conclude that tackling urban heat island without compromising thermal comfort levels, hence encouraging energy use reduction in buildings to cope with outdoor conditions requires a careful management of humidity levels, as well as a careful selection of building morphology and materials. © 2020 by the authors.","Land-use; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Urban microclimate","Buildings; Drought; Health risks; Land use; Landforms; Morphology; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Anthropogenic heating; Equivalent temperature; Hygro-thermal conditions; Morphological features; Outdoor thermal comfort; Perceived temperature; Potential health risks; Thermal comfort level; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; building; energy efficiency; health risk; heat island; humidity; land use; tropical environment; ventilation; Kuala Lumpur [Kuala Lumpur (ADS)]; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086892479

Thus, the installation of OWPPs should be an important agenda item in terms of Turkey's renewable energy policies as a contribution to the global greenhouse gas emission targets. This study proposes a model for installing OWPPs in a suitable part of the Black Sea region of Turkey and simulates the results. The suitable locations for OWPP installation were evaluated according to the technical and geographical conditions of this region and site criteria. Meteorological data from these locations were analyzed in the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) to determine the best location. In this study, an OWPP model with a 204.6 MW installed power capacity was proposed for the identified location, which has a wind speed of 8.77 m s−1 and a wind power density of 348 W m−2. Then, an OWPP model and regional energy transmission system was modeled using DigSilent software. The load flow analysis was performed using this model, and the results show that 7616 tons of toxic gas and 1.527 million tons of greenhouse gas could be reduced in the region in a year if the proposed OWPP were put into operation.

The Rossby Center Atmospheric Regional Model (RCA4) datasets obtained from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment over West Africa were used for the study for projected period between 2011 and 2100. The ability of the RCA4 to reproduce the past climate was evaluated using Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Drought classification and trends in seasonal and annual variability using Mann–Kendall trend test at 95% confidence level were also examined. The results show that RCA4 replicates observed climate of West Africa, evident by strong correlation between the output of the model and CRU dataset. Strong correlation exists between SPI and SPEI at 95% confidence level. The RCA4 model projects a distinct humid period between 2011 and 2060 and drier period from the early 2060s till the year 2100 under RCP4.5 and 8.5 pathways. Projected drought events by the two indices show that areas north of 12°N of West Africa will be hot spot area for mildly and moderately dry events, while the southern part of West Africa will witness pronounced severe and extreme dry events under the two RCPs. Under RCP4.5, SPI trend shows an insignificant increase in almost all the seasons, while the increase is significant in SPEI. At RCP8.5 scenario, SPEI projects a significant decreasing trend in drought events over the three climatic zones and in almost all seasons.

In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify yields of alternative white (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and hybrid spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelmann x Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stocks across planting sites in the boreal and hemiboreal forests of Canada. We extracted meta-data from published tree improvement program results for five Canadian provinces covering 38 planting sites and 330 white and hybrid spruce provenances. Using these meta-data and a random-coefficients nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach, we modelled average height over time trajectories for varying planting site characteristics, as well as climate transfer distances between planting sites and provenances. Climatic transfer distances had strong effects on the height trajectory parameters. In particular, the asymptote parameter had a nonlinear increasing trend with planting site versus provenance mean annual temperature differences. We incorporated the height trajectory meta-analysis model into an existing growth and yield model to predict volume yields. Overall, this research provides a mechanism to quantify yields of alternative provenances at a particular planting site, as a component of decision support models for evaluating evaluate forest management investment into improved planting stocks alternatives under current and possible future climates. © 2020 by the authors.","Climatic transfer distances; Growth and yield; Meta-model; Random-coefficients modelling; Tree improvement","Climate models; Decision support systems; Investments; Metadata; Plants (botany); Trajectories; Canadian boreal forest; Decision support models; Growth and yield models; Mean annual temperatures; Nonlinear mixed effects; Site characteristics; Trajectory parameters; Tree Improvement Program; Forestry; boreal forest; coniferous forest; decision support system; forest management; height; meta-analysis; nonlinearity; provenance; site characterization; temperature anomaly; timber; Forest Management; Forestry; Height; Picea Glauca; Planting; Sites; Trajectories; Trees; Canada; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086504065

This study assessed the energy performance (EP) related investment and operational energy cost of Kouvola housing fair NZEB. Data from 12 new detached houses were collected, which fulfilled the energy certificate class of B according to the Finnish nearly zero energy building (NZEB) regulation. Besides, emission from building materials, construction and energy use during 50 years of one model building were estimated, aiming to compare the life cycle emission from wooden building, insulated concrete building, blockhouse and log house. The results showed that the total construction cost was independent to EP-value and even had a slightly negative correlation to the EP-value. The average EP-value of 12 buildings was slightly higher than that of buildings in Tampere housing fair 2012, which showed no improvement of nearly zero energy building (NZEB) guidelines since 2012. Energy performance related cost dependency in specific cost categories was shown so that EP-value improvement by 40 units increased less than 2% of construction cost. Electricity had a significant contribution to CO2 emission while local district heating was based on renewables. Material emissions contribution was 32-48% of total emissions, and wooden buildings showed lower carbon footprint compared to other building structures. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon footprint; Construction; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Heating; Houses; Investments; Life cycle; Wooden buildings; Building energy efficiency; Building structure; Energy performance; Life cycle emissions; Material emissions; Negative correlation; Total construction costs; Value improvements; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088442143

Remotely sensed data of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) of April 2003, April 2008 and Landsat 8 OLI of April 2015 coupled with meteorological data were used to study the LST. The maximum likelihood classifier was employed to classify the satellite data. Less built-up expansion from 2003 to 2008 compared to 2008–2015 was observed. The validation was performed with the available meteorological data of the stations. The rapid population growth is attributed to expansion of the built-up area and migration of rural people to search employment opportunities and good life. The increase in vegetation cover was witnessed in Potiskum and Environs, hence it has some impact on LST. The LST in the urban area showed low value due to afforestation and adoption of good policies to combat with rise in temperature in urban areas. Therefore, the LST classes of 30 °C–40 °C and > 40 °C showed decrease of area covered from 2003 to 2015. The result shows that in 2003, 34.23 °C of LST was observed while 35.29 °C and 35.60 °C of LST values were also observed in 2008 & 2015, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Land use/land cover change; Landsat 8; LST; NDVI; UHI; Urban climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082528957

The phosphorites are of reworked origin as inferred from the homogeneous texture with lack of any concentric structure in the phosphatic pellets and the presence of bone fragments inside the phosphatic pellets, which are filled with phosphatic mud similar to the matrix of phosphatic pellet. They still reflect the original seawater rare-earth pattern, as indicated from the similarity in their rare-earth element (REE) concentration and patterns with seawater. Positive correlations between P2O5 and Fe2O3, TiO2 and K2O, relatively high rare-earth contents, and similarity in (Nd/Yb)SN ratio to the modern shallow seawater suggest a continental marginal depositional environment for the limestone and chalk facies. δ13C values are lower and more variable compared with the estimated global range of upper Campanian–lower Maastrichtian δ13C values in shelf and oceanic basins. This indicates a diagenetic effect on the δ13C isotopes and suggests that a significant proportion of carbonate ions could have been resulted from the organic carbon oxidation. Three third-order depositional sequences matching with the global and regional sea-level patterns are identified in the studied section based on vertical facies changes.

Barranquilla is a Caribbean city located in the North of Colombia that has approximately 1.200.000 inhabitants and possesses a warm, humid climate. In order to obtain the concentration of the contaminant in an adequate resolution, 137 Passive diffusion tubes from Gradko© were installed. Tubes prepared with 20% Triethanolamine/De-ionised water were located at the roadside between 1 and 5 m from the kerb edge. The sampling period was two weeks, from 3/16/2019 to 3/30/2019. Samples were analyzed on the UV CARY1 spectrophotometer by Gradko©. Results showed an average of 19.92 ± 11.50 μg/m3, with a maximum and minimum value of 70.27 and 0.57 μg/m3, respectively. NO2 correlation with load traffic load was higher than with maximum traffic. The expected results include the analysis of the areas of the city with high concentrations of this pollutant that exceed the limit values established by the WHO in six (6) points; however, they never exceed the local legal limit for annual exposure, which is significantly less restrictive. Overall, the multiregression analysis is a very effective method to enrich the understanding of NO2 distributions. It can provide scientific evidence for the relationship between NO2 and traffic, beneficial for developing the targeted policies and measures to reduce NO2 pollution levels in hot spots.

Governments in lower and middle-income countries have adopted cash transfer programs widely – both in the conditional and unconditional variants – across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and south and southeast Asia. The paper uses the large literature evaluating the material impacts of cash transfers to identify how they affect the climate resilience of households and social systems. Studies of cash transfers only rarely analyze social resilience outcomes directly; the review therefore examines socio-economic indicators that are used in common in research on cash transfers and climate resilience. It finds that although cash transfers support improvements in indicators associated with absorptive and adaptive resilience outcomes, changes in transformative resilience indicators are rare. For a deeper understanding of the processes through which cash transfers influence social resilience, it is important that future studies of cash transfers assess how socioeconomic outcomes of cash transfers relate to key system resilience features such as modularity, redundancy, diversity, learning, self-organization, and network relations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"low income population; resilience; social change; vulnerability; Latin America; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097396708

Commercial 52100 steel was used to simulate the high-carbon content in the case. Specimens were subjected to various thermal treatments in a quenching dilatometer. Reheating cycles to austenitizing temperatures were evaluated with respect to both prior austenite grain size (PAGS) and associated martensite and retained austenite (RA) refinement. Quantitative stereological measurements were performed to evaluate the microgeometry of plate martensite and the size distribution of RA regions. Decreasing the reheating temperature resulted in finer PAGS, and multiple reheating cycles resulted in a narrower PAGS distribution. Refinement in PAGS led to a reduction in martensite plate size and finer distribution of RA. Additionally, interrupted quenching below martensite start (MS) temperature was evaluated. This processing route results in a refinement of martensite plates and more stable RA. The stabilization of austenite may be mechanical or chemical in nature, owing to the deformation of austenite during primary transformation, or due to partitioning of carbon into austenite similar to quenching and partitioning steels. © 2020, ASM International.","carburizing; martensite transformation; microstructure refinement; retained austenite; steel heat treatment; stereology","Austenitic transformations; Carbon; Carburizing; Industrial heating; Martensite; Microstructure; Quenching; Steel heat treatment; Austenitizing temperature; Martensite transformations; Microstructural refinement; Microstructure refinement; Prior austenite grain size; Quenching and partitioning; Retained austenite; Stereology; Austenite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081675415

We tested a total of six solvent mixtures of water or methanol with monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, or activated methyl diethanolamine in a broad range of operational conditions, including temperature (50–100 °C), rich solvent flow rate (0.5–4.5 ml/min), and amine concentration in the solvent (10 and 50% w/w). CO2 desorption was thoroughly characterized with respect to the mass transfer rate and energy consumption, and both were expected to improve with the use of a microreactor due to short diffusion distances and a larger surface-to-area ratio. An increase in the operating temperature or concentration of the amine resulted in a higher percentage of desorption and enhanced mass transfer rates, as shown by the local mass transfer coefficient based on the liquid phase values herein disclosed. Increasing the rich solvent flow rate also increased the local mass transfer coefficient values (80%–95%); however, the overall percentage of CO2 desorption reduced (25%–35%) due to shorter residence times in the microreactor. Similarly, the energetic desorption efficiency improved for all the solutions with increasing temperature (65–75% reduction) and concentration of amine in the solvent (20–35% reduction), yet again decreasing with an increasing flow rate of rich solvent (5–15%). Compared to the literature values for the packed columns and microreactors, our data showed the overall energy consumption up to an 88% reduction in specific CO2 desorption, demonstrating great potential for the intensification of solvent-mediated, energetically demanding CO2 desorption.

The analysis suggests that the project has adversely affected the livelihoods of all three categories of farmers. However, small and marginal farmers are the most distressed due to their low incomes, asset base and risk-bearing capacities. It raises critical project design issues such as binding land use, delayed accrual of benefits, static opportunity costs and displacement of existing economic activities, which have serious livelihood and equity implications. Unless these issues are addressed and strong safety nets are provided, forest carbon projects might create more poverty than wellbeing for marginal communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","A/R CDM; Forest carbon; Haryana; India; Livelihoods","carbon emission; developing world; economic activity; emission control; livelihood; poverty alleviation; project design; Haryana; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081653539

Despite the benefits of reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, the adoption of electric vehicles faces several obstacles ranging from financing issues, government policies, and public acceptance. This study aims to identify the economic, environmental, and social impact of the adoption of electric vehicles for public transportation. Using the Philippines as a case study, the findings highlight the economic advantage of investing in electric public transportation with high public acceptance. The results further identify significant decrease in air pollution, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and encourage lowering the reliance on imported fossil fuels by shifting the public transport from conventional to electric transport system. This study recommends stricter implementation of government policies on modernized public transportation, stronger government support on financing mechanisms, establishment of charging stations in public and private terminals, and boosting programs for developing local-made electric vehicles. To make electric vehicle more environment-friendly, the government must accelerate the energy transition by increasing the electricity share from renewable sources and investing in more sustainable sources of energy. © 2020 by the authors.","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Electric vehicle; Environmental impact; Investment; Public transport; Social acceptance; Sustainable","atmospheric pollution; economic impact; electric vehicle; emission control; environmental impact; fossil fuel; governance approach; greenhouse gas; policy implementation; public transport; social impact; sustainability; transportation system; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086406911

Geothermal energy, widely used in agriculture, has recently emerged as a local, clean, and sustainable energy source able to fulfil the residential demand for space heating and has received growing attention in district energy planning. However, failed attempts in the past and the lack of experience with direct application of this technology in district heating systems has increased uncertainty with respect to the technical, spatial, and socioeconomic barriers to be overcome between supply and demand. This calls for the application of decision support tools in order to remove these barriers and facilitate more appropriate decision making towards the implementation of smart thermal energy grids in local energy communities. This research explores how the network of actors, those who see opportunities in direct use of geothermal energy in the Netherlands, can work on the transformation of the current centralised carbon-based energy systems towards local sustainable energy communities. © 2020 by the authors.

The Government of Jordan has launched a National Green Growth Plan aiming to facilitate the transition towards green growth in six priority sectors; amongst those is the solid waste management sector. Jordan Vision 2025 has set a 33% reduction target in the solid waste amounts disposed in landfills or dumpsites by 2025. This study examines the development of the municipal solid waste management sector in Jordan from sustainability standpoint and presents potential scenarios to attain Jordan Vision 2025 target and gradually place this sector on a green growth path. The Sustainability Window analysis tool was used to assess the sustainability of this sector over the 2010–2015 period. This tool identifies whether the economic growth maintains the social and environmental wellbeing using strong and weak environmental, social inclusion, and economic indicators. Three scenarios to address Jordan Vision 2025 target were proposed and compared using the Sustainability Window tool: Mechanical biological treatment-anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment-composting, and incineration. It was concluded from the sustainability window analysis of the 2010–2015 data that the total number of jobs in the municipal solid waste management sector is a weak social inclusion indicator compared to the stronger one “jobs per 10,000 tonnes”. Likewise, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per tonne is a weak environmental indicator unlike the stronger “net GHG emissions”. It was also inferred from the Sustainability Window analysis that the 2010–2015 Jordanian municipal solid waste sector growth did not fulfill all sustainability criteria. The proposed future scenarios were compared and it was determined that the mechanical biological treatment alternatives fulfill all sustainability criteria regardless of the indicators’ strength, whereas the incineration scenario only satisfies the sustainability criteria using weak environmental indicators. Nonetheless, mechanical biological treatment-composting is the most attractive scenario from an economic perspective owing to the lower GHG mitigation cost of $18.3 per tCO2-eq compared to $35.5/tCO2-eq for the mechanical biological treatment-anaerobic digestion and $161.7/tCO2-eq for incineration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Green growth; Greenhouse gas; Municipal solid waste management; Sustainability window analysis; Sustainable development","Anaerobic digestion; Biochemical engineering; Climate change; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Climate change mitigation; Economic perspective; Environmental indicators; Green growths; Mechanical-biological treatment; Social and environmental; Sustainability criteria; Window analysis; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079601179

Australia represents an interesting case for energy system transformation modelling. While it currently has a power system dominated by fossil fuels, and specifically with a heavy coal component, there is a vast potential for expansion and use of renewable energy, in particular solar and wind energy. However, integrating high shares of such variable renewable energy sources challenges the power system due to their temporal fluctuations and geographical dispersion. This paper applies a state-resolved energy system model for Australia, based on linear optimization. We investigate the cost-optimal configuration of a renewable-based Australian power system and its transformation pathway inline with the ambitious proposed climate targets. We particularly analyze the implications of storage and power transmission grid extensions in a prospective, highly renewable Australian power system. Spatial smoothening effects of a powerful transmission grid reduces the required backup and renewable capacities and thus contributes to further reduction of the total system costs. © 2020, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

This study proposes a novel approach by integrating hydro-climatic variables as well as animal density and grazing pattern in the feature selection modeling phase to increase E. coli prediction accuracy for two cascading dams at the US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC), Nebraska. Predictive models were developed using regression techniques and an artificial neural network (ANN). Two adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) structures including subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering were also used to develop models for predicting E. coli. The performances of the predictive models were evaluated and compared using root mean squared log error (RMSLE). Cross-validation and model performance results indicated that although the majority of models predicted E. coli accurately, ANFIS models resulted in fewer errors compared to the other models. The ANFIS models have the potential to be used to predict E. coli concentration for intervention plans and monitoring programs for cascading dams, and to implement effective best management practices for grazing and irrigation during the growing season. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animal density estimation; E. coli prediction; Feature selection; Grazing pattern; Machine learning","Animals; Escherichia coli; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Surface waters; Water pollution; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Best management practices; Chemical and biologicals; Density estimation; E. coli; Fuzzy C means clustering; Grazing pattern; Subtractive clustering; Fuzzy inference; accuracy assessment; bacterium; best management practice; dam; grazing pressure; hydrometeorology; machine learning; prediction; reservoir; surface water; water quality; animal experiment; animal model; article; artificial neural network; cross validation; dam (animal); disease simulation; Escherichia coli; feature selection; female; fuzzy c means clustering; grazing; growing season; Nebraska; nonhuman; prediction; fuzzy logic; machine learning; Nebraska; United States; Animalia; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Fuzzy Logic; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081657519

Assessments of climate change mitigation potential of new technologies often pay less attention to the criticality of the enabling minerals. We assessed the effects of adopting 4 hybrid architectures on the life-cycle GHG emissions of an emerging fuel and powertrain solution: the use of a novel high-reactivity fuel in an advanced compression-ignition engine (GCI). The 4 hybrids were contrasted against conventional fuels/engines, and a comparable battery electric vehicle using regionally-explicit power mixes in the 3 biggest automotive markets worldwide (China, USA and Europe). The use of larger batteries enabled higher degrees of electrification and it could lead to lower overall emissions. However, there is diminishing returns for every kWh of increasing battery size: a mild hybrid resulted in more than 50% GHG reduction per kWh of battery, whereas an electric vehicle only reduced emission by 4% per kWh given its much larger battery requirement. Given the sustainability constraints of critical raw minerals supply, and the heterogeneity of regional power grids, advanced GCI hybrid architectures, with varying degrees of electrification, can bridge the gap in the interim. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Critical metals; Electric vehicle; Gasoline compression ignition; Life-cycle assessment","Battery electric vehicles; Climate change; Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Minerals; Automotive markets; Climate change mitigation; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Critical minerals; Hybrid architectures; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Regional power grids; Automotive batteries; climate change; detection method; electric vehicle; electrification; emission; engine; social impact; sustainability; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083005059

The aim of the study is to assess the environmental impacts of buildings growth in Kano metropolis Nigeria towards sustainability. Carbon monoxides CO was sensed with the aid of device Gas Sensor by Crown Cone and water sampled was taken from the existing ponds and analysed in the laboratory considering physiochemical properties of suspended particles, salinity, colour and total hardness. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for the location maps preparation. Both indoor and outdoor carbon monoxides was sensed and recorded in selected local governments. The Outdoor carbon monoxide records of the sampled local governments areas of Kano Metropolis shows that Tarauni and Kumbotso recorded exactly 012 ppm as the highest records and Tarauni local government area maintain the highest indoor carbon monoxide emission also. Dala and Fagge local governments' areas depicted 011 ppm as the second highest records with regards to outdoor carbon monoxides emission but Dala, Gwale and Fagge local governments portrayed proportionately equal amount of indoor carbon monoxides emission of 008Ppm. In addition, the results of water analysis reveals that suspended solid contents and the salinity level of Shema Pond being more contaminated with (248 mg/l and 25 mg/l) against Hauran Wanka Pond with (61 mg/l and 20 mg/l). Colour and t. hardness of Hauran Wanka Pond indicates 501 ml/g and 0.16 mg/l) which is higher than Shema Pond with (290 mg/l and 0 mg/l).

Traffic characteristic information (traffic volume, travel speed, and degree of congestion) was estimated based on the digitised data collected by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan. A vehicle emission model, known as the computer program to calculate emissions from road transport (COPERT), was utilised to compute the emission factors (EFs) and total emissions of air pollutants in terms of exhaust particulate matter (PMExh), benzene (C6H6), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxide (NOx). Input variables, such as fuel data, activity data, driving conditions, and meteorological conditions, are needed. The findings revealed that the pollutant emissions reached the higher values over the slower travel speed phase. Road no. 1 with the most congested road segment has intensified vehicle numbers, and the slowest traffic flow movement exposed a greater magnitude of pollutant emissions. C6H6 and CO emissions are obviously more emitted from the passenger cars whereas the trucks are responsible for the greater emission of NOx and PMExh. The EFs of pollutants were compared with the Japanese Emission Standards through JE05 and JC08 chassis dynamometer test cycles. The estimated EFs showed inconsistency with the EFs derived from the test cycles. These results may be deployed as the input in air quality dispersion modelling in urban areas for designing the air pollution abatement strategy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","COPERT; Pollutants; Traffic characteristics; Vehicle emission","air quality; atmospheric pollution; road transport; traffic emission; urban area; urban pollution; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto [Kinki]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084971996

However, this technique is site-specific and therefore its application in developing countries with different hydrologic and environment conditions remains limited. In this research, a 3-discipline study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of the application of this technique in Aswan City (Egypt). Firstly, a hydrological model was developed to identify key environmental factors that influence the effectiveness of BF, and to formulate plans for the design and management of the BF system. Secondly, water samples were collected for one year (January 2017 to December 2017) from the water sources and monitoring wells to characterize the bank-filtrate quality. Lastly, an economic study was conducted to compare the capital and operating costs of BF and the existing treatment techniques. The results demonstrated that there is high potential for application of BF under such hydrological and environmental conditions. However, there are some aspects that could restrict the BF efficacy and must therefore be considered during the design process. These include the following: (i) Over-pumping practices can reduce travel time, and thus decrease the efficiency of treatment; (ii) Locating the wells near the surface water systems (<50 m) decreases the travel time to the limit (<10 days), and thus could restrict the treatment capacity. In such case, a low pumping rate must be applied; (iii) the consequences of lowering the surface water level can be regulated through the continuous operation of the wells. Furthermore, laboratory analysis indicated that BF is capable of producing high quality drinking water. However, an increase in organic matter (i.e., humics) concentration was observed in the pumped water, which increases the risk of trihalomethanes being produced if post-chlorination is implemented. The economic study ultimately demonstrated that BF is an economic and sustainable technique for implementation in Aswan City to address the demand for potable water. © 2020 by the authors.","Arid climate; Bank filtrate quality; Bank filtration; Economic feasibility; Modelling","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Operating costs; Quality control; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Travel time; Water filtration; Water levels; Water supply; Capital and operating costs; Continuous operation; Environment conditions; Environmental conditions; Environmental factors; Hydrological modeling; Laboratory analysis; Treatment techniques; Potable water; arid environment; developing world; drinking water; environmental factor; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydrological modeling; surface water; travel time; water resource; water supply; Aswan [Egypt]; Egypt; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087547868

Due to a growing urban population and private vehicle ownership, heavy traffic has become intolerable for Tehran's residents, particularly during peak hours. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which is a high-quality bus-based transit system that delivers high-speed and efficient services, is among the solutions to such traffic issues. This paper investigates the first line of Tehran's BRT with the aim of enhancing the efficiency of the system. Aimsun has been employed to simulate implementing exclusive bus lanes, decreasing bus headways, implementing actuated traffic signal and revises the bus stations in 10 different scenarios. Finally, nonlinear regression models were employed to predict reductions in commute times, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Results show that by converting shared lines to exclusive lines, commute times could reduce by 2.95%, CO emissions by 9%, PM emissions by 1.13%, NOx emissions by 3.45%, and fuel consumption by 5.3% per kilometer. In addition, by replacing fixed signals with actuated signalization along the route, commute times were reduced by 6.31%, CO emissions by 25.9%, PM emissions by 3.42%, NOx emissions by 6.2%, and fuel consumption by 5.26%. Considering the nature of the proposed scenarios, their impact on vehicle performance assessed and according to the environmental and economic analysis of the scenarios were justified. For the economic analysis of the scenarios, their costs and benefits were used to calculate the payback period. The scenario of full exclusive bus route (i.e. scenario 4) with 73 days had the longest and the station modification scenarios (i.e. 8 and 9) had the shortest payback period after the station modifications. © 2019 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Actuated traffic signals; AIMSUN; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT); Economic analysis; Payback period",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076607444

Intangibility of tourism product is determined by the specifics of economic entity and territorial authorities' interaction, that makes it a prerequisite to use system approach for companies' interaction within regional tourism cluster. The paper identifies institutional environment of business development in tourism cluster taking into accountthe rapid development of communication and information technologies. To achieve this goal the authors analysed the theoretical frameworks of institutional environment of tourism and the process of its formation and factors. The proposed technique is based on system approach and allows to indicate the deficiency in tourism cluster models, taking such critical issues into account as interconnection between cluster actors, regional competition policy, investment climate, development of standards and systems for the services certification, availability of qualified personnel in the region's labour market, tourism infrastructure, financial and tax policies in the region, network of competitive local suppliers, public policies on tourism, tourism support programs and communication problems. As a result, the rationale of using system approach to evaluate effectiveness of subjects' interaction in tourism clusters to determine weaknesses in regional tourism clusters was formed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Climate models; Employment; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Investments; Leisure industry; Personnel testing; Public policy; Recreation centers; Between clusters; Business development; Communication problems; Investment climate; Qualified personnel; Regional competition; Theoretical framework; Tourism infrastructure; Tourism",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087869143
