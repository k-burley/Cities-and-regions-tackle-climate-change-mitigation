This study uses the life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the potential impacts of corn production in Pakistan on global warming and human health damages and also suggests mitigation strategies to reduce environmental impacts towards sustainable crop production based on the results. Land-based, mass-based, and energy-based functional units were used. IMPACT 2002+ methodology—a combination of IMPACT 2002, Eco-Indicator 99, CML, and intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)—is used for the impact assessment. The results demonstrated that the global warming potential of one-ton production of corn, one-hectare corn farm, and production of 1000 MJ energy were 354.18, 34,569.90, and 1275.13 kg CO2 equivalents, respectively. The off-farm and on-farm emissions of nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers were the hotspots in the most impact categories. Moreover, human health damages followed by global warming as environmental externalities were also associated with corn production. We also highlighted the production areas with light, medium and extreme environmental externalities with Toba Tek Singh and Okara districts in the Punjab province of Pakistan being the most and least contributing districts towards global warming, respectively. Results further indicated that a 5 to 100% reduction of chemical fertilizers would mitigate the environmental impacts of corn production by 4.38 to 87.58% and 2.16 to 43.30% in terms of aquatic acidification and global warming, respectively. Modern farming systems and conservation technologies were suggested to reduce emissions and improve the environmental performance of corn production. Furthermore, agricultural extension and the ministry of agriculture should pay more attention to farmers’ education on emissions from farming inputs and their impact on climate. © 2021 by the authors.

The crisis of climate change owing to the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission has led many governments at federal and provincial levels to promulgate policies to address this concern. Among them is regulating the carbon dioxide emission from major industrial sources such as power plants, petrochemical industries, cement plants, and other industries that depend on the combustion of fossil fuels for energy to operate. In view of this, various CO2 capture and sequestration technologies have been investigated and presented. From this review, adsorption of CO2 on porous solid materials has been gaining increasing attention due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of application, and comparably low energy demand. Despite the myriad of advanced materials such as zeolites, carbons-based, metal-organic frameworks, mesoporous silicas, and polymers being researched, research on activated carbons (ACs) continue to be in the mainstream. Therefore, this review is endeavored to elucidate the adsorption properties of CO2 on activated carbons derived from different sources. Selective adsorption based on pore size/shape and surface chemistry is investigated. Accordingly, the effect of surface modifications of the ACs with NH3, amines, and metal oxides on adsorption performance toward CO2 is evaluated. The adsorption performance of the activated carbons under humid conditions is also reviewed. Finally, activated carbon-based composite has been surveyed and recommended as a feasible strategy to improve AC adsorption properties toward CO2.

Super absorbent polymers (SAPs) have been studied as soil amendments in arid and semi-arid environments, but little is known about potential use for drought stress mitigation in humid subtropical climates under rainfed conditions. This study investigated the potential of three K-based SAPs (Stockosorb 660, Hydrosource and SuperAB A200) to act as water reservoirs during periods of drought. In the laboratory, SAPs mixed with sandy soil were tested for water absorption capacity (WAC) and re-swelling capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), water holding capacity (WHC) and storage of simulated rainfall. SAPs showed high WAC, re-swelling capacity, reduced Ks and increased soil WHC with performance dependent more on SAPs concentration than SAPs type. The three SAPs effectively reduced rainwater transport and increased soil water storage during simulated rainfall. In North Carolina, USA, an outdoor pot study with corn in loamy sand soil under rainfed conditions tested the effects of the three SAPs at three concentrations (0.15%, 0.30% and 0.45% w/w) on rainwater transport/storage, biomass production, and biomass rainwater productivity (WPbiomass). Under field conditions, 41.76% of rainwater was percolated in the absence of SAPs while in SAPs-amended soil (0.45% w/w) only 4.8%, 5.5% and 6.02% was lost by percolation, for Stockosorb 660, Hydrosource and SuperAB A200, respectively. The retained rainwater resulted in higher leaf water potential leading to enhanced plant growth and WPbiomass. Stockosorb 660 performed best in terms of rainwater saving, while Hydrosource was the most effective in terms of plant growth and WPbiomass. The results suggest that SAPs soil amendment is a potential approach to mitigate drought stress under rainfed conditions in humid subtropical climates. © 2021","Corn; Drought; Rainfall; Super absorbent polymers; Water holding capacity; Water productivity","Climate change; Ecology; Productivity; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Soil moisture; Solvents; Tropics; Water absorption; Corn; Drought stress; Rainfed condition; Soil amendment; Subtropical climates; Superabsorbent polymer; Swelling capacities; Water absorption capacity; Water productivity; Water-holding capacity; Drought; adsorption; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; maize; polymer; rainfed agriculture; rainwater; soil amendment; North Carolina; United States; Rosa carolina carolina; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106252157

Alternative resources, such as renewable energy sources (RESs), used in electricity grids, could reduce the environmental impact. Since RESs are inherently unreliable, during the last decades the scientific community addressed research efforts to their integration with the main grid by means of properly designed energy storage systems (ESSs). In order to highlight the best performance from these hybrid systems, proper design and operations are essential. The purpose of this paper is to present a so-called model predictive controller (MPC) for the optimal operations of grid-connected wind farms with hydrogen-based ESSs and local loads. Such MPC has been designed to take into account the operating and economical costs of the ESS, the local load demand and the participation to the electricity market, and further it enforces the fulfillment of the physical and the system's dynamics constraints. The dynamics of the hydrogen-based ESS have been modeled by means of the mixed-logic dynamic (MLD) framework in order to capture different behaviors according to the possible operating modes. The purpose is to provide a controller able to cope both with all the main physical and operating constraints of a hydrogen-based storage system, including the switching among different modes such as ON, OFF, STAND-BY and, at the same time, reduce the management costs and increase the equipment lifesaving. The case study for this paper is a plant under development in the north Norway. Numerical analysis on the related plant data shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which manages the plant and commits the equipment so as to preserve the given constraints and save them from unnecessary commutation cycles. © 2021 The Authors","Energy management; Energy storage systems; Grid-connected wind farms; Hydrogen conversion; Mixed logic dynamic; Model predictive control","Climate change; Controllers; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electromagnetic wave emission; Environmental impact; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Lifesaving equipment; Predictive control systems; Wind power; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Grid connected wind farms; Mixed logic dynamic frameworks; Model predictive controllers; Operating constraints; Renewable energy source; Scientific community; Model predictive control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101525977

Chat is residual chert, either in place or transported, weathered out of chert-bearing Mississippian Limestone that was eroded at the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian unconformity. Thus, the formation of chat is an epigene paleokarst process. Tripolite occurs as a highly porous, silica-rich interval within the Mississippi Lime. It is formed by in-place alteration of limestone by silica-rich surface waters or deep-seated hydrothermal fluids, making tripolite formation a mixed or hypogene paleokarst process. Here, we have studied chat and tripolite by seismic analysis calibrated by well control with full-wave sonic and density log data. We identify that chat and tripolite show clear separation from Mississippian Lime log-based acoustic impedance and VP/VS, but there is no meaningful separation of chat from tripolite, and they both exhibit total porosities greater than 20% with evidence of fracture porosity. We find that the sonic-based normal incidence wedge model for chat bounded above by the Pennsylvanian Shale and below by the Mississippian Lime indicate that two seismic expressions are plausible: first, a strong negative amplitude when the chat thickness is above the tuning thickness (for this survey it is 56 ft) and, second, a weak positive or negative amplitude associated with the small impedance contrast between chat and overlying Pennsylvanian Shale. Our analysis suggests that the traditional chat ""strong response""and a new ""dim-out""exploration strategy may be usefully applied in Osage County. We show that the tripolite response is consistently a negative amplitude event that strengthens with increasing tripolite thickness. We provide an interpretive framework for characterizing chat and tripolite zones associated with the Mississippian Lime in the U.S. midcontinent, which may apply to regions around the world. © The Authors.","3D; amplitude; attributes; carbonate; interpretation","amplitude; carbonate; chert; data interpretation; diatomite; Mississippian; paleokarst; seismic data; three-dimensional modeling; well logging; Oklahoma [United States]; Osage County [Oklahoma]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117417214

However, land conversions required for large-scale bioenergy crop production are substantial and may directly affect the climate by altering surface energy balance. In the US, such land conversions are likely to be met in part by converting Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grassland to bioenergy crops. Here, we converted three 22 year old CRP smooth brome grass fields into no-till corn, switchgrass, or restored prairie bioenergy crops. We assessed the biogeophysical climate impact of the conversions using albedo changes relative to unconverted reference CRP grassland. The corn and perennial fields had higher annual albedo than the grassland they replaced - causing cooling of the local climate. The cooling of the corn field occurred solely during the non-growing season - especially when surfaces were snow-covered, whereas the cooling of the perennial fields was more prominent during the growing season. Compared to biogeochemical impacts with fossil fuel offsets for the same land conversions over eight years, the annual albedo-induced climate benefits add ∼35% and ∼78% to the annual biogeochemical benefits provided from the switchgrass and restored prairie fields, respectively, and offset ∼3.3% of the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the corn field. We conclude that albedo-induced climate mitigation from conversion of CRP lands to perennial but not annual bioenergy crops can be substantial, and future climate impact assessments of bioenergy crops should include albedo changes in addition to GHG balances in order to better inform climate policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

The permanent use of mineral oil is closely related to CO2 emissions. Maintaining the sustainability of fossil fuels and eliminating and reducing CO2 emissions is possible through carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes. One of the best ways to maintain CCS is hydrate-based gas separation. Selected type T1-5 (0.01 mol % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) + 5.60 mol % tetrahydrofuran (THF), with the help of this silica gel promotion was strongly stimulated. A pressure of 36.5 bar of CO2 is needed in H2O to investigate the CO2 hydrate formation. Therefore, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME at 0.10 mol %) along with SDS (0.01 mol %) labeled as T1A-2 was used as an alternative to THF at the comparable working parameters in which CO2 uptake of 5.45 mmol of CO2/g of H2O was obtained. Additionally, it was found that with an increase in tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) supplementation of CO2, the hydrate and operating capacity of the process increased. When the bed height was reduced from 3 cm to 2 cm with 0.1 mol % TBAB and 0.01% SDS (labelled as T3-2) in fixed bed reactor (FBR), the outcomes demonstrated a slight expansion in gas supply to 1.54 mmol of CO2/g of H2O at working states of 283 K and 70 bar. The gas selectivity experiment by using the high-pressure volume analysis through hydrate formation was performed in which the highest CO2 uptake for the employment of silica contacts with water in fuel gas mixture was observed in the non-IGCC conditions. Thus, two types of reactor configurations are being proposed for changing the process from batch to continuous with the employment of macroporous silica contacts with new consolidated promoters to improve the formation of CO2 hydrate in the IGCC conditions. Later, much work should be possible on this with an assortment of promoters and specific performance parameters. It was reported in previous work that the repeatability of equilibrium moisture content and gas uptake attained for the sample prepared by the highest rates of stirring was the greatest with the CIs of ±0.34 wt % and ±0.19 mmol of CO2/g of H2O respectively. This was due to the amount of water occluded inside silica gel pores was not an issue or in other words, vigorous stirring increased the spreadability. The variation of pore size to improve the process can be considered for future work. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite repeated pledges to phase out 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies, US oil and gas production continues to be subsidized by billions of dollars each year. In this study, we quantify how 16 subsidies and regulatory exemptions individually and altogether affect the economics of US oil and gas production in 2020-2030 under different price and financial risk outlooks. We find that, at 2019 average market prices of oil and gas, the 16 subsidies could increase the average rates of return of yet-to-be-developed oil and gas fields by 55% and 68% over unsubsidized levels, respectively, with over 96% of subsidy value flowing to excess profits under a 10% hurdle rate. At lower 2020 prices, the subsidies could increase the average rates of return of new oil and gas fields by 63% and 78% over unsubsidized levels, respectively, with more than 60% of oil and gas resources being dependent on subsidies to be profitable under a 20% hurdle rate. Under all price scenarios analyzed, the highest-value subsidies include federal tax incentives that have existed since 1916, as well as less recognized forms of support such as cost exemptions related to well cleanup and hazardous waste management. Given that these results depend on our chosen definitions of what constitutes a subsidy and, in some cases, assumptions regarding what the unsubsidized practices should be, we also present results for selected subsets of subsidies. By showing which subsidies have the greatest effects in different producing regions of the country, our findings can help policymakers chart a schedule of targeted subsidy repeals and regulatory reforms that can contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and achieving other sustainable development goals. Our results can also help inform how different choices about economic recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can shape the US oil and gas industry in the years to come. © 2021 The Author(s).

Samples from across the Canadian Arctic were collected between 2014 and 2017 from onboard the CCGS Amundsen. Samples were processed using density separation with calcium chloride (CaCl2). APs &gt;125 μm were identified and a subset (22%) were characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Following blank-correction, microfiber numbers were corrected using Raman data in a novel approach to subtract possible “natural” cellulose microfibers with no anthropogenic signal via Raman spectroscopy, to estimate the proportion of cellulose microfibers that are of confirmed anthropogenic origin. Of all microfibers examined by Raman spectroscopy, 51% were anthropogenic cellulose, 11% were synthetic polymers, and 7% were extruded fibers emitting a dye signal. The remaining 31% of microfibers were identified as cellulosic but could not be confirmed as anthropogenic and thus were excluded from the final concentrations. Concentrations of confirmed APs in sediments ranged from 0.6 to 4.7 particles g−1 dry weight (dw). Microfibers comprised 82% of all APs, followed by fragments at 15%. Total microfiber concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 microfibers g−1 dw, while microplastic (fragments, foams, films and spheres) concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.6 microplastics g−1 dw. These concentrations may exceed those recorded in urban areas near point sources of plastic pollution, and indicate that the Canadian Arctic is a sink for APs, including anthropogenic cellulose fibers. Overall, we provide an important benchmark of AP contamination in Canadian Arctic marine sediments against which to measure temporal trends, including the effects of source reduction strategies and climate change, both of which will likely alter patterns of accumulation of anthropogenic particles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Beaufort Sea; Canada; Canadian Arctic Ocean; Cellulose; Microparticle; Plastic","Calcium chloride; Climate change; Marine pollution; Microfibers; Microplastic; Raman spectroscopy; Sediments; Submarine geology; Anthropogenics; Beaufort sea; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Canadian arctic ocean; Marine sediments; Microfibre; Microparticles; Microplastics; Plastic; Cellulose; calcium chloride; cellulose; cellulose; concentration (composition); marine sediment; plastic waste; Raman spectroscopy; sediment pollution; Article; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); density; density separation; dry weight; microfiber pollution; microplastic pollution; pollution monitoring; Raman spectrometry; sea pollution; sediment; separation technique; solid waste; trend study; Calcium Chloride; Canada; Cellulose; Raman Spectroscopy; Sediments; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105698878

This paper examined the status, opportunities, and challenges of nuclear electric power, with emphasis on issues of energy security, safety and occupational health implications for Sub-Sahara Africa and particularly Ghana. The findings of the review suggest that Ghana could be supported by the International community with technical and human competencies required to effectively develop and run a nuclear energy project. However, there is the need to have clear-cut health, regulatory, occupational health and safety policies and procedures for the nuclear programme. Further, maintaining and strengthening economic and political institutions for nuclear programme more specifically and the overall national economy will be critical for the success of the nuclear energy programme. This will obviously require first and foremost the passage of the occupational health and safety bill into law and its implementation to ensure safe and clean energy. Additionally, the review shows that nuclear power should not be seen as a substitute but a complement to other renewable energy sources to reduce energy poverty and promote sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental pollution; Ghana; Nuclear energy; Radiation; Renewable energy","Energy policy; Energy security; Heat radiation; Industrial hygiene; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Pollution; Sustainable development; Energy; Energy programs; Environmental pollutions; Ghana; Nuclear power development; Nuclear projects; Occupational health and safety; Renewable energies; Sources of energy; Sub-saharan africa; Renewable energy resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108080955

On this note, the current study examined for the first time the impact of the risk to investment on environmental quality over the period of 1984–2017 for the case of the United States. Considering that the burning of fuels constitutes the largest source of Greenhouse gas in the United States, this study employed energy carbon emissions both as a proxy for environmental quality and dependent variable. The real Gross Domestic Product and renewable energy production were both incorporated in the carbon function model as an additional explanatory variable that was examined by a handful of empirical tools. Importantly, the study found that an associated lower risk to investment is a suitable and significant approach toward improving the quality of the environment in both the short and long run. Similarly, the production and utilization of renewable energy exhibits a statistically significant and desirable impact on environmental quality i.e renewable energy production and utilization improves environmental quality. However, the study found that economic expansion significantly spur hindrance to environmental sustainability. This study justifies that risk associated with all investment aspects is fundamental to environmental quality, and thus posing an indirect health and socioeconomic concerns. Additionally, the result proved that the circumstance of renewable energy waste and energy loss to transmission arising production-consumption disparity is negligible. Moreover, the robustness and diagnostic test affirms the validity of the investigation. Thus, this study proffers a relevant policy mechanism toward the attainment of the country's sustainable development goals via cleaner productivity, especially from the perspective of associated risks in public and private low-carbon and clean technologies financing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production and environment; Renewable energy: economic development; Risk to investment; United States","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Energy dissipation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Investments; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Cleaner production and environment; Energy; Energy productions; Environmental quality; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energies; Renewable energy: economic development; Renewables; Risk to investment; United state; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107567478

The current research focused on the development of an integrated system dynamics model to examine the long-term effects of employing five adaptation strategies on groundwater. The model was calibrated and validated using a 21-year historical data set, and the strategies were combined into 21 management and climate change scenarios (seven management scenarios in tandem with three climate change scenarios) to project groundwater levels for the period 2020–2050. Future climatic conditions were projected by downscaling the data of the CanESM2 general circulation model under three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). By applying the business-as-usual management scenario, the groundwater table change rates will be −0.37, −0.45, and −0.44 m/year under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, while the corresponding rates for the most efficient management scenario are +0.22, +0.11, and +0.13 m/year, respectively. The strategies have been ranked according to their effectiveness as follows: (i) reducing irrigated agriculture in favor of rainfed agriculture or fallow fields, (ii) applying an adaptive cropping pattern, (iii) developing early-maturing cultivars, (iv) practicing deficit irrigation, and (v) enhancing irrigation efficiency. The findings indicate that the local management strategies will play a greater role in future groundwater sustainability than global climate change. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Adaptation strategies;; Climate change;; Groundwater dynamics;; Groundwater management;; Hamedan-Bahar Plain; Water resources;","climate change; concentration (composition); cropping practice; downscaling; general circulation model; global climate; resource depletion; Hamadan; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111479177

These waste management companies have a very high energy consumption processes involved in their operations. But most of these companies also rely on local power generation and hence making it a beneficial field to study micro grids. Our main aim through this research is to make sure that these waste management companies work with their best efficiency by processing the waste and to enable it dominance on micro grids without elimination user interference. This is done through a very unique machine learning approach. In this approach we first predict the amount of waste that can be brought to these companies with the help of ANN (artificial neural network). Then this waste is processed and optimized through Lagrangian Algorithm on the energy requirements that are dependent upon renewable energy. Also, this approach caters to user interference and preferences. This user preference is fed to the model with the help of user feedbacks and then processed through support vector machine. In order to include user feedback, we have used an active learning paradigm. This method is tested on a waste management company of district Warendorf. The results hence prove that the energy requirements can be managed and controlled in a micro grid with giving importance to user feedback. © 2021 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Micro Grids; Renewable Energy; Support Vector Machine; Waste Management","Energy utilization; Feedback; Greenhouse gases; Lagrange multipliers; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Waste management; Energy requirements; Greenhouses gas; High energy consumption; Integrate renewable energies; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Renewable energies; Support vectors machine; User feedback; Very high energies; Support vector machines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116708547

However, these strategies can also increase the chance of fracture interference, which can not only negatively impact the overall production but also introduce complexities for production data analysis. A semianalytical model is therefore developed to analyze production data from two communicating MFHWs and applied to a field case. The new semianalytical model uses the dynamic drainage area (DDA) concept and assumes three porosity regions. The three-region model is comprised of a primary hydraulic fracture (PHF), an enhanced fractured region (EFR) adjacent to the PHF, and a nonstimulated region (NSR). Assuming a well pair primarily communicates through PHFs, the equations for two communicating wells are coupled and solved simultaneously to model the fluid transfer between the wells. This method is used within a history-matching framework to estimate the communication between the wells by matching the production data. The semianalytical model is first verified against a more rigorous, fully numerical simulation model for a range of fracture/reservoir properties. These comparisons demonstrate that there is excellent agreement between the fully numerical simulation model results and the new semianalytical model. The semianalytical model is then employed to history-match production data from six MFHWs (drilled from two adjacent well pads) exhibiting different degrees of communication. For the purpose of history matching the data, only strong communication between pairs of wells (intrapair communication) is considered in the three-region model, and the results show good agreement with the field data. A flexible, yet simple, semianalytical model is developed for the first time that can accurately model the communication between multiple well pairs. This approach can be used by reservoir engineers to analyze the production data from communicating MFHWs.

In the last decade, there has been significant research output from several organisations across Scotland, in collaboration with partners in the rest of the UK and further afield. In this review, I highlight recent research focused on soil organic matter in the context of the main external drivers (land management and climate change). This review demonstrates the strengths and successes of the relatively tightly integrated policy-research-regulatory landscape in Scotland. It also highlights the need for more and greater impact through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research involving soil scientists, social scientists, policymakers and land managers. Evidence is presented that meaningful (rather than incremental) changes to climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and practices are necessary, with a further need for researchers and policymakers to consider both local conditions and global impacts of future climate on the practical implementation of soil-based climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in Scotland. The role of environmental and social scientists through advocacy as well as research is explored and discussed. © 2021 CSIRO.","carbon; climate change; land management; peat; soil databases","Behavioral research; Biogeochemistry; Organic compounds; Soils; Adaptation policies; Adaptation strategies; Climate change mitigation; Local conditions; Policy researches; Recent researches; Social scientists; Soil organic matters; Climate change; climate change; soil analysis; soil organic matter; Scotland; United Kingdom",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096449862

Single-atom-catalysts (SACs) have gained substantial attention thanks to their superior catalytic activity for CO oxidation, and graphene has been considered as one most promising supporting material owing to its peculiar physicochemical properties. In this work, the mechanism of CO oxidation over iridium (Ir) embedded on both single vacancy graphene (Ir-GNSV) and di-vacancy graphene (Ir-GNDV) has been investigated with the aid of density functional theory (DFT). The structural properties of Ir-GNSV and Ir-GNDV were analyzed by Bader charge analysis and electron density difference map. The calculated adsorption energy values of CO and O2 molecules on both the Ir-GNSV and Ir-GNDV have validated that both molecules can be molecularly adsorbed on the surface of each catalyst at room temperature. The results put forth that the reaction mechanism of CO + O2 → OOCO → CO2 + O* prefers to Langmuir − Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism. The activation energy for the transition-state for Ir-GNSV has been calculated to be 0.31 eV, whereas the first transition state (TS1) and the second transition state (TS2) of Ir-GNDV have been determined as 0.30 eV and 0.26 eV, respectively. Moreover, the results have confirmed that Ir-GNSV and Ir-GNDV surfaces have high catalytic activity and selectivity towards CO oxidation. On the basis of these findings, the proposed Ir-GNSV and Ir-GNDV catalysts are considered to be promising SAC for CO oxidation at low-temperature. It can be speculated that this work paves the way for the engineering of boosted-performance Ir-based heterogeneous catalysts by providing deeper mechanistic insights. © 2021","CO catalytic oxidation; DFT; Di-vacancy (DV) graphene; Iridium; Single atom catalysis; Single vacancy (SV) graphene",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108847474

This study examines the perceptions and attitudes of small family farmers toward climate change and identifies adaptation strategies supporting household food security in the Middle Eastern context, Lebanon. The study uses cross-sectional, primary data of households that own small family farms in the Central Bekaa region. The results show that the majority of the households believe that climate change is occurring, has adverse impacts on livelihoods, and is attributable to human factors. They perceived an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall patterns over the last 20 years. In response, the households used multiple agricultural practices to adapt to climate change. Based on the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) scores, only 7.5% of the households were food secure, while 89% were mild to moderately food insecure. Generally, the households had modest access to nutritious diets. All the households used two or more environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. However, the use of multiple environmentally sustainable practices did not correlate with improved food security. This latter result may be due to the limited knowledge of the farmers about trade-offs between various climate change adaptation measures. The findings suggest the need to refocus research from the question of whether small family farmers are willing to adopt (or not) climate change adaptation practices to identifying those practices that are capable of balancing economic, social, and environmental goals in a specific context. © 2021, Crown.","Arid and semi-arid; Climate change adaptation strategies; Family farms; Food security; Sustainability","adaptive management; agricultural practice; climate change; environment; family farm; food security; household survey; Lebanon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108823263

The region is also affected by intense dust storms. Monitoring challenges from the harsh climate have limited data needed to inform appropriate regulatory actions to address air pollution in the region. Objectives: To compare gravimetric measurements with existing networks that rely on beta-attenuation measurements in a desert climate; determine the annual levels of PM2.5 and PM10 over a two-year period in Kuwait; assess compliance with air quality standards; and identify and quantify PM2.5 sources. Methods: We custom-designed particle samplers that can withstand large quantities of dust without their inlet becoming overloaded. The samplers were placed in two populated residential locations, one in Kuwait City and another near industrial and petrochemical facilities in Ali Sabah Al-Salem (ASAS) to collect PM2.5 and PM10 samples for mass and elemental analysis. We used positive matrix factorization to identify PM2.5 sources and apportion their contributions. Results: We collected 2339 samples during the period October 2017 through October 2019. The beta-attenuation method in measuring PM2.5 consistently exceeded gravimetric measurements, especially during dust events. The annual levels for PM2.5 in Kuwait City and ASAS were 41.6 ± 29.0 and 47.5 ± 27.6 μg/m3, respectively. Annual PM2.5 levels in Kuwait were nearly four times higher than the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Regional pollution was a major contributor to PM2.5 levels in both locations accounting for 44% in Kuwait City and 46% in ASAS. Dust storms and re-suspended road dust were the second and third largest contributors to PM2.5, respectively. Conclusions: The premise that frequent and extreme dust storms make air quality regulation futile is dubious. In this comprehensive particulate pollution analysis, we show that the sizeable regional anthropogenic particulate sources warrant national and regional mitigation strategies to ensure compliance with air quality standards. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Air quality; BAM; Dust storms; Kuwait; Source apportionment","Air quality standards; Dust; Factorization; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Regulatory compliance; Storms; BAM; Beta attenuation; Dust storm; Gravimetric measurements; Kuwait; Particulate air pollution; PM$-10$; PM$-2.5$; Quality standard; Source apportionment; Air quality; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; dust storm; environmental assessment; identification method; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; source apportionment; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; air sampling; Article; attenuation; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; data analysis; desert climate; dust storm; elemental analysis; gravimetry; Kuwait; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; petrochemical industry; residential area; air pollutant; city; dust; environmental monitoring; Kuwait; Malaysia; particulate matter; Kuwait [Middle East]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Kuwait; Malaysia; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103961818

This work considers the emissions and production effects of powdered activated carbon (PAC) at 0.5% by dry matter (DM) on methanogenic rumen flora as the major source of dairy cattle enteric methane emissions. In total, 180 dairy cattle located in Brymaroo, Queensland (QLD), Australia, were studied in a three-cycle repeated measures ANOVA format with a 4 week primary interval. Emissions eructated during milking and in faecal deposits were measured, and in addition, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to determine the collective populations of prokaryotic bacteria and archaea as well methanogenic communities for each treatment. Moreover, 0.5% PAC addition reduced CH4 emissions by 30-40% and CO2 emissions by 10%, while improving daily milk production by 3.43%, milk protein by 2.63% and milk fat by 6.32%, on average for the herd (p &lt; 0.001 in all cases). rRNA gene sequencing showed populations of methanogenic flora decreased by 30% on average with a corresponding increase in the nonmethanogenic species.

Key questions that the authors investigate include: how will the renewable energy transition reshape the global balance of power? How will political-economic interdependencies and geopolitical alignments shift? Will contemporary petro-states adapt or collapse? And what new patterns of peace and conflict may emerge in a decarbonized world order? The authors provide different perspectives on the likely speed of the energy transition and its geopolitical implications. However, they occlude deeper questions about the depth of the transformations needed to prevent climate catastrophe—particularly in the nature of capitalism and military power—and the potential for more radical perspectives on energy futures. In contrast, I will argue that we should advance a critical research agenda on the global energy transition that accounts for the possibility of more far-reaching transformations in the political-economic, military, and ideological bases of world politics and highlights diverse movements fighting for their realization. These possible transformations include (1) transitions to post-growth political economies; (2) a radical shrinkage of emissions-intensive military–industrial complexes; and (3) decolonizing ideologies of “progress.” If struggles for alternative energy futures beyond the hegemony of economic growth and Western-style modernization are at the forefront of radical politics today, then these struggles deserve greater attention from critical IR scholars. © The Author(s) 2021.","climate change; climate justice; energy transition; geopolitics; renewable energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113464020

The results from the estimations suggest that renewable energy consumption significantly reduces the level of emissions; furthermore, its impact increases with higher quantiles. In addition, non-renewable energy consumption increases CO2 emissions, while its magnitude decreases with higher quantiles. The empirical results also confirm the validity of EKC hypothesis for the panel of MENA economies.

Consequently, there is a growing energy demand associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The residential building energy demand in arid countries such as Saudi Arabia is supplied with fossil fuel. The existing consumption pattern of fossil fuels in Saudi Arabia is less sustainable due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources and resulting environmental impacts. Buildings built in hot and arid climatic conditions demand high energy for creating habitable indoor environments. Enormous energy is required to maintain a cool temperature in hot regions. Moreover, climate change may have different impacts on hot climatic regions and affect building energy use differently. This means that different building interventions may be required to improve the performance of building energy performance in these geographical regions, thereby reducing the emissions of GHGs. In this study, this framework has been applied to Saudi Arabia, a hot and arid country. This research proposes a community–government partnership framework for developing low‐carbon energy in residential buildings. This study focuses on both the operational energy demand and a cost‐benefit analysis of energy use in the selected geographical regions for the next 30 years (i.e., 2050). The proposed framework primarily consists of four stages: (1) data collection on energy use (2020 to 2050); (2) setting a GHG emissions reduction target; (3) a building intervention approach by the community by considering cost, energy, and GHG emissions using the Technique for Order of Performance by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to select the best combinations in each geographical region conducting 180 simulations; and (4) a clean energy approach by the government using grey relational analysis (GRA) to select the best clean energy system on the grid. The clean energy approach selected six different renewable power generation systems (i.e., PV array, wind turbine, hybrid system) with two storage systems (i.e., battery bank and a combination of electrolyte, fuel cell, and hydrogen tank storage). This approach is designed to identify the best clean energy systems in five geographical regions with thirty scenario analyses to define renewable energy‐economy benefits. This framework informs through many engineering tools such as residential building energy analysis, renewable energy analysis, multi‐criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques, and cost‐benefit analysis. Integration between these engineering tools with the set of energy policies and public initiatives is designed to achieve further directives in the effort to reach greater efficiency while downsizing residential energy demands. The results of this paper propose that a certain level of cooperation is required between the community and the government in terms of financial investments and the best combinations of retrofits and clean energy measures.

Pelletized class A biosolids from the Doha North Sewage Treatment Plant were used. Results revealed significant differences in all measured parameters, which were affected by biosolid treatments compared to the control treatment. Electrical conductivity, pH, macro and micronutrients and heavy metals were significantly affected by biosolid treatments. The comparison of the discovered levels against the international acceptable ceilings of pollutants indicated the advantages of utilizing class A biosolids, as they were well below the international acceptable levels and showed the best test rates, indicating that the product is a sustainable and efficient organic fertilizer for ornamental plants. Furthermore, the results highlight no potential significant impacts on groundwater due to trace presence of heavy metals, owing to the nature of deep groundwater in Qatar and the usage of modern irrigation devices that fulfil the exact needs of plants in a harsh climate and high evaporation rate. © 2021 by the authors.

The member countries set their international and national targets to limit global temperature rise within 2 °C. The major and developed economics play a productive role in achieving the goals set in the Paris Agreement and failing would make it hard for the global community to limit the global temperature within the targeted range. The announcement of the USA to back out of the Paris Agreement has caused uncertainty in the global climate governance (GCG) regime. The present study overviews how the US defiance is likely to affect emission space, carbon prices, and macroeconomic conditions of the economies. It also focuses on the objective to analyze multiple strategic scenarios regarding GCG considering the role of three major contributors to GHG emissions—the USA, the EU, and China. An integrated conflict resolution strategy has been proposed by combining the analytical hierarchy process and attitude-based graph model for conflict resolution. The possible post-withdrawal scenarios based on possible alternatives for the GCG regime has been examined. This study incorporates influence power-based and attitude-based approaches to generate preference rankings of the alternative GCG strategies. The influence power-based and attitude-based preferences are used in general stability and attitude-based stability analyses to explore equilibrium GCG strategies. The analyses reveal that influence power and attitudes of the decision-makers (DMs) influence the preferences of DMs. This influence on preferences has implications on the outcomes of the GCG scenarios. The results of the influence power-based and attitude-based analyses imply that the collective GCG strategies are indispensable to protect the shared natural climate for environmental sustainability and development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Attitude-based analysis; Climate change; Climate governance; Environmental decision-making; Influence-power; Paris Agreement; Preference","analytical hierarchy process; climate change; European Union; global climate; numerical model; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099037042

This becomes critical at the distribution system level, especially at a microgrid (MG) level. This control is required not only to mitigate the negative impacts of intermittent generation from RESs but also to make better use of available energy, reduce carbon footprint, maximize the overall profit of microgrid and increase energy autonomy by effective utilization of battery storage. This paper proposes a heuristic multi-agent based decentralized energy management approach for grid-connected MG. The MG comprises of active (controlled) and passive (uncontrolled) electrical loads, a photovoltaic (PV) system, battery energy storage system (BESS) and a charging post for electric vehicles. The proposed approach is aimed at optimizing the use of local energy generation from photovoltaic and smart energy utilization to serve electrical loads and EV as well as maximizing MG profit. The aim of the energy management is to supply local consumption at minimum cost and less dependency on the main grid supply. Utilizing energy available from RESs (PV and BESS), customers satisfaction (fulfilling local demand), considering uncertainty of renewable generation and load consumption and also taking into account technical constraint are the main strengths of the presented framework. Performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated under different operating conditions and its efficacy is verified. © 2021 IEEE.","Distributed energy; Electric vehicle; Energy management; Multi-agent control; Storage system","Battery management systems; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Customer satisfaction; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Microgrids; Multi agent systems; Profitability; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Control and management; Distributed energies; Distributed energy sources; Electrical load; Microgrid; Multiagent control; Photovoltaic energy; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116634224

To achieve this goal, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database was used in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) setting, which allows for the inclusion of carbon taxes and the definition of four alternative environmental policies scenarios using both Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) as GHG emissions measures. All scenarios analyze the main effects of carbon-based tax economic instruments on the industry and national production, trade, and emissions, comparing the results for different measures of GHG, GWP, and GTP from the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System (SEEG) sectoral Brazilian emissions database. In contrast with other industries, relatively lower taxes on the meat and dairy industries seem to be the most adequate in terms of cost distribution in the Brazilian economic structure when only the GWP measure is considered. Urban activities and less-methane-intensive industries benefit from climate change policies designed using GWP-based rather than GTP-based carbon taxes. The article also highlights the importance of a gradual introduction of carbon taxes, allowing the most vulnerable industries a transition moment to adopt clean technologies and/or redirect economic activity to less-GHG-emitting segments. © 2021 by the authors.

These developments, although from different areas, have collectively paved way for concrete structures with non-corrosive reinforcement and in-built sensors. Therefore, the purpose of this effort is to bridge the gap between civil engineering and sensor engineering communities through an overview on the up-to-date technological advances in both sectors, with a special focus on textile reinforced concrete embedded with fiber optic sensors. The introduction section highlights the importance of reducing the carbon footprint resulting from the building industry and how this could be effectively achieved by the use of state-of-the-art reinforcement techniques. Added to these benefits would be the implementations on infrastructure monitoring for the safe operation of structures though their entire lifespan by utilizing sensors, specifically, fiber optic sensors. The paper presents an extensive description on fiber optic sensor engineering that enables the incorporation of sensors into the reinforcement mechanism of a structure at its manufacturing stage, enabling effective monitoring and a wider range of capabilities when compared to conventional means of structural health monitoring. In future, these developments, when combined with artificial intelligence concepts, will lead to distributed sensor networks for smart monitoring applications, particularly enabling such distributed networks to be implemented/embedded at their manufacturing stage. © 2021 by the authors.

India is one of the countries which is affected most, therefore, the Government of India has implemented several lockdowns in the entire country from April 25, 2020. We studied air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, Black Carbon (BC), and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) level, and observed significantly sudden reduced. In India, most of the anthropogenic activities completely stopped. Therefore, we studied the levels of BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations, their sources apportion, and health risk assessment during normal days, lockdown (from lockdown 1.0 to lockdown 4.0) and unlock down 1.0 situation at Sakchi, Jamshedpur city. It was observed that lockdowns and unlock down situations BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower than regular days. We applied the advanced air mass back trajectory (AMBT) model to locate airborne particulate matter dispersal from different directions to strengthen the new result. The diagnostic ratio analyses of BC shows that wood burning contribution was too high during the lockdown situations. However, during normal days, the PAHs source profile was dedicated toward biomass, coal burning, and vehicle emission as primary sources of PAHs. During the lockdown period, emission from biomass and coal burning was a significant contributor to PAHs. The summaries of health risk assessment of BC quantified an equal number of passively smoked cigarettes (PSC) for an individual situation was studied. This study focuses on the overall climate impact of pandemic situations.

Our aims were to examine the impact of this ENSO exposure on child diets, in particular: (1) frequency of food consumption patterns, (2) the amount of food consumed (g/d), (3) dietary diversity (DD), (4) consumption of donated foods, among children aged 9-36 months living in the outskirts of City of Iquitos in the Amazonian Peru. Design: This was a longitudinal study that used quantitative 24-h recall dietary data collection from children aged 9-36 months from 2010 to 2014 as part of the MAL-ED birth cohort study. Setting: Iquitos, Loreto, Peru. Participants: Two hundred and fifty-two mother-child dyads. Results: The frequency of grains, rice, dairy and sugar in meals reduced by 5-7 %, while the frequency of plantain in meals increased by 24 % after adjusting for covariates. ENSO exposure reduced girl's intake of plantains and sugar. Despite seasonal fluctuations in the availability of fruits, vegetables and fish, DD remained constant across seasons and as children aged. However, DD was significantly reduced under moderate La Niña conditions by 0·32 (P < 0·05) food groups. Adaptive social strategies such as consumption of donated foods were significantly higher among households with girls. Conclusions: This is the first empirical study to show differential effect of the ENSO on the dietary patterns of children, highlighting differences by gender. Public health nutrition programmes should be climate- and gender-sensitive in their efforts to safeguard the diets of vulnerable populations. © The Author(s), 2020.

In 2015-2016, 37.6%-56.9% for ICB, 28.0%-44.3% for PB, 2.5%-7.0% for RADs, and 2.4%-6.9% for WDL were attributed to ambient PM10 and PM2.5 exposures, respectively. Finally, 6-10 ICB, 6-10 PB, 279-788 RADs and 76-214 WDL attributable cases due to PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, could be prevented if the annual limit values of 10 μg/m3 were not exceeded. This study could serve as proxy for similar urban residential environments across many developing countries to aid in informing local and national authorities about future stringent air pollution mitigation policies. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","AirQ+; bronchitis; morbidity; particulate matter","cardiovascular disease; concentration (composition); developing world; disease incidence; disease prevalence; epidemiology; health risk; morbidity; particulate matter; public health; risk assessment; risk factor; urban area; urban population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112842341

The objective of this study was to valorize macaúba husks through subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion (PT+AD) in comparison to a control reactor (CR). The semi-continuous parameters were: 10 g of dried husk; flow rate of 10 mL/min at 200 °C and 14 MPa and for a total reaction time of 40 min. For AD, mesophilic conditions (35 °C) were kept for both experimental trials. For the PT+AD experiment, digestion was performed for 38 days and for 39 days for the CR experiment. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal for the PT+AD reactor was 48% and 43% for CR, indicating the pretreatment improved digestibility of the organic feed. Similarly, the CH4 yield per unit of COD for 590 mL CH4/g COD for the PT+AD experiment compared with 57 mL CH4/g COD for the CR experiment. The corresponding biogas yield was 161% greater than in the PT+AD experiment compared with the CR. Energy analysis revealed a corresponding benefit from SWH for production of heat and power, and several recommendations were made for decreasing the heat required by SWH to make the process self-sufficient. Macaúba cultivation has promise as an energy crop that can be grown locally in Brazil and similar tropical locations for co-production of biodiesel from the extracted oil and biogas from the husks, thereby avoiding greenhouse gas emissions by replacement of traditional fossil sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied relationships among soil C and plant species richness within ~ 9700 ha of grasslands in Colorado, US. Using 141 grassland transects, we tested how soil C was related to plant species richness, grassland type, soil texture, and prairie dog presence. Soil C was significantly, positively related to plant species richness, while native perennial graminoid species richness exhibited an even stronger positive relationship. However, the relationship of soil C and plant richness was not found in all three grassland types studied, but instead was unique to the most common grassland type, mixed grass prairie, and absent from both xeric tallgrass and mesic tallgrass prairie. The presence of a single indicator species, Andropogon gerardii, showed a significant, positive relationship with soil carbon. Our best possible model explained 45% of the variance in soil C using species richness, grassland type, and their interaction. Surprisingly, soil C was negatively related to soil clay, suggesting that surface clays amplify evaporation and water runoff rather than protecting soil organic matter from decomposition. Soil C was negatively related to prairie dog presence, suggesting that prairie dogs do not enhance soil carbon sequestration; in fact, prairie dog occupied sites had significantly lower soil C, likely related to loss of topsoil from prairie dog colonies. Our results suggest that management for species richness provides the co-benefit of soil C storage, and high clay and prairie dog disturbance compromises both. © 2021, The Author(s).","Functional group; Grasslands; Plant species richness; Prairie dogs; Soil carbon","carbon storage; disturbance; evaporation; functional group; prairie; soil carbon; soil organic matter; species diversity; species richness; topsoil; Colorado; United States; Andropogon gerardii; Cynomys; Indicator indicator; carbon; biodiversity; ecosystem; grassland; plant; soil; Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystem; Grassland; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111146058

Under these conditions, pollutant emissions are seriously increased due to internal engine effects and unfavorable operating conditions of the exhaust aftertreatment systems. As a secondary effect, the composition of the exhaust gases has a considerable influence on the deposition of aerosols via different deposition mechanisms and on fouling processes of exhaust gas-carrying components. Also, the performance of exhaust gas aftertreatment systems may be affected disadvantageously. In this study, the exhaust gas and deposit composition of a turbocharged three-cylinder gasoline engine are examined in situ upstream of the catalytic converter at ambient and engine starting temperatures of −22 °C to 23 °C using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer and a particle spectrometer. For the cold start investigation, a modern gasoline engine with series engine periphery is used. In particular, the investigation of the behavior of deposits in the exhaust system of gasoline engines during cold start under dynamic driving conditions represents an extraordinary challenge due to an average lower soot concentration in the exhaust gas compared to diesel engines and so far has not been examined in this form. A novel sampling method allows ex situ analysis of formed deposits during a single driving cycle. Both, particle number concentration and the deposition rate are higher in the testing procedure of real driving emissions (RDEs) than in the inner city part of the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC). In addition, reduced ambient temperatures increase the amount of deposits, which consist predominantly of soot and to a minor fraction of volatile compounds. Although the primary particle size distributions of the deposited soot particles do not change when boundary conditions change, the degree of graphitization within the particles increases with the increasing exhaust gas temperature. © 2020 by ASME","Acetylene; Deposit formation; Engine cold start; Exhaust gas composition; Fouling; Fuel combustion; Gasoline engine; Low ambient temperature; Novel measuring method; RDE; Real driving emissions; Soot; WLTC","Automobile testing; Deposition rates; Deposits; Exhaust gases; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gasoline; Light weight vehicles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Soot; Spectrometers; Temperature; Volatile organic compounds; Aftertreatment systems; Deposition mechanism; Emission regulation; Exhaust aftertreatment; Exhaust gas temperatures; Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; Low ambient temperatures; Particle number concentration; Exhaust systems (engine)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107869979

The RpoZ gene encodes for the ω subunit of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and is involved in the regulation of the relA gene pathway. RelA is responsible for the production of guanosine pentaphosphate (ppGpp), which is a major alarmone in the stringent response. Expression of relA is reduced in the early hours of growth of RpoZ mutant E. coli. In the absence of the ω subunit, ppGpp affinity to RNAP is decreased; thus, rpoZ gene deleted E. coli strains show a modified stringent response. We used the E. coli K-12 MG1655 strain that lacks rpoZ (JEN202) to investigate the effect of the modified stringent response on recombinant protein production. However, the absence of the ω subunit results in diminished stability of the RNA polymerase at the promoter site. To avoid this, we used a deactivated CRISPR system that targets the ω subunit to upstream of the promoter site in the expression plasmid. The expression plasmid encodes for Chaetomium thermophilum formate dehydrogenase (CtFDH), a valuable enzyme for cofactor regeneration and CO2 reduction. A higher amount of CtFDH from the soluble fraction was purified from the JEN202 strain compared to the traditional BL21(DE3) method, thus offering a new strategy for batch-based recombinant enzyme production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CRISPR; E. coli expression system; Formate dehydrogenase","carbon dioxide; CRISPR associated endonuclease Cas9; formate dehydrogenase; fungal enzyme; lac repressor; recombinant enzyme; transcription factor RelA; Article; Chaetomium thermophilum; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; DNA replication origin; enzyme purification; enzyme synthesis; Escherichia coli; genetic code; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; promoter region; protein expression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106293323

It has been verified that buildings and cities have a higher incidence in this regard. It is necessary to have tools for initial assessment that can quickly analyse whether the improvement scenarios put forward by different organisations and governments will be able to meet the goals set at European level. Universities are an important factor for the intended change and therefore offer an excellent environment for testing such tools. A case study focusing on a university in northern Spain is presented, through an evaluation tool using 3D models including life-cycle assessment. Different reform scenarios are evaluated for two key years, 2030 and 2050. The novelty lies in considering, not only the impact of the operational phase but also the impact of the different stages of the life cycle and processes, obtaining an impact value closer to reality. The results indicate that, even with major retrofitting and adaptation efforts, the European targets are difficult to achieve by 2050. Moreover, solutions such as biomass help to achieve greenhouse gas reductions but not to improve energy efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19-related lockdown on the PM concentrations in the North, Central, and South Zones of Cerrejón, Colombia, the largest open-pit coal mine in Latin America. To compare the levels before and during the emergency shutdown, we analyzed both the ground-based daily PM10 and PM2.5 data and the satellite (Terra/Aqua MODIS)-based daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) values from March 6 through April 13, 2020. The average PM10 concentrations in the North and South Zones, in contrast to those observed at other global monitoring sites, increased by 13–38% and 4–7%, respectively, although they decreased by 26–31% in the Central Zone, between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. Furthermore, during the latter, the daily PM2.5 levels in the South Zone rose by up to 43%, and we found higher AOD values (≥ 0.4) over the Central and South Zones as well as significant AOD-contributing loads upwind and downwind of the coal production pits. Finally, the increases in humidity and temperature (≥ 3.5% and ≥ 0.3 K, respectively), decrease in planetary boundary layer height (≥ 0.11 km), wind field variability, and rural biomass burning events shaped the spatial-temporal behavior of the PM in this region, and changes in meteorology and external sources nearly offset the reduction in emissions from mining activities.

In this research, we analyzed how the changes in human mobility during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, from February to April 2020 (i.e., between 17 February and 30 April 2020), affected the daily CO2 emissions for countries having a high number of coronavirus cases at that time. Our daily time-series analyses indicated that when average hours spent at home increased, the amount of daily CO2 emissions declined significantly. The findings suggest that for all three countries (the US, India, and France), a 1% increase in the average duration spent in residential areas reduced daily CO2 emissions by 0.17 Mt, 0.10 Mt, and 0.01 Mt, respectively, during the first wave period. Thus, confining people into their homes contributes to cutting down CO2 emissions remarkably. However, the study also reveals those activities such as visiting parks and going grocery shopping increase CO2 emissions, suggesting that unnecessary human mobility is undesirable for the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Agriculture and land-use change, one of the most diverse sectors, emits 66 % of global anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. A plethora of research has been compiled to estimate and quantify the N2O emissions from agricultural systems and understand the underlying processes (nitrification and denitrification). These processes are controlled by natural (e.g., environment, soil, and topography) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., agricultural management practices). Complexity in topographical attributes such as elevation, slope, and aspect contribute to spatial variability in soil properties and controls N2O emissions. Additionally, a set of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) such as conservation tillage (CT), cover cropping (CC), and soil organic amendments have been adopted to improve soil health. However, the potential impact of these BMPs on N2O emissions has not been considered in detail. Simultaneously, the inter-connectedness of these natural and anthropogenic factors makes soil N2O emissions extremely variable and complex. Recent studies reported the varied impacts of CT, CC, and organic amendments on N2O emissions. However, the landscape level and integrated impact of natural and anthropogenic factors and processes from temperate regions have not been reviewed, which is an obvious gap in the literature. In this review, we critically analyzed 226 recent studies (mainly from temperate regions) to investigate the status and progress of our understanding of N2O emissions from the agricultural crop production system. Most of the studies reported that topography increases spatial variations in N2O emissions by regulating soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Landscape positions with higher soil moisture (foot slope, toe slope, localized depressions) had significantly higher contributions towards N2O emissions. Moreover, agricultural BMPs also increase soil N2O emissions alone and integrated with topographical variations. We identified potential mechanisms accelerating these emissions, mitigation options, and future research directions under each section based on critical literature analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Cover cropping; Nitrous oxide emissions; Soil organic amendments; Soil physical chemical and biological properties; Topography","Cultivation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Process control; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Agricultural best management practices; Anthropogenic factors; Best Management Practise; Conservation tillage; Cover cropping; N$-2$/O; Nitrous oxide emissions; Organic amendments; Soil organic amendment; Soil physical chemical and biological property; Topography; agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; best management practice; conservation tillage; crop production; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; soil moisture; spatial variation; temperate environment; topography",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104613428

Developing efficient plans for resilience enhancement of WDNs thus is essential recognizing the ubiquitous nature of WDNs and increased frequency and destructive severity of hazardous events. This paper presents a resilience-driven multiobjective optimization model to maximize the resilience of WDNs while minimizing the life-cycle cost and carbon emissions. Enhancement actions first are determined and clustered into work packages, and then an optimized schedule is generated considering various operational and managerial factors. A real WDN in the city of London, Ontario, was utilized to demonstrate the proposed model's practicality. The resilience increased by 24% with CAD 1.6 million investment. Additionally, cost saving of about 33% is achievable if the proposed model is employed instead of a currently utilized practice. The developed model is expected to help city managers establish optimal resilience enhancement plans, considering tight available budgets and limited workforce. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Multiobjective optimization; Rehabilitation planning; Resilience; Sustainability; Water distribution networks","Budget control; Carbon; Computer aided design; Life cycle; Managers; Multiobjective optimization; Carbon emissions; Hazardous events; Managerial factors; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimal resilience; Optimized schedule; Rehabilitation planning; Water distribution networks; Water distribution systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106148898

These studies mainly focused on archeological charcoal from the Holocene series, but the potential of the method to be applied Pleistocene sequences is still under debate. Understanding climate-driven variability in stable carbon isotope ratios of modern samples is fundamental for the accurate characterization of past climate information based on the δ13C of charred material. In a previous study, we laid the methodological foundation to apply the method to Pleistocene contexts. Here, we present the δ13C isotopic signal from Pinus spp. charcoal in a well stratified middle Paleolithic site: “Les Canalettes” (Aveyron, France). We demonstrate that the use of isotopic analyses on ancient charcoal of the genus Pinus from the quaternary period could provide a reliable paleoclimatic marker with high resolution and provide data that is complementary to taxonomic studies.

However, TSF prediction has received little attention because a thunderstorm event is a combination of intricate and unique weather scenarios with high instability, making it difficult to predict. To close this gap, we proposed two novel hybrid machine learning models through hybridization of data pre-processing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with two state-of-arts models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for TSF prediction at three categories over Bangladesh. We have demarcated the yearly TSF datasets into three categories for the period 1981–2016 recorded at 28 sites; high (March–June), moderate (July–October), and low (November–February) TSF months. The performance of the proposed EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models was compared with classical ANN, SVM, and autoregressive integrated moving average. EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models showed 8.02–22.48% higher performance precision in terms of root mean square error compared to other models at high-, moderate-, and low-frequency categories. Eleven out of 21 input parameters were selected based on the random forest variable importance analysis. The sensitivity analysis results showed that each input parameter was positively contributed to building the best model of each category, and thunderstorm days are the most contributing parameters influencing TSF prediction. The proposed hybrid models outperformed the conventional models where EEMD-ANN is the most skillful for high TSF prediction, and EEMD-SVM is for moderate and low TSF prediction. The findings indicate the potential of hybridization of EEMD with the conventional models for improving prediction precision. The hybrid models developed in this work can be adopted for TSF prediction in Bangladesh as well as different parts of the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bangladesh; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Hybrid model; Random forest; Sensitivity analysis; Thunderstorm","artificial neural network; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; climate prediction; frequency analysis; sensitivity analysis; support vector machine; thunderstorm; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104699159

All plants’ growth in high SO2 showed a significant decrease in LMA compared with the control (with no SO2).When grown in a highCO2, lowO2, and highSO2 treatment,most plants continued to showa decrease inLMA compared with the control but an increase comparedwith the high SO2 treatment with ambient CO2 and O2. Conclusions. Thesefindings suggest that exposure to SO2 significantly decreasesLMA, potentially reducing preservation potential in the fossil record. Exposure to combined SO2 and high CO2 reduces this effect, but this may also obscure the effects of SO2, leading to interpretations that ecosystem instability is primarily driven by increasing CO2, which may not be the case. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.

This step towards more prosumer‐based and decentralized energy systems comes at a time when energy planning at a neighborhood scale is on the rise in many countries. It is widely assumed that—from a prosumer’s cost‐perspective— shared conversion and storage technologies supplying more than a single building can be advanta‐ geous. However, it is not clear whether this is the case generally or only under certain conditions. By analyzing idealized building clusters at different degrees of urbanization (DOU), a linear‐opti‐ mization approach is used to study the cost difference between shared energy infrastructure (smart energy neighborhoods, SENs) and individually planned buildings. This procedure is carried out for various emission reduction targets. The results show, that with higher emission reduction targets the advantage of SENs increases within rural environments and can reach up to 16%. Nevertheless, there are constellations in which the share of energetic infrastructure among buildings does not lead to any economic advantages. For example, in the case of building clusters with less than four build‐ ings, almost no cost advantage is found. The result of this study underlines the importance of energy system planning within the process of urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

The modifications consist of adding rock-beds to open fires or simple woodstoves, increasing airflow, improving combustion efficiency, and decreasing the distance between the fire and cooking pot, which improves heat transfer. The campaign was sponsored by Sun24, a US-based non-profit organization. They trained women leaders active in a local Anglican diocese consisting of 9200 families. The women returned to their communities and held their own trainings at local parishes. We randomly sampled 1362 households from those communities to understand the impact of the campaign. 67% of surveyed families were aware of rockbeds: 51% had attended trainings themselves and 16% heard about rockbeds from relatives or neighbors. 85% of the families that had heard about rockbeds installed them at home and continued to use them for many months after first hearing about them. Nearly all users express a high degree of satisfaction with rockbeds and 67% of trained respondents report cooking two or more meals daily on with rockbeds. We examined variation in weekly and daily frequency of use and find larger households are twice as likely to use rockbeds daily and to cook all their meals with rockbeds than smaller households (p &lt; 0.01). Respondents that were trained by Sun24 or women leaders were nearly three times as likely to use rockbeds daily than respondents who heard about rockbeds by word-of-mouth (p &lt; 0.01). Among households reporting daily use, better educated respondents were nearly twice as likely to use rockbeds for all meals. However, respondents who owned charcoal or LPG stoves were 30% and 60% less likely to use rockbeds for all their meals than other respondents (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01). Using a regional estimate of “non-renewable biomass” of 36%, we estimate annual emission reductions of roughly 480 kg of CO2-equivalent for each adopter. Sun24 invested roughly USD 700 in training women leaders and facilitating rockbed adoption in thousands of rural households. Previous research found that median fuelwood savings of nearly 30% when families modified open fire stoves with rockbeds. Applying this average to all adopting families results in annual wood savings of 390 kg per family or 2900 tons per year across the diocese. Using a regional estimate of “non-renewable biomass” and assuming rockbed use persists for 5 years, total emission reductions would be 11.8 tCO2e at a mitigation cost of just USD 0.06 per ton CO2e making rockbeds a cost-effective mitigation strategy. © 2021","Cookstoves; Fuelwood; Kenya; Rock beds; Stove adoption","Audition; Charcoal; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Emission control; Fires; Heating; Liquefied petroleum gas; Nonprofit organization; Surveys; Combustion efficiencies; Degree of satisfaction; Emission reduction; Frequency of use; Mitigation costs; Mitigation strategy; Non profit organizations; Simple modifications; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; energy use; fuel consumption; household energy; rural area; survey method; sustainable development; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109988439

Subsequently, CO2 map was also generated theoretically. To obtain precise results, ANN was used while creating the maps. Later, conventional vehicle model was created with Matlab/Simulink. Afterwards, hybrid vehicle model was developed by implementing electrical system in compliance with single-shaft pre-transmission parallel configuration with one electric motor. Hybrid powertrain control algorithm was created by considering efficiencies of mechanical and electrical power sources and sinks. Charge-neutral simulations were run with conventional and hybrid models over WLTC and a local route which is created by collected in-city speed data. The hybrid and conventional vehicles were enabled to be compared with the developed method. Detailed comparison of ICE operations both between two vehicle models and two cycles was presented. Moreover, obtained results, including overall electrical system efficiencies, were compared over WLTC and the local route. Significant improvements both in consumption and CO2 values were concluded. It is also concluded that using the hybrid system in local route with higher proportion of in-city driving conditions caused higher improvements despite a slight decrease in overall electrical system efficiency. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Emission; Fuel consumption; Hybrid system; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Vehicle model","Carbon dioxide; Data acquisition; Efficiency; Hybrid systems; MATLAB; Powertrains; Vehicle performance; Vehicle transmissions; Driving conditions; Electrical system efficiency; Electrical systems; Experimental investigations; High speed data acquisition; Mechanical and electrical; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Pre-transmission parallel configurations; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101857516

Villas as part of a compound or separate units represent the majority of the residential areas in the city. Due to the harsh hot arid climate of Al Ain, the energy demand for the cooling load is quite high. Therefore, it is relevant finding new retrofit strategies that are efficient in reducing the cooling load of the villas. The aim of this study is to analyze one particular strategy (parametric shading structure) in terms of design, construction, cost, energy impact on the selected villa. The main data for this study is taken from the local sources. There are six steps followed in this analysis: case study analysis; climate analysis; parametric structure and PV panels; building energy consumption and outdoor thermal comfort; modelling, simulation, and validation; materials, construction, and cost evaluation. The model of the villa was validated for the full year 2020 based on the electricity bills obtained. After adding the parametric design structure, the reduction after shading is approximately 10%. Meanwhile the UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) dropped from extreme heat stress to strong heat stress (average for the month of March and September). These findings are promising in the retrofit industry due to the advanced calculations used to optimize the parametric design structure. © 2021 by the authors.

At the level of the European Union, the justification for the CAP appears increasingly linked to the translation of policy objectives into results-based measures. Accordingly, in this paper, we estimate a composite indicator to track changes at the farm level and assess the impacts of agri-environment climate schemes (AECSs) on the change in management intensity. As AECS payments are tailored to compensate for the costs and income forgone due to participation in environmentally friendly measures, we assume that any environmental benefits increase with the amount of payment received. We estimate the effects of differential payments on management intensity by applying a generalised propensity score approach to a case study comprising all AECSs implemented in the Veneto region (North-eastern Italy). We find that AECSs have a significant effect on the composite indicator of extensification, but the provision of environmental good differs among the varying levels of payments. Our results contribute in-depth reflections and a proposal for measuring the cost-effectiveness of AECSs to the ongoing debate on the post-2020 CAP regarding AECSs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-Environment schemes; Composite indicators; Environmental effectiveness; Generalised propensity score","agri-environmental policy; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; Common Agricultural Policy; environmental management; European Union; policy approach; Italy; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086935809

A database of 62 articles published in Kazakh, Russian, or English covered the majority of the territory of the country for soil and water samples but to a lesser extent for sediments. Reported concentrations were summarized using statistical parameters, then spatialized and finally classified in contamination classes according to local legislation. This analysis revealed some hotspots of TTE in surface waters (Cd and Pb), soil (As), and sediments (Cd and As). Hotspots of less toxic Cu, Zn, and Mn were also detected. Spatialization of results allowed localization of these hotspots close to industrial sites, such as smelters or mining and metallurgic combines. Others have been shown to be close to disused mining sites or landfills with municipal waste. Methodological improvements for further studies have been suggested, such as to integrate more West Kazakhstan or remote areas in sampling campaigns, but also to describe more exhaustively the used analytical methods and to be more attentive to the speciation of the analyzed form of the element.

Yet, they represent one of the main reasons for the intentional introduction of ornamental species, some of which can escape and establish in natural ecosystems. Besides aesthetic reasons, climate and socioeconomic factors can also modulate which species are planted in urban parks. Here, we evaluate the relationship between traits of 486 ornamental woody species from 46 Spanish urban parks and climatic and socioeconomic variables. We specifically assessed how plant traits, climatic, and socioeconomic factors are related to the proportion of non-native species and, among them, to the proportion of established non-native species in Spain. Overall, we found clear associations between species traits and climatic variables. Most notably, parks with warmer winters have more plant species with conspicuous flowers, whereas parks with colder winters and a more continental climate have more species with higher tolerances to cold and shade. Most of the species recorded in our study are non-native (82 %). Higher proportions of non-native species in urban parks were positively associated with towns with large size homes and inhabitants with higher median age but negatively related to parks with species with a higher hardiness-zone range. Moreover, a greater proportion of non-native species that can establish in the natural ecosystems was found in parks with lower continentality conditions. Our results show that Spanish urban parks have an overwhelming proportion of non-native woody species, some of which have the potential to establish, and that the variation in their proportions can be explained by climatic, and socioeconomic factors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Hardiness zones; Invasive species; Ornamental plants; Plant trait profile","esthetics; greenspace; home range; introduced species; invasive species; ornamental species; socioeconomic conditions; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108630717

Intervention programmes aim to build the resilience of local communities to climate shocks, and ultimately their wellbeing by helping them to better prepare, adapt and recover. Resilience, similar to human wellbeing, is a multidimensional construct grounded in local realities and lived experiences. Yet current evaluation frameworks used in resilience programming rarely consider what resilience means in local contexts prior to implementation. This means policy designs risk failing to improve resilience of communities and creating unintended negative consequences for communities’ well-being. Better processes and indicators for assessing resilience are needed. This paper explores the interplay between local predictors of resilience and wellbeing to assess the validity of self-assessed indicators as part of frameworks to measure resilience. We draw from research on the Devolved Climate Finance (DCF) mechanism implemented between 2014 and 2018 in Tanzania. We find that different factors explain resilience when compared to wellbeing; while resilience is primarily influenced by relationships, wellbeing is correlated with livelihoods. This shows that incentives to improve resilience differ from those of wellbeing. Climate and development practitioners must adopt locally grounded framings for resilience and wellbeing to ensure interventions track appropriate indicators, towards positive outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

Current intensification and expansion practices add to the degradation of grasslands and dramatically increase greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Thus, new ways to sustain and improve their productivity are needed. Research efforts focus on the plant-leaf microbiome, or phyllosphere, because its microbial members impact ecosystem function by inﬂuencing pathogen resistance, plant hormone production, and nutrient availability through processes including nitrogen fixation. However, little is known about grassland phyllospheres and their response to environmental stress. In this study, globally dominant temperate and tropical forage grass species were grown in a greenhouse under current climate conditions and drought conditions that mimic future climate predictions to understand if (i) plant host taxa inﬂuence microbial community assembly, (ii) microbial communities respond to drought stress, and (iii) phyllosphere community changes correlate to changes in plant host traits and stressresponse strategies. Community analysis using high-resolution sequencing revealed Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant bacterial class, which increased under severe drought stress on both temperate and tropical grasses while overall bacterial community diversity declined. Bacterial community diversity, structure, and response to drought were significantly different between grass species. This community dependence on plant host species correlated with differences in grass species traits, which became more defined under drought stress conditions, suggesting symbiotic evolutionary relationships between plant hosts and their associated microbial community. Further understanding these strategies and the functions microbes provide to plants will help us utilize microbes to promote agricultural and ecosystem productivity in the future. IMPORTANCE Globally important grassland ecosystems are at risk of degradation due to poor management practices compounded by predicted increases in severity and duration of drought over the next century. Finding new ways to support grassland productivity is critical to maintaining their ecological and agricultural benefits. Discerning how grassland microbial communities change in response to climate stress will help us understand how plant-microbe relationships may be useful to sustainably support grasslands in the future. In this study, phyllosphere community diversity and composition were significantly altered under drought conditions. The significance of our research is demonstrating how severe climate stress reduces bacterial community diversity, which previously was directly associated with decreased plant productivity. These findings guide future questions about functional plantmicrobe interactions under stress conditions, greatly enhancing our understanding of how bacteria can increase food security by promoting grassland growth and resilience.

Unfortunately, the flow of multiple ecosystem services from small reservoirs have been declining over several years due to lack of rehabilitation and poor management. Using selected multipurpose small reservoirs and available secondary and survey data, this paper applied an ecosystem services-based approach in the economic analysis of investment in rehabilitation of small reservoirs in northern Ghana. The findings reveal that private financial returns from irrigated crops have negative net present value (NPV) and an internal rate of return (IRR) lower than the cost of capital, implying a lack of economic incentive for private investors in their rehabilitation. However, accounting for the multiple ecosystem services such as livestock watering, fisheries, recreation services, domestic water, and climate regulation show positive NPV and high return on capital (IRR up to 43%). Policy choices would be biased against reservoir development if stakeholders consider only irrigation benefits. Based on the findings we recommend public investment in rehabilitation of multi-purpose small reservoirs to harness the multiple ecosystem services and community livelihoods. We further recommend public–private-user partnership business model to address current management inefficiency and optimize the flows of ecosystem services from small reservoirs to wider community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Northern Ghana; Rehabilitation; Retrun on investment; Small reservoirs; Vegetable crops",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114753553

Both sound pressure level measurements and sound classifications were conducted in three urban historical places to emphasize their effect on the character of the area. Based on the data obtained, noise maps were created. The results of the study indicated that there was no change in sound sources due to the similarity of past and present usage types of the three selected historical areas, and that sound sources as an element of cultural heritage in the area were preserved and survived to the present day as a consequence. The type of use, intensity of use, structural-plant density, and climatic change were found to be effective in determining the acoustic environment character. The continuity of sound sources, which are among the elements that constitute the identity in historical places in particular and can be considered as cultural heritage elements, and the harmony of these sound sources for the intended use of the space are the factors that should be taken into account in spatial planning and design. © 2021 by the authors.

The sedimentary sequence of the endorheic Dead Sea and its precursors contain aragonite laminae that provide a detailed sedimentary archive of climatic, hydrologic, limnologic and environmental conditions since the Pleistocene. However, the interpretation of these archives requires a detailed understanding of the constraints and mechanisms affecting CaCO3 precipitation, which are still debated. The implications of aragonite precipitation in the Dead Sea and in its late Pleistocene predecessor (Lake Lisan) were investigated in this study by mixing natural and synthetic brines with a synthetic bicarbonate solution that mimics flash-floods composition, with and without the addition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Aragonite precipitation was monitored, and precipitation rates and carbonate yields were calculated and are discussed with respect to modern aquatic environments. The experimental insights on aragonite precipitation are then integrated with microfacies analyses in order to reconstruct and constrain prevailing limnogeological processes and their hydroclimatic drivers under low (interglacial) and high (glacial) lake level stands. Aragonite precipitation took place within days to several weeks after the mixing of the brines with a synthetic bicarbonate solution. Incubation time was proportional to bicarbonate concentration, and precipitation rates were partially influenced by ionic strength. Additionally, extracellular polymeric substances inhibited aragonite precipitation for several months. As for the lake's water budget, our calculations suggest that the precipitation of a typical aragonite lamina (0.5 mm thick) during high lake stand requires unreasonable freshwater inflow from either surface or subsurface sources. This discrepancy can be resolved by considering one or a combination of the following scenarios; (1) discontinuous aragonite deposition over parts of the lake floor; (2) supply of additional carbonate flux (or fluxes) to the lake from aeolian dust and the remobilization and dissolution of dust deposits at the watershed; (3) carbonate production via oxidation of organic carbon by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Altogether, it is suggested that aragonite laminae thickness cannot be directly interpreted for quantitatively reconstructing the hydrological balance for the entire lake, they may still prove valuable for identifying inherent hydroclimatic periodicities at a single site. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aragonite; Dead Sea; Dead Sea deep drilling project; Eastern Mediterranean; EPS; Extracellular polymeric substances; Lacustrine carbonate; Lake Lisan; Levant climate; Paleoclimate; Paleohydrology; Paleolimnology; Varves","Budget control; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Mixing; Organic carbon; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Dead sea; Dead sea deep drilling project; Eastern Mediterranean; Extracellular polymeric substance; Lacustrine carbonate; Lake lisan; Levant climate; Paleo-hydrology; Paleoclimates; Varve; Lakes; aragonite; bicarbonate; brine; carbonate; deep drilling; lacustrine deposit; paleoclimate; paleohydrology; paleolimnology; Pleistocene; polymer; precipitation (chemistry); varve; Dead Sea; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Lamiinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104955540

We argue that sexism, representing an investment in gendered hierarchies, contributes to climate change denial and policy opposition. Using nationally representative surveys from 2016 to 2018, we show a consistent relationship between sexism and opposition to climate change beliefs and policies. These results are consistent across measures of both climate change beliefs and support for climate policy. We then show that sexism is correlated with climate denial and opposition to climate policy within a wide variety of subgroups of interest: for both Democrats and Republicans and for groups sorted by ideology, gender, education, and age. We then extend our analysis back in time, looking at data from 2012, finding similar effects prior to the 2016 election.

Traditional UHI investigation methods are often incapable of providing the high spatial density of observations required to distinguish small‐scale temperature differences in the UHI. Crowdsourcing offers a solution. Building cooling/heating load in 2018 has been estimated in London, UK, using crowdsourced data from over 1300 Netatmo personal weather stations. The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme was used to classify the different urban environments of London (UK). Inter‐LCZ temperature differences are found to be generally consistent with LCZ temperature definitions. Analysis of cooling degree hours in July shows LCZ 2 (the densest urban LCZ in London) had the highest cooling demand, with a total of 1550 cooling degree hours. The suburban related LCZs 5 and 6 and rural LCZs B and D all had about 80% of the demand of LCZ 2. In December, the rural LCZs A, B and D had the greatest heating demand, with all recording around 5750 heating degree hours. Urban LCZs 2, 5 and 6 had 91%, 86% and 95% of the heating demand of LCZ D, respec-tively.

Succeeding in these niches requires an ability to persist for potentially long periods of time in growth-arrested states when essential nutrients become limiting. The tendency of these bacteria to grow in dense biofilm communities frequently leads to the development of steep nutrient gradients and deprivation of interior cells even when the environment is nutrient rich. Surviving within host environments also likely requires tolerating growth arrest due to the host limiting access to nutrients and transitioning between hosts may require a period of survival in a nutrient-poor environment. Interventions to maximise plant-beneficial activities and minimise infections by bacteria will require a better understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks that contribute to starvation survival, and how these networks function in diverse organisms. Here we focus on carbon starvation as a growth-arresting condition that limits availability not only of substrates for biosynthesis but also of energy for ongoing maintenance of the electrochemical gradient across the cell envelope and cellular integrity. We first review models for studying bacterial starvation and known strategies that contribute to starvation survival. We then present the results of a survey of carbon starvation survival strategies and outcomes in ten bacterial strains, including representatives from the orders Enterobacterales and Pseudomonadales (both Gammaproteobacteria) and Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria). Finally, we examine differences in gene content between the highest and lowest survivors to identify metabolic and regulatory adaptations that may contribute to differences in starvation survival. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

Only literature indexed in English were included. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed using title, abstract, and keywords only. We searched for papers including both a health component and an explicit mention of either climate change, climate variability, or climate change-relevant weather phenomena. We classified relevant publications according to the fields of climate research, climate drivers, health impact, date, and geography. We used supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify and classify relevant articles in the field of climate and health, with outputs including evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in climate health-related publications. We included empirical literature of any study design that reported on health pathways associated with climate impacts, mitigation, or adaptation. Findings: We predict that there are 15 963 studies in the field of climate and health published between 2013 and 2019. Climate health literature is dominated by impact studies, with mitigation and adaptation responses and their co-benefits and co-risks remaining niche topics. Air quality and heat stress are the most frequently studied exposures, with all-cause mortality and infectious disease incidence being the most frequently studied health outcomes. Seasonality, extreme weather events, heat, and weather variability are the most frequently studied climate-related hazards. We found major gaps in evidence on climate health research for mental health, undernutrition, and maternal and child health. Geographically, the evidence base is dominated by studies from high-income countries and China, with scant evidence from low-income counties, which often suffer most from the health consequences of climate change. Interpretation: Our findings show the importance and feasibility of using automated machine learning to comprehensively map the science on climate change and human health in the age of big literature. These can provide key inputs into global climate and health assessments. The scant evidence on climate change response options is concerning and could significantly hamper the design of evidence-based pathways to reduce the effects on health of climate change. In the post-2015 Paris Agreement era of climate solutions, we believe much more attention should be given to climate adaptation and mitigation options and their effects on human health.

This study evaluated for the first time the performance of the statistical downscaling model (SDSM-DC) at 2m spatial resolution in simulating rainfall in Ghana for the base period 1981–2010. It further analysed the projected changes in seasonal rainfall pattern across different agro-ecological zones for the twenty-first century under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios over Ghana. Ensemble mean of simulated rainfall data (2011–2099) generated by 43 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as base factors for local future climate scenarios generation. Performance analysis of SDSM-DC shows a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, percent bias and RMSE observations standard deviation ratio of 0.88, −19 and 0.34, respectively. Generally, seasonal rainfall amount is expected to increase between 10 and 40% in all the agro-ecological zones in Ghana by the end of the twenty-first century. Off-season rainfall in December–February shows more than 100% increase in the Guinea Savannah zone. Rainfall projected under RCP 4.5 was on average 2% higher than RCP 8.5 in all the seasons throughout the century. Based on these results, it is appropriate to suggest a high incidence of flooding across Ghana in the twenty-first century. This could have dire consequences on agriculture which contribute to a large proportion of Ghana’s GDP. Therefore, for sustainable food production and security in the twenty-first century, Ghana needs climate adaptation policies and programmes that encourage the design and implementation of early warning systems of meteorological hazards and the introduction of new crop varieties that are flood tolerant. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate modelling; Ghana; Rainfall; RCP 4.5; RCP 8.5; SDSM-DC","academic performance; CMIP; downscaling; early warning system; food production; performance assessment; rainfall; spatial resolution; sustainability; twenty first century; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098779714

The rates and extents of biological degradation and adsorption were investigated and compared with other biofilm systems, including a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and a sand filter, by monitoring 14C activities in the liquid and gas phases. The microbial cleavage of ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and mecoprop was confirmed for all biofilms, based on the formation of 14CO2, whereas the degradation of 14C-labeled moieties of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine was undetected. Higher degradation rates for diclofenac were observed for the GAC-filter media than for the other biofilms. Degradation of previously adsorbed diclofenac onto GAC could be confirmed by the anaerobic adsorption and subsequent aerobic degradation by the GAC-bound biofilm.

Within soils, root deposits provide an important source of easily accessible energy and nutrients, stimulating microbial growth to produce EPS. Especially under semiarid climates, where a full vegetation cover cannot be sustained, large gradients in living conditions for microbes can be found between the root-soil interface and barren intercanopy spaces. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the plant-specific effects on microbes, EPS production and soil aggregation. At two sites in southern Spain, differing in carbonate and graphite content, legume shrubs of Anthyllis cytisoides and grass tussocks of Macrochloa tenacissima were selected. Soil samples were taken in the adjacent bare interspace, under the canopy and of the rhizosphere. From these samples the microbial community (here bacteria and archaea), EPS(-saccharide) content and soil aggregation (<1 mm) were analysed. DNA extracted from the microbial cells detached from the surface of the sampled roots (rhizoplane), was subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The rhizoplane microbial communities differed strongly between plant species and sites, whereby site was the most important factor shaping the communities. The plant species effect on microbial communities diminished strongly with distance to the root surface. At the carbonate-poor Rambla Honda site (site 1), plant species-specific effects were observed in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere, whereas in the carbonate-rich Alboloduy site (site 2) almost no plant species-specific effects were found at the genus level. The larger heterogeneity in microbial communities at site 1 was reflected in EPS-saccharide contents and subsequent soil aggregation, while no difference in soil aggregation was found at site 2. Both parameters increased strongest in the Anthyllis cytisoides rhizosphere at site 1. Despite the lack of a strong gradient with distance from the root at the carbonate-rich site 2, microbial taxa were found by network analysis that positively correlated to EPS-saccharide contents and/or soil aggregation. The relationship between the identified taxa and EPS and/or aggregation relationships were clearest at the root-soil interface, while several other taxa were found to be widely occurring in the other soil compartments too. In conclusion, we found in all compartments potential EPS producers, which could have influenced soil aggregation. Nevertheless, microbes with higher relative abundance in the rhizoplane were linked to higher EPS contents, especially in conjunction with legume shrubs, and subsequently related to soil aggregation. The spatial extent of the root effect was only governed by carbonate contents, as higher carbonate content diminished the observed root effects on the microbial community and subsequent soil aggregation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate; High-throughput amplicon sequencing; Rhizoplane; Rhizosphere","Agglomeration; Bacteria; RNA; Sugars; Carbonate; Carbonate content; Extracellular; High-throughput amplicon sequencing; Microbial communities; Polymeric substance; Rhizoplane; Soil aggregation; Soil interfaces; Specific effects; Soils; exopolymer; grassland soil; microbial community; semiarid region; soil aggregate; soil microorganism; Anthyllis cytisoides; Archaea; environmental samples (Archaea); environmental samples (Bacteria); Fabaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106386232

However, the required demand-oriented supply of CO2-neutral hydrogen is technically and economically challenging. These challenges arise due to interdependencies between the volatility of renewable power generation, available hydrogen production capacities, available hydrogen storage capacities and the operational demands to be met by gas turbines. The present study aims to quantify these interdependencies by conducting a model-based analysis of an exemplary CHP system featuring a hydrogen-fired industrial gas turbine with on-site hydrogen production via electrolysis and on-site hydrogen storage. To identify the sought-after interdependencies, simulations featuring various system parameterizations are analyzed. If only local power surpluses are utilized for the operation of electrolyzers, the results show a nonlinear impact of both the hydrogen production capacity and the hydrogen storage capacity on the hydrogen-based gas turbine operation. Furthermore, the results indicate that an exclusive utilization of local power surpluses leads to limited periods of hydrogen-based gas turbine operation and low utilization rates of the hydrogen production and storage capacities. If additional power for the operation of electrolyzers is supplied by the grid, increased utilization rates and prolonged periods of hydrogen-based gas turbine operation can be achieved. However, to realize an overall reduction of CO2 emissions, this mode of operation requires the supply of large quantities of renewable power by the grid. The results of an additional economic assessment reveal that both investigated operational modes are not economically viable within the considered economic framework. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Expanding renewable power generation in a significant way is seen as an imperative measure within this transition. To compensate for the inherent volatility of wind- and solar-based power generation, flexible and dispatchable power generation technologies such as gas turbines are required. If operated with CO2-neutral fuels such as hydrogen or in combination with carbon capture plants, a green house gases-neutral gas turbine operation can be achieved. An effective leverage to enhance carbon capture efficiency and a possible measure to safely burn hydrogen in gas turbines is the partial external recirculation of exhaust gas. By means of a model-based analysis of a state-of-the-art industrial gas turbine, this study initially assesses the thermodynamic impact caused by a fuel switch from natural gas to hydrogen. Although positive trends such as increasing net electrical power output and thermal efficiency can be observed, the overall effect on the gas turbine process is only minor. In a following step, the partial external recirculation of exhaust gas is evaluated and compared both for the combustion of natural gas and hydrogen, regardless of potential combustor design challenges. The influence of altering working fluid properties throughout the whole gas turbine process is thermodynamically evaluated for ambient temperature recirculation and recirculation at an elevated temperature (303.15 K). A reduction in thermal efficiency as well as non-negligible changes in relevant process variables can be observed.

The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM2.5 show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 μg/m3 and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 μg/m3. As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown. The present study estimates that cumulative about 100.9 Billion US$ are saved due to reduced air pollution externalities, which are about 25% of the cumulative economic loss of 435.9 Billion US$.

In this study, drought disaster grade sequences from 14 representative stations were chosen from 268 years of drought disaster historical data for the Hunan Province of China collected during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) methods were used to conduct a spatial characteristics analysis of these drought disasters. The results are as follows. (1) There was an inconsistency between the frequency and intensity of the drought disasters. (2) The spatial distribution of the first four EOF loads for the drought disasters showed regional consistency; however, there was a difference in the anti-phase changes in the east–west, south–north, and central directions. (3) The features of the drought disaster distribution in the Hunan Province during the Qing Dynasty are evident, and according to the high values (absolute value ≥ 0.6) for the first six EOF rotational loads, the study area can be divided into the following sections: northeast Xiang (Section I), west Xiang (Section II), southeast Xiang (Section III), middle Xiang (Section IV), north Xiang (Section V), and southwest Xiang (Section VI). The study of drought disasters in Qing Dynasty is of great significance and reference value for disaster prevention, disaster reduction and climate prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Drought disaster; Empirical orthogonal function; Hunan Province; Qing Dynasty; Rotated empirical orthogonal function; Spatial characteristics","Disasters; Drought; Orthogonal functions; Spatial distribution; Climate prediction; Climate warming; Disaster reduction; Distribution characteristics; Drought disasters; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Reference values; Spatial characteristics; Disaster prevention; drought; natural disaster; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; China; China; Hunan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112376282

The exploitation of renewable sources, the improvement of energy performance in buildings and the need for cutting-edge national energy and climate plans represent important and urgent topics to be faced in order to implement the sustainability concept in urban areas. In addition, the spread of polygeneration microgrids and the recent development of energy communities enable a massive installation of renewable power plants, high-performance small-size cogeneration units, and electrical storage systems; moreover, properly designed local energy production systems make it possible to optimize the exploitation of green energy sources and reduce both energy supply costs and emissions. In the present paper, a set of key performance indicators is introduced in order to evaluate and compare different energy communities both from a technical and environmental point of view. The proposed methodology was used in order to assess and compare two sites characterized by the presence of sustainable energy infrastructures: the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa in Italy, where a polygeneration microgrid has been in operation since 2014 and new technologies will be installed in the near future, and the SPEED2030 District, an urban area near the Campus where renewable energy power plants (solar and wind), cogeneration units fed by hydrogen and storage systems are planned to be installed. © 2021 by the authors.

The energy saving potential has been recently proved with adaptive setpoint temperatures. However, the accuracy of thermostats hinders the achievement of the energy saving obtained in previous studies. For this reason, this paper studies the influence of three types of thermostats according to their configuration accuracy: 0.1, 0.5, and 1 °C. Two case studies (with and without retrofitting) were analysed in three cities in the current scenario, in 2050, and in 2100. The results showed that the implementation of adaptive setpoint temperatures in thermostats of 0.1 °C virtually obtains the same savings as the direct application of thermal comfort limits. Nevertheless, obtaining considerable energy savings in the other two thermostats depends on the type of energy consumption, climate, and the category of the thermal comfort model. The application of adaptive setpoint temperatures in air conditioning systems obtains energy savings greater than 40%, regardless of the type of thermostat and category, whereas in heating systems, only the category III obtains energy savings with old thermostats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive thermal comfort model; Energy saving; Residential buildings; Thermostat","Air conditioning; Climate change; Climate models; Energy utilization; Thermal comfort; Thermostats; 'current; Adaptive thermal comfort model; Building energy performance; Case-studies; Energy savings; Energy savings potential; Energy-savings; Residential building; Set-point temperatures; Temperature analysis; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104914720

Also, primary attention to RES has been given at the EU level with the new Green Deal and the new objectives of the Next Generation EU after the Covid pandemic, and at the level of national Governments worldwide. So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries’ specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conditional convergence; Renewable energy sources; Worldwide countries data set","alternative energy; convergence; energy resource; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; article; China; diffusion; education; educational status; financial market; human; human experiment; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; renewable energy; velocity; renewable energy; sustainable development; China; China; COVID-19; Humans; Renewable Energy; SARS-CoV-2; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107709897

Amongst the different fuels under investigation, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia have gained immense attention as carbon-neutral energy vectors. Here we have compared the energy efficiency and the energy demand of rSOC based on these three fuels. In the fuel cell mode of operation (energy generation), two different routes have been considered for both methane and ammonia; Routes 1 and 2 involve internal reforming (in the case of methane) or cracking (in the case of ammonia) and external reforming or cracking, respectively. The use of hydrogen as fuel provides the highest round-trip efficiency (62.1%) followed by methane by Route 1 (43.4%), ammonia by Route 2 (41.1%), methane by Route 2 (40.4%), and ammonia by Route 1 (39.2%). The lower efficiency of internal ammonia cracking as opposed to its external counterpart can be attributed to the insufficient catalytic activity and stability of the state-of-the-art fuel electrode materials, which is a major hindrance to the scale-up of this technology. A preliminary cost estimate showed that the price of hydrogen, methane and ammonia produced in SOEC mode would be ~1.91, 3.63, and 0.48 $/kg, respectively. In SOFC mode, the cost of electricity generation using hydrogen, internally reformed methane, and internally cracked ammonia would be ~52.34, 46.30, and 47.11 $/MWh, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Communities in the United States and elsewhere are exposed to more frequent extreme heat, wildfires, cyclones, extreme precipitation, and flooding events. Whether and how people respond to increased hazard exposure (adaptive behavior) is widely recognized to be driven by their capacity to adapt, perception of the risk, and past experiences. Underlying these important dimensions, however, is social context. In this paper, we examine how social capital and social vulnerability shape risk perception and household flood mitigation actions. The study, based on a metropolitan-wide survey of households in Austin, Texas, USA, suggests that bonding social capital (personal networks, neighborhood cohesion, and trust) is positively related to mitigation behavior and that social vulnerability is negatively related to risk perception. Importantly, our research demonstrates a positive and significant effect of social capital on adaptive behavior even when controlling for social vulnerability of a neighborhood. This suggests that policies and programs that strengthen the social connectedness within neighborhoods can increase adaptive behaviors thus improving community resilience to flood events.

Biogas is a type of biofuel that has the potential to reduce climate emissions from freight transport, while providing additional benefits such as recycling of nutrients and increased energy security. This paper uses theories on the diffusion of green technologies to analyse the barriers and drivers for the increased use and diffusion of biogas in freight transport. The empirical focus is on the region of Västra Götaland in Sweden, and qualitative interviews have been conducted with demand-side actors such as transport buyers, haulage companies and vehicle manufacturers. The results confirm the important barriers observed in previous research, such as the higher costs of biogas, financial uncertainties and lack of infrastructure, as well as the interplay between barriers. The main drivers are an increased focus on sustainability both within the sector and from wider society, as well as the environmental properties of biogas. Specific barriers have also been identified such as a fragmented freight market structure with a mix of large and small transport companies, tight profit margins and reduced capacity for investments.

First, the preparation of microbe coated biocathodes ex-situ with putative electroactive species with CO2 as sole carbon source was assayed. Second, CO2 feeding strategies for the operation of BES systems were explored to ensure enough reducing power during batch mode operation. The impact on the proposed changes on the product portfolio and production yields was assessed. The initial enrichment of a putative electroactive community on bare electrode surfaces was proven to be successful and led to a shortening of the start-up period of the system from days to hours. Moreover, the establishment of a new feeding procedure to favor the presence of elevated reducing power availability for cells triggered the production of longer carbon chain carboxylates (max. 0.99 gbutyrate m-2electrode d-1) and alcohols (max. 0.83 gethanol m-2electrode d-1) at early stages of experiment.

The CLC developed the Carbon Dividends Plan (CDP), which proposes a carbon emissions market mechanism to solve the climate change crisis. The CLC’s lobbying arm, the Americans for Carbon Dividends (AFCD), is currently working to educate US congressional leaders on the importance of a carbon tax, like the one proposed in the CDP. In the paper, I address the following question: what can Polanyi’s theoretical insights tell us about the CDP and its social implications? I first discuss the CDP within the context of the current climate change crisis. Then, I apply Polanyi’s market embeddedness, fictitious commodities, and double movement concepts to the discussion. I illustrate four main points in this paper. First, the CDP is part of an ongoing societal double movement. Second, despite the CLC’s neoliberal “free” market ideals, the self-regulated market proposed in the CDP is a social construction, embedded in social relations, itself. Third, the CDP, and carbon markets in general, comprise one specific type of unconscious countermovement that extends the self-regulated market to combat the destructive forces of the market itself. Fourth, the CDP’s proposal for a carbon emissions market mechanism is an unsatisfactory solution to address the climate change crisis, as it will not address the inherent contradictions in the overall system as a whole. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon Dividends Plan; Climate Leadership Council; Double movement; Fictitious commodities; Market embeddedness; Polanyi",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112055809

This paper presents a protocol for analysing the existing residential stock towards planning building upgrading actions. A Geographic Information System with building-related data is used to assess the housing stock following a bottom-up approach. The urban study sample is established using several criteria at building level. The potential for improvement of buildings is ascertained using DOE 2.2 energy models which incorporate standard passive strategies to reduce the current primary energy demand and the associated CO2 emissions. The protocol is applied to the existing public housing developments built in the southern Spanish city of Córdoba, under Mediterranean conditions, during the urban expansion period which spanned 1951–1980. The extrapolation of results to the urban study sample shows a 25 % reduction in CO2 emissions and a 40 % decrease in annual energy demand. Furthermore, the impact of typology and position on the energy behaviour of a given building is acknowledged. The benefits achieved aim to help stakeholders in the implementation of energy retrofitting urban plans. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings energy performance; GIS for urban building model; Mediterranean housing stock; Public housing developments; UBEM; Urban analysis","Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Geographic information systems; 'current; Building energy performance; CO$-2$/ emission; GIS for urban building model; Mediterranean housing stock; Public housing development; Study samples; UBEM; Urban analysis; Urban studies; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105308558

This modeling paradigm harkens back to a 30–40-year-old debate about whether big-leaf models adequately simulate fluxes for vegetated surfaces compared to more complex and computationally costly multilayer canopy models. This article revisits that scientific debate. We review the early literature to place our findings in context and discuss recent advancements in roughness sublayer theory, observations of canopy structure and leaf traits, and computational methods that facilitate the use of multilayer models. Using a model with variable vertical resolution, we compare a multilayer canopy representation with the equivalent one-layer canopy to ask how well the one-layer canopy replicates the multilayer benchmark and to identify why differences occur. Comparisons with flux tower measurements at several forest sites spanning multiple years show that sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, gross primary production, and friction velocity for the one-layer canopy degrade in comparison to the benchmark multilayer canopy. For the forest sites considered, 5–10 canopy layers sufficiently reproduce the observed fluxes. Vertical variation of within-canopy air temperature, specific humidity, and wind speed in the multilayer canopy alters fluxes compared with the one-layer canopy. The vertical profile of leaf water potential, in which the upper canopy is water-stressed on dry soils, also causes differences between the one-layer and multilayer canopies. The differences between one-layer and multilayer canopies suggest that the land surface modeling community should revisit the big-leaf surface flux parameterizations used in models. © 2021","Big-leaf model; Biosphere-atmosphere fluxes; Land surface model; Multilayer canopy model","land surface; phytomass; sensible heat flux; surface flux; vertical profile; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105828533

Using a century-long, globally gridded time series that indexes net water availability, every year we compute local occurrences of an extreme ""dry""or ""wet""condition for a specified duration and return period. A global exposure index is then derived for major mining commodities by weighting extreme event occurrence by local production exposed. We note significant spatial and temporal clustering of exposure at the global level leading to the potential for fat-Tailed risk associated with investment portfolios and supply chains. This may not be a surprise to climate scientists familiar with the space-Time patterns of interannual to decadal climate oscillations that can affect remote regions through teleconnections. However, the traditional approach of climate risk analysis only considers local or point extreme value analysis and hence does not account for temporal and spatial clustering of exposure for global portfolios. As multinational enterprises and supply chains assess and disclose physical climate risks, they need to consider the much higher chance that they may have multiple assets that may be exposed to extreme wet and/or dry climate extremes in the same year. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"climate effect; climate oscillation; extreme event; global climate; teleconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112068756

The greenhouse gas budget in peatlands will be constrained by how much a peatland can utilize SO42− reduction as an alternative to methanogenesis. Using records of atmospheric deposition and stream chemistry coupled with elemental analysis of peat soil, vegetation, particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), this study estimated a 23-years long sulfur (S) budget for a blanket bog-covered catchment in the North Pennines, England. The study showed that: (a) Atmospheric deposition of total S significantly declined over the study period from 2.4 to 0.5 t S/km2/yr. (b) Long term accumulation of S into deep peat at 1 m depth averaged 127 kg S/km2/yr. (c) Total S fluvial flux peaked as 4.5 t S/km2/yr with an average of 0.7 t S/km2/yr. (d) On average, over 23 years, 0.25 t S/km2/yr were reduced to either mineral sulphides or hydrogen sulphide; however, in eight out of the 23 years the catchment was a net producer of S to the streams of the catchment. At maximum observed, S reduction capacity the peatland was capable of a net removal of 71% of atmospheric S deposition. Allowing for the efficiency of energy transfer in the redox process and the oxidation state of peat organic matter means that for every mole of SO42− reduced, 1.69 moles of CO2 were produced, and an average of 0.47 t C/km2/yr are diverted from methanogenesis. © 2021.

The resultant emissions in the form of heat, directly, and carbon, indirectly, are cause for concern among Data Center managers and owners. In the past, and in many contemporary instances as well, Data Center managers have struggled to rein in large energy bills as operational activities increased. This paper attempts to address the problems without affecting operational efficiency of Data Centers and while maintaining high standards of system uptime. The latter is made possible by observing a set standard of Power Usage Efficiency and through rationalizing power consumption of equipment and Data Center infrastructure itself. Our research has shown that it is possible to control power consumption, and thus bring about savings in terms of electric bills paid, even when the count of servers in Data Centers racks increase from four to seven. Experiments conducted in the course of our research indicate to maintain a high quality of Data Center operational state and keep power consumption under control even in the wake of rising user numbers. The resultant savings in electrical units consumed, shall ultimately contribute in a small yet meaningful way towards a smaller carbon footprint and a greener planet. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission; Data-center; Distributed computing; Energy consumption; Green computing","Carbon footprint; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Managers; Power control; Quality control; Carbon emissions; Electric bills; Electrical energy; Electrical units; Energy efficient; Operational activity; Operational efficiencies; Operational state; Green computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098570257

Given the advancements in analytical techniques that are now available, we have extended the persistence curve of glyphosate to elucidate the actual length of time of persistence in northern British Columbia, rather than relying on estimations of persistence based on half-life curves that are quite often modelled from incomparable environments. We collected plant tissues from five forest understory perennial species growing in two distinct biogeoclimatic regions of northern BC to map out how glyphosate residue quantities change over time according to species, plant tissue type, and climate regime.

Alternative urban spaces should be designed considering new requirements in terms of urban microclimate and thermal comfort. Pervious pavements such as green parking lots can contribute to this goal through solar evaporative cooling. However, the cooling benefits of such systems remain under debate during dry and warm periods. The aim of this study was to compare experimentally the thermal behavior of different parking lot types (PLTs) with vegetated urban soil. Four parking lots were instrumented, with temperature probes buried at different depths. Underground temperatures were measured during summer 2019, and the hottest days of the period were analyzed. Results show that the less mineral used in the surface coating, the less it warms up. The temperature difference at the upper layer can reach 10 °C between mineral and non-mineral PLTs. PLTs can be grouped into three types: (i) high surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, important heat transfer toward the sublayers, and low time shift (asphalt system); (ii) high (resp. low) surface temperature during daytime (resp. nighttime), weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (paved stone system); and (iii) low surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (vegetation and substrate system, wood chips system, vegetated urban soil). The results of this study underline that pervious pavements demonstrate thermal benefits under warm and dry summer conditions compared to conventional parking lot solutions. The results also indicate that the hygrothermal properties of urban materials are crucial for urban heat island mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

The question, especially in cities that have been dominated by car traffic, is how? The challenge is heightened by the multidisciplinary involvements in the design, operation, and maintenance of urban infrastructure. This study examines the views of professionals from different disciplines involved in delivering walking environments in Auckland, New Zealand. The study examines agreements and disagreements regarding users’ needs, priorities, challenges, and evidence gaps for delivering quality walking environments in a car-dominated city. Methods: Primary data were collected through an online survey (N = 28) and a focus group, both involving professionals active in urban design, road safety, transport planning, public health, urban development and strategy. Analysis involved content coding and comparing the frequency of responses across professional groups. Results: The results indicated a consensus on the complexity associated with providing walking environments, as well as the importance of the quality of street environments. The lack of priority given to walking, car-dominated environments, and the inability to deliver change were seen as challenges. The inputs suggested a negative chain reaction linking the low priority of walking and the lack of consensus relative to users’ experience. There appeared to be a lack of common understanding of users’ needs and experiences and a paucity of evidence on this topic. Conclusion: The findings suggest the need for urban retrofit rooted in a sound understanding of users’ needs and experiences, and walkability as a sub-system of the urban environment. Recommendations include higher interdisciplinary collaboration at the policy and practice level, reviewed delivery processes, and better-quality data. © 2021","Multidisciplinary; Public health; Retrofit; Urban design; User experience; Walkability","Highway planning; Motor transportation; Public health; Surveys; Urban growth; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Professional groups; Transport planning; Transport systems; Urban development; Urban environments; Urban infrastructure; Walking environments; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111272668

New decentralized, polycentric structures allow for climate finance to more effectively reach the sub- and non-state actors most directly implementing climate change governance. However, the expansion of climate finance into market-inflected forms of blended finance, as well as debt-based financing, express a neoliberal logic that shifts power to market actors. This may challenge the efficacy of climate finance. We suggest that further research is needed on polycentric systems in climate finance, since an apparent expansion in the diversity of providers is also accompanied by a counter-intuitive concentration of decision-making power with financial fund managers. We join others in suggesting that the weight of scholarship advocates for a strong return to public authored finance and governance, under the auspices of Green New Deal programs and more widely.

This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. P. solenopsis is native to North America and has spread to all continents except Antarctica. It has recently been reported from Cyprus, Greece and Italy. This mealybug is a polyphagous pest, feeding on about 300 plant species. It usually feeds on aerial plant parts, especially new growth, but also occurs on roots, and is often associated with ants. It is an economically important pest of ornamentals, such as hibiscus and lantana, glasshouse vegetable crops, mainly bell pepper, tomato and eggplant, and field crops, such as cotton. Large populations cause die-back and reduction in yield. Adult and immature P. solenopsis could enter the EU with imported fresh fruit, vegetables and cut flowers, although the main pathway of introduction is likely to be plants for planting. Host availability and climate suitability indicate that most of the EU would be suitable for establishment. The main natural dispersal stage is the first instar, which crawls over the plant or may be dispersed further by wind and animals. All stages may be transported over longer distances in trade. Phytosanitary measures are available and should prevent further introductions and slow the spread within the EU. P. solenopsis is under official control in Cyprus and has recently been reported in Greece and Italy. Assuming that these reports reflect a limited distribution, and P. solenopsis shortly comes under official control, it would satisfy all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Most industrialized countries have formulated national adaptation strategies to meet this challenge. However, the implementation of on-the-ground measures is lagging. To analyze the implementation process and possible reasons for the implementation gap, we take a closer look at how the integration of adaptation goals into various sectoral policies—often called mainstreaming—has been handled on different administrative levels in Switzerland. Going beyond traditional compilations of barriers to climate change adaptation, we analyze the use of six different mainstreaming strategies across cases and levels and the reasons for their success or lack thereof. We find that different actors at all administrative levels have successfully employed programmatic mainstreaming in combination with inter-organizational mainstreaming to foster horizontal cooperation. We call this strategy cooperative mainstreaming. Some pioneers even managed to channel their successes into advances in regulatory mainstreaming. However, the lack of systematic regulatory and directed mainstreaming on the national and cantonal levels largely limits adaptation actions on lower levels to those cases where the major impetus derives from extreme events or proactive individuals on the ground. We conclude that the adaptation implementation gap in Switzerland largely stems from the lack of political commitment to promoting local adaptation at the national and cantonal levels. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment","climate change adaptation; climate policy; climate policy integration; environmental policy integration; implementation gap; mainstreaming","adaptation; climate variation; environmental management; environmental policy; strategic approach; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100998279

In order to characterize how the functional traits of bacteria are affected, important plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria of grassland soil communities, pseudomonads, were isolated from a grassland experiment and phylogenetically and functionally characterized. The Miniplot experiment was implemented to examine the mechanisms underlying grassland ecosystem changes due to climate change, and it investigates the sole or combined impact of drought and PCC (plant species with their main distribution either in SW or NE Europe, and a mixture of these species). We observed that the proportion and phylogenetic composition of nutrient-releasing populations of the Pseudomonas community are affected by prolonged drought periods, and to a minor extent by changes in plant community composition, and that these changes underlie seasonality effects. Our data also partly showed concordance between the metabolic activities and 16S phylogeny. The drought-induced shifts in functional Pseudomonas community traits, phosphate and potassium solubilization and siderophore production did not follow a unique pattern. Whereas decreased soil moisture induced a highly active phosphate-solubilizing community, the siderophore-producing community showed the opposite response. In spite of this, no effect on potassium solubilization was detected. These results suggest that the Pseudomonas community quickly responds to drought in terms of structure and function, the direction of the functional response is trait-specific, and the extent of the response is affected by plant community composition. © 2021 by the authors.

We develop an energy-balance model in which each energy system supplies the electric, heating, and cooling demands of 16 commercial building types in 16 climate zones of the United States. We assume a best-case scenario where all the CHP's heat and power are allocated toward building demands to ensure robust results. We quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, conventional air pollutants (CAPs), and natural gas (NG) consumption. In most cases, the decentralized CHP system increases GHG emissions, decreases CAP emissions, and decreases NG consumption relative to the centralized NGCC system. Only fuel-cell CHPs were able to simultaneously reduce GHG, CAP, and NG consumption relative to the NGCC-based system. The results suggest that despite their energy efficiency benefits, standard distributed CHP-based systems typically do not have enough benefits compared to an NGCC-based system to justify a reorganization of existing infrastructure systems. Because fuel-cell CHPs can also use hydrogen as a fuel source, they are compatible with decarbonized energy systems and may aid in the transition toward a cleaner energy economy. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","air pollution; combined cooling, heat, and power; combined heat and power; distributed energy generation; natural gas combined cycle","Air pollution; Climate models; Energy efficiency; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Natural gas; Office buildings; Cleaner energies; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Commercial building; Efficiency benefits; Energy balance models; Infrastructure systems; Natural gas combined cycles; Combined cycle power plants; carbon monoxide; methane; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; natural gas; building; carbon emission; combined heat and power; cooling; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; natural gas; air pollutant; Article; boiler; building; climate; combustion; comparative study; cooling; desulfurization; electricity; energy balance; energy resource; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; heating; particulate matter; storage; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; heat; motivation; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Goals; Greenhouse Effect; Hot Temperature; Natural Gas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111234016

The inhalation of traffic-related air pollution, including NO2, can cause a range of problems to human health. Due to their developing organs, children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution inhalation. Accordingly, schools and associated travel behaviours present an important area of study for the reduction of child exposure to these harmful pollutants. COVID-19 reached the UK in late January 2020. On the 23rd of March that year, the UK government announced a nationwide stay-at-home order, or lockdown, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside of their own homes. The lockdown was accompanied by the closure of schools, public facilities, amenities, businesses and places of worship. The current study aims to assess the significance of nationwide NO2 reductions at schools in England as a consequence of the lockdown in order to highlight the benefits of associated behavioural changes within the context of schools in England and potential child exposure. NO2 data were collected from all AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) monitoring sites within 500 m of nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges in England. A significant reduction of mean NO2 concentrations was observed in the first month of the UK lockdown at background (−35.13%) and traffic (−40.82%) sites. Whilst lockdown restrictions are undoubtedly unsustainable, the study results demonstrate the possible reductions of NO2 at schools in England and potential reductions of child exposure that are achievable when public behaviours shift towards active travel, work from home policies and generally lower use of polluting vehicles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; England; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide; NO2; Schools","Air pollution; Fossil fuels; Reduction; Roads and streets; Urban growth; Urban transportation; COVID-19; England; Fossil fuel combustion; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxides; NO $-2$; Pollution reduction; Road traffic; Traffic-related air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; health risk; LOCKDOWN; nitrogen dioxide; source apportionment; traffic emission; air monitoring; Article; behavior change; child exposure; college; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; England; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; government regulation; high school; home quarantine; lockdown; management; meteorology; motor vehicle; nursery; policy; primary school; school; time series analysis; traffic; traffic management system; travel restriction; United Kingdom; work from home; air pollutant; air pollution; child; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; school; United Kingdom; England; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; England; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Schools; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103236017

This paper illustrates the use of coupled systems in assessments of subnational climate solutions with a case study of Georgia, a state located in the southeastern United States that does not have statewide climate goals or plans. The paper illustrates how robust place-specific plans for climate action could be derived from foundational global and national work and by embedding that research into the context of socio-ecological-technological systems. Our replicable methodology advances the traditional additive sectoral wedge analysis of carbon abatement potential by incorporating solution interdependencies and by spanning both carbon sources and sinks. We estimate that a system of 20 solutions could cut Georgia's carbon footprint by 35% in 2030 relative to a business-as-usual forecast and by 50% relative to Georgia's emissions in 2005. We also produce a carbon abatement cost curve that aligns private and social costs as well as benefits with units of avoided CO2-e. The solutions are affiliated with various social cocosts and co-benefits that highlight societal concerns extending beyond climate impacts, including public health, environmental quality, employment, and equity. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

In conjunction with their allied trade associations, these coalitions have served as a central coordination mechanism in efforts opposed to mandatory limits on carbon emissions. These coalitions pool resources from a large number of corporations and execute sophisticated political and cultural campaigns designed to oppose efforts to address climate change. Through an analysis of twelve prominent CCCM coalitions from 1989 to 2015, I show that over 2,000 organizations were members of these coalitions and that a core of 179 organizations belonged to multiple coalitions. Organizations from the coal and electrical utility sectors were the most numerous and influential organizations in these coalitions.

This paper explores the use of an urban building energy model (UBEM) to examine the potential for creating a near-zero carbon neighbourhood in Dublin (Ireland) that is characterised by diverse land-uses and old and new building stock. UBEMs are a relatively new tool that allows the simulation of building energy demand across an urbanised landscape and can account for building layout, including the effects of overshadowing and the potential for facade retrofits and energy generation. In this research, a novel geographic database of buildings is created using archetypes, and the associated information on dimensions, fabric and energy systems is integrated into the Urban Modelling Interface (UMI). The model is used to simulate current and future energy demand based on climate change projections and to test scenarios that apply retrofits to the existing stock and that link proximate land-uses and land-covers. The latter allows a significant decoupling of the neighbourhood from an offsite electricity generation station with a high carbon output. The findings of this paper demonstrate that treating neighbourhoods as single energy entities rather than collections of individual sectors allows the development of bespoke carbon reducing scenarios that are geographically situated. The work shows the value of a neighbourhood-based approach to energy management using UBEMs. © 2021 by the authors.

Plant species suitable for air quality improvement were selected based on their air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index (API). Results showed a significant difference according to the accumulation of sPM and wPM and the plant species. PM accumulation and APTI showed a positive correlation. Pinus strobus showed the highest PM accumulation and APTI values, while Cercis chinensis showed the lowest. In 11 plants, API was divided into five groups.

Within New Zealand, research on climate change mitigation and environmental impacts of buildings has received renewed attention. However, there has been no detailed investigation of zero carbon building practices. This paper undertakes an exploratory study through the use of semi-structured interviews with government representatives and construction industry experts to examine how the New Zealand construction industry plans and implements zero carbon buildings. The results show that New Zealand’s construction industry is in the early stage of transiting to a net-zero carbon built environment. Key actions to date are focused on devising a way for the industry to develop and deliver zero carbon building projects. Central and local governments play a leading role in driving zero carbon initiatives. Leading construction firms intend to maximise the carbon reduction in building projects by developing a roadmap to achieve the carbon target by 2050 and rethinking the way of designing and constructing buildings.

The increasing need to reduce the climate-damaging exhaust gases in the automotive industry leads to an increasing usage of electric powered drive systems using Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. For the safety and crashworthiness investigations, a deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior under high and dynamic loads is needed. In order to prevent internal short circuits and thermal runaways within a Li-ion battery, the separator plays a crucial role. Based on results of material tests, a novel material model for finite element analysis (FEA) is developed using the explicit solver Altair Radioss. Based on this model, the visco-elastic-orthotropic, as well as the visco-plastic-orthotropic, behavior until failure can be modeled. Finally, a FE simulation model of the separator material is performed, using the results of different tensile tests conducted at three different velocities, 0.1 mm s-1, 1.0 mm s-1 and 10.0 mm s-1 and different orientations of the specimen. The purpose is to predict the anisotropic, rate-dependent stiffness behavior of separator materials in order to improve FE simulations of the mechanical behavior of batteries and therefore reduce the development time of electrically powered vehicles and consumer goods. The present novel material model in combination with a well-suited failure criterion, which considers the different states of stress and anisotropic-visco-dependent failure limits, can be applied for crashworthiness FE analysis. The model succeeded in predicting anisotropic, visco-elastic orthotropic and visco-plastic orthotropic stiffness behavior up to failure. © 2021 by the authors.","Crashworthiness; Elasto-plasticity; Finite element model; Material model; Orthotropy; Polyethylene separator; Safety; Visco-elasticity; Visco-plasticity","Anisotropy; Consumer behavior; Crashworthiness; Dynamic loads; Exhaust gases; Ions; Separators; Stiffness; Tensile testing; Dependent failure; Development time; Material modeling; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical loads; Separator material; Thermal runaways; Viscous behaviors; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112289401

Photothermal CO2 catalysis is one approach to achieve this, but improved materials that can more efficiently harvest and use solar energy are needed. Here, we report a supra-photothermal catalyst architecture—inspired by the greenhouse effect—that boosts the performance of a catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation compared to traditional photothermal catalyst designs. The catalyst consists of a nanoporous-silica-encapsulated nickel nanocrystal (Ni@p-SiO2), which is active for methanation and reverse water–gas shift reactions. Under illumination, the local temperatures achieved by Ni@p-SiO2 exceed those of Ni-based catalysts without the SiO2 shell. We suggest that the heat insulation and infrared shielding effects of the SiO2 sheath confine the photothermal energy of the nickel core, enabling a supra-photothermal effect. Catalyst sintering and coking is also lessened in Ni@p-SiO2, which may be due to spatial confinement effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Hydrogenation; Nickel; Silica; Silicon; Sintering; Solar energy; CO2 hydrogenation; Gas shift reaction; Infrared shielding; Local temperature; Nanoporous silica; Nickel nanocrystals; Photothermal effects; Spatial confinement; Nickel compounds; carbon dioxide; catalysis; catalyst; detection method; fossil fuel; insulation; perforation; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111639348

We assessed the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia in monoculture. Samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons in the 0-to 0.10-and 0.10-to 0.20-m soil layers at 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 m in a perpendicular gradient from tree legume rows. The following responses were determined: δ13C and δ15N, C and N, microbial activity and biomass, and metabolic, microbial, and mineralization quotient. δ13C and δ15N varied with the distance from the trees. In the dry season and beginning of the rainy season, the cropping systems showed similar values for C, N, microbial activity, carbon, and nitrogen in the microbial biomass. The presence of tree legumes at the end of the rainy season favored soil microbiota, which showed a reduced loss of C-CO2, with no indication of metabolic stress and greater microbial biomass and microbial quotient in relation to forage cactus in monoculture. © 2021 by the authors.

Its implementation implies a spatial distribution plan for air quality monitoring sites, especially in populated cities where high emissions of air pollutants with anthropogenic origin are observed. Therefore, the present study aimed: (i) to propose the spatial distribution of air quality monitoring sites in the city of Luanda (capital of Angola); and (ii) to determine the PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO concentrations at two monitoring sites (Avenida Deolinda Rodrigues, ADR, and Condomínio Vale do Talatona, CVT), during four weeks for each site. Due to the absence of national legislation, air quality measurements were then compared to the limits defined by the European Union through Directive, 2008/50/EC. At ADR site, the average concentrations for PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 exceeded the limits recommended for human health. At CVT site, CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations were lower than the values measured at ADR site, due to the relative location of important fixed air pollutant emission sources: airport, thermoelectric plants, refinery, cement plants and the Port of Luanda. The weekend effect was also assessed at both sites. At ADR site, NO2, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were higher at weekends than on weekdays. At CVT site, NO2, SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were higher on weekdays compared to weekends.

It is important for urban transportation planning and finding CO2 footprint for individuals. However, daily usage of these applications are limited due to the power consumption of mobile devices. By the wide spread usage of wearable sensors, it will be crucial to develop systems that have smaller model size and less computational complexity. This paper presents a novel system that exploits n-grams which are widely used in natural language processing for extracting features of mobile sensor signals. This is the first study at the literature that provides smaller and faster activity recognition models by using n-grams. Our results demonstrate that, feature extraction with n-grams is less complex and creates 4 times smaller models even though its accuracy is comparable with classical methods. In addition, if n-gram based features and some of traditional features are combined, accuracy of the model achieves 89% which outperforms the research that use shallow machine learning approaches. Although this study focused on transport mode detection, we believe that n-gram based features could be used for several signal classification tasks. © 2021 IEEE.","Energy-efficiency; N-grams; Smart phones; Time domain features; Transport mode detection","Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Smartphones; Urban transportation; Wearable sensors; Activity recognition; Constrained devices; Detection models; Energy-constrained; Mode detection; N-grams; Smart phones; Time domain features; Transport mode detection; Transport modes; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116682090

Methods We estimated ambient air pollution exposure for respiratory cases through inverse distance-weighted averages of air monitoring stations based on their residential address and averaged at the city level. We used generalised additive models to quantify city-specific associations in 11 cities in Shanxi and a meta-analysis to estimate the overall effects. We further estimated respiratory burden attributable to PM 2.5 using the standards of WHO (25 μg/m 3) and China (75 μg/m 3) as reference. Results Each 10 μg/m 3 increase in lag 03 PM 2.5 corresponded to 0.53% (95% CI: 0.33% to 0.73%) increase in respiratory hospitalisation, an increment of 3.75 thousand RMB (95% CI: 1.84 to 5.670) in hospital cost and 4.13 days (95% CI: 2.51 to 5.75) in length of hospital stay. About 9.7 thousand respiratory hospitalisations, 132 million RMB in hospital cost and 145 thousand days of hospital stay could be attributable to PM 2.5 exposures using WHO's guideline as reference. We estimated that 193 RMB (95% CI: 95 to 292) in hospital cost and 0.21 days (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.30) in hospital stay could be potentially avoidable for an average respiratory case. Conclusion Significant respiratory burden could be attributable to PM 2.5 exposures in Shanxi Province, China. The results need to be factored into impact assessment of air pollution policies to provide a more complete indication of the burden addressed by the policies. ©","clinical epidemiology; respiratory measurement","air monitoring; air pollution; Article; China; disease burden; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; hospital cost; hospitalization; human; length of stay; major clinical study; particulate matter 2.5; practice guideline; respiratory tract disease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107755944

Although we find a significant reduction in coal consumption associated with ETS participation, this reduction was achieved by reducing electricity production. The output contraction in the treated plants is not due to their optimizing behavior but is likely driven by government decisions, because the impacts of emission permits on marginal costs are small relative to the controlled electricity prices and the reduction is associated with financial losses. In addition, we find no evidence of carbon leakage to other provinces, but a significant increase in the production of non-coal-fired power plants in the ETS regions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon market; Electricity generation; Emission trading; Power plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110088346

Therefore, different distributed traffic is used in the source domain and the target domain to establish a cross-domain network abnormal traffic detection system. We propose a transfer learning method based on frameworks and shared adaptive methods. At the same time, since the State Council issued the “Air Pollution Control and Management Action Plan,” it has been stipulated that urban emergency management should include heavily polluted weather. Therefore, it has become more and more important to improve the ability to respond to severely polluted weather emergencies, and governments at all levels have given more attention. Corresponding measures have formed mechanisms for factors that affect heavy weather pollution. In competitive sports, the theoretical application of big data and related research dominate. Experts and scientists at home and abroad combine big data with sports training to promote the innovative development of competitive sports and solve existing technical problems. We are working hard to break through the level of competition. With the rapid development of productivity, people have clear strength training to counter external resistance for various purposes. Among them, the development of skeletal muscle performance is one of the important requirements of strength training. Strength training is the core part of sports training, and load regulation is the key element of strength training. Improving the “dose load” is even more important. Through the research of abnormal flow detection, this paper applies it to the analysis of the formation mechanism of heavy pollution weather and the impact of big data sports training, thereby promoting the improvement of heavy pollution weather and the enhancement of sports training. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Abnormal flow detection; Big data; Formation mechanism; Heavy pollution weather; Sports training","data set; detection method; formation mechanism; machine learning",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111598783

Study Focus: We use a large-scale hydrological and nutrient transport model (E-HYPE) to model basin-wide impacts of measure scenarios on the Baltic Sea, where eutrophication is a critical issue for the marine ecosystem. We constructed measure scenarios based on stakeholder acceptance, established in workshops in different regions around the Baltic. These measures include local stream reach to catchment scale measures aiming to reduce nutrient transport into the stream network (buffer strips, stormwater ponds) and measures aiming to reduce regional nutrient source releases (fertiliser leaching rates, rural household emissions). New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Nutrient load reductions are often needed to reduce eutrophication and improve overall surface water quality in fresh-water and enclosed bays and seas, where dilution is limited and load emissions have long residence times. To reduce riverine nutrient loads, remediation measures are necessary, e.g. establishment of buffer strips or improved wastewater treatment. Such measures are, however, typically not designed to target nutrient load reductions at sea outlets, but rather focus on local improvements. Here, we show that measures, notwithstanding other meliorating ecosystem benefits, must include reductions in load emissions across large basin areas to impact integrated net loads into coastal sea basins, because reduction measures that only target nutrient delivery to the stream network typically cannot be implemented in a significant enough proportion of the total drainage area of large coastal river basins. Our impact scenarios show BSDB-wide nutrient reductions of up to 9 % for nitrogen and phosphorus compared to a reference scenario, if load emissions are reduced in the scenario assumptions. © 2021","Baltic Sea; E-HYPE; Hydrological modelling; Nutrient load reduction; Scenario impacts; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111050176

In 2017, the country accounted for 26% of global carbon emissions, stemming mostly from coal-based electricity generation and mining. The United States, by comparison, accounted for nearly 14%, and the European Union, almost 10%. In view of this disparity and the significance of China's contribution to achieving global emissions targets and sustainability, we revisit its First NDC. We argue that, while China is set to meet its non-fossil fuel targets, progress on its fossil fuel targets is stymied by continual coal development, which has negative implications for the Paris 2 °C limit. We contend that the country's focus on carbon-intensive economic expansion is a major barrier to greater climate ambition, especially when considering its growing portfolio of overseas investments in fossil fuel-dependent sectors.

The United States and Canada are responsible for one-sixth of global greenhouse gas emissions but hold extensive natural ecosystems that store globally significant above- and below-ground carbon. Canada has initiated a process of protected area network expansion in concert with efforts at reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledged nature-based solutions as a key aspect of climate change mitigation. The US, although not a party to global biodiversity conventions, has recently committed to protecting 30% of its extent by 2030 and achieving the UNFCCC Paris Agreement's mitigation targets. The opportunities afforded by these dual biodiversity conservation and climate commitments require coordinated national and regional policies to ensure that new protected areas maximize biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation opportunities. We address how global commitments can best inform national policy initiatives which build on existing agency mandates for regional planning and species conservation. Previous analyses of global conservation priorities under climate change have been tenuously linked to policy contexts of individual nations and have lacked information on refugia due to limitations of globally available datasets. Comparison and synthesis of predictions from a range of recently developed refugia metrics allow such data to inform planning despite substantial uncertainty arising from contrasting model assumptions and inputs. A case study for endangered species planning for old-forest-associated species in the US Pacific Northwest demonstrates how regional planning can be nested hierarchically within national biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation strategies which integrate refugia, connectivity, and ecosystem carbon metrics to holistically evaluate the role of different land designations and where carbon mitigation and protection of biodiversity's resilience to climate change can be aligned. © 2021 The Authors.

Of particular interest are ‘clean growth’ ENGOs that have emerged as key proponents of business-friendly approaches to the climate crisis. We find that the ENGOs receiving large grants tend to be conservationist while the think tanks tend to be conservative. Communities in the network are divided between several clusters of corporate and family foundations supporting conservative think tanks, clean growth ENGOs and conservationist ENGOs, and a segment of the network in which one municipal and several family foundations, support more social-ecological organizations, thereby facilitating more transformative visions and policies.

Their applications are diverse and include use in coatings on selflubricating systems for anti-wear situations, thin films deposited on prosthetic elements, catalysis structures, or water remediation devices. From these applications, the ones that require the most careful testing and improvement are biomedical applications. The biocompatibility and antibacterial issues of medical devices remain a concern, as several prostheses still fail after several years of implantation and biofilm formation remains a real risk to the success of a device. Sputtered deposition prevents the introduction of hazardous chemical elements during the preparation of coatings, and this technique is environmentally friendly. In addition, the mechanical properties of C-based coatings are remarkable. In this paper, the latest advances in sputtering methods and biocompatibility and antibacterial action for diamond-based carbon (DLC)-based coatings are reviewed and the greater outlook is then discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Molecular catalysts have served as models to understand its mechanism, in particular the O–O bond-forming reaction, which is still not fully understood. Here we report a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex that serves as a ‘missing link’ for the species that form after the rate-determining O–O bond-forming step. The Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex (η2-1iv–OO) is generated from the isolated Ru(iv) oxo complex (1iv=O) in the presence of an excess of oxidant. The oxidation (iv) and spin state (singlet) of η2-1iv–OO were determined by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. 18O- and 2H-labelling studies evidence the direct evolution of O2 through the nucleophilic attack of a H2O molecule on the highly electrophilic metal–oxo species via the formation of η2-1iv–OO. These studies demonstrate water nucleophilic attack as a viable mechanism for O–O bond formation, as previously proposed based on indirect evidence.

The advent of the smart grid paradigm has introduced the usage of heating load forecasting tools in DHNs. They provide estimates of future heating load, improving the planning of heat production and power station maintenance. In this article, we propose a methodology based on the integrated use of regularized regression and clustering for generating predictive models of future heating load in DHNs. The methodology is tested on a real case study based on a dataset provided by AGSM, an Italian utility company that manages a DHN in the city of Verona, Italy. We generate a set of multiple-equation models having different degrees of complexity and show that models generated by the proposed approach outperform those trained by standard methods. Moreover, we provide an interpretation of patterns encoded by these models, and show that they identify real operational states of the network.

However, while their effectiveness is well established for wet tropics, it is often argued that R&A are less advantageous or even detrimental at higher latitudes, where the reduction of forest albedo (the amount of reflected solar radiation by a surface) tends to nullify or even overcome the carbon benefits. Here, we carefully analyze the situation for R&A at midlatitudes, where the warming effects due to vegetation albedo are regarded to be almost balanced by the cooling effects from an increased carbon storage. Using both satellite data and atmospheric boundary-layer models, we show that by including cloud–albedo effects due to land–atmosphere interactions, the R&A cooling at midlatitudes becomes prevalent. This points to a much greater potential of R&A for wet temperate regions than previously considered. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Given the departure times and the departure and arrival locations of several commercial flights, the relevant weather forecast, and the expected fuel savings during formation flight, the problem consists in establishing how to organize them in formation or solo flights and in finding the trajectories that minimize the overall direct operating cost of the flights. Each aircraft can fly solo or in different positions inside a formation. Therefore, the mission is modeled as a switched dynamical system, in which the discrete state describes the combination of flight modes of the individual aircraft and logical constraints in disjunctive form establish the switching logic among the discrete states of the system. The formation mission design problem has been formulated as an optimal control problem of a switched dynamical system and solved using an embedding approach, which allows switching decision among discrete states to be modeled without relying on binary variables. The resulting problem is a classical optimal control problem which has been solved using a knotting pseudospectral method. Several numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The obtained results show that formation flight has great potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Commercial aircraft; embedding approach; formation flight; formation mission design; knotting pseudospectral method; logical constraints; optimal control; switched systems","Air transportation; Aircraft; Dynamical systems; Fuel economy; Numerical methods; Weather forecasting; Commercial aircraft; Direct operating costs; Logical constraints; Numerical experiments; Optimal control problem; Optimal control technique; Pseudospectral methods; Switched dynamical systems; Optimal control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101732678

However, difficulties have frequently remained in determining the exact origin of natural gas samples derived from microbial activity, thermal degradation of organic matter (e.g. thermogenic gas), and mixtures of both components. To further refine this approach, we represent the carbon isotope difference between methane and ethane, or Δ13CC1–C2, plotted versus the individual δ13C values of methane and ethane as a new graphical tool for a refined assessment of natural gas origins and their mixtures. In addition, a new mathematical notation using the δ13C values of methane and ethane is also proposed for discrimination of the origin of natural gas samples. This parameter has been termed isotope factor O(C1/C2) and is defined as the ratio [(δ13CC1*1000)/(δ13CC2)3]. When this factor is represented against the δ13C values of methane and ethane, an improved distinction between primary microbial and thermogenic gases is achieved. Our study does not propose mechanisms for microbial generation of ethane, but the data suggest that the isotopic composition of ethane should be taken into account for the characterization of the origin of natural gas samples from shallow subsurface environments. For primary microbial and thermogenic gases with similar δ13C values of methane, the primary microbial gas will be characterized by lower O(C1/C2) values (&lt;1.5) compared to the thermogenic gas (&gt;2), and will have a Δ13CC1–C2 value 10–20‰ more positive than that of thermogenic gas. Gas mixtures have intermediate O(C1/C2) and Δ13CC1–C2 values and are graphically identifiable using the here presented classification tools. The effectiveness of the new graphical tools is demonstrated using natural gas samples from Canadian groundwater wells, low-permeability petroleum reservoirs (including coalbed methane plays) in Canada and the USA, Quaternary primary microbial gas accumulations in China, and secondary microbial gases from Northern Africa and China. © 2021","Carbon isotopes; Ethane; Methane; Microbial; Thermogenic","Carbon; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Ethane; Gas mixtures; Gasoline; Groundwater; Isotopes; Low permeability reservoirs; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Underground reservoirs; $+13$/C; C values; Carbon isotopes; Gas samples; Microbial; Origin of natural gas; Shallow subsurface; Subsurface environment; Thermogenic; Thermogenic gas; Methane; carbon isotope; coalbed methane; groundwater resource; isotopic composition; microbial community; natural gas; organic matter; Quaternary; subsurface flow; Africa; Canada; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110308772

Although global surveys are starting to reveal ecological drivers underlying planktonic community structure and predicted climate change responses, it is unclear how community-scale species interactions will be affected by climate change. Here, we leveraged Tara Oceans sampling to infer a global ocean cross-domain plankton co-occurrence network-the community interactome-and used niche modeling to assess its vulnerabilities to environmental change. Globally, this revealed a plankton interactome self-organized latitudinally into marine biomes (Trades, Westerlies, Polar) and more connected poleward. Integrated niche modeling revealed biome-specific community interactome responses to environmental change and forecasted the most affected lineages for each community. These results provide baseline approaches to assess community structure and organismal interactions under climate scenarios while identifying plausible plankton bioindicators for ocean monitoring of climate change. © 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite such forays, all aspects of knowledge production within the IPCC still echo the aspirations of nation states and quantitative models of attribution and detection. Climate knowledge production in the Himalayan region reflects this reality. In this essay, we focus on our personal experiences with local communities from the Himalayas and bring it in dialogue with our experiences with the IPCC knowledge production process. In doing so, we have two objectives: first, to highlight marginalized stories of climate-society relationships that challenge normative climate science/policy and, second, in light of these stories, suggest some salient considerations required to foreground justice and equity in futureengagements with the IPCC, which explores the production of democratic knowledge and how such knowledge can be wielded to achieve regional climate justice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate adaptation; Climate justice; Climate knowledges; Himalayas","Climate justices; Climate science; Critical reflections; Knowledge production; Local community; Quantitative models; Regional climate; Western science; Behavioral research; adaptive management; environmental justice; indigenous knowledge; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; knowledge; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113714932

Wetland ecosystem services, ranging from provision of food security to climate change mitigation, are enormous, far out-weighing those of dryland ecosystems per hectare. However, land use change and water regulation infrastructure have reduced connectivity in many river systems and with floodplain and estuarine wetlands. Mangrove forests are critical communities for carbon uptake and storage, pollution control and detoxification, and regulation of natural hazards. Although the clearing of mangroves in Australia is strictly regulated, Great Barrier Reef catchments have suffered landscape modifications and hydrological alterations that can kill mangroves. We used remote sensing datasets to investi-gate land cover change and both intra-and inter-annual seasonality in mangrove forests in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, which encompasses a national park and Ramsar Wetland, and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. We built a time series using spectral, auxiliary, and phenology variables with Landsat surface reflectance products, accessed in Google Earth Engine. Two land cover classes were generated (mangrove versus non-mangrove) in a Random Forest classification. Mangroves decreased by 1480 hectares (−2.31%) from 2009 to 2019. The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2008–2010 and 2018–2020 land cover maps were 95% and 95%, respectively. Using an NDVI-based time series we examined intra-and inter-annual seasonality with linear and harmonic regression models, and second with TIMESAT metrics of mangrove forests in three sections of our study region. Our findings suggest a relationship between mangrove growth phenology along with precipitation anomalies and severe tropical cyclone occurrence over the time series. The detection of responses to extreme events is important to improve understanding of the connections between climate, extreme weather events, and biodiversity in estuarine and mangrove ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

This includes growing interest in “blue carbon” and the emerging narrative of the ocean as a “solution” to climate change, and drawing attention to climate impacts on ocean ecosystems and marine biodiversity. It highlights the roles played in constructing this link by entrepreneurial states and the NGO community in building an ocean-climate bandwagon with the existing processes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

When RTA temperature was increased, defect concentration at a-Si/c-Si interface gradually disappeared. For CO2 laser annealing, defects were found to aggregate at the end of range (EOR) region. Sheet resistance (Rs) values decreased significantly with increasing RTA temperature due to defects disappearing at EOR. Rs did not change appreciably for the CO2 laser annealing case. The dopant activation ratio was less than 50% below RTA temperature of 850 °C, and it increased to 70% at 950 °C. For CO2 laser annealing, the activation ratio could reach to over 80% regardless of the laser power. The highest active concentration and the lowest resistivity or mobility were found to be within the top 20 nm region of the surface. Although RTA annealing conditions influenced dopant diffusion and the resulting electrical property depth profiles significantly, depth profiles did not change much with changes in CO2 laser power level.

Recently, several gridded forest AGB products have been produced for China by integrating remote sensing data and field measurements, yet significant discrepancies remain among these products in their estimated AGB carbon, varying from 5.04 to 9.81 Pg C. To reduce this uncertainty, here, we first compiled independent, high-quality field measurements of AGB using a systematic and consistent protocol across China from 2011 to 2015. We applied two different approaches, an optimal weighting technique (WT) and a random forest regression method (RF), to develop two observationally constrained hybrid forest AGB products in China by integrating five existing AGB products. The WT method uses a linear combination of the five existing AGB products with weightings that minimize biases with respect to the field measurements, and the RF method uses decision trees to predict a hybrid AGB map by minimizing the bias and variance with respect to the field measurements. The forest AGB stock in China was 7.73 Pg C for the WT estimates and 8.13 Pg C for the RF estimates. Evaluation with the field measurements showed that the two hybrid AGB products had a lower RMSE (29.6 and 24.3 Mg/ha) and bias (−4.6 and −3.8 Mg/ha) than all five participating AGB datasets. Our study demonstrated both the WT and RF methods can be used to harmonize existing AGB maps with field measurements to improve the spatial variability and reduce the uncertainty of carbon stocks. The new spatial AGB maps of China can be used to improve estimates of carbon emissions and removals at the national and subnational scales. © 2021 by the authors.

Two climate change scenarios were employed to predict stream-flow and temperature: RCP 8.5, the most pessimistic with regards to climate change, and RCP 4.5, a more optimistic scenario where greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2040. Two periods, 2018–2050 and 2051–2100, were also evaluated. In Canada, a number of modelling studies have shown that many regions will likely be faced with higher winter flow and lower summer flows. The CEQUEAU hydrological and water temperature model was calibrated and validated for the Wilmot River, Canada, using historic data for flow and temperature. Total annual precipitation in the region was found to remain stable under RCP 4.5 and increase over time under RCP 8.5. Median stream flow was expected to increase over present levels in the low flow months of August and September. However, increased climate variability led to higher numbers of periodic extreme low flow events and little change to the frequency of extreme high flow events. The effective increase in water temperature was four-fold greater in winter with an approximate mean difference of 4◦ C, while the change was only 1◦ C in summer. Overall implications for native coldwater fishes and water abstraction are not severe, except for the potential for more variability, and hence periodic extreme low flow/high temperature events. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the photoexcited electrons and holes have huge Coulombic attraction and high exciton binding energy due to the weak screening effect and dielectric properties in many low-dimensional conjugated polymers, such as carbon nitride. Reducing the exciton binding energy of carbon nitride and promoting the conversion of excitons into free charge carriers are necessary for improving the activity of photocatalytic reactions but still very challenging. Here, by introducing amino-cyano functional groups into carbon nitride, it is demonstrated that excitons can be effectively dissociated into electrons and holes by finely controlling the charge distribution of heptazine ring. It is found that carbon nitride with heptazine rings of positive charge distribution can greatly reduce the exciton binding energy to 24 from 71 meV. Compared with heptazine ring having negative charge distribution, heptazine ring with positive charge distribution can increase photocatalytic hydrogen production of carbon nitride by up to ten times. This work provides an easy way to promote the dissociation of excitons in carbon nitride by regulating the charge distribution. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon nitride; exciton binding energy; exciton dissociation; photocatalysis","Binding energy; Carrier mobility; Charge distribution; Conjugated polymers; Dielectric properties; Dissociation; Excitons; Hydrogen production; Photocatalytic activity; Semiconductor quantum wells; Coulombic attractions; Exciton-binding energy; Free charge carriers; Local charge distributions; Photocatalytic hydrogen production; Photocatalytic reactions; Photoexcited electrons; Positive charge distribution; Carbon nitride; cyanogen; nitrile; polymer; electron; oxidation reduction reaction; Electrons; Nitriles; Oxidation-Reduction; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108996678

Further development of Pt-Ni catalysts requires mechanistic insights into the catalytic system. Herein, a mechanistic study of DRM over Pt-Ni supported on cerium oxide catalysts (i.e., Pt-Ni@CeO2) was performed using in situ coupled diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (DRIFTS-MS). Specifically, a comparative study of DRM over Pt-Ni@CeO2 and control materials under continuous temperature ramping, isothermal steady-state and fast cycling transient conditions was conducted to gain information on the key surface active intermediates. As compared with the Ni@CeO2 monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic Pt-Ni@CeO2 catalyst showed significantly enhanced performance regarding activity, H2/CO ratio and long-term stability. In situ DRIFTS measurements revealed that CH4 decomposition on the surface of monometallic Ni phases readily caused serious coke deposition and deactivation. Conversely, the Pt phase in the bimetallic catalyst could improve CO2 dissociation, thus producing adsorbed oxygen species, which are beneficial for oxidising surface carbon species (derived from CH4 decomposition) to reduce coke formation. Meanwhile, the existence of Pt sites in the bimetallic catalyst could significantly improve metal dispersion, and thus facilitate the decomposition of CH4. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binary alloys; Catalysts; Catalytic reforming; Cerium oxide; Coke; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mass spectrometry; Mechanics; Methane; Platinum metals; Bimetallic catalysts; Comparative studies; Continuous temperature; Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies; Dry reforming-of-methane; Long term stability; Monometallic catalysts; Transient conditions; Nickel metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112365952

Nonetheless, the distribution patterns and environmental drivers of soil nematode communities are poorly understood, especially at the large scale, where multiple environmental variables covary. We collected 520 soil samples from 104 sites representing alpine meadow and steppe ecosystems. First, we explored the soil nematode community characteristics and compared community patterns between the ecosystems. Then, we examined the contributions of aboveground and belowground factors on these patterns. The genus richness and abundance of nematodes on the Tibetan Plateau are lower than other alpine ecosystems, but are comparable to desert or polar ecosystems. Alpine meadows supported a higher nematode abundance and genus richness than alpine steppes; bacterial-based energy channels were pre-dominant in both the ecosystems. Soil factors explained the most variation in the soil nematode community composition in the alpine meadows, while plant factors were as essential as soil factors in the alpine steppes. Unexpectedly, the climate variables barely impacted the nematode communities. This is the first study to explore the spatial patterns of soil nematode compositions on the Tibetan Plateau, and we found that the contributions of climate, plants, and soil properties on soil nematodes community were essentially different from the previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities. © 2021 by the authors.

To address the subjective contrived factors and errors in the gross domestic product (GDP) data in traditional statistical almanacs, our study aims to construct a panel data model of 287 prefecture-level cities for the period from 1998–2016 (using objective nighttime light data). We also used government work report words related to environmental regulation to characterize the constraints of government environmental regulations. For this purpose, we used instrumental variables (to explore the relationship and interaction between air pollution and economic growth) and a model setting, with which we carried out regression analysis and robustness tests; the findings were validated using a transmission mechanism hypothesis. We found that that economic growth and air pollution positively influence each other and government environmental regulations significantly reduce air pollution. We also found that to achieve high economic development, environmental pollution must be controlled to avoid further damage to human and material capital. Furthermore, government environmental regulations can help improve the environmental comfort level and economic development quality. © 2021 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Nighttime light data; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114215935

The current coarse spatial-temporal resolutions of SIF data from satellite missions and ground measurements still cannot satisfy the corroboration of its correlation with photosynthesis and carbon flux. Practical approaches are needed to be explored for the supplementation of the SIF measurements. In our study, we clarified the diurnal variations of leaf and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence for a subtropical evergreen coniferous forest and evaluated the performance of the canopy chlorophyll concentration (CCC) approach and the backward approach from gross primary production (GPP) for estimating the diurnal variations of canopy SIF by comparing with the Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model. The results showed that the canopy SIF had similar seasonal and diurnal variations with the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above the canopy, while the leaf steady-state fluorescence remained stable during the daytime. Neither the CCC nor the raw backward approach from GPP could capture the short temporal dynamics of canopy SIF. However, after improving the backward approach with a correction factor of normalized PAR incident on leaves, the variation of the estimated canopy SIF accounted for more than half of the diurnal variations in the canopy SIF (SIF687: R2 = 0.53, p &lt; 0.001; SIF760: R2 = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001) for the subtropical evergreen coniferous forest without water stress. Drought interfered with the utilization of the improved backward approach because of the decoupling of SIF and GPP due to stomatal closure. This new approach offers new insight into the estimation of diurnal canopy SIF and can help understand the photosynthesis of vegetation for future climate change studies. © 2021 by the authors.

As one of the largest contributors to global CO2 emissions, the construction industry plays a significant role in combating global warming and achieving sustainable development. This study aimed to compare the CO2 emissions in the construction industry around the world and analyze the drivers of the differences in construction emission intensities between regions in 2009 using the multiregional input–output model and structural decomposition analysis model, respectively. The results show that China, India, the USA, Russia, and Japan were the largest five construction CO2 emitters. The above five regions, especially China and Russia, had much greater construction emission intensities than the UK, which had the smallest intensity. The findings also demonstrate that the production structure effect was the largest driver enlarging the intensity differences between China and the UK, between India and the UK, between Russia and the UK, and between Japan and the UK, contributing 93.1%, 96.6%, 65.6%, and 85.3% of the differences, respectively. The energy intensity effect dominated the emission intensity difference between the USA and the UK, representing 101.6% of the difference. The top three contributors to the above effects were domestic industries except the production structure effect on the difference between Japan and the UK. This study can help policymakers better understand the disparities of CO2 emissions in the construction industry around the world and thus formulate effective policies to mitigate the emissions. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbon emissions; construction industry; input–output analysis; international comparison; sustainable development","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; construction industry; global warming; input-output analysis; sustainable development; China; India; Japan; Russian Federation; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101428471

The lower level of PM2.5 (32.48 ± 11.03 µg/m3) observed during the control period compared to pre-control and post-control periods showed that PM2.5 was alleviated by control policies. Based on the mass concentrations of particulate components, the emissions of PM2.5 from local sources including fossil fuel, coal combustion, industry and construction were effectively reduced, but non-exhaust emission was not reduced as effectively as expected. The accumulation of SNA (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+) was observed during the control period, due to the favourable synoptic weather conditions for photochemical reactions and heterogeneous hydrolysis. Because of transboundary transport during the control period, air masses from remote areas contributed significantly to local PM2.5. Although, secondary organic carbon (OCsec) exhibited more sensitivity than primary organic carbon (OCpri) to control measures, and the increased nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) implied the regional transport of aged secondary aerosols to the study area. Overall, the results from various approaches revealed that local pollution sources were kept under control, indicating that the implementation of mitigation measures were helpful in improving the air quality of Hangzhou during G20 summit. To reduce ambient levels of PM2.5 further in Hangzhou, regional control policies may have to be taken so as to reduce the impact of long-range transport of air masses from inland China.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration has a vital role to reduce the dramatic toll of air pollution on health. Due to the non-linearity and complexity of air pollution process and the influence of multiple factors, such as meteorological conditions, human activities and other chemical components, traditional pollution-related models have challenges in dealing with PM2.5 modeling. Based on atmospheric domain knowledge, we proposed a novel and interpretable deep learning model (iDeepAir) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentration by incorporating traffic data, meteorological data and air quality data. We designed feature interaction module and temporal interaction module to simulate pollution chemical reaction process and temporal accumulated process respectively, which makes the model has better understood and improves prediction accuracy of PM2.5 concentration. Compared to the best comparison model, mean absolute error (MAE) and rooted mean squared error (RMSE) were improved by 20.1% and 14.4% in 24h respectively. Furthermore, with the embedded Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm, iDeepAir allows us to observe the spatial influence patterns of regional traffic emissions in a high-resolution way and evaluate the impact of traffic emissions on PM2.5 formation. Taking Shanghai as an example, we discover that although there are serious traffic emissions in some areas of Shanghai, they do not always directly aggravate air pollution, which is also affected by local buildings, meteorological conditions, and other human activities. These results show the spatial interpretability of our model and provide a quantitive decision-making basis for the government to control air pollution. © 2021 ACM.","Deep learning; PM2.5 concentration prediction; Spatial interpretability","Air pollution control; Air quality; Decision making; Mean square error; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Concentration prediction; Deep learning; Influence patterns; Interpretability; Meteorological condition; PM2.5 concentration; Pm2.5 concentration prediction; Spatial influences; Spatial interpretability; Traffic emissions; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120528107

Two indices—reduction range (C↓) and rate (C˅) of PM2.5 concentrations—are defined to evaluate the temporal variations of PM2.5. Results show that RF models are more accurate and perform better than multiple linear regression models, with R2 ranging from 0.861 to 0.936. Five out of nine urban morphological indicators have the most significant contribution to PM2.5 reduction. For each indicator, the nonlinear response relationship shows similar trends in general, despite of the difference at the higher pollution level. Building evenness index and water body area ratio have a similar response such that C↓ and C˅ sharply increase and tend to be stable when they reach at 0.05 and 8 %, respectively. With the increase in vegetated area ratio, the change of C↓ presents an inverted V-shape trend with the turning point of about 20 %; however, the change of C˅ greatly differs from the pollution level. A higher density of the low-rising buildings with one to three floors will lead to a small reduction rate but a greater reduction range of PM2.5.

It is not clear whether the lagged response of algae to reduced nutrients related to the utilization efficiency of algae to phosphorus (UEAP), and how UEAP could response to climate and water quality factors. Here we analyzed over 20 years monitoring data in two lakes with similar geology but different nutrient levels by using statistical and modeling methods. The aim was to reveal the impact of UEAP on lake algae dynamics and the driving factors of UEAP changes. The results showed that UEAP is one of the key factors affecting algae dynamics, the incorporation UEAP and its driving factors achieved greater modeling reliability. UEAP, Nitrogen phosphorus ratio (NPr) was the key driving factor in Dianchi Lake, while total nitrogen (TN) and air temperature (AT) were the key driving factors in Erhai Lake. The changes of nutrients and climate drove UEAP into the paralysis or sensitive phase depending on lake specific factors and conditions. This correlated to algae density dynamics, in particular to those characteristic of algae growth thresholds. The future trend of climate change will continue to promote the increase of UEAP in both lakes, but severer in Erhai Lake. The key finding here is of the value of a proxy index (UEAP) for phosphorus utilization was associated with the lagged response of algae to nutrient reduction. We demonstrated the related modeling procedures with two-function variable (UEAP) of both prediction and response can predict the trend of algae growth and determine the states of the lake ecosystem. Hence, the approaches are of great value for lake management policy making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Algal bloom; Climate change; Lake eutrophication; Phosphorus utilization efficiency; Water quality","Algae; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Eutrophication; Lakes; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Water quality; Algae growth; Algal blooms; Case-studies; Climate factors; Condition; Driving factors; Lake eutrophications; Linear dynamics; Phosphorus utilization efficiency; Phosphorus; nitrogen; phosphorus; algal bloom; climate change; eutrophication; lake ecosystem; nonlinearity; nutrient; phosphorus; water quality; air temperature; algal bloom; Article; China; climate; dynamics; eutrophication; lake ecosystem; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; nutrient; principal component analysis; priority journal; statistical analysis; water quality; China; Dianchi Lake; Erhai Lake; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103992298

Due to the distributed and seasonal heating demand, the decarbonisation of heating is more challenging, especially for countries that are cold in winters. Electrically powered heat pumps are considered as an attractive solution for decarbonising heating sector. Since grid-powered heat pumps may significantly increase the power demand of the grid, this paper considers using local renewable energy to provide power for heat pumps, which is known as the grid independent renewable heating system including photovoltaic, wind turbine, battery storage system and thermal energy storage. This paper investigates a complete renewable heating system (RHS) framework and sizing the components to decarbonise building heating. The relationship between the reduction of gas consumption and the requirement of battery storage system (BSS) under the corresponding installation capacity of renewable components is analysed with their technical requirements. Then, according to different investment plans, this paper uses the particle swarm optimisation algorithm for optimal sizing of each component in the RHS to find a solution to minimise CO2 emissions. The results verify that the RHS with optimal sizing can minimise CO2 emissions and reduce the operational cost of natural gas. This work provides a feasible solution of how to invest the RHS to replace the existing heating system based on gas boilers and CHPs. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Friedrich and Yu.","annual investment cost; building heating decarbonisation; integrated energy network; particle swarm optimisation; renewable heating system","Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Electric batteries; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Microgrids; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pumps; Attractive solutions; Battery storage system; Global climate changes; Installation capacities; Particle swarm optimisation algorithms; Renewable energies; Renewable heating; Technical requirement; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114292667

To develop strategy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of animal-based food supply chains, the common environmental hotspots among different types of food, the role of transport logistics and the consequence of end market need to be better understood. Life cycle assessment was adopted to model three types of animal-based food chains (beef, butter and salmon), with specific technologies, high spatial-resolution logistics and typical consumption patterns for three markets: local, regional (intra-European) and international. The results confirmed that the farm production stage usually had the greatest environmental impact, except when air transport was used for distribution. Potentially, the role of end market also can significantly influence the environmental impacts. To understand more, three improvement options were examined in detail with regard to hotspots for climate change: novel feed ingredients (farm production stage), sustainable aviation fuel (transport and logistics stage) and reduction of wasted food (consumption and end of life stage). Significant reduction was achieved in the salmon system by sustainable aviation fuel (64%) and novel feed (15%). Minimizing food waste drove the greatest reduction in the beef supply chain (23%) and the international butter supply chain can reduce 50% of GHG mission by adopting sustainable aviation fuel. Combined interventions could reduce GHG emission of animal-based food supply chains by 15% to 82%, depending on market, transport and food waste behaviour. The results show that eco-efficiency information of animal-based foods should include the full supply chain. The effective mitigation strategy to achieve the greatest reduction should not only consider the impacts on-farm, but also detail of the downstream impacts, such as food distribution network and consumption patterns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Animal-based food supply chain; Life cycle analysis; Spatial-resolution; Sustainability","Climate change; Commerce; Environmental impact; Food supply; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Image resolution; Life cycle; Supply chains; Sustainable development; % reductions; Animal-based food supply chain; Aviation fuel; Consumption patterns; End markets; Food supply chain; Hot spot; Lifecycle analysis; Network pattern; Spatial resolution; Animals; environmental impact; food market; food supply; life cycle analysis; spatial resolution; supply chain management; sustainability; air transportation; article; butter; catering service; climate change; environmental impact; food waste; life cycle; animal; bovine; catering service; food; food chain; waste disposal; Europe; Animals; Cattle; Climate Change; Food; Food Chain; Food Supply; Refuse Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104327549

To gain insight into the influences of vegetation barrier characteristics on the dispersion of PMs (TSP, PM10, PM2.5), field measurements were performed in Wuhan, China. Twenty-four sample belts were selected within oblique wind canyons, on road and roadside TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 concentration were simultaneously monitored in steady periods. Layer shelterbelt porosity was used to represent the vertical configurations of the vegetation barriers. The result indicated that vegetation combination of trees, shrubs, and herbs is effective for reducing the concentration of PMs. Vegetation barriers can reduce TSP and PM10 concentrations to a certain level (5∼23 %) in the areas behind vegetation barriers compared to the control within oblique wind canyons. In contrast, the reduction effect of the vegetation barrier on PM2.5 could be positive or negative was inconsistent. Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that TSP and PM10 reduction efficiencies were negatively correlated with shelterbelt porosity in the 0∼2 m height section, but the vegetation barrier indicators had no obvious effects on the reduction efficiency of PM2.5. To improve roadside air quality, the use of shrubs or hedges with heights lower than 2 m should be encouraged, and large, dense trees should be avoided around roads with heavy traffic. These results provide insight on how to improve roadside air quality by mitigating PM pollution in urban street canyons. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Particulate matters; Reduction efficiency; Shelterbelt porosity; Vegetation structure","air quality; particulate matter; roadside environment; shelterbelt; spatiotemporal analysis; street canyon; traffic emission; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107943924

In this study, the integrated analysis of life cycle assessment (LCA), emergy evaluation (EME) and economic analysis (ECA) were applied and Quanjiao county was selected as a case study to estimate the pollution emissions, emergy efficiency and economic benefits of three typical rice-based rotation systems depended on a detailed farming practice filed investigation of 157 valid samples under structured questionnaire. The three typical rice-based rotation systems are rice-wheat rotation (RW), rice-fallow rotation (RF) and rice-crayfish rotation (RC), respectively. The LCA results showed that the area-based potential environmental impact for RW, RF and RC are 34.08, 13.71 and 39.98, the profit-based potential environmental impacts are 2.62, 1.16 and 1.98. The EME results indicated that the RC shows the highest emergy input, around 1.23E+17 sej/ha/yr, more than that of RW and RF, around 3.88E+16 sej/ha/yr and 3.40E+16 sej/ha/yr, respectively. From the emergy indices of the three systems, the RC results in higher environmental pressure and lower sustainability compared with the RW and RF. Fertilizer, diesel oil, water, electricity and forage are the crucial factors of environmental consequences, herein forage, water and electricity inputs are becoming new factors that are increasingly prominent and often neglected. From an economic perspective, the cost and income of the RC are highest because of more input and higher sale value, the area-based profit of the RC (20142 ¥/ha) is higher than that of RF (11848 ¥/ha) and RW (13031 ¥/ha). Generally, during the rice planting system transferring, the development of farming technologies and standards should be promoted to avoid the disorder of agricultural production, and then gearing up to the better economic performance and environmental sustainability for the rice-based rotation systems. Moreover, proper agricultural development policies should be made and promoted to stimulate farmers’ willingness to adopt advanced farming practices and techniques to reduce environmental emissions and enhance agricultural system sustainability as well as increasing farmers' income. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Ecosystem sustainability; Emergy evaluation; Environmental consequences; Life cycle assessment; Rice-based rotation","Cultivation; Environmental management; Life cycle; Profitability; River pollution; Rotation; Sustainable development; Area-based; Economics analysis; Ecosystem sustainability; Emergy evaluation; Environmental consequences; Environmental sustainability; Farming practices; Integrated analysis; Rice-based rotation; Rice-wheat rotations; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111052032

Urban forests have gained increasing recognition as nature-based solutions to climate change via the various benefits they provide, such as carbon sequestration and temperature regulation. Many cities have developed climate change and/or urban forest policies to enhance climate resilience and support urban livability. However, it is still unclear whether these policies consider and address potential alignment between climate action and urban forest planning and management. This study explored whether and to what extent urban forest and climate change policies are mutually supportive and reinforcing, by conducting a review of climate change and urban forest policies in the largest 20 Canadian cities. Results suggest significant gaps and discrepancies between these policies, across and within study cities, indicating potential weaknesses related to stakeholder/actor engagement, policy integration, departmental collaboration and communication, and cohesive management priorities and practices. Only three (15 %) of the cities have developed climate change and urban forest policies that align to some extent. Furthermore, despite some commonalities, most cities defined their urban forests differently, highlighting locally-specific understanding and needs in addition to a lack of cohesion across Canadian municipalities concerning urban forest planning and management. Across most cities, both types of policies included general and locally-relevant information related to impacts of climate change. However, gaps and inconsistencies found between and within many municipalities’ policies may present a major barrier to effective policy implementation and mutually-reinforcing management actions. Areas for improvement are suggested for policy planning and implementation to ensure alignment between urban forest and climate change policies, which should also prove useful for municipalities outside of the study scope. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Canadian cities; Climate change; Mitigation; Municipal policies; Urban forestry; Urban resilience","article; city; climate change; forest; forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105267339

The current research work aims to evaluate technical, economic, social, and environmental impacts of the ongoing transition toward renewable energy (RE) deployment in Morocco. We used the system dynamics approach in order to study different interactions of the components of the Moroccan electricity sector and their behaviors on this complex system under various scenarios. The results showed that 35 MtCO2 of avoided emissions can be ensured up to 2030 if renewable installed capacity reaches 15.72 GW by the same year.

This study focuses on the Western Mediterranean Sea (west of longitude 20g g€¯E) using the full POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances version 3 (POLDER-3)/Polarization & Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) aerosol data record derived from the operational clear-sky ocean algorithm (collection 3) available from March 2005 to October 2013. This 8.5-year satellite data set includes retrievals at 865g€¯nm of the total, fine-, and coarse-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD, AODF, and AODC, respectively), Ångström exponent (AE), and the spherical/non-spherical partition of the coarse-mode AOD (AODCS and AODCNS, respectively), that have been carefully validated over the study region (Formenti et al., 2018). Here, we analyze the spatial distribution, the seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of this ensemble of advanced aerosol products in three latitude bands (34-38, 38-42, and >g€¯42g g€¯N) and for three sites (Ersa, Barcelona, Lampedusa) distributed on the western basin. POLDER-3 retrieves the high influence of north African desert dust over the region, which largely controls the spatial distributions (south-to-north decreasing gradient) and seasonal cycles (spring/summer maximum) of both AOD and coarse AOD, including its non-spherical component. In contrast, the coarse spherical component of AOD remains relatively homogenously low all year long over the region, whereas fine-mode AODs are generally more elevated in the eastern part of the region of study, especially north of the Adriatic Sea. From 2005 to 2013, annual POLDER-3 AOD evolution shows a decreasing trend of 0.0030g€¯yr-1 in absolute value at 865g€¯nm (0.0060g€¯yr-1 at 550g€¯nm). Such a downward evolution is much more pronounced and spatially extended for AODF (-0.0020g€¯yr-1 at 865g€¯nm) than for AODC. Our analysis also suggests that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index explains a significant part of the interannual variability of POLDER-3 AODC, reflecting its role on the frequency of Saharan dust transport over the region. Finally, the POLDER-3 data set highlights an improvement of air quality related to the fine aerosol component, with a marked evolution toward more frequent occurrence of clean conditions (≥g€¯75g€¯% of daily AODF-865g€¯nm<0.05) at the end of the period of study (2010-2013) over most of the Western Mediterranean Sea, and much less evidence of such a large-scale evolution for the coarse fraction. Therefore, despite the high and variable influence of mostly natural north African dust over the region, the POLDER-3 advanced aerosol data set appears sufficiently accurate to successfully resolve the concurrent downward trend of fine, primarily anthropogenic particles, most likely related to reduced emissions in the surrounding European countries. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"aerosol; optical property; PARASOL; POLDER; spatial distribution; temporal variation; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (West)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114018432

This study aimed to assess the oncologic results and quality of life (QOL) of patients with T3 glottic SCC after CO2 TOLMS. Methods: Of the 44 patients who underwent CO2 TOLMS, 38 underwent QOL evaluations. QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and head and neck module, Voice Handicap Index-30, and M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory at least 6 months postoperatively. Results: The patients were predominantly male (98%), with a median age of 61 years. Cordectomy type included 1 type III, 4 type IV, 31 type V, and 8 type VI according to European Laryngological Society classification. Two patients (5%) had cervical lymph node metastasis and 21 patients (48%) underwent postoperative radiotherapy. With a mean follow-up of 65 months for all patients, 10 (23%) had tumor recurrence (9 local, 1 distant). After salvage surgery, four patients lived without disease, and the larynx was preserved in two. The 5-year local control and overall and disease-specific survival rates were 78%, 75%, and 84%, respectively. The overall laryngeal preservation rate was 82% (36/44). Most patients had satisfactory QOL. Conclusions: In selected T3 glottic SCC cases, CO2 TOLMS can achieve favorable oncologic results and a satisfactory QOL. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Function; Glottis; Larynx; Oncologic results; Quality of life; Transoral laser microsurgery","nutrition supplement; adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; cordectomy; disease assessment; disease control; disease specific survival; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; female; human; human tissue; larynx cancer; lymph node metastasis; male; microsurgery; overall survival; quality of life; salvage therapy; transoral laser microsurgery; tumor recurrence; Voice Handicap Index-30; cancer staging; drug therapy; gas laser; glottis; head and neck tumor; larynx tumor; low level laser therapy; microsurgery; middle aged; pathology; quality of life; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Glottis; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Laser Therapy; Lasers, Gas; Male; Microsurgery; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098978204

Advancing the scientific understanding on this topic requires that the best data be used as input to state-of-The-Art models in well-organized scientific assessments. The Land-Use Harmonization 2 dataset (LUH2), previously developed and used as input for simulations of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), has been updated annually to provide required input to land models in the annual Global Carbon Budget (GCB) assessments. Here we discuss the methodology for producing these annual LUH2-GCB updates and extensions which incorporate annual wood harvest data updates from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations for dataset years after 2015 and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) gridded cropland and grazing area data updates (based on annual FAO cropland and grazing area data updates) for dataset years after 2012, along with extrapolations to the current year due to a lag of 1 or more years in the FAO data releases. The resulting updated LUH2-GCB datasets have provided global, annual gridded land-use and land-use-change data relating to agricultural expansion, deforestation, wood harvesting, shifting cultivation, regrowth and afforestation, crop rotations, and pasture management and are used by both bookkeeping models and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) for the GCB. For GCB 2019, a more significant update to LUH2 was produced, LUH2-GCB2019 (10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1851, Chini et al., 2020b), to take advantage of new data inputs that corrected cropland and grazing areas in the globally important region of Brazil as far back as 1950. From 1951 to 2012 the LUH2-GCB2019 dataset begins to diverge from the version of LUH2 used for the World Climate Research Programme's CMIP6, with peak differences in Brazil in the year 2000 for grazing land (difference of 100g000gkm2) and in the year 2009 for cropland (difference of 77g000gkm2), along with significant sub-national reorganization of agricultural land-use patterns within Brazil. The LUH2-GCB2019 dataset provides the base for future LUH2-GCB updates, including the recent LUH2-GCB2020 dataset, and presents a starting point for operationalizing the creation of these datasets to reduce time lags due to the multiple input dataset and model latencies. © 2021 The Author(s).",,,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110545033

Wind speed is the most important factor in determining the total dust emission at the land surface; however, various land-surface conditions must be considered as well. Recently, the Korea Meteorological Administration updated the dust emission reduction factor (RF) in the Asian Dust Aerosol Model 3 (ADAM3) using data from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the improvements of ADAM3 according to soil types. We incorporated new RF formulations in the evaluation based on real-time MODIS NDVI data obtained over the Asian dust source regions in northern China during spring 2017. This incorporation improved the simulation performance of ADAM3 for the PM10 mass concentration in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria for all soil types, except Gobi. The ADAM3 skill scores for sand, loess, and mixed types in a 24 h forecast increased by 6.6%, 20.4%, and 13.3%, respectively, compared with those in forecasts employing the monthly RF based on the NDVI data. As surface conditions in the dust source regions continually change, incorporating real-time vegetation data is critical to improving performance of dust forecast models such as ADAM3. © 2021 by the authors.

To reduce PM emissions from grilling fumes, we developed and evaluated the performance of both multicompartment (M-type) and mirror-symmetrical multicompartment (MSM-type) scrubbers. M-type scrubbers exhibited a PM removal efficiency of 95.7%±3.7% at a fume flow rate of 6 m3/min and a water level of 10 cm, whereas the PM removal efficiency of MSM-type scrubbers was 95.3%±32.5% at a gas flow rate of 12 m3/min and a water level of 10 cm. The design parameters for the M-type and MSM-type scrubbers were compared with the parameters for conventional single-type (S-type) scrubbers. Each design parameter for each scrubber was calculated so that the PM in the grilling fumes at a flow rate of 30 m3/min could be removed at a >95%rate. The equipment volumes were 2.02, 0.54, and 0.47 m3 for the S-type, M-type, and MSM-type scrubbers, respectively. The MSM-type scrubber pressure drop was the lowest (141 mm H2O), followed by the M-type scrubber (162 mm H2O), and, finally, the S-type scrubber (220 mm H2O). These results demonstrate that the MSM-type scrubber represents a promising technology for PM reduction from grilling fumes thanks to its compact design, simple operation, and satisfactory PM removal performance. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Grilling restaurants; Multicompartment (M-type) scrubber; Optimization; Particulate matter (PM); Pressure drop","Efficiency; Flow of gases; Mirrors; Particles (particulate matter); Thermal processing (foods); Water levels; Aerodynamic diameters; Compact designs; Design parameters; Megacities; Particulate Matter; PM emissions; Simple operation; Urban areas; Scrubbers; detection method; instrumentation; particulate matter; pollutant removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107363005

Contemporary agriculture is also about increasing nutrient use efficiency, especially nitrogen, as the critical nutrient causing the most significant environmental pressure. This creates the need to produce highly digestible protein feed with high bioavailability, reducing losses of biogenic elements to feces. In this review, the latest trends and the potential for their implementation in sustainable agriculture have been compared, as well as the need to reduce the negative environmental impact of agriculture has been demonstrated. Applying local protein sources to feed animals reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation. The production of highly digestible fodder leads to a reduction in environmental pollution caused by excessive nitrogen outflows. Another approach indecreasing ammonia emissions from livestock farming is feed protein reduction and amino acid supplementation. All of the aforementioned approaches may result in beneficial long-term changes, contributing to environmental safety, animal welfare and human health. © 2021","Crop-livestock integration; High digestibility feed protein; Nutrient use efficiency (NUE); Sustainable agriculture","ammonia; essential amino acid; nitrogen; plant protein; alternative agriculture; amino acid; ammonia; digestibility; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; nutrient use efficiency; protein; alga; animal food; carbon footprint; comparative study; digestion; environmental impact; legume; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; oilseed; pollution; protein content; Review; soybean meal; sustainable agriculture; traffic and transport; trend study; agriculture; animal; animal food; environment; greenhouse gas; human; livestock; Agriculture; Animal Feed; Animals; Environment; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Livestock; Nitrogen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105116510

Based on the economy-climate (C-D-C) model, this paper introduces a yield impact of climate change (YICC) model that can quantitatively project the climate change impact. The model is based on the YICC as its core concept and uses the impact ratio of climate change (IRCC) indicator to assess the response of the economic system to climate change over a long period of time. The YICC is defined as the difference between the economic output under changing climate condition and that under assumed invariant climate condition. The IRCC not only reflects the sensitivity of economic output to climate change but also reveals the mechanism of the nonlinear interaction between climate change and non-climatic factors on the socio-economic system. Using the main grain-producing areas in China as a case study, we use the data of the ensemble average of 5 GCMs in CMIP6 to project the possible impact of climate change on grain production in the next 15–30 years under three future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5). The results indicate that the long-term climate change in the future will have a restraining effect on production in North region and enhance production in South region. From 2021 to 2035, climate change will reduce production by 0.60–2.09% in North region, and increase production by 1.80–9.01% in South region under three future scenarios. From 2021 to 2050, compared with the climate change impact in 2021–2035, the negative impact of climate change on production in North region will weaken, and the positive impact on production in South region will enhance with the increase in emission concentration. Among them, climate change will reduce grain output in North region by 0.52–1.99%, and increase output in South region by 1.35–9.56% under the three future scenarios. The combination of economic results and climate change research is expected to provide scientific support for further revealing the economic mechanism of climate change impacts. © Copyright © 2021 Chou, Xu, Dong, Zhao, Li and Li.","climate change; economy-climate model; grain production; impact assessment; mechanism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114218451

Notably, for diesel engines, the significance of fuel consumption and emission reduction is increasing because they emit harmful materials (PM, NOx); however, they are characterized by relatively low CO2 emission in comparison with gasoline engines. Various technologies have been developed to solve these problems of diesel engines; however, majority of the diesel engines are developed in a steady state, and yet their certification and evaluation include the transient state. The transient operation of diesel vehicles leads to additional fuel consumption and emission of NOx; however, the impact of transient operation has not been discussed thus far. Therefore, this study quantitively investigates the fuel consumption and NOx emission during the transient operation of a diesel vehicle. First, the engine and vehicle’s efficiency and NOx emission differences are derived and analyzed in the steady state. Subsequently, the effects of the vehicle’s transient operation are analyzed. A vehicle’s transient operation can be classified into two types: operational and thermal transient effects. Finally, the respective transient effects are quantified and analyzed. © 2021, KSAE.","Diesel engine; Energy flow down; Fuel consumption; NOx emission; Thermal transient; Transient operation","Diesel locomotives; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicles; Efficiency improvement; Emission reduction; Engine development; Engine efficiency; Thermal transient effect; Transient operating condition; Transient operation; Various technologies; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111303936

This paper examines the impact that these actions had on emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each U.S. county, we find that vehicle travel dropped about 40% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states, but travel in all states decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (e.g., balancing authority), we find that electricity consumption fell about 6% on average by mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use, we estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality, and, therefore, expected declines in mortality. Overall, we estimate that, for a month of social distancing, the expected premature deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by approximately 360 deaths, or about 25% of the baseline 1500 deaths. In addition, we estimate that CO2 emissions from these sources fell by 46 million metric tons (a reduction of approximately 19%) over the same time frame. © 2021 by the authors.

Building such rapid charging networks is currently capital intensive and therefore requires careful planning. Here, we propose a novel data-driven framework for deploying suitable rapid charging infrastructures in large urban areas for electric taxis. This framework combines an iterative clustering technique with a modified numerical optimisation method to determine the smallest feasible infrastructure for a level of charging availability that ensures uninterrupted electric taxi service. We provide a case study for Istanbul using real-time global positioning data from fossil-fuel taxis currently operational in the city. This case study tests the performance of the proposed infrastructure, determined by the framework, by simulating a taxi fleet of the same size as the one currently operating in Istanbul. Our results show that a sufficient charging infrastructure to serve a fully electric taxi fleet of 17,395 vehicles in a large city like Istanbul should consist of around 1,363–1,834 charging stations depending on the roll-out strategy. In the most suitable case, each charging station on average provides a daily amount of energy of 449.61 kWh and usually serves about 20 electric taxis per day. Furthermore, we observe that infrastructures with less than 1,300 charging stations would result in significant shortages of charging availability and adversely impact a reliable electric taxi service operation. While exact numbers of required charging stations would vary depending on the city characteristics and fleet size, the roll-out strategies, in addition to the underlying feasibility analysis presented here, would support transport authorities and other decision makers in shaping an appropriate urban transition strategy that accommodates electric taxi services. © 2021","Charger allocation; Charging infrastructure; Clustering; E-mobility; Electric taxis; Statistical data analysis","Charging (batteries); Decision making; Fossil fuels; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Optimization; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Charger allocation; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Clusterings; E mobilities; Electric taxi; Rapid charging; Statistical data analysis; Taxi fleets; Taxi services; Taxicabs; atmospheric pollution; detection method; electric vehicle; operations technology; strategic approach; urban area; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106264048

Their very short duration and narrow frequency bandwidth are indicative of subsecond small-scale energy release in the solar corona, yet their origin is not understood. Using the LOw Frequency ARray, we present spatially, frequency, and time resolved observations of individual radio spikes associated with a coronal mass ejection. Individual radio spike imaging demonstrates that the observed area is increasing in time and the centroid positions of the individual spikes move superluminally parallel to the solar limb. Comparison of spike characteristics with that of individual Type IIIb striae observed in the same event show similarities in duration, bandwidth, drift rate, polarization, and observed area, as well the spike and striae motion in the image plane suggesting fundamental plasma emission with the spike emission region on the order of ∼108 cm, with brightness temperature as high as 1013 K. The observed spatial, spectral, and temporal properties of the individual spike bursts are also suggestive of the radiation responsible for spikes escaping through anisotropic density turbulence in closed loop structures with scattering preferentially along the guiding magnetic field oriented parallel to the limb in the scattering region. The dominance of scattering on the observed time profile suggests the energy release time is likely to be shorter than what is often assumed. The observations also imply that the density turbulence anisotropy along closed magnetic field lines is higher than along open field lines. © 2021. The Author(s).

We show that VCP emissions are ubiquitous in US and European cities and scale with population density. We report significant VCP emissions for New York City (NYC), including a monoterpene flux of 14.7 to 24.4 kg · d-1 · km-2 from fragranced VCPs and other anthropogenic sources, which is comparable to that of a summertime forest. Photochemical modeling of an extreme heat event, with ozone well in excess of US standards, illustrates the significant impact of VCPs on air quality. In the most populated regions of NYC, ozone was sensitive to anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs), even in the presence of biogenic sources. Within this VOC-sensitive regime, AVOCs contributed upwards of ∼20 ppb to maximum 8-h average ozone. VCPs accounted for more than 50% of this total AVOC contribution. Emissions from fragranced VCPs, including personal care and cleaning products, account for at least 50% of the ozone attributed to VCPs. We show that model simulations of ozone depend foremost on the magnitude of VCP emissions and that the addition of oxygenated VCP chemistry impacts simulations of key atmospheric oxidation products. NYC is a case study for developed megacities, and the impacts of VCPs on local ozone are likely similar for other major urban regions across North America or Europe. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 μg/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 μg/m3)—well above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 μg/m3 – 16.85 μg/m3 and 0.24–0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 μg/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatio-temporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with non-parametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Land use regression; Low-cost sensors; Machine learning; Particulate matter","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); data quality; estimation method; greenspace; machine learning; particulate matter; pollution exposure; quality control; regression analysis; sensor; Africa; Africa south of the Sahara; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; algorithm; ambient air; Article; comparative study; controlled study; cooking; cost; cross validation; environmental temperature; hospital building; land use; light scattering; machine learning; particulate matter 2.5; population density; precipitation; predictor variable; Uganda; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; machine learning; particulate matter; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Uganda; Varanidae; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Particulate Matter; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107762992

Latin America Methane Project Collaborators","Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) is a developing region characterized for its importance for global food security, producing 23 and 11% of the global beef and milk production, respectively. The region's ruminant livestock sector however, is under scrutiny on environmental grounds due to its large contribution to enteric methane (CH4) emissions and influence on global climate change. Thus, the identification of effective CH4 mitigation strategies which do not compromise animal performance is urgently needed, especially in context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) defined in the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to: 1) collate a database of individual sheep, beef and dairy cattle records from enteric CH4 emission studies conducted in the LAC region, and 2) perform a meta-analysis to identify feasible enteric CH4 mitigation strategies, which do not compromise animal performance. After outlier's removal, 2745 animal records (65% of the original data) from 103 studies were retained (from 2011 to 2021) in the LAC database. Potential mitigation strategies were classified into three main categories (i.e., animal breeding, dietary, and rumen manipulation) and up to three subcategories, totaling 34 evaluated strategies. A random effects model weighted by inverse variance was used (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3.3.070). Six strategies decreased at least one enteric CH4 metric and simultaneously increased milk yield (MY; dairy cattle) or average daily gain (ADG; beef cattle and sheep). The breed composition F1 Holstein × Gyr decreased CH4 emission per MY (CH4IMilk) while increasing MY by 99%. Adequate strategies of grazing management under continuous and rotational stocking decreased CH4 emission per ADG (CH4IGain) by 22 and 35%, while increasing ADG by 22 and 71%, respectively.

While modeling and satellite studies provide spatially extensive constraints, they must be supported by surface-validating dust monitoring. Southern South America is the main dust source to the southern oceans (>45°S), a region of low biological productivity potentially susceptible to increased micronutrient fertilization through dust deposition, as well as one of the main dust sources to Antarctica, implying long-range transport of dust from Patagonia and potentially affecting snow cover albedo. We present multiyear time series of dust-related visibility reduction (DRVR) and dust mass flux in Patagonia. We find that local DRVR is partly controlled by long-term (i.e., months) water deficit, while same-day conditions play a smaller role, reflective of water retention properties of fine-grained dust-emitting soils in low-moisture conditions. This is supported independently by reanalysis data showing that large-scale dust outbreaks are usually associated with anomalously high long-term water deficit. By combining visibility data, surface dust sampling, and particle dispersion modeling, we derive regional dust emission rates. Our results suggest that the inclusion of long-term soil hydrologic balance parameterizations under low-moisture conditions may improve the performance of dust emission schemes in Earth system models. © 2021.

Although industrial activity is rapidly expanding, production practices to increase material circularity and reduce environmental impact have yet to see sufficient progress. This article analyses the environmental benefits of implementing a regionally based co-processing scheme between the iron-steel and cement industries of three emergent South-East Asian economies: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Vietnam, already ranked as the 8th largest cement producer, can be a crucial contributor to a more symbiotic exchange of wastes with regional neighbours. A plan to increase the co-processed iron/steel slag at cement facilities (from 1 to 10 per cent) would translate into substantial gains in material circularity (0.83–8.33 M. tons of raw material savings per year) and carbon emission reductions in the region (0.95–9.07 Mt CO2, i.e. 1.6 to 15.6 per cent of business as usual scenarios equal to reductions of 6 per cent of the total emissions). This scheme could provide further benefits over a nationally self-oriented strategy, revealed by the levels of material exchange within the countries. However, several considerations are essential to make such a scheme feasible. We discuss these critical factors, which are fundamental for a prospective join industrialisation strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cambodia; Cement; Circular economy; Co-processing; Industrial symbiosis; Laos; Slag; South-East Asia; Vietnam","Cement industry; Cements; Economics; Emission control; Steelmaking; Cambodia; Circular economy; Coprocessing; Economic growth rate; Industrial symbiosis; Iron steels; Lao; Regional CO; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Slags",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107602354

Appropriate procedures to assess the evolution over time of climatic actions are needed to deal with the inherent uncertainty of climate projections, also in view of providing more sound and robust predictions at the local scale. In this paper, an ad hoc weather generator is presented that is able to provide a quantification of climate model inherent uncertainties. Similar to other weather generators, the proposed algorithm allows the virtualization of the climatic data projection process, overcoming the usual limitations due to the restricted number of available climate model runs, requiring huge computational time. However, differently from other weather generation procedures, this new tool directly samples from the output of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), avoiding the introduction of additional hypotheses about the stochastic properties of the distributions of climate variables. Analyzing the ensemble of so-generated series, future changes of climatic actions can be assessed, and the associated uncertainties duly estimated, as a function of considered greenhouse gases emission scenarios. The efficiency of the proposed weather generator is discussed evaluating performance metrics and referring to a relevant case study: the evaluation of extremes of minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and ground snow load in a central Eastern region of Italy, which is part of the Mediterranean climatic zone. Starting from the model ensemble of six RCMs, factors of change uncertainty maps for the investigated region are derived concerning extreme daily temperatures, daily precipitation, and ground snow loads, underlying the potentialities of the proposed approach. © 2021 by the authors.

Following a major earthquake, the landslide-mobilized organic carbon can be exported from river catchments by physical sediment transport processes or stored within the landscape where it may be degraded by heterotrophic respiration. The competition between these physical and biogeochemical processes governs a net transfer of carbon between the atmosphere and sedimentary organic matter, yet their relative importance following a large landslide-Triggering earthquake remains poorly constrained. Here, we propose a model framework to quantify the post-seismic redistribution of soil-derived organic carbon. The approach combines predictions based on empirical observations of co-seismic sediment mobilization with a description of the physical and biogeochemical processes involved after an earthquake. Earthquake-Triggered landslide populations are generated by randomly sampling a landslide area distribution, a proportion of which is initially connected to the fluvial network. Initially disconnected landslide deposits are transported downslope and connected to rivers at a constant velocity in the post-seismic period. Disconnected landslide deposits lose organic carbon by heterotrophic oxidation, while connected deposits lose organic carbon synchronously by both oxidation and river export. The modeling approach is numerically efficient and allows us to explore a large range of parameter values that exert a control on the fate of organic carbon in the upland erosional system. We explore the role of the climatic context (in terms of mean annual runoff and runoff variability) and rates of organic matter degradation using single pool and multi-pool models. Our results highlight the fact that the redistribution of organic carbon is strongly controlled by the annual runoff and the extent of landslide connection, but less so by the choice of organic matter degradation model. In the context of mountain ranges typical of the southwestern Pacific region, we find that model configurations allow more than 90ĝ€¯% of the landslide-mobilized carbon to be exported from mountain catchments. A simulation of earthquake cycles suggests efficient transfer of organic carbon out of a mountain range during the first decade of the post-seismic period. Pulsed erosion of organic matter by earthquake-Triggered landslides is therefore an effective process to promote carbon sequestration in sedimentary deposits over thousands of years. © Copyright:",,"carbon cycle; earthquake trigger; landslide; mobilization; mountain region; organic carbon; oxidation; sediment transport; seismic method; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112211141

At the same time, the widespread use of distributed energy systems and the regional utilization of industrial waste heat leads to the existence of multiple heat sources in an area. Therefore, how to design an economical and reliable pipeline network to meet energy-saving demand under multiple heat source conditions becomes a problem. In this work, an optimization method is established to determine the optimal pipeline network topology with minimum total annual cost. In this optimization method, Star tree algorithm, Kruskal algorithm and GeoSteiner algorithm are combined with a linear programming model to establish a distributed energy pipeline network for multiple heat sources. The model incorporates Euclidean Steiner Minimum Tree and Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree in the consideration of the topology optimization of Distributed Energy System pipeline networks. Four pipeline network topologies, STAR, Minimum Spanning Tree, Euclidean Steiner Minimum Tree and Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree, are evaluated in this paper from economic and reliability perspectives. A case extracted from a real industrial park where steam is the medium is used to prove the validity of the model. The optimization results show that a Euclidean Steiner Minimum Tree pipeline network has a lower total annual cost than three other types of pipeline network and ranks second in reliability. Considering the comprehensive economy and reliability, ESMT is the optimal pipeline network type of distributed energy system with steam as the medium. © 2021 by the authors.

(alnus) is widely used in agroforestry systems across the globe and is believed to provide multiple ecosystem services; however, evidence is lacking in agroforestry literature to support the perceived benefits, particularly in Rwanda. To understand carbon sequestration potential and other benefits of alnus, a household survey, tree inventory and destructive sampling were conducted in north-western Rwanda. Over 75% of the respondents had alnus trees in their farms. The trees provide stakes for climbing beans, firewood and timber. They also improve soil fertility and control soil erosion. Farmers had between 130 and 161 alnus trees per hectare with an average height of 7.7 ± 0.59 m and diameter at breast height of 16.3 ± 1.39 cm. The largest biomass proportion was found in stems (70.5%) while branches and leaves stock about 16.5 and 13% of the total biomass, respectively. At farm level, aboveground biomass of alnus trees was estimated to be 27.2 ± 0.7 Mg ha−1 representing 13.6 Mg of carbon (C) per hectare. Biomass carbon increased with tree size, from 7.1 ± 0.2 Mg C ha−1 in 3 years old trees to 34.4 ± 2.2 Mg C ha−1 in 10 years old trees. The converse was observed with elevation; biomass carbon decreased with increasing elevation from 21.4 ± 1.29 Mg C ha−1 at low (2011–2110 m) to 9.6 ± 0.75 Mg C ha−1 in the high elevation (&gt; 2510 m). In conclusion, alnus agroforestry significantly contributes to carbon sequestration, although the magnitude of these benefits varies with tree age and elevation. Planting alnus trees on farms can meet local needs for stakes for climbing beans, wood and soil fertility improvement, as well as the global need for regulation of climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Aboveground biomass; Agroforestry; Carbon stock; Firewood; Soil fertility; Stakes","agroforestry; biomass; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; household survey; perception; sampling; soil fertility; Alnus acuminata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106049403

Hence, understanding the dynamics and the potential of urban forests as carbon pools is crucial to propose effective policies addressing the ecosystem services' maintenance. Remote sensing technologies such as Light detection and ranging (Lidar) are alternatives to acquire information on urban forests accurately. In this paper, we evaluate a UAV-Lidar system's potential to derive individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees in an Urban Atlantic Forest. Additionally, the influence of point density when deriving tree heights was assessed (2500, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10 and 5 returns.m−2). The UAV-Lidar data was collected with the GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory ‘Generation 2’. The UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights were compared by statistical analysis. Higher densities of points allowed a better description of tree profiles. Lower densities presented gaps in the Crown Height Model (CHM). The highest agreement between UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights (r = 0.73) was noticed when using 100 returns.m−2. The lowest rRMSE was observed for 50 returns.m−2 (8.35 %). There are no explicit differences in derived tree heights using 25 to 2500 returns.m−2. UAV-Lidar data presented satisfactory performance when deriving individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Forest inventory; GatorEye; Remote sensing; Urban landscape","carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem service; lidar; rainforest; satellite data; tree; urban area; urban forestry; Araucaria; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Araucaria angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106909994

This research presents a novel design of integrating electrochromic glass window controls with a GCHP system for long-term optimization and sustainability. A building energy model was developed and simulated with the solar heat gain coefficients of 0.41, 0.25, 0.15, and 0.09 to model electrochromic glass windows. The energy model outputs were used for ground heat exchanger model simulations which analyzed 20-year temperature trends and system efficiencies. The results showed the integrated GCHP system with electrochromic windows was feasible and a conceptual control sequence and design was developed. The annual cooling demand decreased by 32% between the clear glass and fully tinted state. It was recommended to increase the ground heat exchanger capacity to 200 boreholes at 45.7 m in 2040 to prevent overheating from projected climate change. The average system coefficient of performance was 7.6 for the fully tinted window state. The integrated GCHP system reduced CO2 emissions by 30% and the 30-year NPV was US$142,273.65 cheaper compared to a conventional boiler and chiller system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Electrochromic glass; Ground coupled heat pump; Numerical modelling; Renewable energy","Air conditioning; Climate change; Electrochromism; Geothermal heat pumps; Numerical models; Pumps; Electrochromic glass; Electrochromic windows; Glass windows; Ground coupled heat pump; Ground heat exchangers; Ground-coupled heat pump systems; Pump optimization; Renewable energies; Sources of energy; Thermal; Glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101979767

Therefore, the energetic, economic and environmental (3E) multi-objective optimization of ethylene separation process is of great significance for the sustainable development of olefin industry. Regarding the high computation cost of conventional optimization approach based on process simulation model, a novel optimization framework named multi-objective adaptive surrogate model assisted optimization (MOASO) is introduced. In this framework, adaptive sampling based on sparsity and IGGD improvement is proposed, aiming at promoting the accuracy of surrogate model successively as optimization proceeds. In addition, a modified non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII) embedding a density-based local search operator is developed for evolutionary optimization. The MOASO is applied to typical test functions and a practical ethylene separation process. The results show that the proposed framework has highly acceptable optimization performance and computational efficiency, reducing 72% of the calculation burden. Compared with the actual operating condition, the energy consumption and CO2 emission can be reduced by 3.5 × 104 GJ/year and 3.81 × 105 kg/year while increasing the annual gross profit by 4.36 × 105 $/year under a typical optimized condition. In general, the proposed framework can be used as an effective tool for multi-objective optimization, from which insights for clean production and sustainable development in complex large-scale chemical processes could be gained. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","3E analysis; Adaptive sampling; Ethylene plant; Multi-objective optimization; Surrogate model","Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Ethylene; Genetic algorithms; Planning; Separation; Sustainable development; 3e analyse; Adaptive sampling; Ethylene plants; High-energy emissions; Multi-objectives optimization; Olefin production; Optimisations; Production process; Separation process; Surrogate model; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106486368

These calculations must be simple and, consequently, the effects of management practices and environmental conditions are only crudely represented in the calculations. The intention of this review is to develop a detailed understanding necessary for developing accurate models for calculating CH4 emission from liquid manure, with particular focus on the microbiological conversion of organic matter to CH4. Themes discussed are (a) the liquid manure environment; (b) methane production processes from a modeling perspective; (c) development and adaptation of methanogenic communities; (d) mass and electron conservation; (e) steps limiting CH4 production; (f) inhibition of methanogens; (g) temperature effects on CH4 production; and (h) limits of existing estimation approaches. We conclude that a model must include calculation of microbial response to variations in manure temperature, substrate availability and age, and management system, because these variables substantially affect CH4 production. Methane production can be reduced by manipulating key variables through management procedures, and the effects may be taken into account by including a microbial component in the model. When developing new calculation procedures, it is important to include reasonably accurate algorithms of microbial adaptation. This review presents concepts for these calculations and ideas for how these may be carried out. A need for better quantification of hydrolysis kinetics is identified, and the importance of short- and long-term microbial adaptation is highlighted. © 2021 The Authors.

Study focus: Climate change is predicted to have a large impact on the hydrological regimes of Welsh rivers. However, its influence on the abstraction capability of key sectors, such as public water supply (PWS) and hydroelectric power (HEP), is not yet fully understood. We use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to generate future (2021–2079) streamflows under a worst-case scenario of greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) at two catchments in Wales, the Conwy and Tywi. SWAT streamflow output is used to estimate total unmet demand for PWS and changes in generation characteristics for HEP. PWS unmet demand is assessed using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) system under increasing, static, and declining demand scenarios. Mann-Kendall analysis is performed to detect and characterise trends. New hydrological insights for the region: Under all future demand scenarios, there is increased occurrence of insufficient streamflow to satisfy PWS demand. For HEP, decrease in annual abstraction volume results in a loss of generation potential, despite an increasing number of days that maximum abstraction is reached. Changes in HEP generation and PWS availability are most pronounced in the medium-term (2021–2054), with rate of change slowing after 2060. We provide a novel perspective on future water resource availability in Wales, giving context to management planning to ensure future PWS sustainability and HEP generation efficiency. © 2021 The Authors","Hydroclimatic change; Hydroelectric power; Hydrological modelling; Trend analysis; Water resource management; Water supply-demand balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110249328

In cities, self-service bike sharing systems are quickly developing and are intended to offer an alternative and cleaner mode of transport than the car. However, the sustainability of such schemes is often taken as a given, rather than thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, in this paper we undertake a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a public self-service bike sharing system in the city of Edinburgh, UK, modelling the production, operation and disposal elements of the system, but discounting additional food intake by users. Our results show that the bike sharing scheme is saving carbon dioxide equivalent emissions compared to the modes of transport by which its users previously travelled, but it is essential to optimize rebalancing operations and to manufacture bikes as near as possible to the point of use to further reduce carbon emissions; and that the overall emissions impacts of the scheme are critically dependent on how public transport providers respond to reductions in demand as users shift trips to bikeshare, since most trips transfer from walk and public transport, not private car.

However, they represent an extremely sensitive ecosystem with a narrow ecological limit: prolonged high temperatures can lead to bleaching, in which corals expel their symbiotic algae and eventually corals will degrade and die. Based on climate change projections from the Blue Communities regional model, using linear regression, exponential regression, polynomial regression, we found that by the decades 2041–2050 and 2051–2060, whether with RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5, the environmental temperature will change beyond the coral capacity threshold. Of particular concern is RCP 8.5, where the number of weeks per decade in which SST exceeds the threshold of coral reef bleaching is up to 55, compared to 0 at the beginning of the century. As well, the El Niño phenomenon often heats up waters to abnormally high temperatures in Cu Lao Cham and, it is projected to rise even further. Consequently, the combination of climate change and El Niño will cause abnormal increases in the seawater environment beyond the coral resistance threshold, leading to degradation of this internationally important site.

Using existing concepts of vulnerability and resilience, I illustrate the empirical utility of centering the human subject and local conceptions of security when analyzing the role of climate in armed conflict. I develop this framework using the cases of Syria, Sudan, and Morocco. I argue that the ecological drivers of conflicts in Sudan and Syria are best understood as a result of policy decisions that reflected the ideology and preferences of ruling elites rather than direct functions of climate change. Conversely, I present the case of Morocco as a counterfactual in which sound government policy attenuated environmental drivers of conflict. In doing so, this approach considers the impacts of international and domestic structures of inequality on people’s climate vulnerability and resilience. © 2021 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate change; environmental politics; ideology; nature-society relations; policy analysis; policy approach; vulnerability; Morocco; Sudan; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112465624

Wide-ranging and large-bodied species are especially vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation due to their typically low population densities, reflecting their need for extensive and connected habitats. We used the multi-scale Random Forests machine learning algorithm to identify factors driving the habitat selection and future changes in habitat of Himalayan brown bear, an iconic wide-ranging and large-bodied species of high conservation interest, across a range of spatial scales. Habitat selection of brown bears was scale-dependent, with most variables selected at broad scales. Climatic variables such as maximum temperature of coldest month, minimum temperature of warmest month and the potential evapotranspiration of wettest quarter strongly influenced habitat selection of brown bears. Future projections indicate a strong difference between the high and low emission scenarios. Alarmingly, our model suggests that high emission scenarios, with or without land use change, may result in a decline of brown bear habitat of >90% by the end of the century. In contrast, low emission scenarios are projected to reduce brown bear habitat by <23%, with much of the species range shifting to higher elevations. This study provides an integrative understanding of scale-dependent variables in brown bear habitat selection, providing critical information for prioritizing areas for habitat management and conservation.

In the baseline scenario (Bsc), all waste was managed through landfilling, while in scenario 1 (Sc1) all waste was treated by incineration. Sc2 employed anaerobic digestion (AD) for food waste and landfilling, and Sc3 treated the waste through AD for food waste, incineration of combustible and plastic wastes, and landfilling. Sc4 treated the waste using AD, incineration, landfilling, and recycling of the plastic waste. The economic cost of waste management scenarios was estimated by calculating different economic variables, such as gate fees, including capital and operating costs, governmental incentives and levies, and also the potential of employed waste treatment technologies for resource recovery. The results revealed that Sc3 has the lowest economic cost of 238.1 mAUD/year, followed by Sc1 (261.9 mAUD/year), while Bsc proved to be the highest cost at 476.1 mAUD/year for MSW treatment. It was noticed that scenarios employing incineration had lower economic costs compared to Bsc and Sc2, mainly because incineration resulted in higher electricity generation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The sustainability assessment results confirmed that Sc3 had the lowest and Bcs the highest total economic cost and environmental damage. © 2021 by the authors.

The impact of oil sands emissions (OSE) on Hg levels in and around the AOSR, relative to contributions from global (anthropogenic, geogenic and legacy) emissions and regional biomass burning emissions (BBE), was assessed using a global 3D-process-based Hg model, GEM-MACH-Hg, from 2012 to 2015. In addition, the relative importance of year-to-year changes in Hg emissions from the above sources and meteorological conditions to inter-annual variations in Hg deposition was examined. Surface air concentrations of Hg species and annual snowpack Hg loadings simulated by the model were found comparable to measured levels in the AOSR, suggesting consistency between reported Hg emissions from oil sands activities and Hg levels in the region. As a result of global-scale transport and the long lifetime of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)), surface air concentrations of Hg(0) in the AOSR reflected the background Hg(0) levels in Canada. By comparison, average air concentrations of total oxidized Hg (efficiently deposited Hg species) in the AOSR were elevated up to 60% within 50km of the oil sands Hg emission sources. Hg emissions from wildfire events led to episodes of high ambient Hg(0) concentrations and deposition enrichments in northern Alberta, including the AOSR, during the burning season. Hg deposition fluxes in the AOSR were within the range of the deposition fluxes measured for the entire province of Alberta. On a broad spatial scale, contribution from imported Hg from global sources dominated the annual background Hg deposition in the AOSR, with present-day global anthropogenic emissions contributing to 40% (<1% from Canada excluding OSE) and geogenic and legacy emissions contributing to 60% of the background Hg deposition. In contrast, oil sands Hg emissions were responsible for significant enhancements in Hg deposition in the immediate vicinity of oil sands Hg emission sources, which were g1/410 times larger in winter than summer (250%-350% in winter and g1/435% in summer within 10km of OSE, 2012-2013). The spatial extent of the influence of oil sands emissions on Hg deposition was also greater in winter relative to summer (g1/4100km vs. 30km from Hg-emitting facilities). In addition, inter-annual changes in meteorological conditions and oil sands emissions also led to significantly higher inter-annual variations in wintertime Hg deposition compared to summer. In 2015, within 10km of major oil sands sources, relative to 2012, Hg deposition declined by 46% in winter but 22% annually, due to a larger OSE-led reduction in wintertime deposition. Inter-annual variations in meteorological conditions were found to both exacerbate and diminish the impacts of OSE on Hg deposition in the AOSR, which can confound the interpretation of trends in short-term environmental Hg monitoring data. Hg runoff in spring flood, comprising the majority of annual Hg runoff, is mainly derived from seasonal snowpack Hg loadings and mobilization of Hg deposited in surface soils, both of which are sensitive to Hg emissions from oil sands developments in the proximity of sources. Model results suggest that sustained efforts to reduce anthropogenic Hg emissions from both global and oil sands sources are required to reduce Hg deposition in the AOSR. © Author(s) 2021.",,"air quality; annual variation; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; mercury (element); oil sand; pollutant source; snowpack; Alberta; Athabasca Oil Sands; Canada; Alberta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114349018

The CNN correctly identifies 91% of observed precipitation extremes based on daily sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies. There is evidence of increasing frequency of extreme precipitation circulation patterns (EPCPs) over the past two decades, although frequency changes are insignificant over the past four decades. Additionally, we find that moisture transport and precipitation intensity during EPCPs have increased.

Bamboos growth fast and display plastic functional traits, which favor the occupation of environments under different conditions, making them efficient C stockers in addition to providing raw material for local human populations. Asian bamboos are known to sequester considerable amounts of C in a short time, and although is likely that New World bamboo species have the same capacity, this perspective is rarely addressed. To evaluate the impact of a native bamboo on biomass and carbon stocks of an Atlantic Forest Protected Area, we first developed an allometric equation to estimate its live aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the destructive sampling method. We then compare our results to the AGB of forest components previously estimated for the same area, as well as to Asian and other Neotropical bamboo species to place our case study in a global scenario. In four 1-ha permanent plots in São Paulo State, Brazil, we made a census of all live culms and collected 20 healthy ones for equations purposes. The Merostachys neesii Rupr. (Poaceae) studied species has 343 clumps ha−1, 3663 culms ha−1, and 12.1 Mg ha−1 of biomass (5.2 Mg C ha−1) or 4% of total AGB and C stocks of the studied area. M. neesii's contributes as much as palms solely, but more than lianas and tree ferns together for the total AGB in the old-growth Montane Atlantic Forest we studied. These results show that the non-inclusion of bamboos may underestimate the role of terrestrial ecosystems in buffering anthropogenic CO2. The comprehension of bamboo ecology is crucial for conservation and management purposes, and it is relevant since, with global warming, the C stored may be released turning these ecosystems into source instead of a sink of C. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Atlantic forest; Bamboo allometric equation; Ecosystem services; Merostachys neesii","aboveground biomass; anthropogenic source; bamboo; biodiversity; biomass; buffering; carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; estimation method; montane forest; native species; Neotropical Region; old-growth forest; source-sink dynamics; species diversity; Atlantic Forest; Bambusa; Matthiola; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103088337

Owing to greater nitrogen use efficiency, leguminous plants present more effective responses to increasing [CO2] than non-legumes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphophysiological and growth responses of two species from the Cerrado, a native C3 herbaceous legume (Stylosanthes capitata Vogel.) and an invasive C4 grass (Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv) growing alone or in competition, in ambient (350 ppm) and high (1000 ppm) [CO2]. Competition with S. capitata reduced leaf development and dry matter production in M. minutiflora individuals, regardless of [CO2]. Stylosanthes capitata increased root system growth under high [CO2] and competition. This change allows greater soil exploitation, decreasing nutrient limitation to S. capitata development. The leguminous species S. capitata showed advantages in the competition for resources under high [CO2] concerning the invasive grass. Although invasive C4 species are initially better in the colonisation of the invaded areas, the C3 native species of Cerrado may adjust morphophysiological traits when growing at high [CO2] and develop strategies that enable it to more effectively compete for resources. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia","biological invasion; Cerrado; competition; photosynthesis; root dry mass","antiherbivore defense; carbon dioxide; cerrado; climate change; grass; growth; herb; native species; nutrient limitation; root system; Capitata; Fabaceae; Melinis minutiflora; Stylosanthes capitata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101023333

We answer these research questions by simulating the energy consumption of 400 representative single-family houses in each of 55 US cities both before and after heat pump adoption. We use energy prices, CO2 emissions, health damages from criteria air pollutants, and changes in peak electricity demand to quantify the costs and benefits of each house's heat pump retrofit. The results show that 32% of US houses would benefit economically from installing a heat pump, and 70% of US houses could reduce emissions damages by installing a heat pump. We show that the potential for heat pump adoption varies depending on electric grid, climate, baseline heating fuel, and housing characteristics.

The direct and indirect adverse consequences of fossil fuel utilization for power generation enforce the region’s countries to raise the share of renewable energy. In this context, various incentive policies have been developed to encourage the residential and industrial sectors to support a portion of energy needs through renewable energy resources. In this case, a solar water heating system (SWHS) as an application of solar thermal technology provides some of the heat energy requirements for domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating, supported conventionally by electricity or natural gas, or even other fossil fuels. This paper reviews the feasibility of the SWHS in the Middle East region from technical and economical standpoints and investigates some of the progress, challenges, and barriers toward this market. The pay-back times and CO2 emission reduction under different incentive frameworks and configurations of each system have been assessed in this context. Furthermore, the advantages and weaknesses of the SWHS in several countries have been reported. Finally, various guidelines have been proposed to enhance the development of this technology. © 2021 by the authors.

Two case studies were discussed: the Smart Energy Building (SEB) in the Savona Campus of the UNIGE, and the Paul L. Cejas School of Architecture (PCA) Building of the FIU. The SEB’s construction reduced emissions by about 86 tCO2/y, whereas the PCA’s retrofitting reduced GHG emissions by 30%. Other operational strategies, including energy efficiency and energy generation, allowed the UNIGE to reduce their overall Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions by 25% from 2013 to 2016. Globally, FIU Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions per person were found to result in more than three times the UNIGE’s emissions, and 2.4 times if evaluated per square meter. The results were compared with GHG emissions and operational strategies from other universities. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, it remains unclear how and which plant traits regulate the assembly process and thus affect ecosystem structure and function under climate changes. Here, we selected six steppe sites with snow fences along a precipitation gradient in inner Mongolia. We measured traits including plant height and leaf carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. We incorporated intraspecific trait variation to quantify the strength of external filters (assembly processes outside the community at a larger spatial scale), the strength of internal filters (assembly processes within the local community), and functional redundancy (the number of species having a similar function to an ecosystem). We applied these assembly rules to explain the changes in biodiversity and productivity in response to changing precipitation. We found that increased rainfall reduced plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) concentrations, but did not affect plant height. High snowfall increased phosphorous concentration, but did not affect other traits. Latent variable models identified climate (rainfall) and soil nutrient conditions (soil total N and P content) were more important than external filtering processes in predicting species richness. However, external filtering processes were the most important predictor of productivity. More specifically, we found with the increase in steppe productivity, the strength of the external filtering on leaf N increased and on plant height decreased, leading to leaf N converging into a small range but broadening the range of plant height. The internal filters had no significant effects on species richness or productivity. Additionally, we found that low precipitation reduced functional redundancy. We emphasize that intraspecific trait-variation drives plant productivity and richness responses to precipitation changes by regulating community assemblage. Our finding also underlines the importance to separate the contributions of different functional traits in regulating the responses of ecosystem structure and function to climate changes. © 2021 The Authors.","biodiversity and productivity; community assembly; drylands; external and internal filtering; functional redundancy; grasslands; intraspecific trait variation; precipitation change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113457012

In the tallgrass region of the Northern Great Plains, plant community composition may have shifted in response to increases in both annual precipitation and temperature. We compared community composition of a tallgrass prairie among three sampling periods (1978-1979, 1998, and 2014), spanning more than three decades, in order to better understand (1) temporal shifts in plant cover and (2) which environmental variables were correlated with these changes. Basal cover of Poa pratensis increased and basal cover of forbs declined over time. The shift from a forb-rich to grass-dominated prairie was positively correlated with higher levels of precipitation and soil moisture. Our study suggests that increased precipitation due to climate change has already altered plant community composition in the Great Plains. © 2021 Natural Areas Association.

Information on the carbon storage and capture capacity of the urban forests especially sacred forests in India is limited. We estimated and examined the different carbon pools and sequestration potentials of two urban sacred forests i.e. Deorali Chorten monastery sacred forest (DMS) and Enchey monastery sacred forest (EMS) and tested its performance against a rural natural forest (STF). Carbon in trees was estimated allometrically from five plots of 31.6 × 31.6 m2 in each of the study sites using the Forest Survey of India's volume equations, wood density, and tree height. Thirty soil samples collected from three soil depths (0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm) from each of the study sites were colorimetrically estimated for soil carbon. Litter biomass collected from ten quadrats of 1 × 1m2 from each of the study sites was used for the estimation of litter carbon. Ecosystem carbon sequestration was calculated from the carbon stock values of each of the study sites by dividing by the corresponding age of sites. Tree carbon density varies significantly (p&lt;0.001) across sites, and aboveground biomass exhibited a positive significant relationship with tree density (p&lt;0.05), and basal area (p&lt;0.01). Pattern of carbon stock and sequestration is EMS (156.04 Mg C ha−1; 2.5 Mg C ha−1y−1); DMS (155.39 Mg C ha−1; 3.42 Mg C ha−1y−1); STF (76.58 Mg C ha−1; 5.27 Mg C ha−1y−1).Topsoil has the highest carbon stock with a peak value in EMS (118.70 Mg C ha−1) followed by STF (107.84 Mg C ha−1), and DMS (97.64 Mg C ha−1). The Present study revealed that old forests have higher carbon storage but reduced sequestration potential. Urban forests allocate more carbon in vegetation than in soil, and warming and a shift in precipitation pattern due to climate change may decrease soil carbon and fertility. Hence, proper management of urban forests by replacing old trees with new ones can effectively mitigate the ill effects of global warming in the cities by regulating the climate through CO2 sequestration. © 2021","Carbon density; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem carbon; Global warming; Soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112567183

Temperatures beyond a plant’s physiological optimum can trigger significant physiological and biochemical perturbations, reducing plant growth and tolerance to stress. Improving a plant’s tolerance to these temperature fluctuations requires a deep understanding of its responses to environmental change. To adapt to temperature fluctuations, plants tailor their ac-climatory signal transduction events, and specifically, cellular redox state, that are governed by plant hormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulatory systems, and other molecular compo-nents. The role of ROS in plants as important signaling molecules during stress acclimation has recently been established. Here, hormone-triggered ROS produced by NADPH oxidases, feedback regulation, and integrated signaling events during temperature stress activate stress-response pathways and induce acclimation or defense mechanisms. At the other extreme, excess ROS accumula-tion, following temperature-induced oxidative stress, can have negative consequences on plant growth and stress acclimation. The excessive ROS is regulated by the ROS scavenging system, which subsequently promotes plant tolerance. All these signaling events, including crosstalk between hormones and ROS, modify the plant’s transcriptomic, metabolomic, and biochemical states and promote plant acclimation, tolerance, and survival. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the ROS, hormones, and their joint role in shaping a plant’s responses to high and low tempera-tures, and we conclude by outlining hormone/ROS-regulated plant responsive strategies for developing stress-tolerant crops to combat temperature changes. © 2021 by the authors.

Extending previous work, this study models the impact of hydro reservoirs on optimal planning decisions. It further provides a more holistic assessment of the role and economic value of hydro reservoirs through the use of a detailed capacity expansion and dispatch model. Our model is parameterized based on the power system of New England, U.S. and the hydro-based system of Quebec, Canada. We find that expanding transmission access to hydro reservoirs reduces the need for fossil-fuel power plants that may otherwise be deployed to balance renewable intermittency. Our results show that hydro access can accelerate decarbonization by decreasing optimal gas plant capacity and generation. At levels of very deep decarbonization, reservoir hydro reduces the need for Carbon Capture and Storage. Our modeling shows how hydro reservoirs accomplish this by serving as both a short- and long-term energy storage resource. We further show that, by reducing the need for more expensive balancing technologies and by enabling a more efficient utilization of variable renewables, hydro access lowers the cost of decarbonization, and that this benefit grows non-linearly with the decarbonization target. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation macro-energy systems decarbonization hydropower energy systems engineering power system planning","Balancing; Carbon capture; Climate change; Decarbonization; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Hydroelectric power plants; Capacity expansion; Climate change mitigation macro-energy system decarbonization hydropower energy system engineering power system planning; Decarbonisation; Economic values; Hydropower reservoirs; New England; Optimal planning; Paper analysis; Parameterized; Power; Hydroelectric power; energy policy; fossil fuel; hydroelectric power; power generation; power plant; reservoir; Canada; New England; Quebec [Canada]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107682531

The ARiD (Atmospheric River Detector) code has been developed to automatically detect atmospheric rivers from water vapor flux and has been applied to the ECMWF ERA5 archive over the period 1980–2020 above the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. A case study of an atmospheric river formed in the East Atlantic on August 2014 that reached France has been detailed using ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis, ground based observation data, and satellite products such as DARDAR, AIRS, GPCP, and GOES. This atmospheric river event presents a strong interaction with an intense upper tropospheric jet stream, which induced stratosphere–troposphere exchanges by tropopause fold. A 1980–2020 climatology of atmospheric rivers over Europe has been presented. The west of France, Iberian Peninsula, and British Islands are the most impacted regions by atmospheric rivers with an occurrence of up to four days per month during the October–April period.

Air pollution is measured by the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and economic growth is measured by the annual growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. A panel data fixed-effects regression model is built, and the instrumental variables estimation method is utilized for quantitative analyses. The study reports a significant negative impact of air pollution on the macroeconomic growth of China. According to our instrumental variables estimation, holding other factors constant, if the concentration of PM2.5 increases by 1%, then the GDP per capita growth rate will decline by 0.05818 percentage points. In addition, it is found that the adverse effect of atmospheric pollution is heterogeneous across different regions. The effect is stronger in the eastern region and in provinces with smaller state-owned enterprise shares, fewer governmental expenditures for public health services, and fewer medical resources. The study results reveal that air pollution poses a substantial threat to the sustainable economic growth of China. Taking actions to abate air pollution will generate great economic benefits, especially for those regions which are heavily damaged by pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used a regional climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to project air pollution in NC and investigate the variations of air pollutions response to future climate changes, which probably has an implication to strategy and control policy for air quality in NC. A comprehensive model evaluation was conducted to verify the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on MODIS and MISR datasets, and the model also showed reasonable results in aerosol concentrations. Future changes of air pollution in the middle of the 21st century (2031–2050) were projected in the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and compared with the situation in the historical period (1986–2005). In the two RCPs, the simulated averaged PM2.5 concentration was projected with the highest values of 50–250 µg·m−3 over the Bohai Rim Economic Circle (BREC) in winter. The maximum AOD is in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region in summer, with an average value of 0.68. In winter, in the RCP4.5 scenario, PM2.5 concentration and AOD obviously declined in BTH and Shandong province. However, in the RCP8.5 scenario, PM2.5 concentration and AOD increased. Results indicated that air pollution would be reduced in winter if society developed in the low emission pathway. Precipitation was projected to increase both in the two RCPs scenarios in spring, summer, and winter, but it was projected to decrease in autumn. The planetary boundary layer height decreased in the two RCPs scenarios in the central region of NC in the summer and winter. The results indicated that changes of meteorological conditions have great impact on air pollution in future scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

These lockdowns had significant impacts on economic and personal activities in many countries. Several studies using satellite and surface observations have reported important changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Global and regional chemistry-Transport model studies are being performed in order to analyze the impact of these lockdowns on the distribution of atmospheric compounds. These modeling studies aim at evaluating the impact of the regional lockdowns at the global scale. In order to provide input for the global and regional model simulations, a dataset providing adjustment factors (AFs) that can easily be applied to current global and regional emission inventories has been developed. This dataset provides, for the January-August 2020 period, gridded AFs at a 0.1×0.1 latitude-longitude degree resolution on a daily or monthly basis for the transportation (road, air and ship traffic), power generation, industry and residential sectors. The quantification of AFs is based on activity data collected from different databases and previously published studies. A range of AFs are provided at each grid point for model sensitivity studies. The emission AFs developed in this study are applied to the CAMS global inventory (CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v4.2_R1.1), and the changes in emissions of the main pollutants are discussed for different regions of the world and the first 6 months of 2020. Maximum decreases in the total emissions are found in February in eastern China, with an average reduction of 20ĝ€¯%-30ĝ€¯% in NOx, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) and SO2 relative to the reference emissions. In the other regions, the maximum changes occur in April, with average reductions of 20ĝ€¯%-30ĝ€¯% for NOx, NMVOCs and CO in Europe and North America and larger decreases (30ĝ€¯%-50ĝ€¯%) in South America. In India and African regions, NOx and NMVOC emissions are reduced on average by 15ĝ€¯%-30ĝ€¯%. For the other species, the maximum reductions are generally less than 15ĝ€¯%, except in South America, where large decreases in CO and BC (black carbon) are estimated. As discussed in the paper, reductions vary highly across regions and sectors due to the differences in the duration of the lockdowns before partial or complete recovery. The dataset providing a range of AFs (average and average ± standard deviation) is called CONFORM (COvid-19 adjustmeNt Factors fOR eMissions) (https://doi.org/10.25326/88; Doumbia et al., 2020).

Results show that additivation or fuel blending (e.g., 50 wt. % wood and 50 wt. % corn cob pellets) reduce total particulate and CO-emissions by 48 to 60 wt. % and 64 to 89 wt. %, respectively, in comparison to baseline emissions from non-additivized corn cob pellets.

Through philosophical reasoning, this book pragmatically addresses these questions and builds a framework to support sustainable ways of living. At the core of the book, it draws on the concept of milieu (fudo) inspired by the Japanese philosopher Watsuji Tetsuro, which captures how we act within and perceive our surroundings as a web of culturally, historically and geographically situated meanings and values. It argues that the milieu connects us as individuals with community, past and future history, and the natural world, providing us with common ground for global environmental ethics.

However, since it is dependent on the sun, it can only generate electricity in the daytime, and this restriction is exacerbated in electricity grids with high PV penetration, where solar energy must be curtailed due to the mismatch between supply and demand. This study conducts a techno-economic analysis to present the cost-optimal storage growth trajectory that could support the dynamic integration of solar PV within a planning horizon. A methodology for cost-optimal assessment that incorporates hourly simulation, Monte Carlo random sampling, and a proposed financial assessment is presented. This approach was tested in Japan’s southernmost region since it is continuously increasing its solar capacity and is at the precipice of high PV curtailment scenario. The results show the existence of a cost-optimal storage capacity growth trajectory that balances the cost penalty from curtailment and the additional investment cost from storage. This optimal trajectory reduces the impact of curtailment on the energy generation cost to manageable levels and utilizes more solar energy potential that further reduces CO emissions. The results also show that the solar capacity growth rate and storage cost significantly impact the optimal trajectory. The incorporation of the Monte Carlo method significantly reduced the computational requirement of the analysis enabling the exploration of several growth trajectories, and the proposed financial assessment enabled the time-bound optimization of these trajectories. The approach could be used to calculate the optimal growth trajectories in other nations or regions, provided that historical hourly temperature, irradiance, and demand data are available. © 2021 by the authors.","Cost-optimal; Diurnal storage; Energy storage; Generation cost; Growth trajectory; High PV penetration; Optimization; Scenario analysis; Solar curtailment","Costs; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Growth rate; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Solar energy; Trajectories; Computational requirements; Electricity storages; Generate electricity; Growth trajectories; Optimal trajectories; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-Economic analysis; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112631328

There are few empirical analyses of decision-making, and “governance is largely ignored” (Primmer et al., 2015, pg. 158). This case study details decision-making following a major coastal hazard, Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico, in the United States (U.S.). It illustrates how collaborative adaptive governance of recreational ecosystem services enhances coastal resilience, or the ability to recover after a hazard. Evidence of resilience centered policy is surprising in the U.S. state of Texas, a conservative subnational area where the denial of climate change science is popular in the epicenter of the U.S. oil and gas industry. This research suggests the devastating hurricane and the popularity of recreational ecosystem services provided a window of opportunity for policy makers to address resilience, which would have been otherwise impossible for political reasons. As part of this process, decision-makers and stakeholders 1) sought out new and innovative funding sources for rapid recreational infrastructure repairs focused on resilience, 2) prevented the loss of public waterfronts and small businesses in the nature based recreational economy that constitute major parts of local identity, and 3) enhanced decision maker capacity to include local ecological knowledge in novel and potentially transformative ways. Recreational ecosystem services, due to their obvious economic importance and popularity, may act as unifying symbols to decision-makers, allowing them enact policy to respond to climate impacts and to conserve ecosystem services in places where this is otherwise politically unpopular. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hazards; Recreational ecosystem services; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108849111

Specifically, social science perspectives allow students to understand the policy, economic, cultural, and personal influences that impact environmental change. This article describes one such college course that employed active-learning techniques. Course topics included community resilience, environmental education, historical knowledge timeline, climate justice, social vulnerability, youth action, science communication, hope versus despair, misinformation, and climate refugees. To unify these concepts, engaging activities were developed that specifically address relevant individual, local, state, national, and international climate resilience themes. Students assessed their personal climate footprint, explored social/cultural influences, wrote policy requests to relevant local/state government officials, studied national policy options, and learned about previous global initiatives. The course culminated in a mock global climate summit, which was modeled on a Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This final activity required each student to prepare a policy report and represent a nation in negotiating a multilateral climate agreement. It is accepted that climate change education must include physical data on the impacts of anthropogenic emissions. It is also essential that students appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of climate adaptations, become hopeful about addressing change, and gain skills necessary to engage as informed climate citizens. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

The objective was to ascertain the effect of key traditional farming practices on nutrients and physicochemical properties of soils in the area. Soil samples were manually collected for laboratory determination of these properties. Descriptive statistics was used to determine variation in the textural characteristics of soil while Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test variation in soil chemical characteristics. Results proved that traditional bush burning has beneficial effects of adding potassium (K) into the soil while nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were adequately enhanced through the application of artificial fertilizer on one hand and the incorporation of plant’s residues into the soil on the other. Tillage and slashed treatments facilitated soil organic carbon and other plant’s nutrients absorption but exerted little or no influence on the textural characteristics of soil. The reason is the value of soil textural classes was not statistically different across treatment blocks. Descriptive statistics also proved that all nutrients/chemical properties of soil were altered considerably as mean pH values of 5.32 B/F and 6.62 A/F in burn treatment practice and the soil Organic carbon content also altered considerably from a mean of 2.8 to 4.56. Analysis of variance indicates that there was a significant difference in all nutrients/chemical properties of soil at 0.05 probability level indicating that on farm treatment methods altered soil nutrient and chemical properties considerably.

Box 877Phnom Penh, Cambodia","This study aimed to propose a set of decision support tools to allocate Cambodia's REDD+ national baseline or initial forest reference level (FRL) to local REDD+ projects, based on their forest cover and forest carbon stocks, and the historical deforestation trends in their reference regions. Our samples included 77 hypothetical REDD+ projects and five actual REDD+ projects. To identify reference regions for our samples, a cluster analysis of 127 districts in Cambodia was conducted using the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm (or k-medoids method). To calculate the baseline amount to be allocated to projects, four allocation methods were proposed. Two methods used ‘snapshot’ variables (i.e., [1] existing forest area or [2] forest carbon stock) and two used ‘change’ variables (i.e., [3] historical forest area change or [4] historical forest carbon stock change from 2006 to 2014). We weighted the baseline by the deforestation risk in 2014. We found that ‘snapshot’ methods tended to allocate more baseline if the project had more forest cover or forest carbon stocks. In contrast, ‘change’ methods tended to allocate more baseline if the project has more forest area loss or forest carbon stock loss between 2006 and 2014 in its reference region. These differences suggest that the ‘snapshot’ methods do not consider the inequity in the amount of baseline allocated to the projects. This inequity stems from the different degree of effort made by project stakeholders to protect their forests. The degree of effort varies depending on the historical deforestation trend in a project's reference region. However, the ‘change’ methods explicitly incorporate the trend into their calculations of baseline allocations. Technically, the ‘change’ method [4] seems to be the desired choice for allocating FRL to local projects; this is because it fits best with the idea of counter-factual thinking using a ‘reference period’ that a national baseline must have under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ‘change’ methods are less likely to stimulate further deforestation, in a jurisdiction with high forest cover or forest carbon stocks that does not have a REDD+ project, compared with the ‘snapshot’ methods. However, the ‘change’ methods are more likely to face the challenge of political adjustment to balance the reduced emissions from some jurisdictions/projects with increased emissions from the other jurisdictions/projects, compared with the ‘snapshot’ methods. The findings are applicable not only in Cambodia but also in other REDD+ countries that include deforestation as one of the five REDD+ activities, within the scope of their national baseline submission to the UNFCCC. The study's outcomes will facilitate stakeholder dialogue on the proportions of national baseline allocated to sub-national programs/projects by showing the technical and political implications of the proposed allocation methods. © 2021 The Authors","Baseline; Cambodia; Evaluation; Nesting; REDD+; Reference level","Carbon; Cluster analysis; Decision support systems; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Baseline; Cambodia; Carbon stocks; Evaluation; Forest carbons; Forest cover; Nesting; REDD+; Reference levels; Snapshot method; Deforestation; Cambodia; Carbon; Coverings; Deforestation; Environmental Regulations; Evaluation; Methods; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107725623

Sentiment analysis of social media posts has become increasingly prominent in recent years as a means of gaining insights into how members of the public perceive current affairs. The ongoing research in this domain has leveraged multiple types of sentiment analysis. However, although the existing approaches enable researchers to acquire retrospective insights into public opinion, they do not enable a real-time evaluation. In addition, they are not readily scalable and necessitate the analysis of a significant amount of posts (in the millions) to facilitate a more in-depth evaluation. The study outlined in this paper was designed to address these shortcomings by presenting a framework that facilitates a real-time evaluation of the evolution of opinions shared by prominent public features and their respective followers; that is, high-impact posts. The developed solution encompasses a sophisticated Bi-directional LSTM classifier that was implemented and tested using a dataset consisting of 278,000 tweets related to the topic of climate change. The outcomes reveal that the proposed classifier achieved the following accuracies: 88.41% for discrimination; 89.66% for anger; 87.01% for inspiration; and 87.52% for joy - with negative emotions being more accurately classified than positive emotions. Similarly, the sentiment classification performance yielded accuracies of 89.32% for support and 89.80% for strong support, as well as 88.14% for opposition and 87.52% for strong opposition. In addition, the findings of the study indicated that geographic location, chosen topic, cultural sensitivities, and posting frequency all play a critical role in public reactions to posts and the ensuing perspectives they adopt. The solution stands out from existing retrospective analysis methods because it does not rely on the analysis of vast quantities of data records; rather, it can perform real-time, high-impact content analysis in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner. This framework can be used to generate insights into how public opinion is developing on a real-time basis. As such, it can have meaningful application within social media analysis efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Opinion leaders; Sentiment analysis; Smart cities; Social media analytics","Classification (of information); Climate change; Long short-term memory; Smart city; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Analysis frameworks; Case-studies; High impact; Online social medias; Opinion leaders; Public opinions; Real time evaluation; Real- time; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Sentiment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107522959

A time-varying cointegration (TVC) approach allowing for the smooth changes in the parameters is employed, using quarterly data covering the period from 1990:Q1 to 2018:Q4. TVC tests confirm the variation in the long-run parameters over time for all countries by rejecting the null hypothesis of time-invariant cointegration. Moreover, results reveal that time-varying parameters of income and oil prices are inelastic for all counties’ oil markets. BRICS's oil demand is significantly affected by the real economic activity, although the evidence on inelastic income implies oil as a necessary commodity. The sign of time-varying price elasticities implies oil as an ordinary good for Brazil, Russia, and China whereas an inferior good in some intervals for India and South Africa. The evidence on the insignificance of price elasticities in most of the analysis periods indicates that regulation of oil product prices cannot control domestic oil demand. Hence, one can infer that taxes imposed on petroleum product prices are not an effective policy instrument to reduce greenhouse emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BRICS; Income elasticity; Oil demand; Price elasticity; Time-varying cointegration","Costs; Economics; Brazil, russia, india, china, and south africa; Co-integration tests; Income elasticities; Longest run; Oil demand; Price-elasticity; Runtimes; South Africa; Time varying; Time-varying cointegration; Elasticity; cointegration analysis; demand analysis; elasticity; income distribution; price dynamics; Africa; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107154564

Goats were allocated into three dietary treatments (n = 10/treatment) as follows: control (basal diet without any supplementations), natural zeolite (20 g/kg DM diet), and nano-zeolite (0.40 g/kg DM diet). The in vitro results revealed that only the nano-zeolite supplementation form quadratically (p = 0.004) increased GP, and the level of 0.5 g/kg DM had the highest GP value compared to the control. Both zeolite forms affected the CH4 production, linear, and quadratic reductions (p &lt; 0.05) in CH4 (mL/g DM), consistent with linear increases in truly degraded organic matter (TDOM) (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.007) were observed by nano zeolite treatment, while the natural form of zeolite resulted in a linear CH4 reduction consistent with a linear decrease (p = 0.004) in NH3-N, linear increases in TDOM (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.004). Results of the in vivo experiment demonstrated that the nutrient digestibility was similar among all treatments. Nano zeolite enhanced (p &lt; 0.05) the total short-chain fatty acids and butyrate concentrations, while both zeolite forms decreased (p &lt; 0.001) NH3-N compared to the control. These results suggested that both zeolite supplementation forms favorably modified the rumen fermentation in different patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

A parametric analysis was performed by using three software: RADIANCE 2.0 and DAYSIM 3.1 for daylighting simulation and TRNSYS.17 for thermal dynamic simulation. Three shading device parameters were assessed: the spacing between slats, the tilted angle and the slats installation. The vertical shading angle “VSA” is fixed; it is equal to the optimum shading angle measured for Ghardaïa. The simulation results indicate that fixed external shading devices have a significant impact on decreasing the energy demand for cooling; however, they are unable to reduce the total energy demand since they significantly increase heating loads. It was found that fixed external shading devices remove all risks associated with glare in summer by decreasing illuminance close to the window; however, they do not improve daylighting performance in winter because of glare. We note that even if the vertical shading angle “VSA” was the same for all cases, these did not present the same thermal and luminous behavior. This is mainly due to the amount and the way that the solar radiation penetrates space. © 2021 by the authors.

With the United States leading the path in terms of case incidence, it is important to investigate how weather variables influence the spread of the disease in the country. This paper assembles a detailed and comprehensive dataset comprising COVID-19 cases and climatological variables for all counties in the continental U.S. and uses a developed econometric approach to estimate the causal effect of certain weather factors on the growth rate of infection. The results indicate a non-linear and significant negative relationship between the individual weather measures and the growth rate of COVID-19 in the U.S. Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 °C rise in daily temperature will reduce daily covid growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 6 percent in the following week, while a marginal increase in relative humidity reduces the same outcome by 1 percent over a similar period. In comparison, a 1 m/s increase in daily wind speed will bring about an 8 percent drop in daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the country.

Relative to purely siliciclastic landscapes, the response of erosion and weathering to uplift may differ in mixed-lithology regions. However, our knowledge of weathering and erosion in mixed carbonate-silicate lithologies is limited and, thus, so is our understanding of the mechanistic coupling between uplift, weathering, and the carbon cycle. Here, we partition denudation fluxes into erosion and weathering fluxes of carbonates and silicates in the Northern Apennines—a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic active orogen—using dissolved solutes, the carbonate sand fraction, and existing 10Be denudation rates. Erosion generally dominates total denudation fluxes relative to weathering by an order of magnitude. Carbonate and silicate contributions to erosion vary between lithologic units, but weathering fluxes are systematically dominated by carbonates. Silicate weathering may be kinetically limited, whereas carbonate weathering may be limited by acid supply. Carbonate re-precipitation estimated by comparing ion ratios (Sr, Ca, Na) from rivers and bedrock suggests that up to 90% of dissolved Ca2+ is lost from carbonate-rich catchments. Corresponding [Ca2+] estimates for the weathering zone are high, likely driven by high soil CO2 partial pressures (pCO2); however, re-equilibration with atmospheric pCO2 in rivers converts solutes back into grains that become part of the physical denudation flux. Weathering limits in this landscape therefore differ between the subsurface weathering zone and riverine exports, and our findings suggest that carbon cycle models may overestimate the sensitivity to erosion of solute exports (Ca2+ and HCO3−) derived from carbonate weathering. © 2021.

Overall, between 2012-13 and 2018–19, universities have reduced emissions by 29% although their energy consumption remained mostly stable, implying that these reductions mostly stemmed from reductions in emission coefficient effect (which measures carbon efficiency of energy generation) by 24% and energy intensity effect by 25%. Consistently, estimated correlation coefficients confirm that emission coefficient, intensity, and affluence effects are major contributors behind the annual change in total emissions, with estimated correlation coefficients being 0.42, 0.66, and −0.24, respectively. The share of renewable energy sources was reduced by 2.2%, which is a major reason, in addition to increased number of students, behind the sector's overall failure achieve the 2020 goal of reducing emissions by 43% from the 2005 level.

Small/subsistent livestock herders are the most vulnerable and less resilient group towards climatic disasters within South Asian region including Pakistan. The adoption of climate-smart practices would be beneficial for small livestock herders because of its potential to ensure food security, improve income, and sustain development simultaneously. The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors influencing small livestock herders’ adaptation decisions towards changing climate by conducting field-based research. We intend to understand how institutional factors, risk perceptions, adaptations, and personal constraints affect the adaptation decisions related to climate change mitigation and choice of adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a primary data set of 405 small livestock herders from Punjab, Pakistan was used. The regression results of empirical models reveal the probability of adopting specific climate change strategies. The study results showed that zero adaptation (non-adoption) to climate change is higher when there is low literacy rate, less experience, nuclear family system, lack of institutional services, and low level of risk perception about climate change. The marginal outcome showed that the livestock herders with positive risk perception and access to the institutional services do participate more frequently in a higher number of adaptations options for economic and ecological benefits. Therefore, it is suggested that government and other development actors should strengthen institutions for trust building among local community groups and to reduce individuals’ risks. Moreover, effective insurance schemes could facilitate small livestock herders to keep less but more productive livestock. The study recommends building viable and potential weather index insurance schemes which will result meaningful marginal scale benefits for smallholders. Finally, the results of major constraints suggest that it is necessary to provide awareness of climatic vulnerabilities, timely information delivery, and adequate financial facilities to offset resource constraints of livestock herders in order to adopt sustainable strategies at their farms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptations; Climate change; Institutional services; Risk perceptions","climate change; data set; farming system; livestock farming; probability; risk perception; sustainability; vulnerability; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; agriculture; animal; climate change; human; livestock; Pakistan; perception; Agriculture; Animals; Climate Change; Humans; Livestock; Pakistan; Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104228732

The use of inorganic sulfur source makes it possible for sulfur to be effectively introduced, which is found to increase the defective degree in the carbon plane. The defect augment is revealed by systematic physical characterizations to originate from the fact that S atoms get rid of the carbon crystal and diffuse to form bits of sulfides during the heat-treatment process, thus leaving abundant vacant spots and providing access to forming pyridine-N sites. Therefore, more catalytic active sites are exposed and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be improved. Benefiting from the advantages in structure and composition, the resultant catalyst shows a remarkable half-wave potential (0.86 V vs. RHE) and an outstanding durability, superior to that of Pt/C.

While a unified national emission trading scheme (ETS) has been recognized as the crucial instrument to fulfill these ambitious dual goals, its potential performance remains underexplored. This paper quantifies China's need for emission reduction under the dual goals in 2030 by setting three scenarios for peak emissions. Four initial allocation schemes of carbon emission allowance (CEA) are compared according to the emission abatement costs (EACs) of China and its 30 provinces. By estimating the provincial marginal abatement cost curves, China's ETS is simulated through a nonlinear programming aimed at minimizing its total EACs. We find that in achieving the dual goals it makes economic sense to operationalize the ETS that would reduce China's EACs by 61.41%–80.33% in 2016–2030, at a carbon price of 394.55–425.75 RMB per ton CO2. Peaking China's emissions in 2030 is the preferred choice that will trigger the largest GDP in 2016–2030. The historical responsibility scheme is recommended for the CEA allocation because of the lowest initial EACs without ETS. To allow more room for economic growth after China peaks emissions, there is a need for overfulfilling the goal of carbon intensity reduction by 2030, which is consistent with China's latest climate mitigation targets. This research not only highlights the role of ETS in realizing China's dual goals, but provides a scientific framework for evaluating the environmental policies towards multiple goals in a cost-effective manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon intensity; China; Emission reduction quotas; Emission trading scheme; Marginal abatement costs; Peak emissions","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Emission control; Environmental protection; Nonlinear programming; Carbon abatement; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity; China; Emission allowances; Emission reduction quota; Emissions abatement costs; Emissions Trading Scheme; Marginal abatement costs; Peak emissions; Carbon; abatement cost; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental planning; Gross Domestic Product; abatement cost; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate; controlled study; cost; cost effectiveness analysis; economic development; emission trading scheme; gross national product; socioeconomics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105546581

This study aimed to investigate the effect of exposure to ambient air pollution and prevalence of asthma in adults. This cross-sectional study was done between November 2015 and February 2016. The asthma prevalence was surveyed in 3172 adults between 20 and 44 years old in Tehran, Iran. Face to face interview and standardized questionnaire (European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS)) were used for data gathering. Concentrations of air pollutants in the whole city of Tehran were obtained from Tehran Air Quality Control Company (AQCC). Air pollution exposure assessed by the spatial analysis based on GIS method. The effect of ambient air pollution on the asthma symptoms was assessed with the crude and adjusted logistic regression. Results were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results showed that the asthma prevalence in adults in Tehran was 11.73%, higher than the average prevalence of asthma in the whole country equal to the 8.9%. The prevalence of asthma in males (6.43%, n=204) was significantly higher than females (5.26%, n=167), but this difference was not significant (P = 0.29). A significant positive association was observed between the asthma prevalence and the concentration of CO (OR 1.64; 1.26 to 1.85) and PM10 (1.04; 1.01 to 1.08) (P &lt;0.05). Finally, we concluded that exposure to some air pollutants can affect the asthma prevalence in adults. Therefore, control of air pollution is recommended to reduce the asthma in Tehran metropolis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Asthma; Respiratory diseases; Tehran","adult; ambient air; asthma; atmospheric pollution; confidence interval; disease prevalence; health survey; mortality risk; pollution exposure; risk factor; spatial analysis; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103155093

Understanding the interactions in this microclimate of this natural habitat of plant pests (i.e., boundary layer of leaves), is a prerequisite for their control through targeted climate management for sustainable greenhouse production. The temperature and humidity simulations, inside the greenhouse, were performed using CFD code which has been adapted to simulate the plant activity within each mesh in the crop canopy. The air temperature and air humidity profiles within the boundary layer of leaves were deduced from the local surrounding climate parameters, based on an analytical approach, encapsulated in a Used Defined Function (UDF), and dynamically linked to the CFD solver, a work that forms an innovative and original task. Thus, this model represents a new approach to investigate the microclimate in the boundary layer of leaves under greenhouses, which resolves the issue of the inaccessibility of this area by the conventionnel measurement tools. The findings clearly showed that (i) contrarily to what might be expected, the microclimate parameters within the boundary layer of leaves are different from the surrounding climate in the greenhouse. This is particularly visible during photoperiods when the plant’s transpiration activity is at its maximum and that (ii) the climatic parameters in the leaf boundary layer are more coupled with leaf surfaces than with those of greenhouse air. These results can help developing localized intervention strategies on the microclimate within boundary layer of plant leaves, leading to improved and sustainable pest control management. The developed climatic strategies will make it possible to optimize resources use efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

The SDGs provide the construction industry with a new lens through which global needs and desires can be translated into business solutions. This paper explores the role of the construction industry in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The paper uses an explanatory sequential design with an initial quantitative instrument phase, followed by a qualitative data collection phase. Following a comparative review of the literature on the 17 SDGs, a questionnaire was designed and administered among 130 re-spondents, and 105 responses were received. These data were then validated through semi-struc-tured interviews with 16 sustainable construction experts. Data obtained from the semi-structured validation interviews were analysed through side-by-side comparisons of the qualitative data with the quantitative data. The findings show that the construction industry has a critical role in achieving almost all the 17 SDGs. The roles were, however, prevalent in 10 key SDGs, namely: sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); climate action (SDG 13); clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9); life on land (biodiversity) (SDG 15); gender equality (SDG 5); good health and well-being (SDG 3); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). The study con-firmed the role played by the construction industry in achieving these SDGs. The findings from this study provide further insights into the ever-increasing state-of-the-art regarding the construction industry’s role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 by the authors.

The results show that NND promotes economic development but fails to reduce the emission of air pollution including per capita SO2 and per capita smoke without the consideration of spatial spillover effect. However, the promotion effect of NND on economic development is not supported after PSM matching. On the other hand, the advantage of the SDID model in policy evaluation is proved. For instance, with the consideration of spatial spillover effect, the win-win of promoting economic development and reducing air pollution are partially supported.

In this study, canopy interception (CI), throughfall (TF), and stemflow (SF) were evaluated for a semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest (AFR) from 2013 to 2019, where a prolonged dry period occurred. The Gash and Liu models were analyzed in detail to determine the most appropriate for modeling CI throughout drought conditions. Thus, the climatic parameters were retrieved annually by a modified TF-based method (EI%), whereas the structural parameters represented the entire period. The contribution of the energy stored in the forest (i.e. air and biomass; Q) to CI was also assessed in the AFR stand. Both models performed well when using EI%, as the Gash model overestimated CI by 71 mm (4.6%), whereas the Liu model underestimated it by only 13 mm (0.85%). This performance is due to an increased Q and turbulent mechanisms (such as advection and strong updrafts) that occur in drought conditions and are indirectly accounted for in EI%. However, the Liu model stood out for modeling CI under a prolonged dry period, as the exponential wetting approach better represents the complex canopies of the semi-deciduous forests. Thus, we recommend the Liu model and additional energy sources when dealing with prolonged droughts, as in the case of climate change scenarios projected to the studied region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass energy; Energy advection; Energy stored rate (ESR); Gash model; Liu model; Tropical forest","biomass; climate change; deciduous forest; drought; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; forest edge; interception; stemflow; throughfall; advection; article; biomass energy; canopy; climate change; drought; energy resource; evaporation; forest stand; tropical rain forest; biomass; forest; hydrology; tree; Atlantic Forest; Biomass; Climate Change; Droughts; Forests; Hydrology; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105567255

However, the interactive effects among these factors regulating soil N transformation rates in ecosystems across large spatial scales remain unclear. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of the potential N mineralization, nitrification, ammonification, and denitrification rates in relation to plant traits and soil edaphic conditions across a 600-km precipitation gradient in secondary grasslands of South China. The soil potential N mineralization and nitrification rates significantly increased with increasing precipitation. However, the soil potential N ammonification and denitrification rates did not significantly vary with precipitation. Moreover, the soil potential N nitrification and denitrification rates significantly increased with increasing soil pH, whereas the potential N mineralization and ammonification rates decreased with increasing soil pH. The soil potential N mineralization rate was positively correlated with soil labile N but negatively correlated with soil recalcitrant C and N contents. Our results revealed that changes in soil NH4+-N and pH along precipitation gradients primarily controlled the potential N mineralization, nitrification, and ammonification rates. In contrast, soil NO3−-N, soil pH, and plant N inputs predominantly regulated the potential N denitrification rate. Overall, our results reveal that soil N transformation varies along the precipitation gradient, and these results need to be considered when studying the effects of climate change on N cycling in grassland ecosystems across diverse environments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; N ammonification; N denitrification; N mineralization; N nitrification; Secondary grassland","Climate change; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Mineralogy; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Denitrification rate; N ammonification; N denitrification; N mineralization; N nitrification; N transformation; Precipitation gradients; Secondary grassland; Soil pH; Soil potential; Soils; ammonia; carbon; nitrate; nitrogen; ammonification; climate change; denitrification; grassland; inorganic nitrogen; mineralization; nitrification; nutrient cycling; precipitation (chemistry); soil chemistry; soil dynamics; soil nitrogen; ammonification; Article; biotransformation; China; climate change; controlled study; denitrification; grassland; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen dynamics; nitrogen mineralization; precipitation; soil acidity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104976528

For urban centers, the climate change issue presents unique challenges for each of these dimensions; however, its potential impacts on marginalized populations are extensive. This study draws from the ‘just sustainabilities’ (Agyeman, Bullard, and Evans 2003) framework and applies the concepts of distributive and procedural justice to examine whether, and to what extent, U.S. cities prioritize social equity concerns in adaptation plans. We perform a qualitative analysis of climate adaptation plans prepared by 22 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. We find that social equity concerns are particularly prominent in local-level climate adaptation discussions relative to those concerning environmental quality and economic development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Climate adaptation plan; Climate change; Social equity; Sustainability","climate change; economic development; environmental protection; environmental quality; equity; sustainability; urban planning; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106143822

Plants and their traits play a major role in the functioning of an ecosystem. Therefore, successful restoration towards long-term multifunctionality requires a fundamental mechanistic understanding of this link under changing climate. An integrated approach of empirical research and simulation modelling with a focus on plant traits can allow this understanding. Based on empirical data from a large-scale restoration project in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem in Western Australia, we developed and validated the spatially explicit simulation model Modelling Ecosystem Functions and Services based on Traits (ModEST), which calculates coupled dynamics of nutrients, water and individual plants characterised by functional traits. We then simulated all possible combinations of eight plant species with different levels of diversity to assess the role of plant diversity and traits on multifunctionality, the provision of six ecosystem functions that can be linked to ecosystem services, as well as trade-offs and synergies among the functions under current and future climatic conditions. Our results show that multifunctionality cannot fully be achieved because of trade-offs among functions that are attributable to sets of traits that affect functions differently. Our measure of multifunctionality was increased by higher levels of planted species richness under current, but not future climatic conditions. In contrast, single functions were differently impacted by increased plant diversity and thus the choice and weighting of these functions affected multifunctionality. In addition, we found that trade-offs and synergies among functions shifted with climate change due to different direct and indirect (mediated via community trait changes) effects of climate change on functions. Synthesis and application. With our simulation model Modelling Ecosystem Functions and Services based on Traits (ModEST), we show that restoration towards multifunctionality might be challenging not only under current conditions but also in the long-term. However, once ModEST is parameterised and validated for a specific restoration site, managers can assess which target goals can be achieved given the set of available plant species and site-specific conditions. It can also highlight which species combinations can best achieve long-term improved multifunctionality due to their trait diversity. © 2021 The Authors.

Implementation is politically difficult since it typically forces politicians to trade-off different concerns. The literature on how parties and members of parliament (MPs) handle these trade-offs is sparse. We use structural topic models to study how MPs in an oil dependent environment responded to a shock in the oil price that created spatially concentrated costs of climate policies. We leverage the rapid oil price drop between parliamentary sessions and MPs’ constituency adherence in a difference-in-differences framework to identify if MPs respond differently to variation in the salience of trade-offs. We find that MPs facing high political costs of climate policies tried to avoid environmental topics, while less affected MPs talked more about investments in green energy when the oil price declined. Our results suggest that the oil price bust created a ‘window of opportunity’ for advocates of the ‘ green shift’. © 2020 The Authors.

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question “How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?”. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Decision-making; Hydropower; Research-practice collaboration; Transdisciplinary; Usability gap","climate change; decision making; hydroelectric power; knowledge based system; research; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108830378

In the absence of these conditions, carbon finance provides perverse incentives that undermine biodiversity and human rights without storing carbon.

A combination of efficiency measures, integration of solar thermal collectors, waste heat utilization and seasonal storage is being considered to achieve these targets. However, the existing campus building infrastructure does not allow for an efficient immediate transition to a low-temperature solar district heating grid. Therefore, a stepwise transition with a successive reduction of the grid temperatures is investigated. Dynamic system simulations serve to compare transition strategies until 2050 with regard to their environmental performance and economic efficiency. The proposed strategies differ in dimensions of components as well as the timing of construction or decommissioning. Results indicate that the emission reduction target can be met most economically by a strategy with a gradual construction of 42,000 m2 of solar thermal collectors and a seasonal storage consisting of 37 boreholes of 750 m each, accompanied by a concurrent scaling-down of the existing CHP capacity. Compared to a strategy with an immediate construction of a full-sized system, the levelized cost of heat can be reduced from 7.6 ct/kWh to 6.3 ct/kWh, as projected renovation rates, energy prices and emission factors are taken into account better. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","4GDH; Borehole thermal energy storage; Life cycle assessment; Modelica; Solar district heating; Transition strategies","Boreholes; Costs; District heating; Emission control; Environmental management; Geothermal energy; Life cycle; Solar heating; Temperature; Waste heat; 4GDH; Borehole thermal energy storage; Efficiency measure; Emission reduction targets; Energy; Heat utilization; Modelica; Seasonal storage; Solar thermal collector; Transition strategy; Heat storage; decommissioning; economic analysis; emission control; energy storage; geothermal energy; heating; integrated approach; low temperature; smart grid; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105317335

This paper aims to present the environmental and economic aspects of different delivery means of transport in European urban areas. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is selected to analyse the environmental impact of several vehicles, allowing us to quantify the emissions according to the loading factor.

This regularity may arise from multiple sources, e.g., due to periodic changes in hardware or program state, program structure, inter-task dependence or inter-task interference. Such complexity can be better captured by a Markov Model, compared to the common approach of assuming independent and identically distributed random variables. However, despite the regularity that may be described with a Markov model, over time, the execution times may change, due to irregular changes in input, hardware state, or program state. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adapt the emission distributions of the Markov Model at runtime, in order to account for such irregular variation. A preprocessing step determines the number of states and the transition matrix of the Markov Model from a portion of the execution time sequence. In the preprocessing step, segments of the execution time trace with similar properties are identified and combined into clusters. At runtime, the proposed method switches between these clusters based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR). Using a Bayesian approach, clusters are updated and emission distributions estimated.

The study investigates the potential and the design challenges of Polar solar power plants through field measurements of a small-scale solar power plant with modules facing both sky and ground in Adventdalen, Svalbard. The climate is characterized by significant horizontal redistribution of snow due to little shelter and strong winds, causing snowdrifts to develop in the aerodynamic shade of the PV arrays. In this study we show that snowdrifts pose a significant challenge for solar power plants in Polar climates as they can grow to cover the plant, resulting in reduced power production and an imposed mechanical load on the PV arrays. The snowdrifts produced by the PV arrays exhibit a similarity with that produced by porous snow fences and it is argued that snow fence theory can be applied to PV arrays to control the accumulation. The results from solar power production indicates that the module yield is enhanced by the low temperatures as a seasonal performance ratio of 92.5% in combination with below-STC backsheet temperatures are measured. The bifacial gain displays a strong seasonal variation due to the presence snow cover and averages 14.7% annually. The findings indicate that the Polar climate enhance the module performance and that an adaption of solar power plant design is necessary for the system to be resilient to snowdrift development. © 2021 The Authors","Bifacial; Energy yield; Module temperature; Snow; Snow fence; Snowdrifts","Fences; Photovoltaic cells; Snow melting systems; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Bifacial; Design challenges; Energy yields; Module temperature; Polar solar power; Power; Power production; PV arrays; Snow fences; Snowdrift; Snow; array; design method; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power plant; seasonal variation; solar power; Adventdalen; Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107636321

Providing sustainable energy sources to meet this demand is crucial for emissions mitigation. District heating (DH) is energy agnostic, allowing a community to leverage low- or no-emission, locally occurring, natural and fabricated heat sources. The United States, while being the greatest energy consumer on a per capita basis, lacks the heat demand mapping intelligence necessary to plan for DH potential across communities. This work provides a method to map building-level heat demand using energy consumption surveys and property tax information in the absence of proprietary gas and electric utility data. Three demonstration municipalities in this work are from Washington, Idaho, and Montana. With demand mapping readily available in these areas and elsewhere, the policymaker, planner, and developer can quickly assess system potentials using Comsof Heat, a techno-economic simulation software for DH planning. This software auto-routes the necessary pipe networks along the lowest-cost pathways through a community to meet peak demand, providing multi-heat source integration. The constructed heat demand maps from these communities are imported to Comsof Heat to explore the hypothetical energy sources, payback periods, and decarbonization of building stocks using DH. Inconsistencies in structural data exist in property tax information across state, county, and municipal governments. These inconsistences can lead to uncertainties in heat demand mapping that could easily be overcome through greater coordination by local and regional GIS managers. Despite these uncertainties, it is still possible to characterize most commercial-residential heat demand across municipalities in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. These preliminary heat demand maps should be a public-facing product available from governments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building stock decarbonization; District heating; GIS; Municipal planning; Simulation; Sustainable energy","Computer software; District heating; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Housing; Investments; Mapping; Building levels; Building stock decarbonization; Heat demands; Montana; Municipal planning; Property taxes; Simulation; Sustainable energy; Uncertainty; Washington; Decarbonization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106272284

As bioethanol production with grain crops may become obsolete due to food security concerns, the Chinese government has advocated the development of non-grain bioethanol. According to the current actual situation of bioethanol development and China’s Liquid Biofuel Development Roadmap, we defined three stages of bioethanol development. We focused on the assessment of bioethanol feedstock resources and bioethanol yield potential in different stages using a comprehensive evaluation system integrating statistical meth-ods, crop growth process models, and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The consid-ered feedstocks included corn, sweet sorghum, cassava, switchgrass, crop straw, and forest resi-dues. The spatial–temporal characteristics of the regional bioethanol distribution were discussed. The results indicate that the total resources of corn, sweet sorghum, cassava, switchgrass, crop straws, and forest residues were about 257.17, 2083.55, 44.36, 357.56, 1031.62, and 924 million tons at different time points, respectively. In the first stage, the year 2020, the potential bioethanol totaled 21.55 million tons. An advantage in bioethanol development was demonstrated by Northeast China. A positive development situation was also identified in East China, such as in Tianjin. In the second stage, from 2020 to 2030, the potential bioethanol production is estimated to be 145.42 million tons. The bioethanol development potential will increase in South China, in areas such as Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou. In the third stage, the potential bioethanol based on switchgrass is estimated to be 92.99 million tons. The potential bioethanol based on crop straws and forest residues will be 14.76 million tons if 5% of these feedstocks are fully used for producing bioethanol. Regions with a large development potential will be further expanded. Interregional bioethanol flows and international cooperation will help meet the whole nation’s requirement. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, there is an urgent need to find a method to detect TC that is practical, rapid, sensitive, and offers ready visualization of TC levels so that adequate remediation measures can be immediately implemented. Herein, we report a fluorescent and colorimetric dual-mode nanosensor for the detection of TC based on reduced state carbon dots (r-CDs). In the presence of TC, the emission fluorescence of r-CDs was quenched by the Förster resonance energy transfer mechanism to achieve high-sensitivity detection of TC with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.73 nM. Moreover, TC was also detected by r-CDs via a noticeable color change of the solution (from colorless to red) with the naked eye, having an LOD of 0.46 μM. Furthermore, r-CDs have excellent selectivity and sensitivity in detecting TC in wastewater, and therefore, have practical applications in wastewater treatment. The fluorescent and colorimetric dual-mode proposed in this work may offer a unique idea for the detection of TC, with great prospects for environmental wastewater applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dots; Dual-mode; Fluorescent and colorimetric; Nanosensor; Tetracycline detection","Carbon; Color; Colorimetry; Energy transfer; Health risks; Nanosensors; Wastewater treatment; Carbon dots; Dual modes; Environmental problems; Fluorescent and colorimetric; Heteroatoms; Large amounts; Mode detection; Reduced-state; Risk to human health; Tetracycline detection; Fluorescence; carbon; ethylenediamine; phosphoric acid; reduced state carbon dots; sucrose; tetracycline; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; carbon; fluorescent dye; quantum dot; tetracycline; calorimetry; carbon; detection method; fluorescence; remediation; resonance; sensor; wastewater treatment; Article; colorimetry; concentration (parameter); fluorescence analysis; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; limit of detection; process optimization; quantum yield; sensitivity analysis; wastewater; ecosystem; human; wastewater; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Carbon; Colorimetry; Ecosystem; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Quantum Dots; Tetracycline; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105326138

Given that spatial distribution of IE is irrelevant to space agents commonly used (such as population and nighttime light), estimation and spatialization methods for total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are not entirely suitable for IE. Therefore, this paper used greenhouse gases observing satellite level 4A product to estimate IE at the city level and used industrial land density to obtain the distribution of IE within the administrative districts. Sectoral emission inventories of 182 cities and a mosaic Asian anthropogenic emission inventory named MIX were used to verify the results. Then, spatiotemporal variation characteristics of China’s IE were analyzed from multiple levels. Results showed that (1) the mean relative error of estimation results was 56.11%, among which 62 cities had relative error of less than 30%. Gridded IE in this paper had high consistency with MIX. (2) Cities with high IE experienced rapid growth from 2009 to 2012, followed by slower growth from 2012 to 2017. (3) Centroid of significant cold and hot spots moved to the southeast and northwest, respectively. Most cities with high annual IE growth had relatively low emission efficiency, mainly located in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Aggregation of medium and high IE grids may represent high emission efficiency. Significant differences still exist between cities in IE, and sustainable development strategies should be formulated according to local conditions. Regions with high annual growth or low emission efficiency are the key to achieving IE reduction targets in future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Industrial carbon emissions; Multi-source data; Spatiotemporal variation","anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; emission control; emission inventory; exploration; industrial emission; satellite altimetry; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Nei Monggol; Xinjiang Uygur; carbon dioxide; China; city; greenhouse gas; industry; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Greenhouse Gases; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103198799

Harbor cities in China have put much effort into expanding the business of their ports, ignoring the overlapping of hinterland markets with other ports. Excess resources expended by ports may intensify regional environmental issues, such as carbon emissions. Motivated by the emissions reduction targets proposed by the International Maritime Organization and the urgent need for the development of green and sustainable ports, the Chinese government is trying to draft a carbon constraint policy to prevent the disorderly development of ports. It is thus necessary to study competition strategies under the context of carbon emission constraints. In this paper, the improved Hotelling model is used to describe the competitive relationship between ports. Then, three competition scenarios of the seaports under no carbon emissions policy, a carbon emission cap policy, and a carbon cap-and-trade policy are examined to analyze the effects of carbon emissions policy on port service prices, demand for goods, maximum profits, and social welfare. The results show that (1) from the perspective of port managers, only when government-defined carbon emission limits are lower than the critical value, the carbon cap policy is binding on port competition; when it comes to the cap-and-trade policy, government-defined carbon emission limits only affect profits. (2) From the government's perspective, the cap-and-trade policy maximizes social welfare more than the other policies regardless of the value of government-defined carbon emission limits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions policy; Competitive analysis; Harbor city; Seaports","Commerce; Emission control; Ports and harbors; Profitability; Public policy; A-carbon; Cap and trade; Carbon emission policy; Carbon emissions; Competition strategy; Competitive analysis; Emission limits; Harbor city; Seaport; Trade policies; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106356904

To jump-start their market deployment, regulations in China, the U.S., and the European Union provide preferential treatments, including counting a single plug-in electric vehicle with multipliers (super-credits) in calculating sales-averaged emissions (regulation dilution effect) and considering zero emissions for the electric mileage by omitting electricity generation emissions (regulation leakage effect). This study quantifies greenhouse gas emission increases due to these two effects in the three markets. We show that plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2012–2025 in the three markets will result in greenhouse gas emission increases of more than 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through 2050 relative to the case without the two effects. The increase is 671, 280, and 143 million tonnes in China, the U.S., and the EU, respectively. The dilution effect causes an increase of 615 million tonnes, and the leakage effect 479 million tonnes.

This calls into question how much herbivory can be sustained by seagrass meadows that these turtle populations feed on. In our study, we documented the long-term impacts of green turtle foraging on seagrass meadows in the Lakshadweep archipelago, Indian Ocean. We tracked green turtle densities and seagrass areal extent in five atolls across the archipelago since 2005. Turtle densities first grew to record levels in the seagrass meadow of the Agatti lagoon around 15 years ago. Within a few years of intense herbivory, the meadow underwent radical biomass reduction and compositional shifts, leading to functional extinction and ultimately, bare sand. This trajectory of decline wtas repeated in every atoll, with turtle aggregations persisting 2 to 6 years before meadows were depleted, depending on their initial size. By 2019, all large meadows had declined, and in 2020, green turtles were distributed at low densities in every meadow. The meadows were limited to small patches of early successional species, maintained in a state of protracted recovery by constant, low-level herbivory. We measured the impacts of turtles on two key ecosystem services, a habitat for fish communities and stored organic carbon. Turtle overgrazing resulted in massive declines in seagrass fish diversity, biomass, and abundance, and major reductions in sediment-stored carbon. Apart from being important conservation flagships, green turtles are strong ecosystem interactors, and can potentially cause trophic cascades or functional extinction of seagrass ecosystems. © 2021","Foraging aggregations; Habitat loss; Mega-herbivores; Overgrazing; Phase shift","archipelago; biomass; conservation management; ecological impact; ecosystem management; extinction; foraging behavior; herbivory; overgrazing; population decline; seagrass meadow; turtle; Agatti; India; Indian Ocean; Lakshadweep; Chelonia mydas; Testudines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107114737

Yet, how diverse groups of organisms associated with an invasive plant change simultaneously with latitude and the roles of climate and plant invasion remains unclear. We conducted a field survey of plants (native vs exotic), soil fungi (pathogenic, saprotrophic, arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi) and arthropods (herbivores, predators and detritivores) associated with the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides at 49 sites spanning 14 latitudinal degrees in China. Results showed that diversity and composition of these functional groups changed differently with latitude, partially due to their specific responses to climate, invasion of A. philoxeroides and other biotic environments. Moreover, A. philoxeroides invasion and/or composition of other plants, rather than climate, predicted the diversity and richness of major functional groups and partly explained variance in composition of putative fungal pathogens. Our results suggest that climate and plant invasion could affect the diversity and composition of diverse groups of organisms simultaneously and their relative importance might vary among functional groups. Thus, it is necessary to explore latitudinal patterns and underlying drivers of diverse groups of organisms simultaneously to improve our ability to predict and mitigate threats posed by plant invasion and climate change. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation.","aboveground arthropod community; climate; community composition; exotic plant invasion; fungal pathogens; latitudinal biodiversity pattern; plant community; soil fungal community","arbuscular mycorrhiza; arthropod; community structure; ectomycorrhiza; field survey; functional group; introduced species; microbial community; native species; plant community; species diversity; China; Alternanthera philoxeroides; Arthropoda; biodiversity; China; microbiology; plant; soil; Biodiversity; China; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107984323

These biosignatures preserve the long-term evolution of the microorganism-hosted metabolic machinery responsible for producing deviations in the isotopic compositions of inorganic and organic carbon. Despite billions of years of ecosystem turnover, evolutionary innovation, organismic complexification, and geological events, the organic carbon that is a residuum of the global marine biosphere in the rock record tells an essentially static story. The ~25‰ mean deviation between inorganic and organic 13C/12C values has remained remarkably unchanged over &gt;3.5 billion years. The bulk of this record is conventionally attributed to early-evolved, RuBisCO-mediated CO2 fixation that, in extant oxygenic phototrophs, produces comparable isotopic effects and dominates modern primary production. However, billions of years of environmental transition, for example, in the progressive oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere, would be expected to have accompanied shifts in the predominant RuBisCO forms as well as enzyme-level adaptive responses in RuBisCO CO2-specificity. These factors would also be expected to result in preserved isotopic signatures deviating from those produced by extant RuBisCO in oxygenic phototrophs. Why does the bulk carbon isotope record not reflect these expected environmental transitions and evolutionary innovations? Here, we discuss this apparent discrepancy and highlight the need for greater quantitative understanding of carbon isotope fractionation behavior in extant metabolic pathways. We propose novel, laboratory-based approaches to reconstructing ancestral states of carbon metabolisms and associated enzymes that can constrain isotopic biosignature production in ancient biological systems. Together, these strategies are crucial for integrating the complementary toolsets of biological and geological sciences and for interpretation of the oldest record of life on Earth. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"bioactivity; carbon isotope; coevolution; isotopic composition; marine environment; microorganism; origin of life; preservation; carbon; atmosphere; ecosystem; geology; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Earth, Planet; Ecosystem; Geology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104242517

Long-term average climate data are often used to evaluate the climate suitability of an area, but in these aggregated climate datasets, inter-annual variability is lost. Due to non-linearity in species’ biological responses to climate, estimates of long-term climate suitability from average climate data may be biased and so differ from estimates derived from the average annual suitability over the same period (average response). We investigate the extent to which such differences manifest in a regional assessment of climate suitability for 255 plant species across two 17-year time periods. Location: Cornwall in South-West England provides a case study. Taxon: Plantae. Methods: We run a simple mechanistic climate suitability model and derive quantitative estimates of climate suitability for 1984–2000 and 2001–2017. For each period, we run the model using climate data representing average monthly values for that period. We then run the model for each year using monthly climate data for that year and average the annual suitability scores across each period (average response). We compare estimates of climate suitability from these two approaches. Results: Average climate data gave higher estimates of suitability than the average response, suggesting bias against years of poor suitability in temporally aggregated climate datasets. Differences between suitability estimates were larger in areas of high climate variability and correlated with species’ environmental requirements, being larger for species with small thermal niches and narrow ranges of precipitation tolerance. Main Conclusions: Incorporating inter-annual variability into climate suitability assessments or understanding the extent to which average climate data might obscure this variance will be important to predict reliably the impacts of climate change on species distributions and should be considered when using mechanistic species distribution models. © 2021 The Authors.

Super passive optical network (Super-PON), a prominent next generation Ethernet PON (NG-EPON) candidate, can suffice this exponentially increasing data rate requirements. However, to appease such requirements, it employs many transceivers and increases the power-consumption of the network. In this work, we focus on reducing the carbon footprint of Super-PON and propose power-efficient dynamic bandwidth and wavelength allocation (DBWA) algorithms, namely best fit bin-packing sleep mode aware (BF-SMA) and updated BF-SMA (UBF-SMA). The proposed algorithms use SMA for bandwidth scheduling and different bin-packing techniques for wavelength allocation. In bin-packing, the number of available wavelengths and their efficient allocation is based on the network load. For restricting the number of available wavelengths, we can switch off the non-essential transceivers at the OLT, which also helps in maximizing the wavelength utilization and increasing the power efficiency. The simulation results show that in comparison to the state-of-the-art DBWA algorithms, the proposed algorithms improve the power efficiency and reduce the average delay of a Super-PON system. Furthermore, we use Jain’s fairness index to validate the fairness of the proposed DBWA algorithms. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,"Bandwidth; Carbon footprint; Efficiency; Transceivers; Allocation algorithm; Bandwidth scheduling; Dynamic bandwidth; Efficient allocations; Network provider; Power efficiency; State of the art; Wavelength utilization; Passive optical networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112008009

To understand how and why these changes came about, we revisit the question whether personal experiences with increasingly unusual local weather conditions affect people’s beliefs about climate change and their related attitudes. We first take a closer look at the theoretical underpinnings and extend the theoretical argument to account for the differential impact of different weather phenomena, as well as the role of prior beliefs and individual reference frames. Applying mixed-effects regressions to a novel dataset combining individual-level multi-wave panel survey data from up to 18,010 German voters collected from 2016 to 2019 with weather data from 514 weather stations, we show that personally experiencing unusual or extreme local weather did not shape people’s awareness of climate change as a political problem or their climate policy preferences in a sustained manner. Even among people who may be considered most likely to exhibit such effects, we did not detect them. Moreover, we demonstrate that the common modeling strategy of combining fixed-effects regression with clustered standard errors leads to severely reduced standard errors and substantively different results. We conclude that it cannot be taken for granted that personally experiencing extreme weather phenomena makes a difference in perceptions of climate change and related policy preferences. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Experiential learning; Mixed-effects regression; Panel data; Policy preferences","Voltage measurement; Climate protection; Individual levels; Local weather conditions; Personal experience; Political problems; Theoretical arguments; Weather phenomena; Weather stations; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112645586

Hence, decarbonising this sector is increasingly recognized as an important means of mitigating climate change, which is reflected in numerous smart city initiatives. However, existing studies thereon have focused almost exclusively on energy and CO2, thereby neglecting the consumption of material resources required to transform urban transport systems so as to be compatible with a low carbon future. In this study, we hence investigate the effects of transforming urban transport systems on future material stock and material flows using the city of Vienna as a case study. For this purpose, a material flow analysis for the infrastructure and vehicles required until 2050 has been conducted taking different scenarios into consideration, which are mainly characterized by different modal splits. The results show that different paths of development among the various transport modes significantly affect the overall material stocks and flows. If the modal split remains constant, the road-infrastructure has to be further expended to provide the transport service needed due to the expected increase in population in Vienna. The material stock per capita for the transport system remains constant at around 54 t/capita for this scenario. If the motorized individual transport can be reduced to a share of less than 10% of all trips (today's share amounts to 25%), the material stock per capita decreases to around 47 t/capita in 2050. As this case allows for infrastructure (e.g. parking infrastructure, road lanes) to be dismantled, the annual material demand for maintenance efforts is also reduced by a fifth (to 460 kg/cap/yr). Despite the reduction in material stocks and flows achievable by changing the current modal split, a significant change in the waste composition in terms of the end-of-life vehicles generated is to be expected in the coming decades. Annual quantities of old batteries, for instance, might rise from today's 1.5 kg/capita up to 70 kg/capita. These changes will definitely challenge the waste management sector, but also represent an opportunity for the recovery of valuable resources. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the transformation of an urban transport system towards lower greenhouse gas emissions also has the potential to reduce future material demand and waste generation.

However, the question remains as to whether increased shipping in the future will counteract these emission reductions. The overall goal of this study is to provide an up-to-date view on future ship emissions and provide a holistic view on atmospheric pollutants and their contribution to air quality in the Nordic (and Arctic) area. The first step has been to set up new and detailed scenarios for the potential developments in global shipping emissions, including different regulations and new routes in the Arctic. The scenarios include a Baseline scenario and two additional SOx Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and heavy fuel oil (HFO) ban scenarios. All three scenarios are calculated in two variants involving Business-As-Usual (BAU) and High-Growth (HiG) traffic scenarios. Additionally a Polar route scenario is included with new ship traffic routes in the future Arctic with less sea ice. This has been combined with existing Current Legislation scenarios for the land-based emissions (ECLIPSE V5a) and used as input for two Nordic chemistry transport models (DEHM and MATCH). Thereby, the current (2015) and future (2030, 2050) air pollution levels and the contribution from shipping have been simulated for the Nordic and Arctic areas. Population exposure and the number of premature deaths attributable to air pollution in the Nordic area have thereafter been assessed by using the health assessment model EVA (Economic Valuation of Air pollution). It is estimated that within the Nordic region approximately 9900 persons died prematurely due to air pollution in 2015 (corresponding to approximately 37 premature deaths for every 100 000 inhabitants). When including the projected development in both shipping and land-based emissions, this number is estimated to decrease to approximately 7900 in 2050. Shipping alone is associated with about 850 premature deaths during present-day conditions (as a mean over the two models), decreasing to approximately 600 cases in the 2050 BAU scenario. Introducing a HFO ban has the potential to lower the number of cases associated with emissions from shipping to approximately 550 in 2050, while the SECA scenario has a smaller impact. The ""worst-case""scenario of no additional regulation of shipping emissions combined with a high growth in the shipping traffic will, on the other hand, lead to a small increase in the relative impact of shipping, and the number of premature deaths related to shipping is in that scenario projected to be around 900 in 2050. This scenario also leads to increased deposition of nitrogen and black carbon in the Arctic, with potential impacts on environment and climate. © 2021 Camilla Geels et al.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; health impact; holistic approach; shipping; traffic emission; Arctic; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113367812

So, decision support tools, on-farm nutrient cycling models, and life cycle assessment tools to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems that include manure typically use ambient air temperature as a surrogate for manure temperature. This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms' unique abilities to predict manure temperature based on measured data. The data was collected from two on-farm manure storages (clay pit and concrete tank) instrumented with sensors to acquire manure temperature at various depths during the storage period. The local weather data (ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall) were recorded by stations installed at each farm. The data were subjected to four machine learning algorithms gradient boosted trees, bagged tree ensembles, random forest ensembles, and neural networks using the supervised learning approach. The weather data and two additional parameters, time (month) and the manure depth above a sensor, were derived and used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Further, the developed machine learning algorithms were challenged with parameters from historical weather data (1990 to 2020) to assess their suitability to predict manure temperature where local weather is not available. The results showed that, in general, the stored manure temperature lagged but followed a similar trend as the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The average manure temperature was higher than the ambient air temperature for most of the year. Depth influenced the manure temperature; manure in the top layers had a higher temperature during warm periods than the bottom layers, and vice versa during cold seasons. The ensemble models performed better than the neural networks by predicting manure temperatures closer to the measured values and predictions during the scenario analysis. The random forests and bagged tree ensembles were the best performers. Models tended to make better predictions as the depth of manure above a sensor increased. This work will provide added value for developing better decision support tools and models for assessing nutrient cycling on farms. It also informs our knowledge to develop emission mitigation strategies during manure storage, leading to more sustainable manure management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Dairy manure; Machine learning; Manure emissions; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Meteorology; Nutrients; Solar radiation; Wind; Ambient air temperature; Dairy manures; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Manure emission; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature; Nutrients cycling; Support tool; Weather data; Machine learning; agricultural production; air temperature; algorithm; assessment method; detection method; gas storage; machine learning; sensor; solar radiation; storage; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107583950

Community-level assessment of flowering phenology allows understanding variations across seasons and years and the risks of decoupling flowering and pollinators’ activity. We evaluated flowering patterns and temporal diversity of pollination systems in a tropical seasonal forest. We asked whether the temporal organization of flowering times differs among pollination systems; if there is a constancy of pollination systems through the year, since climate and phylogenies constraint flowering time; if there is a prevalent flowering pattern by pollination system, and if the temporal organization of pollination systems by modularity analyses is coherent with grouping by pre-defined seasons. We characterized 10 pollination systems, examined flowering strategies, climate cues and phylogenetic constraints. Pollination by large-to-medium bees dominated (49.2%), followed by diverse insects (22.1%) and flies (14.7%). The remaining systems represented 14% of species. Flowering occurred year-round for most pollination systems, predominating the seasonal flowering strategy. Flowering patterns ranged from aggregated to nested, and random. Climate affected the flowering of most pollination systems, but there was no phylogeny constraint. Modularity grouped pollination systems differently than rainfall seasonality. Contrasting the expectations of reduced temporal constancy, most systems were present year-round, facilitating the exploitation of floral resources by pollinators. Diversity of pollination systems remained constant despite climate seasonality, indicating that several factors influence the optimum flowering time for pollination in seasonally dry vegetations. Global warming may disrupt phenological patterns and the temporal organization of plant communities, a matter for future studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate; Flowering patterns; Flowering strategy; Pollination systems; Temporal organization","assessment method; flower visiting; flowering; global warming; phenology; phylogeny; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; seasonal variation; seasonality; temporal variation; tropical forest; Hexapoda; animal; bee; flower; forest; phylogeny; pollination; season; Animals; Bees; Flowers; Forests; Phylogeny; Pollination; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111349052

Abstract: Maximizing carbon sequestration for a given water budget is extremely important in the contest of climate change in the Mediterranean region, which is characterized by increasing temperatures and rising water stress. This issue is fundamental for plantation stands, where limited water availability during the growing season reduces CO2 assimilation and, consequently, tree growth. In this study, the main objective was to investigate the performances in terms of carbon–water balance of conifer (Pinus halepensis and Cupressus sempervirens) and hardwood (Quercus robur, Juglans regia, Fraxinus excelsior and Populus spp.) mixed plantations. To this aim, we used carbon isotope signatures to evaluate the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and the species-specific relationship between basal area increments (BAI) and iWUE. At the species level, the highest iWUE values corresponded to the lowest carbon accumulation in terms of BAI, for water-saving species such as Cupressus. Conversely, Populus had the lowest iWUE and the highest BAI accumulation. Juglans, Fraxinus, and Pinus showed the most balanced ratio between BAI and iWUE. Overall, no clear correlation of iWUE and BAI was evident within all species, except for Populus and Cupressus. Considering projected aridification and increased temperatures that will negatively impact the growth, our data suggest that Pinus, for conifers, and Quercus, Juglans, Fraxinus for hardwood species should be preferred when choosing species for forestry plantation, as they performed better in terms of BAI and iWUE ratio. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon isotope composition; Forest productivity; Plantations; Tree growth; Water-use efficiency","Budget control; Carbon; Climate change; Efficiency; Hardwoods; Timber; Water conservation; Basal area increment; Carbon sequestration; Forestry plantation; Fraxinus excelsiors; Increased temperature; Increasing temperatures; Intrinsic water-use efficiencies; Mediterranean region; Forestry; Carbon; Cost Control; Efficiency; Forestry; Hardwoods; Water Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103391219

The adaptation of plants is a particularly important aspect of it and contributes to assess the variations in biodiversity to expect in the near future in the attempt of understanding the possible consequences. In this research, some significant forest areas of the Tuscan Apennines, which are featured by a complex and varied territory from a climatic point of view, have been taken into consideration. Four historical weather stations were considered, in order to verify climate trends and their mutual correlations. In-depth analyses were carried out to identify climate trends and check whether there are recurring periods in the climate, as seemed to be highlighted by previous studies on silver fir forests. The results were surprising as inhomogeneous distribution of temperatures during time between the different sites sampled was observed, and clustering of the sites showed variability through space and time. In addition, a return period of 6–7 years was identified in the historical temperature series through Fourier analysis, outlining a cyclical trend of the same; that could be reflected in the growth trends of trees. Furthermore the analysis revealed that the use of master series of the climate variable as representative of trends across the study area can lead to not detecting relevant information relating to climate/tree growth relationships both at the forest landscape level and at the forest unit level, thus affecting the accuracy and validity of forest management plans. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Agglomerative hierarchical clustering; Climate change; Fourier spectral analysis; Tree growth","climate change; forest management; growth response; return period; temperature; trend analysis; Apennines; Italy; Tuscany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110500112

An electric vehicle model is developed in MATLAB Simulink to analyze the impact of various factors on the driving range and validation of the range prediction model. A comparative study on different neural network models is done using the Keras framework to select the best suited regression model to predict the driving range based on prediction error. The analysis reveals the impact of various factors like driver behaviour, exploitation environment, battery parameters, and auxiliary loads on the driving range. For the test data, the bidirectional long short-term memory shows the minimum error compared to other sequential models with a mean square error of 0.029 km in the prediction of driving range.

Rice is an important staple food, especially in Senegal. The scope for increase in rice production under irrigated conditions is uncertain. Rainfed rice is therefore a key component for regional food security impelling agronomists to assess climate change impact on rainfed rice yield and to design rainfed rice ideotypes suited to future climate scenarios. The DSSAT CSM-CERES-Rice model was thus calibrated and evaluated on 19 agronomic experiments conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2014, in 6 locations, with 21 cultivars and two fertilization levels (20 and 80 kg N ha−1). Simulations were then carried out with the crop model forced with the downscaled projections of seven climate models, with and without considering the impact of an increase in atmospheric [CO2], using an ensemble of global circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Simulated rice yield was divided by two over the century with RCP8.5 and stagnated with RCP2.6. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased yields, but this effect could not offset the yield decline due to elevated temperatures. Cultivars with longer vegetative phases and greater temperature tolerance were better adapted to climate change than current cultivars. Using these new cultivars with the recommended fertilization rate (80 kg N ha−1) could offset the yield decline due to climate change. For the first time, we bring together a study based on a process-based crop model handling crop response to elevated [CO2], a large set of field experiments and up-to-date climate projections (i) to provide useful insights into plausible impacts of climate change on rainfed rice in Senegal and (ii) to identify cultivar characteristics relevant for adaptation to future possible climates.

The study thus, appraises determinant factors of farmers' adaptation strategies to climate variability in purposely selected from kir and Eliya kebeles in Itang Special district, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 188 randomly selected sample households using pretested questionnaire survey. The supplementary data were collected from purposely selected eight key informants, (xxxx) focus group participants. The rainfall and temperature data (1983–2016) were also collected from Ethiopia's National Meteorological Agency (NMA). The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The main climate variability adaptation responses were found to be changing farming calendar, collecting fruits and roots, flood recession farming, and growing short maturing crop varieties were widely implemented climate variability adaptation responses. The result shows that gender, age, family size, education level, livestock holding, access to extension, access to information and access to weather information have statistically significant (P < 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1) impact on the choice of adaptation responses. We recommend that climate variability and extremes risk could be reduced through strengthening the provision of extension and basic infrastructure services and facilitates. © 2021","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate Variability; Determinants of adaptation; Itang","accessibility; adaptive management; agricultural extension; climate change; crop production; farmers knowledge; farming system; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112538359

In this paper, a hybrid system is developed and analyzed for liquefied natural gas, natural gas liquids and power tri-generation using LNG/NGLs recovery system, absorption–compression combined refrigeration, organic Rankine cycle and solar parabolic trough collectors. This integrated structure produces 54.12 kg s−1 NGLs, 66.52 kg s−1 LNG and 278.5 MW net power output. Specific power consumption, thermal and exergy efficiencies of the hybrid system are 0.3771 kWh kg−1 LNG, 78.38% and 84.47%, respectively. The pinch method is used to extract the heat exchanger network related to the multi-stream heat exchanger of the hybrid system. To simulate the integrated structure, MATLAB programming, HYSYS and TRNSYS software with the weather conditions of Bandar Abbas city in Iran are used. The effect of natural gas composition entering the cycle on system parameters is studied and reported. Results show that with the reduction in methane percentage in natural gas to 55 mol%, specific power consumption increases to 0.6004 kWh kg−1 LNG, and thermal efficiency decreases to 71.61%. The integrated structural behavior at different operating conditions is used to investigate the sensitivity analysis.

Rice is known as a strategic crop and rice husk is a cheap and available feedstock material for biochar in particular in Asia. We conducted a field experiment with laboratory biochar (LB) and locally produced [in-situ biochar (IB)] applied at rates of 10 and 20 t ha−1 using a randomized block design in three replicates to examine the efficiency of IB for improving soil condition for rice production, and to propose a cheap and in-farm applicable measure to decrease greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from the agricultural sector. Grain yield significantly increased following biochar addition by 52.2%, 53.2%, 65.4%, and 67.2% in LB10, IB10, LB20, and IB20, respectively. Total biomass in all biochar treatments had a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) compared with our control and the highest biomass belonged to LB20 and IB20 with 12.2 and 15.7 t ha1, respectively. The highest grain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium was in IB20. Compared to the control, IB20 significantly decreased emissions of CH4 by 72.3%, N2O by 85.8%, and CO2 by 32.9%. IB is as effective as LB.

A clear and transparent harmonisation process promotes a consistent interpretation of the modelling outcomes divergences and, reducing the model variance, is instrumental to the use of integrated assessment models to support policy decision-making. Despite its crucial role for climate economic policies, the definition of a comprehensive harmonisation methodology for integrated assessment modelling remains an open challenge for the scientific community. This paper proposes a framework for a harmonisation methodology with the definition of indispensable steps and recommendations to overcome stumbling blocks in order to reduce the variance of the outcomes which depends on controllable modelling assumptions. The harmonisation approach of the PARIS REINFORCE project is presented here to layout such a framework. A decomposition analysis of the harmonisation process is shown through 6 integrated assessment models (GCAM, ICES-XPS, MUSE, E3ME, GEMINI-E3, and TIAM). Results prove the potentials of the proposed framework to reduce the model variance and present a powerful diagnostic tool to feedback on the quality of the harmonisation itself. © 2021","Harmonisation; Integrated assessment modelling; Model inter-comparison","Climate models; Economics; Decisions makings; Economic policies; Global integrated assessments; Harmonisation; Integrated assessment modelling; Intercomparisons; Model intercomparisons; Model response; Policy decisions; Support policy; Decision making; comparative study; conceptual framework; environmental assessment; environmental policy; heterogeneity; modeling; article; decomposition; France; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104344014

There are concerns, though, about their emission performance when tested at or above the boundaries of ambient and driving conditions requirements of RDE regulations. In this study, a Euro 6d-Temp gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicle with threeway catalyst and gasoline particulate filter was tested on the road and in a laboratory at temperatures ranging between −30◦C and 50◦C, with cycles simulating urban congested traffic, uphill driving while towing a trailer at 85% of the vehicle’s maximum payload, and dynamic driving. The vehicle respected the Euro 6 emission limits, even though they were not applicable to the specific cycles, which were outside of the RDE environmental and trip boundary conditions. Most of the emissions were produced during cold starts and at low ambient temperatures. Heavy traffic, dynamic driving, and high payload were found to increase emissions depending on the pollutant. Even though this car was one of the lowest emitting cars found in the literature, the proposed future Euro 7 limits will require a further decrease in cold start emissions in order to ensure low emission levels under most ambient and driving conditions, particularly in urban environments. Nevertheless, motorway emissions will also have to be controlled well. © 2021 by the authors.

B vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism regulation (folate, riboflavin, vitamins B6 and B12) are critical nutrients contributing to homocysteine and epigenetic regulation. Although cross-sectional B vitamin intake in ageing populations is characterised, longitudinal changes are infrequently reported. This systematic review explores age-related changes in dietary adequacy of folate, riboflavin, vitamins B6 and B12 in community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years at follow-up). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, databases (MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, CINAHL) were systematically screened, yielding 1579 records; eight studies were included (n 3119 participants, 2-25 years of follow-up). Quality assessment (modified Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale) rated all of moderate-high quality. The estimated average requirement cut-point method estimated the baseline and follow-up population prevalence of dietary inadequacy. Riboflavin (seven studies, n 1953) inadequacy progressively increased with age; the prevalence of inadequacy increased from baseline by up to 22.6 and 9.3 % in males and females, respectively. Dietary folate adequacy (three studies, n 2321) improved in two studies (by up to 22.4 %), but the third showed increasing (8.1 %) inadequacy. Evidence was similarly limited (two studies, respectively) and inconsistent for vitamins B6 (n 559;-9.9 to 47.9 %) and B12 (n 1410;-4.6 to 7.2 %). This review emphasises the scarcity of evidence regarding micronutrient intake changes with age, highlighting the demand for improved reporting of longitudinal changes in nutrient intake that can better direct micronutrient recommendations for older adults. © The Author(s), 2020.

This study examines the effects of highly ambitious, yet feasible, building energy efficiency upgrades in the United States. Our energy efficiency scenarios, derived from the literature, lead to a 6 to 11% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 18 to 25% reductions in particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in 2050. These reductions are complementary with a carbon pricing policy on electricity. However, our results also point to the importance of mitigating indoor PM2.5 emissions, improving PM2.5 filtration, and evaluating ventilation-related policies. Even with no further ventilation improvements, we estimate that intensive energy efficiency scenarios could prevent 1800 to 3600 premature deaths per year across the United States in 2050.

Understanding the drought characteristics of possible future scenarios under climate change requires verification of past drought events using appropriate drought indices. Consequently, this study investigates the application of two widely used drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized streamflow index (SSI), to characterize historical droughts, drought trends, and their impact on water quality and stream integrity for a selected study basin in New Jersey. Results indicated that both SPI and SSI were able to identify historical drought events, including three drought emergency periods and the most recent drought-watch periods. A significant positive meteorological drought was observed at the western side of the basin, whilst a significant positive hydrological drought was found in the eastern side. The average pollutant concentration of drought periods were lesser than non-drought periods due to reduction of different processes, such as erosion and transport of sediment and nutrients into rivers and streams, during drought periods as opposed to non-drought periods.

While maintaining the same underlying focus, over the past twenty years US agricultural policy has shifted from decoupled income support to price- and revenue-based counter-cyclical subsidy programmes, increased the coverage under a plethora of heavily subsidised agricultural insurance initiatives, and expanded the scope of conservation programmes. Further, between 2018 and 2020, there were unprecedented levels of additional spending through ad hoc measures to compensate producers for losses sustained as a result of the Trump administration’s trade wars and, more recently, losses attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. These levels of spending have been criticised as excessive relative to actual losses and likely caused the United States to violate its WTO domestic support commitments. However, US agricultural subsidy initiatives could soon involve more changes. The Biden administration wants to refocus some agricultural expenditure towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing concerns about the lack of financial support for minority groups, but probably not at the expense of funding for current programmes. © 2021 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists",,"agricultural policy; agricultural trade; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; international trade; minority group; trend analysis; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113908410

The task of reducing the level of air pollution is highlighted in the UN program documents as one of the main priorities. The most problematic in terms of air pollution in Russia are 12 cities, seven of which have ferrous metallurgy enterprises. The problems of ecological development of large industrial centers remain, despite the implementation of the state program of the Russian Federation “Environmental Protection” since 2012, and the national project “Ecology” since 2019, the introduction of a quota system for pollutant emissions, the definition of a list of compensation measures and the creation of a federal state information system for monitoring the quality of atmospheric air. In cities such as Krasnoyarsk and Novokuznetsk, the average actual annual concentration of some pollutants that are highly toxic and carcinogenic substances of I and II hazard classes exceeds the maximum permissible concentration by 5–6 times. The content of reports of specialized state authorities of the regional level on the state and protection of the environment has been analyzed. It is concluded that there is no unity of methodological approaches to the presentation of analytical information on the state and quality of atmospheric air in reports, as well as the untimely publication of the reports themselves. The fact of inertia of the institutional environment was revealed in terms of including irrelevant norms in the adopted normative legal acts, and as a result, the emergence of expenditure obligations of budgets, the real need for which is absent. It was established that large enterprises of ferrous metallurgy (PJSC Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Combine (Mechel) and LLC Krasnoyarsk Metallurgical Plant), operating in cities with high levels of air pollution, did not draw up corporate non-financial reporting in the GRI format. © 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.","air quality; corporate non-financial reporting; emissions of pollutants; maximum permissible concentration of pollutants; pollution level; state and protection of the environment; sustainable development goals","Budget control; Environmental regulations; Finance; Industrial emissions; Metallurgy; Metals; Planning; Sustainable development; Corporate non-financial reporting; Corporates; Emission of pollutant; Financial reporting; Maximum permissible concentration; Maximum permissible concentration of pollutant; Pollution level; Protection of the environments; State and protection of the environment; Sustainable development goal; Air quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120848413

Various separation techniques, including absorption, adsorption, membrane, cryogenics, and chemical looping were explored in this review, with their challenges and future prospects identified. Utilization of CO2 via conversion to fuels and chemicals, as a green solvent and enhanced oil recovery, as well as through mineral carbonation were explored. Conversion of CO2 to synthetic fuels appears to be the very promising pathway to scaling up carbon capture technologies due to the value of the products.

Though easy to implement, prescriptive approaches do not typically discriminate between minimally compliant, high-performing and poorly performing HVAC system configurations. Hence, to meet aggressive energy and carbon reduction goals, it is clear that energy codes will need to transition from prescriptive to performance-based approaches, a transition that is riddled with several challenges. This paper discusses a new HVAC system-based performance approach (HVAC System Performance) which provides a simpler solution to HVAV system evaluation compared to whole building performance, while keeping tradeoffs limited to specific building systems. The Total System Performance Ratio (TSPR) is a metric for evaluation of overall system efficiency instead of individual component efficiency, a solution which could also eventually facilitate the transition to a 100% performance-based code structure. TSPR is a ratio that compares the annual heating and cooling load of a building to the annual energy consumed by the building’s HVAC system. A calculation software tool has been developed for determining a building’s TSPR. Already incorporated into the 2018 Washington State Energy Code, this approach is also being evaluated by ASHRAE Standard 90.l Project Committee and has the potential to provide a comprehensive performance-based approach for HVAC system evaluation and analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

The performance of RCA under different iHD modes is not well documented. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied all consecutive iHD sessions with our RCA protocol during a 3-year period. We compared low-flux iHD, high-flux iHD, and online post-dilution hemodiafiltration (oHDF) with regard to flow rates, calcium changes, metabolic outcomes, and complications. We used a calcium-free dialysate, concentrated sodium citrate (0.5 M), and calcium chloride substitution (0.5 M). Several safety measures were implemented to prevent human errors. Results: We performed 111 RCA treatments in 66 cases. Seven sessions were prematurely stopped due to malfunctioning vascular access or pre-existing severe hypotension. The other 104 treatments (94%) consisting of 28 low-flux iHD, 31 high-flux iHD, and 45 oHDF were completed without clotting or complications. The protocol settings were used without adaptations in 75% of low-flux iHD, 93% of high-flux iHD, and 84% of oHDF sessions. Minor adjustments of the calcium flow rate were made within the first 2 hours. We did not observe any clinically relevant differences between the three modes regarding flow rates, systemic iCa, post-filter iCa, pH, or bicarbonate levels. Conclusion: Our protocol was similarly suitable for low-flux iHD, high-flux iHD, and oHDF, with only minor adaptations. Clotting, relevant calcium changes, metabolic or other complications were not observed. Our protocol could serve as a template for a commercial RCA solution in iHD. © 2021 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.

Here we have taken advantage of the solar light harvesting in the thermocatalytic approach to carbon dioxide methanation. The large-surface-area Ni/CeO2 catalyst produced by a scalable low-cost method was characterized and tested in the dark and under solar light irradiation conditions. Light-assisted CO2 conversion experiments as well as in-situ DRIFT spectrometry, performed at different illumination intensities, have revealed a dual effect of the incident photons on the catalytic properties of the two-component Ni/CeO2 catalyst. On the one hand, absorbed photons induce a localized surface plasmon resonance in the Ni nanoparticles followed by dissipation of the heat to the oxide matrix. On the other hand, the illumination activates the photocatalytic properties of the CeO2 support, which leads to an increase in the concentration of the intermediates being precursor for methane production. Analysis of the methane production at different temperatures and illumination conditions has shown that the methanation reaction in our case is controlled by a photothermally-activated process. The used approach has allowed us to increase the reaction rate up to 2.4 times and consequently to decrease the power consumption by 20 % under solar illumination, thus replacing the conventional thermal activation of the reaction with a green energy source. © 2021 The Authors","CO2 methanation; DRIFTS; LSPR; Nickel-ceria catalyst; Photothermal effect","Catalysts; Cerium oxide; Hydrogenation; Irradiation; Light; Methanation; Methane; Photocatalytic activity; Photons; Reaction intermediates; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Surface plasmon resonance; CeO$-2$; CO2 methanation; DRIFTS; LSPR; Methane production; Nickel-ceria catalyst; Photothermal effects; Solar irradiation; Thermally driven; ]+ catalyst; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102152277

We examined the different morphotype resolutions using a recently collected Eocene (34 Ma) fossil leaf assemblage from Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument Collection Site 9 (CS-9, Florissant, Colorado), an exposure that yields one of the most diverse sets of dicotyledonous angiosperm (‘dicot’) morphotypes yet analyzed from a single site within this well-studied formation. We grouped this collection using what are herein referred to as ‘Splitter’ (number of morphotypes n = 129), ‘Intermediate’ (n = 96), and ‘Lumper’ (n = 53) morphotyping approaches, which differed in their degree of delineating foliar morphotypes.

The local consequences and broader fate of carbon delivered to streams is determined by the overall composition of carbon inputs, including the balance of organic and inorganic forms. Yet, our understanding of how hydrologic fluxes across different land-water interfaces regulate carbon supply remains poor. We used 7 years of data from three boreal catchments to test how different land-water interfaces (i.e., forest, wetland, and lake) modulate concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane, as well as the balance among forms (e.g., DOC:CO2). Seasonal patterns in concentrations and C-Q relationships for individual carbon forms differed across catchments. DOC varied between chemostasis and transport limitation in the forest catchment, between supply limitation and chemostasis in the wetland catchment, and was persistently chemostatic in the lake outlet stream. Carbon gases were supply limited overall, but exhibited chemostasis or transport limitation in the forest and wetland catchments linked to elevated flow in summer and autumn. Unique C-Q relationships for individual forms reflected the properties of different interfaces and underpinned changes in the composition of lateral carbon supply. Accordingly, DOC dominated the carbon flux during snowmelt, whereas gas evasion increased in relative importance during other times of the year. Integrating the C-Q dynamics of individual carbon forms provides insight into the shifting composition of lateral export, and thus helps to predict how hydrologic changes may alter the fate of carbon supplied to streams. © 2021.

However, existing inventories, most of which are yearly, provincial, and incomplete, have failed to reflect the spatial variation and seasonal trends of CH4 emissions. This study aims to develop a high-resolution (0.05° × 0.05°) monthly inventory of CH4 emissions across China in 2015 from eight major natural and anthropogenic sources. The inventory evaluation of CH4 emissions was based on the gridded activity data and high spatial-temporal resolution emission factors, which were estimated by their relationship with environmental factors in most source sectors. The results showed that the annual CH4 emissions across China were 61.65 Tg, of which 85% was associated with anthropogenic emissions. Energy activities, livestock, and paddy fields were the largest contributors, accounting for 31% (19.06 Tg), 24% (15.01 Tg) and 19% (11.45 Tg) of the total emissions respectively, followed by vegetation (7%, 4.52 Tg), wetlands (7%, 4.20 Tg), wastewater (6%, 3.43 Tg), municipal solid waste, (4%, 2.59 Tg) and biomass burning (2%, 1.40 Tg). However, these proportions varied by month; paddy fields, vegetation, and wetlands emitted the most CH4 in July and August with approximately 29%, 14%, and 8% of total emissions, respectively, and least in January and December with 0%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, leading to a CH4 emissions peak in summer and a valley in winter. Moreover, the major contributing provinces of CH4 emissions in China were Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, accounting for 33% of China's total emissions. The dominant emission sources were energy activities in Mongolia, Shanxi, and Guizhou; livestock in Sichuan; and paddy fields in Hunan. This improved inventory of CH4 emissions can help understanding the spatial-temporal variation of CH4 concentration in the atmosphere and formulating regional-seasonal-specific emission reduction policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Intra-annual trend; Methane emissions; Spatiotemporal variations","Agriculture; Atmospheric chemistry; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Municipal solid waste; Vegetation; Wetlands; CH$-4$; China; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Intra-annual trend; Methane emissions; Natural sources; Paddy fields; Spatial temporals; Spatio-temporal variation; Total emissions; Methane; annual variation; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); emission; emission inventory; environmental factor; greenhouse gas; methane; spatial variation; temporal variation; China; Guizhou; Hunan; Nei Monggol; Shanxi; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104403814

Synergistic efficacy of synchronous adsorption and bio-degradation was evaluated in pilot-scale bio-enhanced activated carbon (BEAC) system. Results identified that MCGL-4 obtains synchronously well-developed meso- (0.7605 cm3/g), micro- (0.2655 cm3/g) and macro-porous (0.143 cm3/g) structures. Higher volume during 20.4–208.2 Å (0.6848 cm3/g) ensured higher adsorption capacities for natural organic matters (NOM). The initial immobilized biomass and stabilities on MCGL-4 were also significantly promoted. Rapid small-scale column tests system (RSSCTs) tests showed that adsorption capacities for humic-like organics were 67,725.32 mg·DOC/(kg·carbon) at 39.50 m3·H2O/(kg·carbon). In BEAC system, MCGL-4 achieved higher removal efficiency for fulvic acid, humic acid and aromatic organic matters than commercial carbons. At 39.50 m3·H2O/(kg·carbon), cumulative uptake of organic-pollutants achieved by MCGL-4 was 94,850.51 mg·DOC/(kg·carbon). The proportion occupied by biodegradation were 31,674.70 mg·DOC/(kg·carbon).

A lot of utility-scale PV power plants are being installed in tropical regions owing to the increased sunshine hours especially during the summer season. The influence of rain on the performance of PV power plants during monsoon seasons in a tropical climate is not studied in detail. This paper analyses the operational performance of a 2 MWp photovoltaic plant commissioned at the Kuzhalmannam site, Palakkad district, Kerala State, South India. The methodology includes the analysis of standard performance metrics of the plant utilizing two-year measured data and comparison with other climates. The PV plant's average performance ratio (PR) is 73.39, with an average of 15.41% capacity utilization factor (CUF) over the study period. The most deficit generation for the PV plant is observed in the months from June to August, which are part of the Southwest monsoon season. It is observed that the monsoon seasons prevailing in the region have a more substantial influence leading to a 35% reduction in energy generation from the annual average generation. Further, a comparison with other climates revealed that the specific yield obtained in rain-dominated monsoon tropical climates is lesser than dry and temperate climates. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

While the support of innovations is high on the agenda of both national and local authorities, consciously phasing-out unsustainable technologies and practices is often neglected. However, this other side of the policy coin, ‘exnovation’, is a crucial element for the mobility transition. We developed a framework to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of urban mobility transition policies, systematically integrating exnovation policies. It links exnovation functions as identified in transition studies with insights from urban mobility studies and empirical findings from eight city case studies around the world. The findings suggest that most cities use some kinds of exnovation policies to address selective urban mobility issues, e.g., phasing-out diesel buses, restricting the use of polluting motor vehicles in some parts of the city, etc. Still, we found no evidence for a systematic exnovation approach alongside the innovation pol-icies. Our framework specifies exnovation functions for the urban mobility transition by lining out policy levers and concrete measure examples. We hope that the framework inspires future in-depth research, but also political action to advance the urban mobility transition. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, considering the key role played by the structural traits in affecting carbon sequestration potential, we assessed the impact of two different training systems widely diffused in the region: single trunk in orchardA and bush-like in orchardB. The results showed that plants in orchardA and orchardB sequestered 10.6 ± 1.8 and 25.7 ± 4.2 kg (CO2) plant−1 month−1, respectively. Higher CO2 sequestration in the plants in orchardB was due to their higher leaf area index relative to plants in orchardA.

Given the joint decarbonization strategies of electrifying fossil fuel-based energy uses and decarbonizing the electricity supply, understanding how electricity emissions might change over time is of particular value in evaluating policy sequencing strategies. For example, is the electricity system likely to decarbonize quickly enough to motivate electrification even on relatively carbon-intensive systems? Although electricity sector decarbonization has been widely studied, limited research has focused on evaluating emissions factors at the utility level, which is where the impact of electrification strategies is operationalized. Given the existing fleet of electricity generators, ownership structures, and generator lifespans, committed emissions can be modeled at the utility level. Generator lifespans are modeled using capacity-weighted mean age-on-retirement for similar units over the last two decades, a simple empirical outcome variable reflecting the length of time the unit might reasonably be expected to operate. By also evaluating generators in wholesale power markets and designing scenarios for new-build generation, first-order annual average emissions factors can be projected forward on a multidecadal time scale at the utility level. This letter presents a new model of utility-specific annual average emissions projections (greenhouse gases and air pollutants) through 2050 for the United States, using a 2019 base year to define existing asset characteristics. Enabling the creation and evaluation of scenario-based projections for dynamic environmental intensity metrics in a decarbonizing electricity sector can inform life cycle and other environmental assessment studies that evaluate impact over time, in addition to highlighting particular opportunities and risks associated with the timing and location of long-lived capital investments as the fossil fuel electricity generator fleet turns over. Model results can also be used to contextualize utilities' decarbonization commitments and timelines against their asset bases. © 2021 The Author(s).

Without restoration and peat regrowth, harvested peatlands are dramatically altered, impairing their carbon sink function, with consequences for methane turnover. This study determined the response of the underlying microbial communities catalyzing methane production and oxidation. We hypothesize that with the return of Sphagnum spp. postharvest, methane turnover potential and the corresponding microbial communities will converge in a natural and restored peatland. We determined the potential methane production and oxidation rates in natural, actively mined, abandoned, and restored peatlands over two consecutive years. In all sites, the methanogenic and methanotrophic population sizes were enumerated using quantitative PCR assays targeting the mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively. Peat mining adversely affected methane turnover potential, but the rates recovered in the restored site. In addition, little is known of the response and recovery of the methanotrophic interactome to disturbances. In a follow-up study, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis comparing a pristine and restored peatland. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using [13C]CH4 to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Bacterial community composition was distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The community’s population has already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 22%, while the gross domestic product (GDP) in its member states increased by 58% between 1990 and 2017. The Union has shown that economic growth is possible in the link between politics, nature, and the citizens’ eco-empathy. It has implications for both the European and global economy, infrastructure, food production, public health, and biodiversity, the formula for political stability. The hallmark of the European Union is the blending of politics, culture, and nature in its quest for climate neutrality. The community’s horizon is a zero-emission economy by 2050. (2) Theoretical framework: The cognitive assumptions of the article are the following theses: 1. The Union strives to accelerate the transition process to a regenerative growth model using technologies for obtaining and distributing energy for individual and collective needs; 2. The Union and the European citizens want to hand over more to planet Earth than they take away from it, thus making progress toward keeping resource consumption within planetary limits. 3. The Union aims to reduce its consumption footprint and double the rate of applying closed-loop materials in the next decade. Finally, it fits in with the organization’s policy projections. (3) Methodology and research results: Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in the research process. The literature has been analyzed on the subject and the applicable legal acts, making it possible to classify, generalize, describe, and systematize the facts collected during the research. A survey was conducted on 1106 students, and in-depth interviews were conducted with three energy experts: Krzysztof Tomaszewski (the University of Warsaw, researcher and lecturer on energy security issues), Dariusz Pachniewski (inventor in energy sector, businessman in hydrogen energy sector), and Tomoho Umeda (President of Polish Chamber of Commerce). The research aimed to identify the environmental and energy awareness, knowledge of renewable energy sources, and opinions of young Poles on their use in two areas: home and work. (4) Discussion: The reinforced narrative of creating a low-carbon society, a green economy, was adapted and evaluated for innovative individual and collective approaches in the research conducted in this paper. In the quantitative and qualitative samples, the assumptions made were double-checked. The former verified the students’ views, while the latter, the experts’ views. The procedure established the directions of knowledge evolution and approach to technologies and innovations among students of technical faculties related to the energy sector. There were existing individual and collective mental constructs on energy transition and climate neutrality identified. (5) Conclusions: The surveys conducted among university students of energy-related majors and specialties and experts revealed important information. First, it concerned the way knowledge is communicated and how it is interpreted; second, informing and implementing the European Union’s climate policy; third, the creation of a low-carbon society; fourth, the perception of climate neutrality among young Poles, and finally, preferences in energy generation and use in homes and businesses. © 2021 by the authors.

It is necessary to strengthen ozone pollution control and promote PM2.5 and ozone's coordinated management in China. This study assessed the PM2.5- and ozone-related health impacts of 100 major Chinese cities in fourteen seasons of 2017 (60 cities studied), 2018, 2019, and the first half of 2020. We found 6.68 × 107 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 3.72 × 107 DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5 and ozone pollution in the 100 major cities. High PM2.5-related health impacts mostly appeared in winter and north, while high ozone-related mostly in summer and south. In the winter of 2019, the total PM2.5-related health impact of 100 major cities accounted for 98.67% of the sum of PM2.5- and ozone-related. The proportion in the summer of 2019 was only 23.15%. We also found a north-south differentiation of PM2.5- and ozone-related health impacts in spring and autumn. Taking the Yangtze River Basin as the dividing zone, PM2.5 was generally the primary attribution of health impacts in the north in spring and autumn. To the south of the Yangtze River, ozone-related health impacts were generally dominant. The attempt to introduce seasonal population data in the health impact assessment provided a reference. Population movements relatively influenced the seasonal health impacts of developed urban agglomerations. The present study could help in the policy implementation of PM2.5- and ozone-related health risk prevention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Health impact; Ozone; PM2.5; Seasonal variation","Health risks; Ozone; Pollution control; Population statistics; Risk assessment; River pollution; Ambient ozones; Ambients; Chinese cities; Disability adjusted life years; Disability-adjusted life year; Health impact; Major cities; Ozone pollution; PM$-2.5$; Seasonal variation; Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106503955

We investigated the combined effects of long-term exposure to fine particle matter (PM2.5) and habitual exercise on deaths from natural causes in Taiwan. Methods: We recruited 384 130 adults (aged ≥ 18 yr) with 842394 medical examination records between 2001 and 2016, and followed all participants until May 31, 2019. We obtained vital data from the National Death Registry of Taiwan. We estimated PM2.5 exposure using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model, and collected information on exercise habits using a standard self-administered questionnaire. We analyzed the data using a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates. Results: A higher level of habitual exercise was associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes, compared with inactivity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.88 for the moderate exercise group; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62–0.68 for the high exercise groups), whereas a higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of death from natural causes compared with lower exposure (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98–1.07, and HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10–1.20, for the moderate and high PM2.5 exposure groups, respectively). Compared with inactive adults with high PM2.5 exposure, adults with high levels of habitual exercise and low PM2.5 exposure had a substantially lower risk of death from natural causes. We found a minor, but statistically significant, interaction effect between exercise and PM2.5 exposure on risk of death (HR 1.03 95% CI 1.01–1.06). Subgroup analyses, stratified by PM2.5 categories, suggested that moderate and high levels of exercise were associated with a lower risk of death in each PM2.5 stratum, compared with inactivity. Interpretation: Increased levels of exercise and reduced PM2.5 exposure are associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes. Habitual exercise can reduce risk regardless of the levels of PM2.5 exposure. Our results suggest that exercise is a safe health improvement strategy, even for people residing in relatively polluted regions. © 2021 CMA Joule Inc. or its licensors",,"adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; death registry; exercise; female; habit; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; medical examination; mortality; PM2.5 exposure; questionnaire; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112868209

This study established a hierarchical framework for urban residents’ approach-avoidance responses to personal carbon trading; adopted Likert scale and manikin task methods to assess the current states of residents’ responses by investigating 1892 respondents in eastern China; employed one-way analysis of variance to identify the demographic differences of their responses; and used regression analysis to explore the influences of psychological factors on their responses. The findings showed that urban residents’ responses to personal carbon trading scheme and participation could be classified into five response hierarchies: deep avoidance, shallow avoidance, uncertain, shallow approach, and deep approach. The average of residents’ responses denoted a shallow approach, with the characteristics of median stability, duration, and noise. Moreover, residents holding deep approach responses to the scheme and participation respectively accounted for 42.365% and 34.275% of the total, which indicated a gap between attitude and behavior. Urban residents’ responses exhibited significant differences with respect to demographic characteristics. Most of the residents with the most avoidance response were young males (i.e., 18–20 years old), older first-line employees (i.e., older than 50 years old), and those on subsistence incomes (i.e., annual individual or household income was RMB 30,000–50,000 yuan). Additionally, residents who held egoistic values, had low senses of social responsibility, knew little about carbon reductions, and preferred comfortable life were likely to avoid the scheme and participation. Finally, policy suggestions are proposed for the enhancement of urban residents’ attitudes towards personal carbon trading, thereby providing valuable references for its implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Approach-avoidance responses; Carbon emission reduction; Demographic characteristics; Personal carbon trading; Policy suggestions; Psychological factors; Urban residents","carbon emission; emissions trading; household income; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; subsistence; urban population; variance analysis; China; carbon; adolescent; adult; China; human; income; male; middle aged; policy; questionnaire; urban population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Carbon; China; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Policy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104050233

Using Westerlund and Edgerton's panel cointegration test, the authors found a stable long-run relationship between CO2 emissions and its determinants. We found that under major structural breaks at the local, regional, and global levels, such as the East Asian crises of 1997, the financial crises of 2007–2008, China's RMB exchange rate reform announced on August 11, 2015, and mild recession in 2001, CO2 emissions, income, green innovation, renewable energy use, and energy industry investment are cointegrated. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is valid. In the long run, income, environmental innovation, investment in the energy industry, and renewable energy consumption are key contributors in explaining CO2 emissions. The empirical evidence from augmented mean group (AMG) is consistent with the estimates of CS-ARDL. Concerning practical implications, the findings suggest that there is a need to switch the Chinese economy to more sustainable sources of energy, a viable solution to abate environmental degradation.

In this framework, pseudospin states of photons, topological phase, and topological corner state are subsequently constructed by engineering the structures. It is shown that a high Q-factor of 3.66×1011 can be obtained at the corner state, showing strong confinement of light at the corner. Consequently, SHG is significantly boosted and manifests directional out-of-plane emission. More importantly, the enhanced SHG has robustness against a broad class of defects.

Different from traditional donors only with a single emission, the VIE donor possessed well-separated dual emission bands by altering the excited state molecular configuration from the bent state to the planar state. By linking an acceptor such as a cyanine dye (Cy5), a novel VIE-FRET cassette (PPCy5) was prepared. The planar emission profile of the VIE donor moiety could fully cover the absorption of Cy5, and thus the complete FRET process enabled the excellent bimodal spectra difference of 142 nm and ultra-large pseudo-Stokes shift of up to 300 nm. Benefiting from the viscosity-dependent characteristic of the VIE donor, PPCy5 could clearly and intuitively reveal the different viscosity regions in vivo by dual-color and high-resolution imaging. The VIE-FRET paradigm provides an optional platform for developing donor-acceptor-based dual-color fluorescent probes with high-resolution imaging ability.

The impacts of management scenarios and different climate scenarios on water-related ecosystem services are uncertain in the context of future LULC and climate change interactions. Therefore, here, we analyzed the impact of future climate change and land management scenarios on water-related ecosystem services by 2030 in the Jianghuai Ecological Economic Zone (JHEEZ). Water yield and water purification were modelled for 2030, and the models were built on LULC scenarios and climate scenarios by using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services Trade-offs (InVEST) model. We used the Beijing Normal University Earth system model (BNU-ESM) for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and we simulated four LULC scenarios using the future LULC simulation (FLUS) model. Four 2030 LULC scenarios, including rapid urbanization (RUS), farmland protection (FPS), ecological protection (EPS), and returning farmland to lakes scenario (RLS), were designed and compared with the year 2015 as the baseline. We found that the water yield of each LULC scenario under RCP4.5 had a decreasing trend: 10.41% (RUS), 12.43% (FPS), 13.69% (EPS), and 13.83% (RLS). However, the water yield increased under RCP8.5 and were 5.92%, 3.77%, 2.35%, and 2.18%, respectively. Water purification increased more in all LULC scenarios under the RCP8.5 than under RCP4.5. The water purification of all land-use scenarios from small to large was FPS, RUS, EPS, and RLS. Our results indicated that climate change had a greater impact than LULC on water yield, but LULC change had a greater impact on water purification.

This paper analyzes the well-to-wheel climate performance of gas and electric vehicles in Europe, taking into account the share of biomethane in vehicle gas as well as the production systems for biomethane and electricity in different countries. The results show that both gas and electric vehicles can significantly reduce the climate change impact of transports compared to diesel. In an average European electricity system, electricity has around 30% lower climate impact than diesel for a heavy truck, and 65–70% lower for a passenger car or city bus. Average European vehicle gas reduces the climate impact by up to 28% compared to diesel, or 11% compared to fossil natural gas, and in some countries vehicle gas has lower climate impact than electricity. This demonstrates the importance of not limiting analysis and policy to tailpipe emissions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biomethane; Carbon intensity; Electric mobility; Transport; Vehicle gas; Well-to-wheel","carbon emission; electric vehicle; energy policy; European Union; methane; performance assessment; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107129658

However, wide gaps in the fossil record still remain throughout the tropics, while genetic and genomic datasets from tiny (<50 mg) ancient tropical fossils recovered from small mass species (<100 g) are particularly scarce. We studied tropical fossil hemimandible samples of two rodent genera from seven stratigraphic strata from Loltún cave, Yucatán, Mexico, dated 2,000–12,000 years ago. We also selected contemporary museum skin samples of these rodents and amplified mitochondrial DNA from both sources (fossil and museum) with next generation sequencing. We recovered the first nearly complete contemporary and partial fossil mitogenomes for Ototylomys and Oryzomys. Ancient and contemporary samples of both species clustered together, whilst exhibiting a topology in which haplotypes differentiated in correspondence with biogeographic breaks. Accordingly, Ototylomys and Oryzomys distinct lineages are associated with biogeographic provinces and breaks across neotropical Mexico and Central America. Results from Loltún provide further evidence for biogeographic processes that affected Yucatán species during the Holocene. Relative abundances of the studied genera's fossil remains differed among the stratigraphic layers, mirroring the expansion and contraction of their populations in response to changing climatic conditions and shifting plant regimes. Oryzomys fossil remains are much less abundant at the most recent and oldest layers, supporting a biogoegraphic hypothesis where this region was dominated by a wet and cold climate during the Last Glacial Maximum and which, only a few thousand years ago, changed to a warmer and much dryer climate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ancient fossil DNA; Loltún cave; Mexico; Oryzomys; Ototylomys; Phylogeography",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105734612

In Algeria, the removal of dredged sediment has become a significant environmental impact and an economic issue. In this context, the utilization of calcined sediments as an artificial pozzolanic material could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the cement industry. This paper addresses the objective of valorizing calcined sediments in sustainable mortar production on fresh and hardened states of grouts and mortars. Moreover, three dry curing methods were used to accelerate improving the strength of the different mortars at a rate of 5, 15, and 25% by weight of Portland cement (CEM I 42.5 N). The first method was applied at 10 °C, and the other two at 20 °C and 40 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed a real advantage of heat treatment at 750 °C of sediments to acquire pozzolanic behavior. A substitution rate of 25% affected the fluidity of cement grouts with calcined sediments at 60 min with a loss of fluidity, even with a high dosage of plasticizer. Indeed, the best mechanical results of the mortars were observed at cure temperatures of 20 °C and 40 °C. With an acceleration of the pozzolanic activity at 90 days for a cure at 40 °C and 180 days at 20 °C, the development of compressive strength is relatively higher than that of the control mortar. In conclusion, the carbon footprint of the final mortars showed that a high substitution rate reduces CO2 emissions, representing a reduction of 3%, 10%, and 17% respectively for the formulation of mortars based on 5%, 15%, and 25% calcined sediment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Calcined sediments; Carbon footprint; Cement; Cure temperatures; Mechanical properties; Mortars","Calcination; Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Compressive strength; Curing; Emission control; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Grouting; Portland cement; Sediments; Algeria; Calcined sediment; Cure temperature; Dredged sediments; Lifetime storage; Mechanical; Partial replacement; Property; Substitution rates; Water storage capacity; Mortar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102081297

It has substantiated the archeological site's outstanding preservation condition, and furthermore proven the numerous construction timbers’ suitability for dendrochronological analysis. Dendrochronological analysis on archaeological timbers was applied, combined with radiocarbon dating. Bayesian radiocarbon modeling allowed to ‘wiggle match’ the dendrochronological mean curves, i.e. allowed the precise chronological anchoring of ‘floating’ tree-ring sequences. Furthermore, radiocarbon dates of plant remains from the site's main archaeological layer are statistically evaluated. Based on the new findings, the strikingly high density of wooden piles at the site can be attributed to several construction phases of Neolithic (middle of 5th millennium BC) and Bronze Age (2nd millennium BC: 1800, 1400 and 1300 BCE) settlements. Intense settlement activity is furthermore evidenced by a cultural layer of mainly organic material under the lakebed up to 1.7 m in thickness, which accumulated during the Neolithic occupation of the bay in the middle of the 5th millennium BC. The presented research enables precise absolute dating of a series of settlement phases at Ploča Mičov Grad from the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, and hence provides important reference points for an absolute chronological framework for the prehistory of the southwestern Balkans. The investigations underline the potential of future research on waterlogged prehistoric settlements in the region. © 2021 The Author(s)","Dendrochronology; EXPLO; Lakeshore settlements; Neolithic and Bronze Age Balkans; Pile dwellings; Radiocarbon dating; Wetland archeology; Wiggle-matching",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111503081

This study aims to assess the performance of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR) region and Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) in the mid-infrared (MIR) region to predict nine different soil properties: total carbon, total nitrogen, bulk density, clay, sand, silt, pH (in H2O), exchangeable Mg and exchangeable K using chemometric approaches. The predictive performance of four different regression methods i.e., Partial least square (PLS), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist and convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with different pre-processing approaches were investigated. For CNN, the FTIR/NIR spectra were converted to spectrograms and fed into the CNN to examine the prediction accuracy of two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN-2D) and to compare its performance with one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN-1D, spectral data as input). To achieve these objectives, we used a spectral library of 650 samples from National Soils Inventory of Scotland (NSIS) dataset collected in a 20 km grid throughout Scotland between 2007 and 2009. The FTIR and NIR data were both split into calibration (nc = 520) and validation (nv = 130) sets. Our results show that the regression models with FTIR data have better predictive performance than those created using NIR data for all the studied soil properties (improvement in root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 3–61%), except for pH. Comparing the different chemometric approaches, for both the NIR and FTIR, the results indicated that the CNN-1D models performs better than PLS, SVR and CNN-2D for all the studied soil components in terms of RMSEP. We found that the CNN-1D models created using the NIR spectral dataset were superior (lower RMSEP values) to those developed using the Cubist approach for total carbon, total nitrogen, clay, silt, pH and exchangeable K, whereas the Cubist models for sand and exchangeable Mg performed slightly better than CNN-1D. For the FTIR data, Cubist models for total carbon and silt performed best (with lowest RMSEP and highest Residual Prediction Deviation (RPD) values), while for the rest of the components, CNN-1D outperformed the PLS, SVR, Cubist and CNN-2D. We also calculated the impact of the NIR and FTIR variables used by the Cubist and CNN-1D models in predicting different soil properties. We used the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values, a game theoretic approach, to interpret the output of the CNN-1D models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","ATR-FTIR; Chemometric; CNN; Cubist; NIR; PLS; SHAP; Spectroscopy; SVR","Carbon; Convolution; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Least squares approximations; Magnesium; Mean square error; Neural networks; Nitrogen; Regression analysis; Silt; Supersaturation; Attenuated total reflection fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (ATR/FT-IR); Chemometrics; Convolutional neural network; Cubist; FTIR; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Partial least-squares; Shapley additive explanation; Support vector regressions; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; data set; detection method; infrared spectroscopy; model validation; near infrared; soil air; soil analysis; soil classification; soil profile; soil property; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103755787

Meanwhile, human capital formation can increase carbon emissions as it indirectly affects growth; yet human capital can enhance the absorptive capacity of an economy and enhance the effectiveness of ICT technologies to reduce potentially emissions. Results show that ICT reduce carbon emissions while human capital formation increases it. However, the results vary when examining the impact of ICT and human capital on carbon emissions from manufacturing, residential, transport and other industries: ICT consistently reduces carbon emissions; meanwhile, human capital decreases carbon emissions for manufacturing and other industries.

The electrochemical performance improves drastically by the addition of just 1% carbon which further increases in the composite having rGO. The as-developed Mo2C/C/rGO composite exhibits a specific capacity as high as 630 mA h/g after 1600 cycles with nearly 100% efficiency. The material also delivers 198 mA h/g capacity at 4 A/g current density which again comes back to the normal state. The high capacitive current in the composite contributes to superior electrochemical performance. A full cell has been fabricated using LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC 622) and Mo2C/C/rGO as electrodes, which delivers around 114 mA h/g capacity at 50 mA/g. Theoretical calculations reveal that strong interaction of Mo2C and graphene induces modification of the geometrical (widening of Li movement channels) and electronic structures of Mo2C, which in turn improves the overall performance of the composite electrode. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Anodes; Carbides; Composite structures; Electronic structure; Graphene; Life cycle; Lithium compounds; Manganese compounds; Nickel compounds; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Transition metals; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Composite electrode; Electrochemical performance; Electronic conductivity; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Specific capacities; Theoretical calculations; Transition metal carbide; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111250796

Here, we investigate temporal shifts in phenology and spatial shifts in northern range boundaries for 289 Lepidoptera species by using long-term data sampled over two decades. While 40% of the species neither advanced phenology nor moved northward, nearly half (45%) used one of the two strategies. The strongest positive population trends were observed for the minority of species (15%) that both advanced flight phenology and shifted their northern range boundaries northward. We show that, for boreal Lepidoptera, a combination of phenology and range shifts is the most viable strategy under a changing climate. Effectively, this may divide species into winners and losers based on their propensity to capitalize on this combination, with potentially large consequences on future community composition. © 2021 The Authors.

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. Materials and Methods: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. Results: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest. Conclusion: We hypothesize that one important reason for this drop in stroke admissions, may be an actual reduction in stroke incidence brought about by an improvement in air quality. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Air quality index; Covid; Pandemic; South Asia; Stroke","adult; air quality; anterior cerebral artery; Article; cardioembolic stroke; coronavirus disease 2019; female; hospital admission; human; ischemic stroke; lockdown; major clinical study; male; middle aged; middle cerebral artery; Pakistan; pandemic; posterior cerebral artery; priority journal; stroke patient; tertiary care center; adverse event; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; brain ischemia; comparative study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; incidence; prevention and control; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; urban health; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Incidence; Ischemic Stroke; Male; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Patient Admission; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106941650

In this work, torrefaction was employed as a pretreatment for inhibiting the synthesis of dioxins. A mixture of poplar and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was used as the model MSW and provided the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) source and chlorine sources, respectively. A torrefaction-pyrolysis experiment was performed in a tubular furnace system, and the weight loss and chlorine release (mainly in the form of hydrogen chloride) were evaluated. The dioxins distribution in the products were detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was employed to clarify the chlorination of PAHs. The results showed that torrefaction could reduce 98.63 % of the total amount of dioxins and reduce 99.09 % of the toxic equivalent of volatile dioxins. Since torrefaction cut the Cl participation of MSW (from PVC) by 86.94 %, the overall reaction process was simplified, and the temperature of the maximum conversion rate was increased. In addition, the analysis of the functional groups indicated that most dioxins during pyrolysis was synthesized from 200 ℃ to 400 ℃. This research demonstrated a significant emission reduction, which effected by torrefaction, and provided a new idea for dioxins clean pyrolysis of MSW. © 2021","Chlorine; Dioxins; MSW; Pyrolysis; Torrefaction","Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Emission control; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heating furnaces; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Polyvinyl chlorides; Pyrolysis; High resolution mass spectrometry; Mechanistic studies; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Polyvinyl chloride (PVC); Pyrolysis experiments; Thermo-gravimetric; Toxic Equivalents TEQ; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108266275

Emission data in this study comprised of 247 industrial stacks were used together with local terrain features and meteorological data in 2018 for the analysis. Evaluation of model performance was accomplished by statistical comparison between observed and modeled PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Results from statistical analysis indicated that predicted PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations data were lower than those measured ground level concentrations. This under-estimated prediction reveals less contribution of emission from industrial stacks towards ambient particulate concentrations.

This allows us to capture some of the latest insights from research on ocean acidification. Using a static two-sector general equilibrium model we derive optimal rules for national taxes on (Formula presented.) emissions and agricultural run-off and show how they depend on both isolated and interacting damage effects. In addition, we derive a second-best rule for a tax on agricultural run-off of fertilizers for the realistic case that effective internalization of (Formula presented.) externalities is lacking. The results contribute to a better understanding of the social costs of ocean acidification in coastal economies when there is interaction with other environmental stressors. Recommendations for Resource Managers: Marginal environmental damages from (Formula presented.) emissions should be internalized by a tax on (Formula presented.) emissions that is high enough to not only reflect marginal damages from temperature increases, but also marginal damages from ocean acidification and the interaction of both with regional sources of acidification like nutrient run-off from agriculture. In the absence of serious national policies that fully internalize externalities, a sufficiently high tax on regional nutrient run-off of fertilizers used in agricultural production can limit not only marginal environmental damages from nutrient run-off but also account for unregulated carbon emissions. Putting such regional policies in place that consider multiple important drivers of environmental change will be of particular importance for developing coastal economies that are likely to suffer the most from ocean acidification. © 2021 The Authors.

In the toolbox of crop management, soil amendments have shown benefits to control these diseases and improve soil quality. Most amendments provide nutrients to plants and suppress multiple soilborne pathogens. Soil amendments are naturally derived materials and products and can be classified into fresh or living plants, organic or inorganic matters, and microbial supplements. Fresh plants have unique functions and continuously exude chemicals to interact with soil microbes. Organic and inorganic matter contain high levels of nutrients, including nitrogen and carbon that plants and soil microorganisms need. Soil microorganisms, whether being artificially added or in-digenously existing, are a key factor in plant health. Microbial communities can be considered as a biological reactor in an ecosystem, which suppress soilborne pathogens in various mechanisms and turn soil organic matter into absorbable forms for plants, regardless of amendment types. Therefore, soil amendments serve as an energy input, nutrient source, and a driving force of microbial activi-ties. Advanced technologies, such as microbiome analyses, make it possible to analyze soil microbial communities and soil health. As research advances on mechanisms and functions, amendment-based strategies will play an important role in enhancing soil health and disease suppression for better potato production. © 2021 by the authors.

With IPCC's 6th Assessment Report scheduled to be released in 2021-22, we asked: how has climate change and health research in North America advanced since the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report in 2014? Specifically, we systematically identified and examined trends in the extent, range, and nature of climate-health research conducted in North America. We used a scoping review methodology to systematically identify literature and map publication trends. A search string was used to search five academic databases. Two independent reviewers first screened titles and abstracts, and then the full texts of articles for relevance. Research articles and reviews using systematic methods published since 2013 were eligible for inclusion, and no language restrictions were applied. To be included, articles had to measure and link climatic variables or hazards to health outcomes in North America. Relevant articles were analysed using descriptive statistics to explore publication trends. The number of climate-health articles has significantly increased since the last IPCC Assessment Report. Published research about climate change impacts, heat-related mortality and morbidity, and respiratory illness taking place in urban centres and in the USA continue to dominate the North American climate-health literature, reflected by the high proportion of articles published. Important research gaps on previously neglected climate-sensitive health outcomes, however, are beginning to be filled, including climate change impacts on mental health, nutrition, and foodborne disease. We also observed progress in research that included future projections of climate-health risks; however, projection research is still relatively nascent and under-studied for many climate-sensitive health outcomes in North America, and would benefit from considering social and demographic variables in models. Important research disparities in geographical coverage were noted, including research gaps in Canada and Mexico, and in rural and remote regions. Overall, these publication trends suggest an improved understanding of exposure-response relationships and future projections of climate-health risks for many climate-sensitive health outcomes in North America, which is promising and provides an evidence-base to inform the IPCC 6th Assessment Report. Despite these advancements and considering the urgent policy and practice implications, more research is needed to deepen our understanding of climate-sensitive health outcomes, as well as examine new arising issues that have limited evidence-bases. In particular, transdisciplinary and cross-sector research, that includes the social sciences, examining current and future climate-health adaptation, mitigation, and the adaptation-mitigation nexus should become a top priority for research, given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies, actions, and interventions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Health; Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC); North America; Scoping review","ice; climate change; environmental policy; health care; health risk; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; adaptation; age; air quality; allergy; Article; attitude to health; Canada; cardiovascular disease; climate change; coastal erosion; coastal waters; cold exposure; comparative study; cultural anthropology; demography; drought; educational status; environmental erosion; environmental health; environmental policy; ethnicity; evidence based practice; fetus outcome; flooding; food poisoning; freshwater environment; futurology; gender; geographic distribution; health care access; health hazard; heat; housing; human; human impact (environment); hurricane; income; indigenous people; injury; interdisciplinary research; maternal welfare; medical research; medical sociology; mental health; Mexico; morbidity; mortality; North America; North American; nutrition; ocean environment; outcome assessment; permafrost; publication; residential area; respiratory tract disease; rural area; rural population; skin disease; socioeconomics; systematic review; thermal exposure; trend study; United States; urban area; urban population; urinary tract disease; vector borne disease; vegetation; water borne disease; weather; wildfire; wildlife crime; work; mental health; North America; North America; Canada; Climate Change; Humans; Mental Health; Mexico; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108123847

Despite widespread recognition of the importance of AMF relationships for plant functioning, we do not know how fungal community structure changes across a desert climate gradient, nor the impacts of different fungal communities on host plant species. Because climate change can shape the distribution of species through effects on species interactions, knowing how the ranges of symbiotic partners are geographically structured and the outcomes of those species interactions informs theory and improves management recommendations. Here we used high throughput sequencing to examine the AMF community of Joshua trees along a climate gradient in Joshua Tree National Park. We then used a range of performance measures and abiotic factors to evaluate how different AMF communities may affect Joshua tree fitness. We found that fungal communities change with elevation resulting in a spectrum of interaction outcomes from mutualism to parasitism that changed with the developmental stage of the plant. Nutrient accumulation and the mycorrhizal growth response of Joshua tree seedlings inoculated with fungi from the lowest (warmest) elevations was first negative, but after 9 months had surpassed that of plants with other fungal treatments. This indicates that low elevation fungi are costly for the plant to initiate symbiosis, yet confer benefits over time.

Therefore, this paper introduces a new idea of installing micro-propeller turbines in the aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to extract power from the high-velocity location in the water column. This extracted power can be used to operate a mixer at the top of the membrane to induce the mixing in that region, which will drive the less oxygenated wastewater into the water column. The rest of the extracted power will rotate microturbine rotors for electric power generation. By applying the proposed microturbines to the 13 audited facilities, it was demonstrated to achieve a gross annual energy-savings of 3,836.9 MWh, a gross annual cost-saving of $260,497, and total CO2 emissions that would be reduced by 2,714 metric tons/year. Generally, the addition of the proposed microturbines can save up to 15.7% of the annual plant electricity consumption (1.3-12.8% of the plant annual electricity bills). © 2020 by ASME.","Aeration basins; Alternative energy sources; Energy conversion/ systems; Energy efficiency; Energy systems analysis; Micro-propeller turbine; Power reclamation; Renewable energy; Wastewater treatment plants","Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Extraction; Hydraulic turbines; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water aeration; Water treatment plants; Aeration basins; Annual energy savings; Electricity bill; Electricity-consumption; Oxygen transfer efficiency; Propeller turbines; Wastewater treatment plants; Water columns; Sewage treatment plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107859295

In the state-of-the-art anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzers, however, there is a substantial loss of reactants due to a nonelectrochemical CO2 consumption at the cathode and the transport of its products to the anode. Our detailed analysis of CO2 crossover in a zero-gap CO2-to-CO flow electrolyzer showed a change in the chemical nature of the transported ionic species through the membrane. With the increasing reaction rate, a continuous shift from HCO3- to CO32- conduction was found to be similar to pure carbonate conduction in the high current density region (>100 mA cm-2). As competing hydrogen evolution takes over the cathodic reaction in a CO2-rich environment, hydroxide conduction becomes more pronounced. This reveals an alteration in the chemical CO2 consumption, the so-called CO2 hydration (CO2 + OH- ↔ HCO3- + OH- ↔ CO32-), implying an unidentical environment for the hydroxide ions generated in CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction under a CO2 atmosphere. Our work draws attention to the incomplete description of CO2 hydration at the confined cathode/membrane interface in membrane electrode assembly-type zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers. ©","anion exchange membrane; CO2electroreduction; CO2hydration; flow cell electrolyzer; gas diffusion electrode; membrane electrode assembly","Cathodes; Chemical analysis; Diffusion in gases; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic cells; Hydration; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Ion exchange membranes; Ions; Pollution control; Reaction rates; Reduction; Anion exchange membrane; Carbon dioxide reduction; Cathodic reactions; Gas diffusion electrodes; High current densities; Hydrogen evolution; Membrane electrode assemblies; Relevant reactions; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114037600

Therefore, huge investments and efforts have been made by governments and international institutions to find new renewable and clean sources of energy. As a contribution to these efforts, this study determined the practical energy and environmental implications of replacing conventional speed humps with energy-harvesting speed humps in Nablus city, Palestine. The study was implemented using an energy-harvesting speed hump (EHSH) system developed in the laboratories at An-Najah National University and based on comprehensive traffic volume counts at all speed humps’ locations. In addition, a traffic volume prediction model was developed in order to determine the implications over the next 10 years. As a result of the study, the expected annual amount of generated energy was determined. Moreover, the expected reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the reduction in the cost of roadway network lighting were determined based on the current and future traffic conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

So far, such attachments have been accomplished by using weak van der Waals forces. However, using strong covalent bonding to attach such photosensitizer with CN is yet to be determined. Here, for the first time, we covalently bonded porphyrin (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-(2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazinyl) phenyl)-Porphyrin (TDP)), a renowned photosensitizer, effectively with CN by thermally balanced molecular strategy. A photoreaction system was set up for the deoxygenated conversion of CO2 to CO under visible light, where cobalt acted as a redox controller to speed up the charge transportation, while CN-TDP worked as a CO2 activating photocatalyst. The subsequent photocatalyst has a broader absorbance range, a greater specific surface area, and intramolecular organic connections that help to decrease the electron-hole pairs’ recombination rate. Furthermore, the average weight ratio between urea and TDP was well-tuned, resulting in a fantastic CO2 photoconversion for CN-TDP7.0 compared to the blank sample. This substantial increase in photocatalytic activity predicts a significant shift in CN’s specific surface area, band gap, chemical composition, and structure, as well as the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers from the ground state (HOMO) to the excited state (LUMO), making it a top candidate for CO2 photoreduction. At the same time, this approach paves the path for the bottom-up fabrication of carbon nitride nanosheets. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Using cross-sectional data from 210 women collected in 2009 across 28 agro-pastoralist villages in Kaokoveld Namibia, we conducted principal-component (PC) analysis of resource variables and constructed profiles of resource strategies from the major PCs. Next, we explored associations between key resource strategies and demographic measures and fitness proxies. Results: The first two PCs accounted for 43% of women's overall resource variation. PC1 reflects women's ability to access market resources via livestock trading, while PC2 captured women's direct food access. We found that market strategies were more common among married women and less common among women who have experienced child mortality. Women with higher subsistence security were more likely to be from the OvaHimba tribe and had a higher risk of gonorrhea exposure. We also qualitatively explored drought-induced pressure on women's livestock. Finally, we show that sexual networks were attenuated during drought, indicating strain on social support. Conclusions: Our results highlight how agro-pastoralist women manage critical resources in unpredictable environments, and how resource strategies distribute among the women in our study. Goats as a commodity to obtain critical resources suggests that some women have flexibility during drought when gardens fail and cattle die. However, increased aridity and drought may eventually overwhelm husbandry practices in this region. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110144922

A possible method for CO2 storage and emission reduction is to use it to displace oil and gas. Solubility of CO2 in water is key to replace oil and gas. The present study investigates the effects of the temperature, pressure, and addition of salt and methane on the water solubility of CO2 by high temperature and high pressure cell combined with chromatographic analysis. The results show that the phase state of CO2 in water with temperature and pressure greatly affects its solubility. Besides, its solubility in the supercritical and liquid state is significantly greater than that in the gaseous state. The solubility of CO2 gas in brine and water increases with an increase in pressure; however, this increasing tendency gradually decreases. At the same time, the addition of CH4 gas can boost the dissolution of CO2 gas, while the addition of NaCl can significantly reduce its solubility; as the salt content in the water increases, the solubility of CO2 gradually decreases. Given the influence of saturated vapor pressure of water at vapor-liquid equilibrium, a thermodynamic constitutive equation was established to calculate the water solubility of CO2. The results showed that the prediction error of CO2 solubility in water is within 8%, that of pure CO2 is less than 4%. A comparison of these results with those predicted using the artificial neural network model showed that the thermodynamic model is more suitable for predicting water solubility required for replacing oil and gas by carbon dioxide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Carbon dioxide; Phase diagram; Solubility; Thermodynamic model","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Neural networks; Phase diagrams; Sodium chloride; Solubility; Temperature; Gas displacement; Global temperatures; Greenhouses gas; Neural-networks; Oil and gas; Oil displacement; Solubility of CO; Theoretical study; Thermodynamic model; Water solubilities; Carbon dioxide; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; displacement; experimental study; solubility; theoretical study; thermodynamic property; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103340095

Nevertheless, the mechanism of commercial carbonates on in situ-generated SEI and the consequential effect on cycling performance is not well understood yet, although some carbonates are well used in electrolytes. In this work, quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics are used to reveal the formation mechanisms of SEI with carbonate-based electrolyte additives on the atomic level. It is confirmed that the Li-coordinated carbonate species are the leading participant of SEI formation and their impact on battery performance is clarified. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits a completely different behavior from vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and vinylene carbonate (VC).

These are considered to potentially be major instruments for decarbonization in a just transition. This plan has led to some districts being defined as PEDs, although none have fully met the criteria to be a PED yet. Research shows that new forms of energy ownership and production, as could potentially be found in PEDs, could help reduce energy poverty, which affects a significant segment of the population, as households can reduce their energy expenditure as well as improve their energy behavior. This paper set out to shed light on the PED landscape, investigating the barriers and opportunities to PED creation in Spain and its potential to mitigate energy poverty. We conducted a literature review on community-owned energy in Spain, followed with expert interviews (energy researchers, stakeholders, and NGOs) who focus on sustainability issues in Spain. Results show a number of barriers (lack of knowledge and awareness, and lack of trust from consumers) and opportunities connected with the creation of PEDs.

In this study, spatial models showing the distribution of carbon stocks and the number of species were produced in order to identify areas that maximize carbon storage and biodiversity in the tropical forests of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We mapped carbon density and species richness of trees using L-band radar backscatter data as well as radar texture metrics, climatic and field data with the random forest regression algorithm. We reduced sources of errors in plot data of the national forest inventory by using correction factors to account for carbon stocks of small trees (<7.5 cm DBH) and for the temporal difference between field data collection and imagery acquisition. We created bivariate maps to assess the spatial relationship between carbon stocks and diversity. Model validation of the regional maps obtained herein using an independent data set of plots resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.28 and 0.31 and a relative mean square error of 38.5% and 33.0% for aboveground biomass and species richness, respectively, at pixel level. Estimates of carbon density were influenced mostly by radar backscatter and climatic data, while those of species richness were influenced mostly by radar texture and climatic variables. Correlation between carbon density and species richness was positive in 79.3% of the peninsula, while bivariate maps showed that 39.6% of the area in the peninsula had high carbon stocks and species richness. Our results highlight the importance of combining carbon and diversity maps to identify areas that are critical—both for maintaining carbon stocks and for conserving biodiversity. © 2021 by the authors.","Aboveground biomass; Biodiversity; L-band SAR; National forest inventory; Texture analysis; Tropical dry forests","Backscattering; Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision trees; Digital storage; Forestry; Mean square error; Population distribution; Radar; Textures; Tropics; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Field data collection; Integrating information; National forest inventories; Regression algorithms; Relative mean square errors; Spatial relationships; Conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112560804

A stochastic dynamic building stock model was developed to investigate the impact of climate change and renovation strategies on district heat demand. The model was applied to a representative city in Finland comprising 3880 real buildings with hourly-resolution data, for which heat demand scenarios for buildings were simulated up to 2050 using results from global and regional climate change models. The novel stochastic dynamic building stock model utilises the real building stock as a basis and considers demolition, construction of new buildings and renovation of existing buildings. It is used in the precised dynamic heat demand model (mean MAPE 7.7%) to calculate the future heat demand. Model outputs indicated that early adoption of building renovation will decrease long-term energy consumption by 3% for every 0.5% increase in the renovation rate by 2050. Increasing the yearly renovation rate from the current 1% to 3% could reduce the district heat demand by 22% (range 19–28%). Early adoption of building renovation could reduce the relative peak load by 50% compared with late adoption. Climate change will reduce the overall heat demand for district heating but will increase the annual relative daily variation from 3.6% to 4.5%, meaning that the peaks in heat demand will be more visible. © 2021 The Author(s)","2050 strategy; District heating; Energy efficiency; Morphing technique; Renovation strategy; Stock driven model","Buildings; Climate change; Climate models; District heating; Energy utilization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; 2050 strategy; Building renovation; Building stocks; Energy; Heat demands; Morphing techniques; Renovation strategy; Stochastic dynamics; Stock driven model; Stock models; Energy efficiency; climate change; energy efficiency; future prospect; heating; long-term change; numerical model; stochasticity; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105850361

Accordingly, as a consequence of IoT and AI, multiple forms of data are incorporated in these systems, e.g. social, implicit, local and personal information, which can help in improving recommender systems’ performance and widen their applicability to traverse different disciplines. On the other side, energy efficiency in the building sector is becoming a hot research topic, in which recommender systems play a major role by promoting energy saving behavior and reducing carbon emissions. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in buildings still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges and issues, where their solutions are the keys to enable the pervasiveness of research findings, and therefore, ensure a large-scale adoption of this technology. Accordingly, this paper presents, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first timely and comprehensive reference for energy-efficiency recommendation systems through (i) surveying existing recommender systems for energy saving in buildings; (ii) discussing their evolution; (iii) providing an original taxonomy of these systems based on specified criteria, including the nature of the recommender engine, its objective, computing platforms, evaluation metrics and incentive measures; and (iv) conducting an in-depth, critical analysis to identify their limitations and unsolved issues.

Climatic variables, namely precipitation, and temperature are regarded as the primary factors controlling soil organic carbon (SOC) storage; however, no consensus has been made about the magnitude and direction that changes in climatic variables may have on SOC. Based on copula theory, the present study investigates the soil carbon dynamics and the likelihood of SOC occurrence under varying climatic conditions across India's 14 agro-climatic zones. Results demonstrate the possibility of occurrence of SOC under both low and high temperature/precipitation conditions. It was found that the SOC of agro-climatic zones situated in semi-arid and arid regions are more sensitive to changes in climatic variables compared to that of the others. We then quantify the soil resilience of the agro-climatic zones based on the amount of SOC content. Results showed that only 1/3 of India's agro-climatic zones were resilient during the study period (1985–2005). Thus, the study's findings facilitate the identification of India's most sensitive agro-climatic zone for soil carbon management and climate-related policy. It stresses the need for big data assimilation to identify site-specific management practices that can facilitate soil health and improve the country's soil resilient capacity for food security and environmental management. © 2021","Big data analytics; Climatic variables; Copula; Resilience; Security; Soil organic carbon","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Environmental management; Food supply; Information management; Soils; Binding-sites; Climatic variables; Climatic zone; Copula; Data analytics; Food security; Resilience; Security; Soil carbon; Soil organic carbon; Organic carbon; climate variation; data set; environmental management; food security; organic carbon; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105485893

This seasonally flooded wetland is mainly used by smallholder farmers who cultivate during the rainy season, although there are some community-based irrigation systems that reduce hydro-climatic risks. In this study, we aim to understand how farmers’ aspirations and visions about the future are related to the current agricultural practices and human–water interaction. We specifically investigate the differences between farmers from rainfed and irrigated agriculture by using focus group discussions. Analysis of the in-depth interviews highlights how farmers’ actions both shape and respond to this highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Furthermore, we identify a close link, driven by the farmers’ level of agency, between aspirations and expected agro-economic development. The heterogeneity of farmers’ agency and hence their ability to cope with change is not only based on the socioeconomic status but also on their perception of the physical environment. We thus recommend that attention is also paid to the capacity for coping with environmental challenges that influences the level of farmers’ aspiration. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agro-economic development; Aspiration gap; Decision-making under uncertainty; Focus group discussions; Hydro-climatic risk; Smallholder farmers","decision making; economic development; farmers knowledge; future prospect; irrigation system; rainfed agriculture; risk factor; smallholder; uncertainty analysis; Kilombero Valley; Morogoro [Tanzania]; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103680011

Quantifying local sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG) facilitate evaluating mitigation options. We present an approach to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape, to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region. Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland. Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the region (66%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total emissions of the region by 72%. The region's net emissions amounted to 4.37 ± 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr−1, corresponding to a net emission intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km−2 yr−1, and estimated per capita net emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr−1. Our landscape approach opens opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions. © 2021 The Authors","Anthropogenic; Crop land; Forest; GHG; Mire; Waterbodies","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Intelligent systems; Lakes; Land use; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen oxides; Rivers; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenics; Crop land; Forest; Greenhouses gas; Mire; Source and sink; Spatially explicit; Undrained; Waterbodies; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission inventory; forest; forest inventory; greenhouse gas; landscape structure; methane; mire; Monte Carlo analysis; nitrous oxide; quantitative analysis; source-sink dynamics; agriculture; air pollution; aquatic environment; arable land; Article; carbon balance; climate change; combustion; cropland; Finland; forest; fuel combustion; greenhouse gas; land use; Monte Carlo method; peat extraction; peatland; priority journal; river basin; source sink relationship; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103384941

When the CB is closing and moving contacts and the nozzle are moving toward fixed contacts, the SF6 gas enters the puffer volume via the refill valve. Since changing the refill valve diameter can alter the direction of the SF6 gas motion in the closing operation of CBs, understanding its effects on CBs' function and performance may help to improve the CB design. This paper has focused on the effects of refill valve diameter on prestrike occurrence in the closing operation of puffer type SF6 CBs. In order to accurately study these effects, some equations are used in the developed multiphysics model, including the Navier-Stokes equations and standard K-ϵ turbulent model for modeling the motion of the SF6 gas, heat equation for calculation of the gas temperature, Maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields modeling, and gas state equation for taking into account the severe dependence of the SF6 gas properties on temperature.

Promoting the reform of the electricity spot market provides a good opportunity to realize the consumption of large-scale renewable energy. This article aims at the northwest region where renewable energy accounts for a relatively high proportion in my country, and clarifies the factors that inhibit the consumption of renewable energy. Based on the investigation of the typical foreign power spot market model, a power spot market model suitable for large-scale renewable energy is proposed. According to the actual data of a province's power grid in the northwest region, the day-ahead spot market under different models was cleared separately. The results show that the centralized market model is more suitable for large-scale renewable energy grid-connected consumption, and is conducive to promoting energy conservation and emission reduction and reducing power generation costs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy utilization; Centralized market; Electricity spot market; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Installed capacity; Northwest regions; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Renewable energy power; Power markets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112491954

These processes influence the nature of terrestrial OC (OCterr) export and the magnitude of OCterr burial in marginal seas, with important environmental implications such as CO2 release and hypoxia. In this study, we determined the contents and carbon isotopic compositions (13C and 14C) of bulk OC and fatty acids (FAs) as well as the sedimentological characteristics of suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples collected from two sites over four seasons and of surface sediment samples from three sites in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) to evaluate processes controlling OCterr degradation and aging along an estuarine gradient. We found that the abundance-weighted average C24-32FA 14C ages increased by an average of ∼1170 years for SPM and by an average of ∼3440 years in PR/PRE sediments, along the ∼60 km PRE transect. These increases in the FA age coincided with an 86% decrease in the corresponding mineral surface area-normalized FA loading along the sediment transport pathway, implying that selective degradation of labile and younger OC resulted in apparent OC aging. These measurements reveal an important shift in the nature of OC, with implications for biogeochemical cycling within estuaries and for regional environmental changes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","compound-specific radiocarbon analysis; estuarine environment; organic carbon degradation and aging; Pearl River estuary; terrestrial organic carbon","Biogeochemistry; Fatty acids; Organic carbon; Sediment transport; Suspended sediments; Biogeochemical cycling; Carbon isotopic composition; Environmental change; Environmental implications; Pearl River estuary; Sediment transport pathways; Selective degradation; Suspended particulate matters; Estuaries; carbon 13; carbon 14; fatty acid; organic carbon; carbon; biogeochemical cycle; environmental degradation; estuarine environment; organic carbon; Article; biogeochemical cycling; bioremediation; chemical composition; environmental change; estuary; seasonal variation; sediment; sediment transport; surface area; suspended particulate matter; volume; environmental monitoring; river; water pollutant; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Geologic Sediments; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111321189

While these declarations have been interpreted as a demonstration of ambition, little is known about how and why they actually came about when they did and the implications this will have for what happens next. Focusing on London, UK, we present evidence collected via semi-structured interviews with experts and practitioners involved in the propagation of climate emergency declarations to critically explore how and why these declarations emerged, and the various different roles they are perceived to play for different local actors. Our findings reveal four journeys to local government declaration of a climate emergency (made actively from above, passively from above, actively from below, and passively from across) and three interwoven purposes (statements of intent, acting as a political gesture, and stimulating local action). We argue that these three purposes combine and coalesce to correlate the declaration of climate emergency with a local responsibility for emissions reduction, leaving little analytical space to question the scalar disconnect between the immediacy of the narrative at local scales and the slow-burning (and) global nature of the threat in question. If these emergency declarations are to be an opportunity for change in the governance of climate change, then the question of ‘what next?’ requires more in-depth, thorough and constructive engagement with the type of climate action the declarations are expected to induce while considering how this aligns with existing responsibilities and resource bases of local government. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate emergency; Local scale; London; United Kingdom; Urban governance","Binary alloys; Emission control; Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Emergency declarations; Emissions reduction; Local climate; Local government; Local scale; London , UK; Semi structured interviews; Climate change; climate change; detection method; local government; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111705648

Until now, no reported research has conducted an extensive survey to predict SOM content, analysed SOM spatial variability, and determined the main controls of SOM variation in areas around Dongting Lake in southern China. Therefore, this study aims to (1) explore the spatial variability of SOM content; (2) build a model to quantitatively predict SOM content with various sources of covariates and with the RF method; and (3) identify potential controls of SOM based on the relative importance of variables. Materials and methods: A total of 8040 soil samples were collected from Yueyang County in Eastern Dongting Lake Plain. Ordinary kriging was used to produce a map of SOM and then the random forest algorithms were used to predict SOM content with 17 covariates covered terrain attributes, land use, climate, soil management policies, soil properties, and geologic information. Finally, the main dominants of SOM variability were identified. Results and discussion: The SOM content in the survey region varied from 4.00 to 446.60 g kg−1 and had an average content of 33.17 g kg−1, which indicated fertile soil in the study area. SOM presented strong spatial variability in the area under study. The high SOM values were majorly located in the northeast and southwest parts of the survey regions. The R2 of our developed model was 0.74 and the RMSE was 0.16 g kg−1. The main controls of SOM variability in the study area were available phosphorus, precipitation, soil group, rotation system, available potassium, altitude, and slope. Conclusion: Our developed model showed a good performance to estimate SOM content using auxiliary variables. Soil properties and agricultural management measures played the most important roles in predicting SOM in the study area. Results obtained from this study could provide new insights for estimating SOM and contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture and better regulation of soil quality in the study area.

Using simple calculations and published values on Sargassum coverage, biomass density, carbon/biomass ratio, primary productivity, and carbon sequestration efficiency, we show that the total carbon stock in pelagic Sargassum of the entire Atlantic, even during the peak month, is unlikely to exceed 3.61 × 10−3 Pg C, and carbon fixation cannot exceed 6.0 million tons C month−1. While the carbon fixation estimate represents an upper bound, it is still &lt;0.2% of carbon fixation by phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean. The carbon stock estimate is 2000 times lower than predicted using a machine learning model in another recent paper. In contrast, carbon sequestration by Sargassum appears significant locally within the Atlantic Sargassum belt. The analysis further suggests that, while the Atlantic pelagic Sargassum may play an important role in affecting local carbon budget and carbon sequestration, its contribution to either carbon stock or carbon sequestration at a global scale may be insignificant. This, however, does not diminish the importance of Atlantic pelagic Sargassum in many other aspects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Ocean; Biomass; Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stock; Climate change; Phytoplankton; Primary production; Remote sensing; Sargassum","Budget control; Carbon; Forestry; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Atlantic Ocean; Brown seaweed; Carbon carbons; Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Climate change mitigation; Primary production; Remote-sensing; Sargassa; Climate change; biomass; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; climate change; phytoplankton; primary production; remote sensing; seaweed; algal growth; algorithm; Article; biomass; calculation; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; environmental impact assessment; machine learning; mathematical analysis; population abundance; population density; priority journal; Sargassum; seasonal variation; species distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Sargassum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103686150

Although varied resource allocation patterns among different organs in different functional groups of terrestrial plants have been found, few studies have focused on freshwater ecosystems. In this study, to clarify biomass and nutrient allocation strategies and their responses to environmental factors, we collected and analysed 2,162 samples from 262 aquatic plant communities (including emergent plants, floating-leaved plants and submerged plants) in various aquatic habitats in north-eastern China. The results showed that the root/shoot (R/S) ratios of the three aquatic plant life-forms were significantly different, and the trend showed that the ratio values for the three plant life-forms occurred in the following order: emergent plants > floating-leaved plants > submerged plants. There were obvious scaling relationships between above-ground biomass, N (or P or N:P ratios) and below-ground biomass, N (or P or N:P ratios), but their scaling exponents changed among different aquatic plant life-forms. The allocation of biomass and nutrients between different organ responses to environmental factors was not consistent for the different life-forms of aquatic plants. The partial least squares path model revealed that plant stoichiometric characteristics are important direct drivers of biomass production.

To mitigate these impacts, it is essential to estimate bus emissions and analyze their characteristics. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), termed GRU-XGB, to predict gaseous pollutants from bus emissions (CO, CO2, HC, NOX) under real conditions. On-road experimental data collected from CNG-fueled and diesel-powered buses in Zhenjiang was used as a case study to verify the model's effectiveness. A comparison between the proposed and other state-of-the-art models reveals that GRU-XGB performs best for all evaluation metrics on both microscopic and aggregative levels, with an average correlation coefficient above 0.98 and an average MAPE lower than 9%. Moreover, the results of estimation errors analysis suggest that the real conditions of bus stations are more complicated than those of intersections and road sections. In most cases, however, the emission factors produced from intersections are proven to be the highest. Furthermore, operating patterns are shown to be the most significant factors, with relative importance equal to 45.09% and 71.68% for CNG and diesel buses, respectively. Besides, the results also indicate that humidity has little impact on this issue, while the influence of temperature is obvious, with relative importance equal to 17.56% and 9.41% for CNG and diesel buses, separately. Such findings can provide theoretical guidance for both emission estimation and environmental protection. Also, it is applicable for the management of accurate monitoring from an urban-level and can be integrated into emission simulation tools. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Bus emissions; Environmental protection; Extreme gradient boosting; Gated recurrent unit","Air quality; Bus transportation; Deterioration; Environmental protection; Fog; Roads and streets; Bus emission; CNG bus; Condition; Diesel bus; Extreme gradient boosting; Gaseous pollutants; Gated recurrent unit; Hybrid modelling; Model-based OPC; Urban areas; Buses; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; comparative study; correlation; diesel engine; environmental protection; estimation method; experimental study; humidity; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; urban transport; air pollutant; analytical error; Article; artificial neural network; China; correlation coefficient; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; extreme gradient boosting; gas waste; gated recurrent unit; humidity; intermethod comparison; machine learning; measurement accuracy; priority journal; statistical model; urban area; China; Jiangsu; Zhenjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104154646

In the European Union (EU), the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive 2016/2284/EU sets ambitious reduction targets by more than 30% for some countries by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. As urease inhibitors (UIs) can reduce the NH3 emission from urea by up to 70%, Germany has enforced their addition to granular urea by the national Fertilizer Ordinance since 2020. Therefore, this study investigates the implementation of UIs for urea fertilizers via national policy regulations to evaluate their contribution to achieving the 2030 targets in the EU countries. The results indicate that the contribution of UIs for countries with high reduction targets can reach 20%-60% of the required NEC reduction. The assessment of costs and benefits of UI implementation demonstrates that the ratio of benefits to costs can reach 70. Therefore, we recommend that adding UIs to urea fertilizers is one of the best strategies for mitigation of NH3 emissions not only in the EU but also in other regions such as China. © 2021 The Author(s).

Moreover, demand changes will directly affect the energy sector as the supply side amplifies the economic impact through the industrial linkages among regions and sectors. Therefore, we developed an integrated assessment model combining an energy demand-driven model (EDD) and adaptive multiregional input-output model (AMRIO). The assumptions were used in the model based on China's future climate, economy and energy development. In addition, we evaluated the century-scale energy demand change and its possible economic impact in 5 future scenarios (SSPx-y of CMIP6). The results show that the following: (i) The energy demand in China will continue to increase by approximately 1.89–1.94 times by 2100, resulting in a negative economic impact on GDP ranging from 8.19% to 12.05%. (ii) The energy sector will cumulatively benefit by 26% because of the increase in demand; however, other sectors will suffer negative economic ripple impacts due to the imbalance of supply and demand, especially manufacturing (719%) and agriculture (577%).

This study uses multi-source aerosol datasets, including Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), to conduct a long-term variation assessment of aerosol load, high aerosol load frequency, and dominant aerosol types over Asia. The results indicate that regional aerosol type information with adequate spatial resolution can be combined with aerosol optical depth (AOD) values and heavy aerosol load frequency characterization results to explore the key contributors to air pollution. During the study period, the aerosol load over the North China Plain, Central China, Yangtze River Delta, Red River Delta, Sichuan Basin, and Pearl River Delta exhib-ited an increasing trend from 2000–2009 due to a sharp rise in aerosol emissions with economic development and a declining trend from 2010–2019 under stricter energy conservation controls and emissions reductions. The growth of urban/industrial (UI) type and biomass burning (BB) type aerosol emissions hindered the improvement of the atmospheric environment. Therefore, in future pollution mitigation efforts, focus should be on the control of UI-type and BB-type aerosol emissions. The Indus–Ganges River Plain, Deccan Plateau, and Eastern Ghats show a continuously increasing trend; however, the aerosol load growth rate of the last decade was lower than that of the first decade, which was mainly due to the decrease in the proportion of the mixed type aerosols. © 2021 by the authors.

The on-going CO2CRC Otway project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of large-scale CO2 storage in deep saline formations and to develop new monitoring technologies in Australia. The relative permeability curves are essential for predicting the movements of CO2 and estimate residual trapping in the aquifer during and after injection through numerical simulations. However, studies of relative permeability curves for the Paaratte sandstone at the in situ conditions are limited. In addition, different rock types in the Paaratte formation can behave differently when CO2 displaces brine. This work reports four relative permeability experiments of CO2/brine systems using the unsteady-state core flooding method for different types of rock collected from various depths of Paaratte formations at near-reservoir conditions. The relative permeability results calculated from the analytical Johnson, Bossler, and Naumann (JBN) method and the numerical history matching method are compared. The JBN method does not calculate the relative permeability accurately for CO2/brine systems due to the assumptions of incompressible flow, since the CO2 relative permeability results calculated from the JBN method are similar for all the cases. The history matching results show that the brine (water) relative permeability of the core samples with a high fraction of macropores is similar to the measurements for Paaratte formation reported in the literature over a large range of brine (water) saturation. In contrast, the brine relative permeability of the core samples with a high fraction of micropores is considerably higher than that of the core samples with macropores, suggesting better connectivity for the samples with a high fraction of micropores. The new findings will be useful in reservoir-scale numerical modelings of the Paaratte formation to more accurately predict the movement of CO2 during and after the injection. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon storage; CO2 drainage; CO2-brine multiphase fluids; core flooding experiments; relative permeability","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Core samples; Hydrogeology; Incompressible flow; Microporosity; Numerical methods; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); CO2 sequestration; Deep saline aquifers; Deep saline formations; Monitoring technologies; Multiphase fluids; Relative permeability; Relative permeability curves; Reservoir conditions; Petroleum reservoir engineering; brine; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; drainage; experimental study; hydrocarbon reservoir; multiphase flow; permeability; reservoir flooding; sandstone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105217920

Primary production supporting the coastal ecosystems is supposed to be affected by progressive ocean acidification driven by increasing CO2 emissions. In order to investigate the effects of high pCO2 (HC) on eutrophic plankton community structure and ecological functions, we employed 9 mesocosms and carried out an experiment under ambient (∼410 ppmv) and future high (1000 ppmv) atmospheric pCO2 conditions, using in situ plankton community in Wuyuan Bay, East China Sea. Our results showed that HC along with natural seawater temperature rise significantly boosted biomass of diatoms with decreased abundance of dinoflagellates in the late stage of the experiment, demonstrating that HC repressed the succession from diatoms to dinoflagellates, a phenomenon observed during algal blooms in the East China Sea. HC did not significantly influence the primary production or biogenic silica contents of the phytoplankton assemblages. However, the HC treatments increased the abundance of viruses and heterotrophic bacteria, reflecting a refueling of nutrients for phytoplankton growth from virus-mediated cell lysis and bacterial degradation of organic matters. Conclusively, our results suggest that increasing CO2 concentrations can modulate plankton structure including the succession of phytoplankton community and the abundance of viruses and bacteria in eutrophic coastal waters, which may lead to altered biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Sun, Yang, Jiang, Wang, Song, Wang, Zhang, Li, Yi, Chen, Bao, Qu, Zhang, Jiao, Gao, Huang, Lin, Gao and Gao.","biogenic silica; community structure; eutrophic coasts; ocean acidification; plankton; viruses",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114296886

As such, proper management and planning of electricity are essential to mitigating climate change. This paper presents a hybrid inexact credibility constraint programming (ICCP) model for planning and optimization in the electricity sector for Ontario, Canada. The model considers the costs and emissions of electricity generated from six sources over a planning horizon of 30 years, minimizing system cost while meeting provincial emission goals. The ICCP method addresses uncertainties by transforming fuzzy variables into crisp equivalents with credibility levels, allowing decision-makers to address uncertainties in planning by tackling uncertainties as intervals through an interactive two-step algorithm. This model was applied to electricity planning in Ontario to address uncertainties due to demand predictions, technological advancements, and shifting energy consumption. The cap-and-trade program was compared to the federal carbon pricing backstop program, and the results over the planning horizon were similar. Through this model, expansion options to address future demands were also compared to minimize emissions while meeting electricity demand. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Credibility; Electricity; Fuzzy; Interval; Optimization; Uncertainty","Carbon; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Decision making; Energy utilization; Cap-and-trade program; Climatic conditions; Constrained programming; Constraint programming; Electricity demands; Electricity sector; Technological advancement; Two-step algorithms; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105147559

To reduce the population exposure to water scarcity and improve universal access to safe drinking water are important targets of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 in the near future. This study aims to examine the potential of applying adaptive inner-basin water allocation measures (AIWAM), which were not explicitly considered in previous studies, for mitigating water scarcity in the future period (2020–2050). By incorporating AIWAM in water scarcity assessment, nonagricultural water uses are assumed to have high priority over agricultural water use and thus would receive more water supply. Results show that global water deficit is projected to be ~3241.9 km3/yr in 2050, and severe water scarcity is mainly found in arid and semi-arid regions, e.g. Western US, Northern China, and the Middle East. Future warming climate and socioeconomic development tend to aggravate global water scarcity, particularly in Northern Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. The application of AIWAM could significantly mitigate water scarcity for nonagricultural sectors by leading to a decrease of global population subject to water scarcity by 12% in 2050 when compared to that without AIWAM. However, this is at the cost of reducing water availability for agricultural sector in the upstream areas, resulting in an increase of global irrigated cropland exposed to water scarcity by 6%. Nevertheless, AIWAM provides a useful scenario that helps design strategies for reducing future population exposure to water scarcity, particularly in densely populated basins and regions. Our findings highlight increasing water use competition across sectors between upstream and downstream areas, and the results provide useful information to develop adaptation strategies towards sustainable water management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive measures; Water allocation; Water deficit; Water demand; Water scarcity","Agriculture; Climate change; Planning; Rivers; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Adaptive measures; Middle East; Population exposure; Safe drinking water; Universal access; Water allocations; Water deficits; Water demand; Water scarcity; Water use; Potable water; water; adaptive management; climate change; drinking water; sustainable development; water demand; water management; water supply; water use; agriculture; Article; desert; fluid intake; futurology; greenhouse effect; human; priority journal; river basin; water insecurity; water management; water supply; Central Asia; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104103629

Mowing is an essential component of an airport’s Wildlife Hazard Management Plan (WHMP), which reduces the risk of birds and other wildlife to aircraft operations. Many airports have large areas of land (hundreds or even thousands of acres), which requires significant resources to manage and mow; experience at the Purdue Airport (KLAF) suggests that automated mowing may support economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. Automated mowing supports economic efficiency by reducing personnel requirements, although personnel are still needed for inspections, maintenance, and “mower rescue” if there is a malfunction (technical or field issue). Automated mowing supports environmental impacts by reducing local emissions since the mower is powered by electricity rather than gasoline; this benefit would be increased with the use of solar-powered mowers. Automated mowing may not be viable everywhere, and factors such as terrain, access to available power, acreage, and location on the airfield (including proximity to protected areas) must be carefully considered. Although automated mowing will not completely replace traditional mowing in the near future, autonomous mowers in remote areas may be an appropriate practice to support airport sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

By using these systems, clustered buildings combined with industrial waste heat can achieve a net-zero energy balance on a variety of time scales. Thanks to the low exergy approach, these systems are highly efficient. As part of the Smart Anergy Quarter Baden (SANBA) project, the thermal energy grid simulation tool TEGSim has been further developed and used to design an ultra-low-temperature district heating (ULTDH) network with hydraulic and thermal components fitted to the specific regional characteristics of the investigated case. Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) used as seasonal storage ensures long-term feasibility. The annual discrepancy of input of thermal energy provided by space cooling and output of energy demanded by space heating and domestic hot water is supplied by an external low-grade industrial waste heat source.

As a result, energy systems around the world are undergoing a process of fundamental change and transformation that goes far beyond the technological dimension. While energy system models have been developed and used for several decades to support decision makers in governments and companies, these models usually focus on the techno-economic dimension, whereas they fall short in addressing and considering behavioural and societal aspects of decisions related to technology acceptance, adoption, and use. In fact, it is often the societal dimension that comes with the greatest challenges and barriers when it comes to making such a socio-technical transformation happen in reality. This paper therefore provides an overview of state-of-the-art energy system models on the one hand and research studying behavioural aspects in the energy sector on the other hand. We find that these are two well-developed fields of research but that they have not yet been integrated sufficiently well to provide answers to the many questions arising in the context of complex socio-technical transformation processes of energy systems. While some promising approaches integrating these two fields can be identified, the total number is very limited. Based on our findings, research gaps and potentials for improvement of both energy system models and behavioural studies are derived. We conclude that a stronger collaboration across disciplines is required. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on empirical evidence, the study simulates the thermal impact of completely retrofitting an existing building in a Southern African urban context with passively controlled, non-integrated RTGs under current and future climate change affected climatic conditions. The study concludes that the current greenhouse technologies used in South African rooftop farms provide limited thermal modulation capacity for farmers, as well as generally negatively affecting the thermal performance of the associated buildings. Simulating both highly and poorly insulated buildings reveal contrasting impacts on the indoor thermal environment, with a 0.73 °C decrease and 0.55 °C increase in mean temperatures, respectively. Conversely, the highly insulated simulation reveals an annual energy consumption increase of 3.5%, which progressively worsens under higher climate change induced temperatures. These findings, based on current practices in the BIA industry, hope to inform both the choice of technology, as well as the development of appropriate greenhouse technologies to maximise their performance and enable co-benefits as often assumed in the industry. © 2021","Appropriate technologies; Building integrated agriculture; Building performance modelling; Climate change; Thermal performance; Urban agriculture","Buildings; Climate change; Energy utilization; Greenhouses; Land use; Retrofitting; 'current; Adaptation strategies; Appropriate technologies; Building integrated; Building integrated agriculture; Building performance modeling; Future climate; Greenhouse design; Thermal Performance; Urban agricultures; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108063216

In New York State (NYS), the local air quality has significantly improved due to reductions in anthropogenic emission over the past decades. As the intensity and frequency of wildfires are continuously increasing under changing climate, smoke aerosols are predicted to become the dominant source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration in NYS in the future. In this study, smoke and non-smoke cases in NYS during the summer seasons of 2012–2019 were identified using satellite measurements and aerosol reanalysis products. Overall, smoke cases showed higher PM2.5 concentrations than non-smoke cases with average PM2.5 concentrations of 11.5 ± 5.9 μg m−3 and 6.6 ± 4.6 μg m−3, respectively. PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 20 μg m−3 mainly occurred during smoke cases. In addition, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to estimate surface PM2.5 mass concentrations at 21 air quality monitoring sites in NYS. Results showed that, for smoke cases, the application of predictors designed as indicators of vertical transport mechanisms and smoke inflow from the fire source regions generally improved the model performance by reducing the model errors. Also, analysis of the variable correlations and variable importance indicated that synoptic subsidence, entrainment process, and turbulent mixing within PBL collectively contributed to PM2.5 concentrations for smoke cases. Machine learning techniques showed the capabilities of learning the general air quality features, characterizing the key contributors to PM2.5 concentrations, and distinguishing the vertical transport processes of smoke aerosols. © 2021 The Authors","Air quality; Machine learning; PM2.5; Smoke aerosol; Vertical mixing","Aerosols; Air entrainment; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Fires; Machine learning; Neural networks; Smoke; % reductions; Anthropogenic emissions; Changing climate; Fine particulate matter; Machine-learning; New York State; PM$-2.5$; Smoke aerosols; Vertical mixing; Wildfire smoke; Mixing; air quality; anthropogenic source; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); machine learning; particulate matter; smoke; spatiotemporal analysis; turbulent mixing; wildfire; aerosol; air monitoring; article; artificial neural network; machine learning; New York; particulate matter 2.5; smoke; summer; wildfire; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107284037

With the rapid progress of China's urbanization, the total energy consumption is constantly rising, among which the urban energy consumption accounts for more than two thirds of the total energy consumption. Therefore, the urban energy utilization efficiency largely determines the overall level of China's energy utilization. The results show that the growth rate of energy efficiency and the growth rate of energy use technology efficiency decrease under the constraint of environment. At the same time, due to the neglect of energy emission reduction technologies, the growth rate of technological progress in energy use decreases. As is known to all, carbon dioxide emitted by energy consumption causes a surge in greenhouse gases, leading to global climate anomalies, and China's carbon dioxide emissions have now surpassed the United States as the number one carbon dioxide emitter. Energy efficiency is an important ""energy source"". Drew Warren (1982) regards energy efficiency as the ""fifth energy source""alongside coal, oil, natural gas and electricity. Energy efficiency needs to play a major role as a ""source of energy""as it can reduce reliance on energy.

Nevertheless, the contribution due to off-driving photovoltaic (PV) recharging shall be adequately accounted for when approaching the development and testing of energy-efficient and environment-friendly powertrain energy management. The aim of this work was thus to enhance the existing highly charge-depleting (HCD) control strategy of a 48V mild-hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV), implementing a state-of-charge-dependent soft charge-depleting (SCD) one. The performance of the implemented control strategy was analyzed on two different vehicle configurations, obtained by integrating a solar kit with the aforementioned mild-hybrid powertrain. The modelling framework used to perform simulation-based analysis was suitably updated in such a way as to test both charge-depleting and quasi-charge-sustaining strategies. A scenario analysis was thus enabled, whose objective was to assess the FE and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction potential associated with the joint effect of solar hybridization and the proposed battery state-of-charge-driven control rules. The Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS) was simulated for the four vehicle scenarios available (conventional, MHEV-HCD, MHEV-SCD, and solar mild hybrid).

To complement global efforts to mitigate climate change, there is a need for accurate estimations of GHG emissions using country-specific emission factors (EFs). The objective of this study was to develop national EFs for the estimation of CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation in South Korean dairy cattle. Information on dairy cattle herd characteristics, diet, and management practices specific to South Korean dairy cattle farming was obtained. Enteric CH4 EFs were estimated according to the 2019 refinement of the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using the Tier 2 approach. Three animal subcategories were considered according to age: milking cows >2 years, 650 kg body weight (BW); heifers 1–2 years, 473 kg BW; and growing animals <1 year, 167 kg BW. The estimated enteric CH4 EFs for milking cows, heifers, and growing animals, were 139, 83, and 33 kg/head/year, respectively. Currently, the Republic of Korea adopts the Tier 1 default enteric CH4 EFs from the North America region for GHG inventory reporting. Compared with the generic Tier 1 default EF of 138 (kg CH4/head/year) proposed by the 2019 refinement to the 2006 IPCC guidelines for high-milking cows, our suggested value for milking cows was very similar (139 kg CH4 /head/year) and different to heifers and growing animals EFs. In addition, enteric CH4 EFs were strongly correlated with the feed digestibility, level of milk production, and CH4 conversion rate. The adoption of the newly developed EFs for dairy cattle in the next national GHG inventory would lead to a potential total GHG reduction from the South Korean dairy sector of 97,000 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year (8%). The outcome of this study underscores the importance of obtaining country-specific EFs to estimate national enteric CH4 emissions, which can further support the assessment of mitigation actions. © 2021 by the authors.

With lengthening of a polymethine chain the silver NPs' effect on the D and I IFL values has been increasing. Whilst, a spectral overlap between the silver NPs and merocyanines has been decreasing. It is argued that the effect of the silver NPs on optical properties of the dye solutions may be related to the growth in the value of electron dipole moment of ground-to-the first excited state transition at the lengthened polymethine chain. The dye fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes in the presence of silver NPs have been measured.

Over the past few years, there has been a particularly intensive demand for alternatives to fossil fuels, because when they are burned, substances that pollute the environment are released. In addition to the smoke from fuels burned for heating and harmful emissions that industrial installations release, the exhaust emissions of vehicles create a large share of the fossil fuel pollution. Alternative fuels, known as non-conventional and advanced fuels, are derived from resources other than fossil fuels. Because alcoholic fuels have several physical and propellant properties similar to those of gasoline, they can be considered as one of the alternative fuels. Alcoholic fuels or alcohol-blended fuels may be used in gasoline engines to reduce exhaust emissions. This study aimed to develop a gasoline engine model to predict the influence of different types of alcohol-blended fuels on performance and emissions. For the purpose of this study, the AVL Boost software was used to analyse characteristics of the gasoline engine when operating with different mixtures of ethanol, methanol, butanol, and gasoline (by volume). Results obtained from different fuel blends showed that when alcohol blends were used, brake power decreased and the brake specific fuel consumption increased compared to when using gasoline, and CO and HC concentrations decreased as the fuel blends percentage increased. © 2021 by the author.

Global warming is one of the leading issues caused by human activities. To cope with environmental challenges, and to achieve carbon neutrality, fiscal decentralization and eco-innovation are promising strategies that can also enable countries and local governments to pursue visible economic growth. This study investigates the role of export diversification, environment-related technological innovation, and fiscal decentralization in effectively achieving carbon neutrality target for 37 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) economies from 1970 to 2019. For empirical analysis, it uses second-generation tests that deal with heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence issues. To this end, this study employs updated cointegration techniques. The augmented mean group (AMG) approach is used to examine the long-run dynamic equilibrium among the variables of interest. The findings indicate that export diversification and fiscal decentralization followed by GDP growth affect carbon dioxide emission positively. While renewable energy consumption and environment-related technological innovation assure environmental improvement. Additionally, short-run causal and unidirectional links are found running from fiscal decentralization, export diversification, and environment-related technological innovation to carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that OECD partner countries need to be careful while devising fiscal decentralization and export diversification policies. They should increase the share of renewable energy, and expand environment-related technological innovation. Such strategic efforts would direct the OECD countries to meet the climate change mitigation agenda of sustainable development goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon neutrality; Eco-Innovation; Export diversification; Fiscal decentralization; Renewable energy","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decentralization; developing world; environmental economics; environmental management; export; global warming; human activity; innovation; OECD; Sustainable Development Goal; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; decentralization; economic development; empirical research; energy consumption; environmental indicator; government; gross national product; high income country; manufacturing industry; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; pollution; renewable energy; sustainable development; technology; cross-sectional study; economic development; human; Carbon Dioxide; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Development; Humans; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105837091

The empirical investigation involves the estimation of a panel autoregressive distributed lag model in a multivariate framework by employing the pooled mean group estimator. The estimates are presented for homogenous long-run effects and heterogeneous (country-specific) short-run effects of EE and RE on carbon emissions. The estimated results suggest that a cointegrating link is evident between carbon emissions, EE and RE in South Asian countries, especially after controlling the effects of economic growth and trade openness. The homogenous coefficient estimates reveal that in the long run, carbon emissions decline with a rise in RE, but emissions increase with an improvement in EE. Moreover, heterogeneous coefficient estimates indicate that in the short run, both low-carbon strategies (EE and RE) are effective for India and Nepal. However, only one strategy is effective for Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, that is, RE, RE and EE, respectively. The findings of this study provide new and valuable insights about the impact of EE and RE on carbon emissions in South Asian countries.

However, the contribution of climatic factors, human impact, and dispersal strategies in driving invasion processes is still controversial and not well embedded in the existing theoretical considerations. Here, we study how climate, species dispersal strategies, and human impact determine plant invasion processes on islands distributed in all major oceans in the context of directional ecological filtering. Location: Six mountainous, tropical, and subtropical islands in three major oceans: Island of Hawai'i and Maui (Pacific), Tenerife and La Palma (Atlantic), and La Réunion and Socotra (Indian Ocean). Taxon: Vascular Plants. Methods: We recorded 360 non-native species in 218 plots along roadside elevational transects covering the major temperature, precipitation and human impact (i.e., road density) gradients of the islands. We collected dispersal strategies for a majority of the recorded species and calculated the environmental niche per species using a hypervolume approach. Results: Non-native species’ generalism (i.e., mean community niche width) increased with precipitation, elevation and human impact but showed no relationship with temperature. Increasing precipitation led to environmental filtering of non-native species resulting in more generalist species under high precipitation conditions. We found no directional filtering for temperature but an optimum range of most species between 10 and 20°C. Niche widths of non-native species increased with the prevalence of certain dispersal strategies, particularly anemochory and anthropochory. Main conclusions: Plant invasion on tropical and subtropical islands seems to be mainly driven by precipitation and human impact, while temperature seems to be of little importance. Furthermore, anemochory and anthropochory are dispersal strategies associated with large niche widths of non-native species. Our study allows a more detailed look at the mechanisms behind directional ecological filtering of non-native plant species in non-temperature-limited ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

While existing studies attempted to create an exhaustive list of barriers by focusing on “what” is occurring, we continue to have a meager understanding of “how” or “why” barriers emerge in the governance process. Selecting Bangladesh as a case study area, we identify the mechanisms that cause the emergence of barriers in the climate change adaptation governance process. We particularly focus on the barriers that emerge through interactions among actors. We base our research on data from key-informant interviews and a systematic literature review. Our analysis reveals that there are at least five mechanisms that are involved in the emergence of barriers: enclosure and exclusion, boundary control, organizational inertia, belief formation, and frame polarization. Our identification of common mechanisms provides insights on actors' roles and activities in adaptation governance and elucidates the processes through which actors' interactions lead to barriers. This mechanism-based analysis of barriers will help to address and navigate through the barriers more effectively to ensure successful adaptation. As climate change is becoming mainstreamed in development plans and policies in our study area, identifying the mechanisms of adaptation barriers can elucidate how development and climate adaptation strategies are affected by identified barriers. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; Bangladesh; barriers; governance; mechanisms","adaptive management; climate change; development strategy; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental research; governance approach; literature review; policy approach; research work; strategic approach; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096697509

RDD4 protein was highly accumulated in leaf sheaths and localized to vascular bundles. RDD4-overexpressing plants (RDD4-OX) improved the accumulation of various nutrient ions, irrespective of nutrient concentration in a hydroponic solution. K+ and Cl− deficiencies induced the accumulation of other cations and anions, respectively. Interestingly, in RDD4-OX plants K+ and Cl− deficiencies increased PO43− and Mg2+ contents, respectively, despite opposite electric charges. Furthermore, PO43− deficiency induced NO3− and Mg2+ accumulation in RDD4-OX plants. These data show that RDD4 is associated with the control of nutrient ion contents within plants. Also, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in RDD4-OX plants was higher than in wild-type (WT) plants, although the sizes of shoots and panicles decreased in RDD4-OX plants. Subsequent microarray analysis indicated that OsFWL7, similar to maize CNR1 that negatively regulates plant size, showed the most significant difference in its expression levels between WT and RDD4-OX plants. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that a prominent increase in the OsFWL7 expression reduces plant size in RDD4-OX plants. © 2021 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.",,"ion; plant protein; transcription factor; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Oryza; transgenic plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ions; Nutrients; Oryza; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105422685

In addition to lighting and ventilation, health centers need a reliable electrical source for medical equipment. Thus, they need to reduce their cost, especially energy costs. In other words, environmental problems and high energy consumption cause using other types of energy sources like renewable energies. This article discusses the possibility of implementing hybrid renewable energy systems to supply the power demand for a hospital, by a comparison between techno-economic – environmental parameters. The case study is a hospital located in Tehran, Iran. The load demand of this building is considered as a small-scale load which is about 5342.46 kWh/day and is supplied by the urban grid. The simulation is based on a multi-year module and the variations occurring during the project's lifetime. The energy cost and carbon dioxide emissions for this case are determined to be 0.113 $/kWh and 1555804 kg/year, respectively. The calculations show that by making use of the grid-connected scenario the amount of cost of energy and net present cost will be reduced by 44.2% and 50.2% repetitively and also the amount of CO2 emissions will be reduced by 66% compared to the direct current system.

While considering climate change a security issue, the military’s role in this discourse and praxis becomes critical as a security actor. However, the interrelationships between climate change, security and the military are conceived and approached by different states diversely. Within different states, this triangular relationship is guided by processes with varied practical/policy implications. While ‘securitization’ has generally been used to explain climate security, other processes such as ‘climatization’ have assumed significance, wherein security practices are climatized. The Indian military too has been engaging with security implications of climate change, but by using approaches distinct from Western states, which have been the usual focus in such analyses. In this paper, the framework of climatization is used to analyse the triangular relationship, using the case study of the Indian military—by categorizing climatizing moves as symbolic, strategic, precautionary and transformative. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate security; Climatization; Indian military; Riskification; Securitization","armed forces; climate change; environmental politics; military intervention; security threat; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085556555

Recently, the frequency and intensity of such events have increased remarkably, especially in hyper-arid and arid zones of Yazd province. Under these conditions, it is necessary to address several notable challenges, including methods of detecting the potential sites for wind erosion and dust storms and degree of success in reducing air pollution and dust storms. Thus, this study utilized weather codes of dust to monitor wind erosion and dust storm frequency in Yazd province, Iran. The study also defined a new appropriate index to evaluate air pollution in terms of different dust events. A new dust storm index for air pollution (PDSI) introduces to monitor air pollution. Daily dust storm index (DSI) is another empirical model to study dust storm activities. Weather codes associated with dust events were used at 11 synoptic stations in the Yazd province during 2000–2017. PDSI assessment using meteorological code 06 and hourly scale is used as the main tools for evaluating air pollution. Evaluation of dust weather codes using different weights performed to properly analyze wind erosion and air pollution status at different spatial and temporal scales. Yazd station had the highest amount of air pollution (105.9). Meybod had the highest amount of wind erosion (9.76) with a significant potential to occur dust storm. Assessment of the DSI and PDSI indicates a significant increase (about ten times) in wind erosion and air pollution in recent years. Poor land management and the existence of outdoor dust haze are the main causes of the terrible increase in air pollution during 2008–2017. It is recommended to promote sustainable industrial development and reduce the negative impacts of mining activities in regions with medium to severe air pollution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Arid lands; Dust; Haze; Iran; Visibility; Weather code","arid region; atmospheric pollution; dust; haze; pollution monitoring; visibility; weather; wind erosion; Iran; Yazd; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104133112

Searching for available parking spots can be a time-consuming task that simultaneously increases traffic congestion and greenhouse gas pollution by a significant 40%. A solution that would increase drivers' ability to locate an empty parking spot would represent an important step towards more sustainable parking as it would have a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. This paper proposes how data science can help by evaluating the prediction performance of four machine learning models. Analysed machine learning models are based on different machine learning methods (i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest) and use different real-world data sets (i.e., parking sensor data only or contextually enriched parking sensor data). The dummy (baseline) model is considered as well, but with a R2 score of 61.29% is outperformed by more advanced data science approaches. Prediction performance in the case of using parking sensor data only gives R2 score of 84.31% and 88.16% for Random Forest and CatBoost, respectively. The best prediction performance is achieved using CatBoost and contextually enriched data, resulting in the high-performing machine learning model with the R2 value of 88.83%, thus outperforming the Random Forest model by 1.7%. In fact, for both machine learning methods, the contextually enriched data approach gives better results for predicting parking spot availability. This suggests that parking data should be enriched with contextual data when designing and building sustainable parking solutions for smart cities of the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Contextually enriched data; Data science; Greenhouse gas pollution reduction; Parking spot availability; Smart city; Sustainable parking","Decision trees; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Machine learning; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Contextually enriched data; Gas pollution; Greenhouse gas pollution reduction; Greenhouses gas; Machine learning models; Parking spot; Parking spot availability; Prediction performance; Sensors data; Sustainable parking; Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107662581

Low octane gasoline has emerged as an ideal fuel candidate for premixed charge combustion under diesel-like conditions in gasoline compression ignition (GCI) engines. GCI is an excellent technology to rectify future global energy demand imbalance, because it aims to replace diesel (which is in short supply) with low octane fractions/naphtha (which is in surplus supply) in compression ignition engines. However, this novel combustion concept requires modifications in the conventional design of diesel engines. The combustion chamber shape and in-cylinder flows play a crucial role in charge distribution and temperature stratification. Therefore, understanding the combined effect of combustion chamber geometry and in-cylinder flows is essential for future engine designs. GCI combustion engine simulations for varying swirl ratios (SRs) were performed in CONVERGE CFD software to understand the effect of in-cylinder air motion on the mixture stratification and combustion. A 1/7th sector geometry for a conventional re-entry piston bowl was modeled and then simulated. Two different mechanisms were used for model validation. The results indicated that the large-scale flow structures govern the fuel distribution in the combustion chamber. The charge convection because of increased swirl has a substantial effect on the combustion characteristics of the engine. A distinguished ignition kernel was observed for all test cases. An interfacial region with counter-rotating vortices formed a lean mixture zone, hindering flame propagation and combustion. A lower SR, shallow depth piston, and modifications to avoid flame quenching in the squish zone need to be further investigated to optimize the engine performance. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Combustion chambers; Compression ratio (machinery); Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Gasoline; Mixtures; Pistons; Temperature; Combustion characteristics; Compression ignition engine; Counter-rotating vortices; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Large-scale flow structure; Low temperature combustion; Premixed charge combustion; Temperature stratification; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112383502

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the particulate matter reduction potential of climbing plants used for green walls, an element of vertical green infrastructure. Methods: A sealed chamber with controlled environmental variables was used to assess the PM reduction level caused by climbing plants. PM concentration in the plant chamber was measured after two and four hours of PM exposure, and the reduction potential was assessed based on the leaf area. Results: Compared to the empty chamber (Control), the PM reduction speed per hour was higher in the plant chamber, which confirmed that climbing plants contribute to the reduction of PM in the air. The PM reduction speed immediately after exposure in the plant chamber was high, but this slowed over time. Additionally, PM has been continuously reduced in plants with large leaves. As a result of calculating the particulate matter reduction level based on leaf area, it was found that there was a difference by particle size. Actinidia arguta, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Trachelospermum asiaticum, and Euonymus fortunei var. radicans showed a high reduction effect. The trichomes on the leaf surface of Trachelospermum asiaticum were found to affect PM reduction. Conclusion: PM adsorption on the leaf surface is an important factor in reducing its concentration. It was possible to compare different plants by quantifying the amount of PM reduction during a fixed time period. These results can be used as the basic data to select the plant species suitable for urban green walls in terms of PM reduction. © 2021 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.","Green infrastructure; Leaf shape; Trachelospermum asiaticum; Trichome; Vines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115988054

In addition to that, its low strength-to-weight ratio, high density and thermal conductivity are among the few limitations of heavy weight concrete. Therefore, this study was carried out to provide a solution to these limitations by developing innovative eco-friendly lightweight foamed concrete (LFC) of 1800 kg/m3 density incorporating 20–25% palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and 5–15% eggshell powder (ESP) by weight of total binder as supplementary cementitious material (SCM). The influence of combined utilization of POFA and ESP on the fresh state properties of eco-friendly LFC was determined using the J-ring test. To determine the mechanical properties, a total of 48 cubes and 24 cylinders were prepared for compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity each. A total of 24 panels were prepared to determine the thermal properties in terms of surface temperature and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, to assess the environmental impact and eco-friendliness of the developed LFC, the embodied carbon and eco-strength efficiency was calculated. It was determined that the utilization of POFA and ESP reduced the workability slightly but enhanced the mechanical properties of LFC (17.05 to 22.60 MPa compressive strength and 1.43 to 2.61 MPa tensile strength), thus satisfies the ACI213R requirements for structural lightweight concrete and that it can be used for structural applications. Additionally, the thermal conductivity reduced ranging from 0.55 to 0.63 W/mK compared to 0.82 W/mK achieved by control sample. Furthermore, the developed LFC showed a 16.96 to 33.55% reduction in embodied carbon and exhibited higher eco-strength efficiency between 47.82 and 76.97%. Overall, the combined utilization of POFA and ESP as SCMs not only enhanced the thermo-mechanical performance, makes the sustainable LFC as structural lightweight concrete, but also has reduced the environmental impacts caused by the disposal of POFA and ESP in landfills as well as reducing the total CO2 emissions during the production of eco-friendly LFC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eco-strength efficiency; eggshell powder; palm oil fuel ash; supplementary cementitious materials; surface temperature; thermal conductivity","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; compressive strength; concrete; detection method; eggshell; environmental impact; maximum sustainable yield; mechanical property; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; palm oil; animal; building material; compressive strength; egg shell; powder; Animals; Compressive Strength; Construction Materials; Egg Shell; Palm Oil; Powders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103160114

China's nationwide traffic control during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak provided us a unique opportunity to assess the direct dose-effect relationship between vehicle density and air pollution. We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) μg/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) μg/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) μg/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) μg/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) μg/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P &lt; 0.05 for interaction). According to our estimation, PM2.5 emissions from every doubling of vehicle density can lead to over 8000 excess deaths per year, 66% of which were caused by cardiopulmonary diseases. This natural experiment study is the first to observe the dose-effect relationship between on-road traffic and traffic-generated air pollution, as well as the mitigating effect of urban greening.

In gas turbines, these flames are confined in a combustor and can interact with relatively cold walls. This interaction can quench the flame, producing incomplete combustion products. In this study, Flame-Wall Interaction (FWI) for methane/air flames diluted by hot combustion products is investigated using direct numerical simulation. A three-Dimensional (3D) turbulent V-flame in a channel with isothermal hot and cold walls is simulated. It is shown that a main reaction zone in the central region between two walls supported by periodic bulk ignition events changes the position of volumetric reaction zones where CO is formed. The cold wall leads to a longer flame, thereby having disproportionately large contribution to the exhaust CO. Near-wall turbulence-flame interaction creates wrinkled and streaky flame surfaces, and localises the near-wall CO distribution. High mean CO mass fraction develops in the free-stream while a high magnitude of the peak RMS CO mass fraction is present closer to the wall. It is also shown that one-dimensional flame solutions can reasonably describe the changes of CO mass fraction as a function of temperature in the free-stream region and some parts of the near-wall region but not close to the wall. Turbulent mixing and diffusion effects contribute to this deviation. The results highlight the complexities involved in CO modelling for diluted flames and set a benchmark for future work. © 2021 The Combustion Institute","CO emissions; Combustion modes; Direct numerical simulation; Flame-wall interaction; MILD and diluted flames; Turbulence","Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Direct numerical simulation; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical models; Carbon monoxide emissions; Cold wall; Combustion mode; Combustion products; Direct-numerical-simulation; Flame-wall interaction; Hot combustion; Mass-fraction; MILD and diluted flame; Reaction zones; Turbulence; carbon monoxide; methane; nitrogen oxide; adiabaticity; Article; boundary layer; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; diffusion coefficient; enthalpy; flame; flammability; flow rate; molecular weight; oscillation; oxidation; priority journal; steady state; surface property; thermal conductivity; thermal diffusion; thermodynamics; velocity; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104050901

Therefore, this paper establishes a comprehensive index of vulnerability to climate change based on the vulnerability scoring diagram (VSD) framework. Moran’s I index is used to study the spatial evolution characteristics of vulnerability, and spatial regression analysis is used to explore the factors influencing the spatial distribution of vulnerability. The results show that (1) the climate change vulnerability of China has decreased over time, and the sensitivity state is relatively stable; however, the annual change in exposure and adaptive capacity is significant. (2) The western region of China is more vulnerable than the eastern region, and the most vulnerable provinces are Guizhou and Gansu. (3) The regional vulnerability is generally in a significant spatial agglomeration state. (4) Finally, the driving factors of the spatial distribution of climate change vulnerability include forest coverage, the urban-rural income gap and information technology. These recommendations provide detailed discussions and scientific information for mitigating global warming and formulating long-term emission reduction targets, thereby optimizing resource allocation and providing spatial governance directions for the formulation of adaptation policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Temporal and spatial evolution; Vulnerability","climate change; global warming; regression analysis; resource allocation; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; China; Gansu; Guizhou; acclimatization; China; climate change; forest; spatial analysis; Acclimatization; China; Climate Change; Forests; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103203731

In this paper, we have demonstrated a facile synthetic strategy to create disordered, high-surface-Area metal oxide nanomaterials using biomineralization-inspired methods. Using protamine as a protein template, a range of TiOx-SiOx nanomaterials were synthesized and implemented for catalytic CO2 thermal reduction reactions. The modularity of synthetic options afforded via biomineralization enables increases in surface area, which are ideally suited for subsequent modification to regulate catalytic performance. All materials were thoroughly characterized using a suite of synchrotron scattering and spectroscopic methods. Through these techniques, we have demonstrated that protamine-induced biomineralization results in largely disordered materials with changes in the local atomic structure dependent on the applied synthetic conditions. Protamine removal with treatment under acidic conditions greatly increased material surface area while causing measurable changes in the structure as revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Upon subsequent hydrogenation, Ti-and Si-based defects were induced in the materials while the disordered nature of the material was still largely retained. Furthermore, we found that the incorporation of Si into TiOx was able to mitigate the known anatase to rutile phase change during the reaction while stabilizing the defect sites. The synthetic strategies described in this work are expected to be translatable to other metal oxide nanomaterial chemical structures, providing a means to control catalytic properties using benign synthetic strategies. ©","biomineralization; CO2reduction; protamine; silicon oxide; titanium oxide","Biomineralization; Biosynthesis; Metals; Nanostructured materials; Oxide minerals; Silicon; Spectroscopic analysis; Titanium dioxide; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Catalytic performance; Disordered materials; High-surface area metal oxides; Local atomic structures; Metal oxide nanomaterials; Metal-oxide nanomaterial; Spectroscopic method; Synthetic conditions; Crystal atomic structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111477958

This paper applies the social network analysis to give a clear picture on the evolutionary characteristics of carbon emissions network of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and investigates the technology spillovers of environmental regulation on the carbon emissions network. Empirical results show that: First, the carbon emissions network of OECD countries presents a typical network structure with increasing network density, correlation and decreasing network efficiency. Second, carbon is mainly transferred among European countries along with the international trade, and the impact of countries on the edge of the network is still small. Finally, the U-shape relationship between environmental regulation and carbon emissions network is identified. The innovation inhibition effect exists when the environmental regulation is in a low level, and after arriving at the threshold value, the innovation compensation effect begins to appear. Our findings implied that when making policies for carbon emissions reduction, countries should strengthen the cross-regional communication and fully consider the spatial correlation effect. Some international organizations are supposed to play a leading role in reducing global carbon emissions by controlling the carbon transfer. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emissions network; Environmental regulation; OECD; Technology spillovers","Carbon; Emission control; Environmental technology; International cooperation; International trade; Social sciences computing; Carbon emission network; Carbon emissions; Density correlation; Development countries; Network structures; Networks densities; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Social Network Analysis; Spatial associations; Technology spillovers; Environmental regulations; carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental policy; network analysis; OECD; regulatory framework; social network; spillover effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105323409

A competitive bio-blendstock should have lower prices and/or superior properties. Gasoline is specified by final blended properties rather than compositions, while adding bio-blendstocks, most likely oxygenates, will modify the property mixing rules due to the non-ideal interactions between polar and nonpolar components. This paper presents an equation-of-state model for predicting Reid vapor pressure, non-linear blending models for computing key properties of final products, and an optimization approach to identify key economic drivers. Those models are used to estimate the potential economic value of bio-blendstocks, which is presented by its calculated break-even value as a feedstock to petroleum refineries for gasoline blending without any government subsidy or renewable tax credit. In additional to ethanol, six low-vapor-pressure bio-blendstock candidates were evaluated: i-propanol, n-propanol, i-butanol, diisobutylene, cyclopentanone, and a mixture of furans. Reid vapor pressure, distillation temperatures, and octane numbers were identified as the key economic drivers of adding bio-blendstock to a petroleum-derived base fuel. The calculated economic value ranks as furan mixture (4.9) > cyclopentanone > n-propanol ≈ iso-propanol > iso-butanol > diisobutylene (2.4) in US dollar per gasoline gallon equivalent ($/gge) in 2013 to 2017 5-year averaged price basis. The bio-blendstocks with higher octane numbers may have higher potential economic values. The uncertainties in property predictions may lead to roughly 15% deviation in the potential economic value. © 2021","Biofuel; Economic value; Gasoline blending; Octane number; Reid vapor pressure","Aromatic compounds; Biofuels; Blending; Distillation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrostatic pressure; Mixtures; Organic pollutants; Propanol; Vapor pressure; Blendstocks; Cyclopentanone; Economic values; Gasoline blending; Low vapor pressures; N-propanol; Optimisations; Property; Property estimation; Reid vapor pressure; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103952819

Promoted generation of oxygen free radicals by semiquinone structure of humic substance (HS) in drinking water was considered to be one of its pathogeneses. Therefore, detailed analysis of HS was performed in water and sediment samples collected from three endemic and three disease-free areas in Changdu Region, Tibet, China. After purification of the HS in the samples, the fractions of HS were characterized using electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The organic carbon content of HS did not show a significant difference between endemic and disease-free areas or correlation with KBD-associated morbidity. Except FTIR, all techniques succeeded in characterization of the quinone redox system, indicating their validity and consistency. The quinone redox system in aquatic HS exhibited significantly higher level of the following indexes in endemic areas than disease-free areas: semiquinone radical content of fulvic acid (FA) (p &lt; 0.05), aromaticity of FA (p &lt; 0.05), fluorescence intensity (per gram carbon) of reduced quinone-like component of FA (p &lt; 0.05) and humic acid (HA) (p &lt; 0.1). Semiquinone radical content (r = 0.781, p &lt; 0.1), aromaticity of FA (r = 0.891, p &lt; 0.05), intensity of oxidized quinone-like component (r = 0.875, p &lt; 0.05) and reduced quinone-like component of FA (r = 0.793 p &lt; 0.1) showed medium to strong correlation with KBD-associated morbidity. Generally, the content of reduced quinone and aquatic FA showed stronger differences between endemic and disease-free areas than oxidized quinone and aquatic HA, respectively. The quinone redox system in sediment HS did not show any significant relationship with KBD. The present study is a successful attempt to combine the three indexes, semiquinone radical content, aromaticity and fluorescence intensity, in characterizing quinone redox system in HS, facilitating more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of HS in KBD-affected regions.

Aiming to solve this problem effectively and improve transportation efficiency and reduce energy consumption, a bi-objective mathematical model combined routing model with synchronization constraints is proposed to simultaneously minimize non-value-added transportation time cost and total CO2 emission. A Pareto-based multi-objective Tabu Search (MOTS) algorithm is then designed to solve the model, in which local improvements are developed to generate promising neighboring individuals. Experimental results show that the proposed MOTS algorithm can effectively solve the problem even on a large scale and outperform the classic algorithm of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-Ⅱ).

The results show that the control measures to adjust transport modes and regulate private cars can achieve significant synergies and cost-effectiveness of emission mitigations on CO2 and air pollutants, and should be implemented as a high priority. In contrast, the control measures to promote the application of electricity, hydrogen energy, and bio-fuel have effective synergies, but with high costs, and should be implemented as a lower priority. Moreover, the control measures to popularize Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) have good cost-effectiveness, but with poor synergies due to the emission increments of HC and CO. Unless HC and CO emissions can be effectively reduced through the installation of terminal removal devices for air pollutants, the implementation of the control measures related to LNG will remain a low priority. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; CO2; Cost-effectiveness; Guangzhou; Synergies; Urban transportation","Air pollution; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Gas fuel purification; Global warming; Liquefied natural gas; Planning; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Air pollutants; Control measures; Cost-effective analysis; Development path; Emissions mitigation; Environmental pollutions; Guangzhou; Low priorities; Radar chart; Synergy; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105690959

Plants are sessile organisms and one important factor for their successful acclimation is the temporal coordination of the 24 h daily cycles and the stress response. The crosstalk between second messengers, such as Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hormones is a fundamental aspect in plant adaptation and survival under environmental stresses. In this sense, the circadian clock, in conjunction with Ca2+- and hormone-signalling pathways, appears to act as an important mechanism controlling plant adaptation to stress. The relationship between the circadian clock and ROS-generating and ROS-scavenging mechanisms is still not fully understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level and in stress situations in which ROS levels increase and changes in cell redox state occur. In this review, we summarize the information regarding the relationship between the circadian clock and the ROS homeostasis network. We pay special attention not only to the transcriptional regulation of ROS-generating and ROS-scavenging enzymes, but also to the few studies that have been performed at the biochemical level and those conducted under stress conditions. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

One of the primary concerns is the elevated salinity and the degradation of water quality in the Awash River. Located in the Great Rift Valley in Ethiopia, the Awash River has unique hydrochemistry due to water-rock interactions. However, in recent years, increasing anthropogenic activities including the discharge from saline Lake Beseka into the Awash River has caused some concern. This study used an Integrated Catchment Model to simulate chloride concentration in the Awash River Basin by taking both natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity into consideration. Future scenarios of climate change and Lake Beseka discharge were examined to assess the impact to the river water quality. New hydrologic insights: Results show that Lake Beseka has made significant contribution to the rise of the salinity in the Awash River. If the trend of human interference (e.g. increased irrigation and unregulated water transfer) continues, the river downstream of Lake Beseka could see Cl increases up to 200 % in the near future (2006–2030). The modeling results are essential for generating long term plans for proper utilization of water resources especially in the region where the resources and the economic capacity to meet the water demand is lacking. © 2021 The Authors","Chloride; Climate change; Lake Beseka; Salinity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109850279

But how this effect playing over horizontal scales is not well investigated. This study reveals the ABL structure over a sub-synoptic scale or mesoscale related to regional PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) pollution in the North China Plain (NCP). A typical PM2.5 pollution episode from December 1–4, 2017, is chosen for analysis, which is characterized by the rapid development of a vast polluted air mass along the mountainous side of the NCP extended hundreds of kilometers. In association with this episode, a shallow trough and a warm tongue at 850 hPa, with warm air advection in the upper layer and an orographic trough at the surface, provide favorable conditions for low-level warm front formation in the NCP. Surface meteorological data from 116 observatories and pollution-monitoring data recorded at 40 stations on the NCP are used to diagnose the hourly evolution of the meteorological and PM2.5 concentration fields, based on the California Meteorological (CALMET) model and a simple interpolation scheme. In addition to the surface wind, the equivalent potential temperature (EPT) is used to analyze air-mass boundaries or fronts at the surface. The results show that a block of colder air mass is gradually confined by warmer air, driven both from the southeast by a warm front and from the northwest by the thermal effect of the mountains. Consequently, a polluted air mass develops, with sharp boundaries indicated by both the discontinuity of wind fields and a strong gradient in the EPT. Numerical simulation using the Weather Research and Forecast model reproduces the meteorological evolution at the surface, revealing a three-dimensional ABL structure during this episode. With a dome-like warm cap covering the colder polluted air mass, an abrupt drop of ABL height occurs at the cross section from outside into this zone. Strong stratification suppresses the daytime ABL height to as low as 300 m over this zone. Thus, the cold air mass is confined not only laterally but also vertically. This ABL structure persisted throughout the daytime and night, in addition to weak winds in the nearly isolated air mass, which constitutes adverse dispersion conditions. This may help to explain the simultaneous increase in PM2.5 concentrations over a vast area of the NCP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air mass; Atmospheric boundary layer; Front; North China Plain; Regional air pollution","Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Computational fluid dynamics; Horizontal wells; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Air mass; Boundary layer structure; Front; North China Plain; PM$-2.5$; Polluted air mass; Potential temperature; Regional air pollution; Warm air; Warm fronts; Atmospheric boundary layer; advection; air mass; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; mesoscale meteorology; orographic effect; pollution monitoring; advection; article; boundary layer; California; China; cold air; computer simulation; night; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; tongue; weather; California; China; North China Plain; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108254795

These mandates require efficiency improvements at both the engine and vehicle levels, with the most stringent reductions required in the heaviest vehicles used for long-haul applications. At the same time, a 90% reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) will be required as part of new regulations from the California Air Resources Board. Any technologies applied to improve engine efficiency must therefore not come at the expense of increased NOx emissions. Research into advanced engine architectures and components has identified improved turbomachine efficiency as one of the largest potential contributors to engine efficiency improvement. However this comes at the cost of a reduced capability to drive high-pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). This study investigates the combination of a high-efficiency turbocharger and an electric EGR pump to allow improved engine fuel efficiency without the corresponding penalty to engine-out NOx. Results collected on a 13L 2019 model year engine on a dynamometer show the potential for a 3.5% reduction in engine Brake-Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) at engine operating conditions representative of highway cruise. Improvements at other engine operating conditions are also possible with careful matching of the turbocharger and EGR pump. © 2021 SAE International.",,"Carbon dioxide; Commercial vehicles; Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Pumps; Turbomachinery; California Air Resources Board; Efficiency improvement; Engine efficiency; Engine operating conditions; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Greenhouse gases (GHG); High-efficiency; Oxides of nitrogen; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114722313

The properties of galaxies at redshift z > 6 hold the key to our understanding of the early stages of galaxy evolution and can potentially identify the sources of the ultraviolet radiation that give rise to the epoch of reionisation. The far-infrared cooling line of [Ca II] at 158 μm is known to be bright and correlate with the star formation rate (SFR) of low-redshift galaxies, and hence is also suggested to be an important tracer of star formation and interstellar medium properties for very high-redshift galaxies. Aims. With the aim to study the interstellar medium properties of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z > 6, we search for [Ca II] and thermal dust emission in a sample of 52 z ∼ 6 galaxies observed by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey. Methods. We perform our analysis using LINESTACKER, stacking both [Ca II] and continuum emission. The target sample is selected from multiple catalogues, and the sample galaxies have spectroscopic redshift or low-uncertainty photometric redshifts (σz < 0.02) in nine galaxy clusters. Source properties of the target galaxies are either extracted from the literature or computed using spectral energy distribution fitting. Both weighted-average and median stacking are used, on both the full sample and three sub-samples. Results. Our analyses find no detection of either [Ca II] or continuum. An upper limit on L[CII] is derived, implying that [Ca II] remains marginally consistent for low-SFR z > 6 galaxies but likely is under-luminous compared to the local L[CII]-SFR relationship. We discuss potential biases and possible physical effects that may be the cause of the non-detection. Further, the upper limit on the dust continuum implies that less than half of the star formation is obscured. © 2021 ESO.","Galaxies: Evolution; Galaxies: Formation; Galaxies: High-redshift; Galaxies: Star formation; Galaxies: Statistics; Radio lines: Galaxies","Dust; Red Shift; Stars; Surveys; Continuum emission; High redshift-galaxies; Interstellar mediums; Physical effects; Redshift galaxies; Spectral energy distribution; Star formation rates; Weighted averages; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113666258

Although the majority of PM2.5 research has focused on outdoor exposures, people spend the majority of their time indoors, where PM2.5 of outdoor origin can penetrate. In this work, we measured indoor PM2.5 continuously for one year in 37 urban commercial offices with mechanical or mixed-mode ventilation in China, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We found that indoor PM2.5 concentrations were generally higher when and where outdoor PM2.5 was elevated. In India and China, mean workday indoor PM2.5 levels exceeded the World Health Organization's 24-hour exposure guideline of 25 μg/m3 about 17% and 27% of the time, respectively. Our statistical models found evidence that the operation of mechanical ventilation systems could mitigate the intrusion of outdoor PM2.5: during standard work hours, a 10 μg/m3 increase in outdoor PM2.5 was associated with 19.9% increase in the expected concentration of indoor PM2.5 (p &lt; 0.0001), compared to a larger 23.4% increase during non-work hours (p &lt; 0.0001).

However, we remain largely absent from these critical, ongoing efforts. Here, we draw on the literature and our own experiences to make recommendations for how EBAs can engage broader audiences, including the communities with whom we collaborate, a more diverse population of students, researchers in other disciplines and the development sector, policymakers, and the general public. These recommendations include: (1) playing to our strength in longitudinal, place-based research, (2) collaborating more broadly, (3) engaging in greater public communication of science, (4) aligning our work with open-science practices to the extent possible, and (5) increasing diversity of our field and teams through intentional action, outreach, training, and mentorship.

The article takes that insight as a starting point, in order to discuss the tools, work, sites and contestations involved in common temporal frameworks and structures that cross and join together time’s multiplicities. We thus articulate and discuss key components of synchronisation, a concept with significant potential for understanding common temporalities and social orders. Our emphasis is particularly on media, their technological and representational affordances for synchronisation. The article’s approach to social and mediated times presents an alternative to Hartmut Rosa and François Hartog’s influential theories about the temporal configuration of the present historical moment. Their understanding of the present tends more towards unity and uniformity, particularly by means of chronology. We follow Luhmann in arguing that ‘there is no supersynchronization’ producing such privileged, unitary temporal orders. We propose pursuing an understanding of both present and past through investigations of synchronisation itself, which always exists in plural, always involves different synchronisations in competition with each other, is subject to social and historical contingencies. The article combines theoretical and conceptual arguments with historical and contemporary cases. We investigate the synchronisation of national collectives by means of broadcast media, of individuals in everyday life by means of social media, and the recalibration of various contemporary media to a global scale in order to tackle the issue of climate change. These cases move from past and relatively comprehensive forms of synchronisation, via more localised forms today, to highly uncertain and heterogeneous ones in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.","media; multiple temporalities; social order; supersynchronisation; Synchronisation; work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105287747

Recent studies have given methodologies on how to assess mean annual concentrations based on numerical model results to compare with the annual air quality standards. Nonetheless, these methodologies need many wind directions to be modelled and, therefore, lead to high calculation costs. The purpose of this paper is to present two approaches to decrease the calculation costs when calculating annual concentration from computational fluid dynamics results by (1) ignoring uniformly spaced wind direction and (2) considering the predominant wind directions. According to the results, the first approach is on overall better than the second one for any wind rose or building layout considered. With the first approach, the calculation costs can be reduced up to 50 % without leading to more than 20 % of error, and even less error can be expected for homogeneous wind roses. Finally, a method to finely evaluate errors made when using the first approach versus using the whole wind rose, without computing it, is presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; CFD; Computation optimization; Mean annual concentration; Wind rose","Air quality; Errors; Optimization; Air pollutant concentrations; Calculation cost; Computation optimizations; Computational fluid; Fluid-dynamics; Mean annual concentration; Pollution concentration; Scientific community; Wind directions; Wind rose; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104463388

As such, spatial planning deals with challenges occurring at different scales and across sectors. The international literature points out the need for horizontal and vertical cooperation to tackle climate change impacts. This paper discusses the general challenges for climate proofing across planning levels, sectors, and areas and provides a systematic overview of challenges that would affect an integrative theoretical framework for climate proofing. Based on the latter, the study ultimately aims at presenting a novel theoretical framework for Climate Proofing specific to spatial planning involving a multi-sectoral perspective. An iterative process was used for conceptual development, based on a literature review followed by external feedback meetings with the core team of planning experts responsible for exchange across federal states and two workshops with focus groups of experts of planning departments responsible for federal, regional, and local spatial planning. Implementation and further development of the framework are planned as the second phase of this study. By specifically addressing the challenges relating to cross-regional and crosssectoral planning, this novel framework attempts to discuss the (i) consideration of the hierarchy of climate proofing measures through enhanced vertical and horizontal cooperation as well as the (ii) long-term institutionalisation of integrative planning processes across planning borders. It attempts also to (iii) foster the consideration of co-benefits for joint adaptation purposes and climate change mitigation through encouraging multi-disciplinary perspectives. © 2021 by the authors.

Forming a core part of this industry, the state of Assam, located in India, is known to be the largest contiguous tea-growing area in the world. With respect to tea production in this state, the small tea grower (STG) community in Assam contributes nearly half to the total production, making them a significant stakeholder in the burgeoning tea industry. Notably, diesel pumps have been long-favored for water pumping in tea plantations. Nonetheless, a complex mix-match of factors such as global warming, unreliability of monsoon rains and unavailability of adequate infrastructure has made them vulnerable to universal winds of change. This study makes an effort to identify the prospects of using solar pumps for irrigation, assess the constraints faced by STGs with regard to irrigation facilities and discuss the cost-effectiveness of using solar water pumps. The methodology involves both primary and secondary data interpreted by means of a descriptive research technique and a statistical cost–benefit analysis. Analysis shows that the breakeven period between both types of pumps occurs at the third year of usage. This emphasises that although solar pumps are cost-intensive in the short run, their installation has significant benefits such as, zero power costs and environmental costs, for STGs in the long run. With large economies moving towards low carbon strategies these days, installation of solar water pumps presents an optimum policy prescription that combines both cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, while bearing immense possibility in nourishing the tea industry of not only Assam, but the entire South Asian region. © 2020, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.","Diesel pumps; India; Renewable energy; Small tea growers; Solar water pumps; South Asia; Sustainable development; Tea industry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088859334

Then, the possibility of establishing these fungi in the cultivated lands of studied crops was examined. Fungal growth was high on soybean and cotton residues and low on those of rice, and all the fungi produced a significant reduction in the carbon to nitrogen ratios in relation to noninoculated residues. The amount of nitrogen in fungal-treated cotton residues increased about four times compared with the control and in other studied residues increased twice as much as the control. The lowest C:N values for cotton and rice residues were found for Pleurotus ostreatus while Aspergillus niger was the most efficient for those of soybean. The results also showed that these fungi will not show the best performance in respect to temperature and pH, but will not be ineffective.

The scientific and indus-trial communities have paid increasing attention to an LHV, known as the A-double combination, consisting of a tractor, two 13.5-m semitrailers, and a dolly converter. The present research contrib-utes to the existing literature by developing a methodology based on a cost-benefit approach to quantify the effects of the A-double combinations if introduced to a line-haul transport system. Four implementation scenarios and sensitivity analyses of main variables were evaluated within a case study of 48,472 line-haul trips in Denmark. The results indicate that in the least beneficial scenario, the A-double combinations reduce transport cost by 9.65% while reducing trips, CO2 emissions, and road wear by 17.91%, 5.34%, and 9.55%, respectively. Besides, the use of A-double combinations can significantly reduce empty tractor-semitrailer trips. However, the benefits are relatively less in the case of just-in-time deliveries and cargo constrained by vehicle weight. Also, cost saving is highly sensitive to driver salaries, fuel prices, and driving speeds. This research provides valuable insights into the potentials of A-double combinations under different regulations and freight characteristics from a micro perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

The study focuses on a top worldwide tourist destination of the Mediterranean, Santorini Island in Greece, and aims to assess the past, present and future thermal environment in the island based on the advanced Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The study utilizes historical observations capturing past (late 19th to early 20th century) and more recent (1982–2019) time periods, while future projections are realized based on four regional climate models (RCMs) under the weak mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) and the non-mitigation scenario with high emissions (RCP8.5). The frequency of cold stress conditions at midday decreases during winter and early spring months by up to 19.8% (January) in the recent period compared to the historical one, while heat stress conditions increase in summer by up to 22.4% (August). Future projections suggest progressive shifts of the UTCI towards higher values in the future and an increase in the exposure time under heat stress depending on the RCM and adopted scenario. The increase in moderate and strong heat stress conditions is mainly expected during the summer months (June, July, August); nevertheless, a noticeable increase is also foreseen in September and May. The highest occurrences of favorable (no thermal stress) conditions are also projected to shift by one month, from June to May and from September to October, in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Chemical transport models, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, are valuable tools for exploring policy options for improving air quality but are computation-ally expensive. Here, we statistically fit an efficient polynomial function in a response surface model (pf-RSM) to CMAQ simulations over the eastern U.S. for January and July 2016. The pf-RSM predictions were evaluated using out-of-sample CMAQ simulations and used to examine the nonlinear response of air quality to emission changes. Predictions of the pf-RSM are in good agreement with the out-of-sample CMAQ simulations, with some exceptions for cases with anthropogenic emission reductions approaching 100%. NOx emission reductions were more effective for reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations than SO2, NH3, or traditional VOC emission reductions. NH3 emission reductions effectively reduced nitrate concentrations in January but increased secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations in July. More work is needed on SOA formation under conditions of low NH3 emissions to verify the responses of SOA to NH3 emission changes predicted here.

However, barriers posed by legal requirements for historical buildings are counterbalanced by opportunities because historic cities have not undergone urban modernization and did not embrace the concept of functional cities, which nowadays impedes urban sustainability transformations. Thus, this paper focuses on the relationship between cultural heritage, urban sustainable development, and climate policy. We study continuity and change in the mid-sized UNESCO World Heritage cities Potsdam (Germany) and Bern (Switzerland). These matching forerunner cities share many characteristics, which enables them to transfer policies and jointly create new solutions for common problems. We find that national context matters, but we also identify functional equivalents like referenda and active citizen participation. Despite many similarities, Potsdam is ahead of Bern with respect to the institutionalization and integration of climate mitigation and adaptation. The comparative analysis (interviews and document analysis) identifies innovations that can be transferred between the two cities (e.g., Potsdam’s integrative climate policy or Bern’s efforts to become a role model for stakeholders and citizens). Moreover, the challenge to coordinate heritage management and climate governance offers chances for cooperation between matching cities like Bern and Potsdam. © 2021 by the authors.

Though many islands have now introduced policy measures to encourage RE development, the existing literature focuses on qualitative recommendations and has not sought to quantitatively evaluate and compare the impacts of policy interventions in the Caribbean. After compiling the first systematic database of RE policies implemented in 31 Caribbean islands from 2000 to 2018, we conduct an econometric analysis of the effectiveness of the following five policy interventions in promoting the deployment of RE: investment incentives, tax incentives, feed-in tariffs, net-metering and net-billing programs, and regulatory restructuring to allow market entry by independent power producers. Using a fixed effects model to control for unit heterogeneities between islands, we find evidence that net-metering/net-billing programs are strongly and positively correlated with increases in installed capacity of renewable energy - particularly solar PV. These findings suggest that the RE transition in the Caribbean can be advanced through policies targeting the adoption of small-scale, distributed photovoltaics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Caribbean; Econometrics; Feed-in tariff; Panel data; Renewable energy policy; Small island developing states (SIDS)","Economics; Fossil fuels; Investments; Public policy; Solar power generation; Taxation; Caribbean; Energy expansion; Feed-in tariff; Net metering; Panel data; Panel data analysis; Policy intervention; Renewable energies; Renewable energy policy; Small island developing state; Statistics; alternative energy; econometrics; energy market; energy policy; investment incentive; island state; panel data; regulatory approach; tax incentive; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105602345

Four ultralow-carbon alloys with chemical compositions of 0.045% C, 0.28 Si%, 0.91% Mn and different Cr weight contents of 0.59, 1, 1.56 and 2% were determined within the pre-peritectic region from phase diagrams plotted by Thermo-Calc 2020. These alloys were melted and cast into blocks, and then, a certain thermomechanical schedule was applied using the actual data obtained from the log files of a CSP plant. The cooling schedule was designed with the aid of CCT and TTT curves plotted by JMat Pro. The results show that hot-rolled FBDP steel contains a substantial amount of bainite from 10 to 28% and negligible martensite. The increase in Cr led to an increase in the bainite volume fraction and an increase in the yield strength and tensile strength, while the elongation decreased slightly. The strain hardening exponent (n-value) reached values ranging from 0.28 to 0.36, while a value of 0.18 was found in the literature for martensitic DP steel.

However, the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ products on Cu0-Cu+ interfaces is critically limited due to the low electrocatalytic production of ethanol relative to ethylene. In this study, a novel porous Cu/Cu2O aerogel network is introduced to afford high ethanol productivity by the electrocatalytic CO2RR. The aerogel is synthesized by a simple chemical redox reaction of a precursor and a reducing agent. CO2RR results reveal that the Cu/Cu2O aerogel produces ethanol as the major product, exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency (FEEtOH) of 41.2% and a partial current density (JEtOH) of 32.55 mA cm−2 in an H-cell reactor. This is the best electrosynthesis performance for ethanol production reported thus far. Electron microscopy and electrochemical analysis results reveal that this dramatic increase in the electrosynthesis performance for ethanol can be attributed to a large number of Cu0-Cu+ interfaces and an increase of the local pH in the confined porous aerogel network structure with a high-surface-area. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","aerogels; carbon dioxide; copper oxide; electrocatalysts; electrosynthesis","Carbon dioxide; Copper metallography; Ethanol; Ethylene; Integrated circuit interconnects; Redox reactions; Electrocatalytic; Electrochemical analysis; Ethanol production; Ethanol productivity; Faradaic efficiencies; High surface area; Network structures; Partial currents; Aerogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106973551

However, there are very limited studies on amphibians in South Korea. Here, we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on different habitat groups (wetland amphibians, Group 1; migrating amphibians, Group 2; and forest-dwelling am-phibians, Group 3) under future climate change and land cover change in South Korea using a maximum entropy modelling approach. Our study revealed that all amphibians would suffer substan-tial loss of suitable habitats in the future, except Lithobates catesbeianus, Kaloula borealis, and Karsenia koreana. Similarly, species richness for Groups 2 and 3 will decline by 2030, 2050, and 2080. Currently, amphibian species are widely distributed across the country; however, in future, suitable habitats for amphibians would be concentrated along the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range and the southeastern region. Among the three groups, Group 3 amphibians are predicted to be the most vulnerable to climate change; therefore, immediate conservation action is needed to protect them. We expect this study could provide crucial baseline information required for the government to design climate change mitigation strategies for indigenous amphibians. © 2021 by the authors.

Although focused on the local level, this book discusses climate basics such as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement of 2015, worldwide energy generation forecasts, and other items of global concern in order to familiarize urban planners and citizen planners with key concepts that they will need to know in order to be able to host climate conversations at the local level. The many case studies from around the United States of America show how communities have encountered pushback and bridged the implementation gap, the gap between plan and reality, thanks to a commitment to substantive public engagement.

These records suggest that hyperthermal-like features (negative excursions in δ18O and δ13C coupled to suboxic and acidic conditions in the deep ocean) developed at eccentricity maxima during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; 16.9 to 14.7 Ma) on an almost ice-free Earth. Elevated Mn and U concentrations indicate that bottom and pore waters in the Indian Ocean became progressively suboxic during the later phase of the MCO. A fundamental change in deep-water circulation occurred after the expansion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition (MMCT; 14.7 to ~13.8 Ma). Stepwise increases in δ18O at ~13.8 and ~13.1 Ma concurred with dampening of deep-water δ18O and δ13C variability, as Antarctic ice cover expanded and became more stable. A marked improvement in deep-water oxygenation after ~13.5 Ma coincided with the end of the last δ13C maximum of the Monterey Excursion. Carbonate dissolution in the equatorial Indian Ocean intensified and prolonged episodes of reduced carbonate deposition during the Carbonate Crash interval (~12.6 to 8.6 Ma) were not restricted to eccentricity maxima as during the MCO. Rising Mn and U concentrations after ~9 Ma indicate decreased oxygenation of bottom and pore waters, associated with the onset of the Biogenic Bloom in the Indian Ocean. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate Crash; Deep-water ventilation; Middle Miocene cooling; Miocene Climatic Optimum; Stable isotopes; X-ray fluorescence scanning","benthic foraminifera; carbonate; climate change; deep water; dissolution; eccentricity; Miocene; oxygenation; preservation; toxicity; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; California; East Antarctic Ice Sheet; East Antarctica; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Equatorial); Monterey; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107831354

Our understanding of present-day biogeography implies that changes in the distribution of continents across climatic zones have predictable effects on habitat distribution, dispersal barriers and the evolution of provinciality. To assess marine provinciality through the Phanerozoic, here we (a) simulate provinces based on palaeogeographic reconstructions and global climate models and (b) contrast them with empirically derived provinces that we define using network analysis of fossil occurrences.

Building on existing studies that identify the significant contributions of lifestyle changes, this study proposes a practical methodology for modeling and exploring city-specific carbon footprint reduction pathways through lifestyle changes to decarbonization. It uses an input-output approach with mixed-unit consumption data and the concept of adoption rates, which is applicable to multiple cities with widely available subnational household consumption data. This paper illustrates the use of this methodology by exploring the consumption-based mitigation pathways of 52 Japanese cities with 65 lifestyle change options covering mobility, housing, food, consumer goods, and leisure domains. The results revealed that city-specific impacts of a variety of lifestyle change options can differ by as much as a factor of five among cities, even in the urban context within the same country. Due to this city-level heterogeneity, the priority options of decarbonized lifestyles, such as among shared mobility, low-carbon diets, and longevity of consumer goods, have shifted between cities. The analysis suggests that ambitious urban lifestyle changes can potentially reduce their carbon footprints to meet the 1.5 ◦C target. However, due to the overlaps of mitigation potentials between multiple lifestyle change options, the necessary levels of adoption and coverage are extensive (i.e. adoption rates of 0.6-0.9). Importantly, adopting lifestyle changes with an efficiency strategy (e.g. the introduction of end-use technologies) or sufficiency strategy (e.g. behavioral changes in consumption amounts and modes) alone is not enough; the only way to succeed is through the combination of both strategies. This paper calls for a target-based exploration and identification of city-specific priorities of lifestyle change options to facilitate consumption-oriented mitigation policies and stakeholder actions to address the climate impacts of urban consumption. © 2021 The Author(s).

Here landscape and ecological relations are taken into account via the adaptation unit, and the recent dynamics is compared with the one observed as far as possible distant in time.

To demonstrate this crucial problem, a life cycle assessment was developed and applied to a real plant located in the Canary Islands, Spain. In the analysis, the environmental consequences of each phase of the process were quantified. Prior to this, a review of the different calculation tools was undertaken with the intention of selecting the one that best matches the plant in order to obtain the most reliable results possible. The plant was selected for analysis on the basis of its size, with an average supply capacity in the island territory, as well as the availability of renewable energy resources. Calculation of the GHG emissions generated by the plant’s energy consumption confirmed its contribution to climate change. To mitigate this contribution, a methodology is developed to determine the feasibility of renewable energy synergies to obtain a clean energy mix. This methodology, applicable to any reverse osmosis desalination system, was applied to the plant under study, with a resulting proposal for a sustainable energy system that avoids the emission of 21,781 tons of GHGs. By extending the application of the proposed methodology to other reverse osmosis desalination plants on the island, a considerable reduction in GHG emissions and its impact on climate change could be achieved at this stage of the water cycle. © 2021 Desalination Publications.","Desalination; Energy; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy; Water-energy nexus","alternative energy; climate change; desalination; emission control; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; Canary Islands; Spain; Spain; Serinus canaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114172779

Existing literature, however, lacks a holistic evaluation of their life cycle impacts. In this study, a comparative environmental and economic life cycle analysis between green and flat roofs under Mediterranean climate conditions was conducted, examining all green roof types (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive), two types of drainage layer (granular and synthetic) for each one, all green roof layer materials, life cycle stages (production of materials, use and maintenance, disposal) and their quantifiable costs and benefits, aiming to address this research gap. Dynamic whole-building energy demand simulations were also conducted in its context, which additionally investigated the effect of various factors on green roofs' energy saving potential. Thermally insulated green roofs provided a small improvement in the energy consumption for heating and cooling (up to 8.30% and 3.50% respectively) but significant reductions in total life cycle energy consumption (8–31%), CO2 emissions (24–32%) and waste production (15–60%) rendering them a cleaner environmental option compared to flat roofs. However, they also produced a very important increase in total life cycle water consumption (279–835%). The extensive green roof types were the ones to perform better in all these indexes. They were also the only type to constitute a better economic choice than a flat roof for the private owner in a low discount rate (0.25%) scenario, both with or without public benefits. As this study shows, the green roofs' potential is not limited only to the improvement of the buildings’ energy efficiency, as numerous studies in the field of energy efficiency highlight, but compared to flat roofs, expand to reduce the embodied energy, greenhouse gas emissions and material waste. By means of environmental footprint, they are superior to flat roofs when only energy and emissions are considered, while in regions where water availability is a key environmental factor, this superiority is in question, together with their economic feasibility in countries where this technology is not financially supported. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic; Energy; Environmental; Green roofs; Life cycle analysis; Mediterranean climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107046216

Changes in the high-frequency variability of temperature exert additional pressures, yet the effect of greenhouse forcing thereon has not been fully assessed or identified in observational data. Here, we show that the intramonthly variability of daily surface temperature changes with distinct global patterns as greenhouse gas concentrations rise. In both reanalyses of historical observations and state-of-the-art projections, variability increases at low to mid latitudes and decreases at northern mid to high latitudes with enhanced greenhouse forcing. These latitudinally polarized daily variability changes are identified from internal climate variability using a recently developed signal-to-noise-maximizing pattern-filtering technique. Analysis of a multimodel ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 shows that these changes are attributable to enhanced greenhouse forcing. By the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, daily temperature variability would continue to increase by up to a further 100% at low latitudes and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes. Alternative scenarios demonstrate that these changes would be limited by mitigation of greenhouse gases. Moreover, global changes in daily variability exhibit strong covariation with warming across climate models, suggesting that the equilibrium climate sensitivity will also play a role in determining the extent of future variability changes. This global response of the high-frequency climate system to enhanced greenhouse forcing is likely to have strong and unequal effects on societies, economies, and ecosystems if mitigation and protection measures are not taken. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

In order to reach sustainability goals such as reduction of the use of primary resources, it is of utmost importance to reuse or recycle the existing stocks - a strategy labelled as “Urban Mining”. The fact that the new construction rate is only 3%, underlines the importance of Urban Mining. However, there is lack of knowledge about the exact material composition and geometry of the existing stock, which represents the main obstacle for Urban Mining and accordingly for reaching high recycling rates. In this paper the Integrated Data Assessment and Modelling (IDAM) method based on digital scanning and modelling technologies for capturing of the geometry and material composition data is proposed for enabling a generation of as built Building Information Modelling (BIM)-models from acquired point clouds and non-geometric data. The main aim of this research is to explore the potential of the IDAM method for the generation of a BIM-model, which serves as basis for BIM-based Material Passports (MP), as major element enabling Circular Economy (CE) and Urban Mining strategies as well as the creation of a digital secondary raw materials cadastre. In order to deliver a proof of concept for IDAM, a real use case will be assessed in terms of geometry and material composition, and possibilities of data capturing via laser scanning and ground penetrating radar (GPR) for follow-up generation of a BIM-based MP explored. For capturing the geometry, laser scanning, and for capturing the material composition, GPR is used. The use of GPR for the generation of a BIM-model, which incorporates material information, addresses a research gap - the capturing and modelling of geometry is already well explored, however the methods and tools for capturing and modelling of the material composition of buildings are largely lacking. Result show, that the coupled use of capturing technologies has great potential to serve as basis for a BIM-based MP. Moreover, the use of GPR, enables a determination of embedded materials within a building, but is confronted with various difficulties. As a result, a framework, which can serve as groundwork for follow-up research, is presented. COPYRIGHT: © 2021 The author(s).

For healthcare, the topic is both concerning and tragically ironic as hospitals have substantial environmental footprints, which are now known to contribute to significant health problems that the system itself was designed to treat. The human medical field has been proactive in taking steps to reduce waste and carbon emissions by identifying best practices to minimize such impacts. Characterization of needs and gaps has been addressed through reviews of the literature regarding environmental sustainability in the context of human hospitals. Our objective was to replicate methods used in a recent review of environmental sustainability in human hospitals to summarize information available to clinical veterinarians. Two search algorithms were used across 8 databases, however only 3 peer-reviewed opinion articles specific to veterinary medicine were identified. These papers included 1 on anesthesia and 2 on production animals. Interestingly, all articles were written by United Kingdom-based authors and none were specific to companion animal practice, the largest sector in the veterinary industry in the United States. Results of this review highlight need for research and communication that supports veterinary clinics in adopting more environmentally sustainable practices. Proposed starting points informed from research in other sectors, including 5 physical themes of energy efficiency, water, waste, sustainable procurement, and transportation, and human behavior changes on the individual, group, and organizational levels, are discussed.

We hypothesized that the identity of neighboring plants influences the amounts of C that a plant inputs into the soil, the resultant formation of soil pore architecture, and the fate of the plant's C inputs. To test this hypothesis, we combined 13CO2 plant pulse labeling with X-ray computed micro-tomography (μCT) in assessing plant-assimilated C from three species common to North American prairie: switchgrass, big bluestem, and wild bergamot. The plants were grown in a greenhouse in monoculture and in all-pair combinations. The 13C labeling was conducted so as to ensure that only one member of each pair has received 13C. The results demonstrated that greater belowground C exchange among neighboring plants enhanced inputs of plant-assimilated C into soil, suggesting that the involvement of plant community members in belowground C transfer, rather than community's diversity per se, drives rapid soil C accrual. Moreover, the magnitudes of C losses as well as properties of soil pore architecture also depend not only on the identity of the C source plant itself but also on the identities of its neighbors. These findings propose belowground interspecific C transfer as a previously overlooked mechanism for enriching and stabilizing soil C and suggest genomic and management potentials for selecting species that participate in intensive interspecific assimilate exchange in order to promote rapid and stable soil C gains. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","13CO2 pulse labeling; Big bluestem; Pore-size distribution; Prairie; Soil pore architecture; Soil pore structure; Switchgrass; Wild bergamot; X-ray computed micro-tomography","Architecture; Carbon; Plants (botany); Pore size; Pore structure; Tomography; 13CO2 pulse labeling; Big bluestem; Plant communities; Pore-size distribution; Prairie; Soil pore architecture; Soil pore structure; Switchgrass; Wild bergamot; X-ray computed micro-tomography; Soils; belowground biomass; genomics; microtopography; monoculture; plant community; pore space; prairie; soil carbon; soil chemistry; X-ray tomography; North America; Andropogon gerardii; Monarda; Panicum virgatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105703176

Shorter time‐to‐market as well as stricter legal requirements regarding the validation of Real Driving Emissions (RDE) require the adaptation of current procedures and the implementation of new technologies in the powertrain development process. In order to achieve highest efficiencies and lowest pollutant emissions at the same time, the layout and calibration of the control strategies for the powertrain and the exhaust gas aftertreatment system must be precisely matched. An optimal operating strategy must take into account possible trade‐offs in fuel consumption and emission levels, both under highly dynamic engine operation and under extended environmental operating conditions. To achieve this with a high degree of statistical certainty, the combination of advanced methods and the use of virtual test benches offers significant potential. An approach for such a combination is presented in this paper. Together with a Hardware‐in‐the‐Loop (HiL) test bench, the novel methodology enables a targeted calibration process, specifically designed to address calibration challenges of hybridized powertrains. Virtual tests executed on a HiL test bench are used to efficiently generate data characterizing the behavior of the system under various conditions with a statistically based evaluation identifying white spots in measurement data, used for calibration and emission validation. In addition, critical sequences are identified in terms of emission intensity, fuel consumption or component conditions. Dedicated test scenarios are generated and applied on the HiL test bench, which take into account the state of the system and are adjusted depending on it. The example of one emission calibration use case is used to illustrate the benefits of using a HiL platform, which achieves approximately 20% reduction in calibration time by only showing differences of less than 2% for fuel consumption and emission levels compared to real vehicle tests. © 2021 by the authors.

The characterizations of fabricated photocatalysts were observed by XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, N2 adsorption-desorption, and UV–vis spectroscopy. The distribution of Ni, Ti, and O atoms on the surface of these photocatalysts was demonstrated to be uniform, and the BET surface areas were varied slightly with the increase of NiO loading. Meanwhile, the absorption edge of fabricated photocatalysts was found to shift towards the visible region and the bandgap energy was decreased. The photocatalytic reaction was conducted in a continuous-flow reactor under UV irradiation.

In particular, it has been believed as step forward towards zero energy systems. Recent progress in positive energy building and community levels is gaining interest among different stakeholders. However, an inadequate understanding of the positive energy system is widely noticed in many projects, and a shortage of standard details on the positive energy system still prevails in the research community. Therefore, a state-of-the-art review of positive energy building and community is conducted in this paper. Firstly, this paper begins with the definitions and concepts of positive energy buildings and communities. Secondly, it comprehensively describes the energy supplies, demands, indicators, storage, energy management, roles of stakeholders, and bottlenecks of positive energy systems. Thirdly, the main differences between positive energy buildings and communities are summarized. Fourthly, the impact of smart energy grids and new energy vehicles on the positive energy buildings and communities is derived. As a conclusion, this paper shows that even though all the energy-efficient buildings such as passive buildings, nearly zero energy buildings, zero energy buildings, positive energy buildings look like an up-trending scale of renewable penetration, considerable differences are visible among all, and the same thing applies to the community level. Furthermore, considerable differences exist when comparing between positive buildings and communities regarding both the technical and economic perspectives. © 2021 by the author.

In the present study, fourteen forest stands were selected in four different altitudes, i.e., &lt; 1000, 1001–1400, 1401–1800, and &gt; 1801 masl in Garhwal Himalayan of Uttarakhand, India, to assess carbon stock potential of the forest. The study was conducted during 2013–2015. Among the study sites, the maximum tree density (575 ± 90.14 ind. ha−1) was reported in New Tehri (altitude: &gt; 1801 masl) and minimum (135 ± 5.00 ind. ha−1) in Daddi (altitude: 1001–1400 masl). The highest (96 ± 18.36 t ha−1) above-ground carbon stock was estimated in Kandikhal where bole, branch, and foliage contribute 89.93 ± 19.47, 5.17 ± 1.04 and 0.90 ± 0.14 t ha−1, respectively, while lowest (26.68 ± 9.48 t ha−1) was in Gumkhal, and contribution from the same component was found as 20.72 ± 7.84, 4.50 ± 1.58, and 1.47 ± 0.11 t ha−1, respectively. Further, highest value of below-ground carbon was in Kandikhal (28.58 ± 4.81 t ha−1) with an altitude range between 1001 and 1400 masl and the lowest in Gumkhal (9.19 ± 2.87 t ha−1) between 1401 and 1800 masl. Besides, litter production was found higher in the summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The study concluded that the density, height, basal area, and volume of Pinus roxburgii varied with altitude, but it was not directional. However, growth patterns and tree density were the key factors in estimating total carbon stocks and further to know the behavior of carbon dynamics (source/sink). Litter production had an inverse relation with altitude; however, increase in litter biomass at &gt; 1801 masl was observed due to new plantations of pine. This study will be highly helpful to the forester and policy-makers in planning carbon mitigation strategies (e.g., catchment area treatment, afforestation activities) at regional and global scales. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Altitudes; Carbon; Chir pine; Climate change; Himalaya","afforestation; biomass; carbon storage; catchment; energy resource; foliage; growth; litter; pine; policy making; India; Uttarakhand; Matthiola; Pinus roxburghii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098655343

We systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU, SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands, ponds, trees, parks, grass, green roof/walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs, mangroves, sea grasses, oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches and dunes. We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range of social and economic co-benefits.

Such tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating the implementation of NBS. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate-impact mitigation; Cost-effectiveness; Nature-inspired solutions; NBS upscaling; Numerical models; Performance evaluation","Catchments; Climate models; Efficiency; Floods; Forestry; Landslides; Numerical models; Reefs; Wetlands; Climate-impact mitigation; Efficiency evaluation; Meteorological risks; Model method; Nature-based solution upscaling; Nature-inspired solution; Performance; Performances evaluation; Risks management; Risks reduction; Cost effectiveness; climate effect; cost-benefit analysis; hydrometeorology; natural hazard; numerical model; performance assessment; catchment area; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; disaster management; drought; economic aspect; environmental erosion; environmental management; flooding; hazard assessment; heat wave; human; landslide; priority journal; Review; risk reduction; social aspect; storm surge; systematic review; Ostreidae; Poaceae; Rhizophoraceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104955077

Marine environments are extremely sensitive to climate change that influences their ecological functions and microbial community including fungi. Fungi from marine habitats are engaged and adapted to perform diverse ecological functions in marine environments. Several studies focus on how complex interactions with the surrounding environment affect fungal evolution and their adaptation. However, a review addressing the adaptation of marine fungi to climate change is still lacking. Here we have discussed the adaptations of fungi in the marine environment with an example of Hortaea werneckii and Aspergillus terreus which may help to reduce the risk of climate change impacts on marine environments and organisms. We address the ecology and evolution of marine fungi and the effects of climate change on them to explain the adaptation mechanism. A review of marine fungal adaptations will show widespread effects on evolutionary biology and the mechanism responsible for it. © Copyright © 2021 Kumar, Sarma, Thambugala, Huang, Li and Hao.","Aspergillus terreus; ecology; eDNA; evolution; Hortaea werneckii; next-generation sequencing","Aspergillus terreus; climate change; ecology; high throughput sequencing; Hortaea werneckii; marine environment; nonhuman; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114717547

This power requirement is normally met by the power supplied by the power agencies for the over the ground requirements. However, in the cases of underground work at the drilling site or de-watering sites we need to use the smaller portable generator sets. These generator sets generate a lot of harmful gases and CO2 and in-cases of over loading lead to short circuits and also fire. In the cases of prolonged tunneling times these generators remain inside the tunnel and are not serviced on time leading to gen-sets often going out of order leading to loss of work and may also cause accidents. Regular maintenance enhances the lifespan of the generators. This paper takes the approach to provide a solution to the preventive generator maintenance problems which would take care of reliability issues. In the proposed design we monitor the vital parameters of the gen-sets like fuel levels, temperatures, loads (current and voltage), running time, last servicing time, average fuel consumption, last serviced dates, battery voltages, Air filter life etc. This information is then collected by an on-board Data Acquisition System (DAS) which is then passed on to Cloud via a Wi-Fi connection.

The distribution of HE emissions and dark spots suggested the formation of so-called potential barriers around dislocations in the InGaN SQWs on the MT-GaN layers. Multiple HE emissions were observed in the local PL spectra acquired from the InGaN SQWs on the MT-GaN layers as well in the case of InGaN multiple QW on MT-GaN previously reported. This observation suggested that the origin of multi-peak HE emissions is an in-plane variation in In composition and/or well thickness. The energy difference between InGaN emission from c-plane QW and HE emission from V-pit facet increased as the MT-GaN layer thickness or V-pit diameter increased. The origin of both the multiple HE emissions and the increase in the energy difference with V-pit diameter in InGaN/GaN SQW on MT-GaN was probably the diffusion of group III atoms between different facets of the InGaN SQWs in sub-micrometer scale V-pits. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Gallium nitride; Semiconductor alloys; Semiconductor quantum wells; Energy differences; Energy emissions; In compositions; InGaN/GaN quantum well; Moderate temperature; Photoluminescence spectrum; Potential barrier height; Potential barriers; III-V semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111933464

We reviewed the available literature on farmers’ reports of climate-driven crop changes. Small-scale farmers tend to adopt water-demanding crops, even in areas where models predict that reduced rainfall will reduce yields. The adoption of horticultural cash-crops combined with the abandonment of subsistence cereals modifies farmers’ nutritional inputs in terms of calories and nutrients, potentially undermining their food security.

Two separate 6 mm × 6 mm regions were irradiated with 1 keV H+ and 4 keV He+, respectively, to fluences of 8.1 × 1017 ions/cm2 for H+ and 1 × 1018 ions/cm2 for He+. Unirradiated and irradiated surfaces were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), visible to near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR; 0.35–2.5 μm), and microprobe two-step laser-desorption mass spectrometry (μL2MS). We also performed analytical field-emission scanning transmission electron microscopy (FE-STEM) on focused ion beam (FIB) cross-sections extracted from olivine grains and matrix material within the H+- and He+-irradiated regions. In situ XPS analyses suggest that ion irradiation results in the removal of most surface carbon and the partial reduction of surface iron to lower oxidation states. In response to He+-irradiation, we observe brightening (longward of ~0.75 μm) and reddening of reflectance spectra, which is a departure from typical lunar-style space weathering. Additionally, H+- and He+-irradiation have opposing effects on organic carbon content: H+-irradiation increases the abundance of some low-molecular-weight free organic species by breaking down macromolecular material while He+-irradiation causes a decrease in overall organic content by cleaving bonds and sputtering constituent atoms. This suggests that solar wind H+-irradiation and solar wind He+-irradiation change the organic functional group chemistry of asteroidal regolith in different ways. In contrast to some previous experimental space weathering studies, we observe an increase in H2O and OH− abundances in our sample in response to both types of ion irradiation. FE-STEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses show complete amorphization of matrix phyllosilicates in ion-affected rims, partial amorphization of olivine, and changes in Si and Mg concentrations at and/or near the surface. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the complex nature of space weathering on primitive, carbon-rich asteroids and for analyzing future returned samples from carbonaceous asteroids Bennu and Ryugu. © 2021","Asteroidal regolith; Carbonaceous asteroid analog; Electron microscopy; Solar wind; Space weathering",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105599862

Strategic reforestation activities, which account for both carbon sequestration potential (CSP) and economic opportunity, can provide attractive options for policymakers who must manage competing social and environmental goals. In particular, forest carbon pricing can incentivize reforestation on private land, but this may require landholders to forego other profits. Here, we utilize an ambitious geospatial approach to quantify economic opportunities for reforestation in the state of Maryland (USA) based on high-resolution remoting sensing, ecosystem modeling, and economic analysis. Our results identify spatially-explicit areas of economic opportunity where the potential revenue from forest carbon outcompetes the expected profit of existing cropland at the hectare scale. Specifically, we find that under a baseline economic scenario of $20 per ton of carbon (5% rental rate) and decadal average crop profitability, a transition to forest on agricultural land would be more profitable than 23.2% of cropland in Maryland under a 20 year land-use commitment. Accounting for variations in carbon and crop pricing, 5.5%-55.4% of cropland would be immediately outcompeted by expected forest carbon revenue, with the potential for an additional 0.5%-10.6% of outcompeted cropland within 20 years. Under the baseline economic scenario, an annual allocation of $5.8 million towards a carbon rental program could protect 6.93 Tg C (3.4% of the state's total remaining CSP) on reforested croplands.

However, social arthropods face an elevated risk of infections due to the dense colony structure, which facilitates pathogen transmission. An interesting hypothesis is that social arthropods are protected by chemical compounds produced by the arthropods themselves, microbial symbionts, or plants they associate with. Stegodyphus dumicola is an African social spider species, inhabiting communal silk nests. Because of the complex three-dimensional structure of the spider nest antimicrobial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a promising protection against pathogens, because of their ability to diffuse through air-filled pores. We analyzed the volatilomes of S. dumicola, their nests, and capture webs in three locations in Namibia and assessed their antimicrobial potential. Volatilomes were collected using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tubes and analyzed using GC/Q-TOF. We showed the presence of 199 VOCs and tentatively identified 53 VOCs. More than 40% of the tentatively identified VOCs are known for their antimicrobial activity. Here, six VOCs were confirmed by analyzing pure compounds namely acetophenone, 1,3-benzothiazole, 1-decanal, 2-decanone, 1-tetradecene, and docosane and for five of these compounds the antimicrobial activity were proven. The nest and web volatilomes had many VOCs in common, whereas the spider volatilomes were more differentiated. Clear differences were identified between the volatilomes from the different sampling sites which is likely justified by differences in the microbiomes of the spiders and nests, the plants, and the different climatic conditions. The results indicate the potential relevance of the volatilomes for the ecological success of S. dumicola. © Copyright © 2021 Lammers, Zweers, Sandfeld, Bilde, Garbeva, Schramm and Lalk.","antimicrobial; chemical ecology; social arthropods; Stegodyphus dumicola; volatile organic compound","1 decanal; 1 dodecanal; 1 dodecene; 1 heptanal; 1 methoxy 2 propanol; 1 non anal; 1 tetradecene; 1 tridecene; 1,3 benzothiazole; 2 decanone; 2 ethyl 3 hydroxyhexy; 2 ethylhexanol; 2 methylpropanoate; 2,6,11 trimethyldodecane; acetophenone; antiinfective agent; benzothiazole; dimeticone; docosane; dodecane; heneicosane; menthol; myristic acid; nerylacetone; pentadecane; silk; unclassified drug; undecanol; volatile organic compound; volatilome; agar diffusion; animal experiment; animal trapping; antimicrobial activity; arachnid; arthropod; Article; Bacillus thuringiensis; Candida albicans; climate change; controlled study; discriminant analysis; ecology; Escherichia coli; gas chromatography; infectious agent; microbiome; nest predation; nonhuman; pathogen transmission; spider; Staphylococcus aureus; Stegodyphus dumicola; symbiont; time of flight mass spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107962719

Existing urban GHG accounting methods, however, focus largely on emissions related to energy and material flows and have rarely considered the role of urban stocks. In this article, we have extended urban stocks and flows analysis to urban GHG accounting, using bottom-up and high-resolution urban stocks and flows information for a case of Odense, Denmark. We introduced a complementary indicator of carbon replacement value (CRV) to account for emissions embodied in the urban stocks and determined the CRV of Odense as 10.7 megatons of CO2 equivalent (or 53 metric tons per capita) in 2017, equivalent to 13 years of Odense's operational emissions. The comparison between CRV and operational emissions across urban activities facilitates a better understanding of the carbon profile of the city and opportunities for decarbonization. Such urban metabolic based GHG accounting and inclusion of stocks can help to estimate the amount of GHG emissions to be expected from the further urbanization in developing countries as their urban stocks continue to increase and inform their potentials for leapfrogging in emission reduction. © 2021 The Authors.

The research is based on the monthly-averaged vertically-resolved aerosol optical depth (AOD) atmospheric profiles along a 1◦ × 1◦ horizontal grid, obtained from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument measurements aboard the Cloud-Aerosol lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). To assess the variability of the anthropogenic aerosols on climate, we compared the aerosol vertical profile observations to a one-dimensional radiative transfer model in two metropolitan climate sensible hot-spots in Europe, namely the Po Valley and Benelux, to investigate the variability of the aerosol radiative effects and heating rate over ten years. The same analysis is carried out as reference on the Sahara desert region, considered subject just to natural local emission. Our findings show the efficacy of emission reduction policies implemented at government level in strongly urbanized regions. The total atmospheric column aerosol load reduction (not observed in Sahara desert region) in Po Valley and Benelux can be associated with: (i) an increase of the energy flux at the surface via direct effects confirmed also by long term surface temperature observations, (ii) a general decrease of the atmospheric column heating rate, and likely (iii) an increase in surface temperatures during a ten-year period. Summarizing, the analysis, based on the decade 2007–2016, clearly show an increase of solar irradiation under cloud-free conditions at the surface of +3.6 % and +16.6% for the Po Valley and Benelux, respectively, and a reduction of −9.0% for the Sahara Desert. © 2021 by the authors.

Owing to their synthetic tunability, molecular catalysts for the CO2reduction reaction can give rise to high product selectivity. In this context, a RuIIcomplex [Ru(HO-tpy)(6-mbpy)(NCCH3)]2+(HO-tpy = 4′-hydroxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine; 6-mbpy = 6-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine) was immobilised on a thin SiOxlayer of a p-Si electrode that was decorated with a bromide-terminated molecular layer. Following the characterisation of the assembled photocathodes by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry, PEC experiments demonstrate electron transfer from the p-Si to the Ru complex through the native oxide layer under illumination and a cathodic bias. A state-of-the-art photovoltage of 570 mV was determined by comparison with an analogous n-type Si assembly. While the photovoltage of the modified photocathode is promising for future photoelectrochemical CO2reduction and the p-Si/SiOxjunction seems to be unchanged during the PEC experiments, a fast desorption of the molecular Ru complex was observed. An in-depth investigation of the cathode degradation by comparison with reference materials highlights the role of the hydroxyl functionality of the Ru complex to ensure its grafting on the substrate. In contrast, no essential role for the bromide function on the Si substrate designed to engage with the hydroxyl group of the Ru complex in an SN2-type reaction could be established. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Catalyst selectivity; Electron transport properties; Field emission cathodes; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Photocathodes; Photoelectrochemical cells; Silicon compounds; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Cathode degradations; Hydroxyl functionality; Molecular catalysts; Native oxide layer; Photoelectrochemicals; Product selectivities; Reference material; Ultra-thin oxide layers; Ruthenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111944110

Promoting a climate characterized by positive communication, autonomy support, and parental warmth supports adolescents in making healthy behavioral changes. In addition, encouraging these skills within the family may have additional benefits of improved family functioning and other mental and physical health outcomes. Although several programs have identified essential elements and established the evidence base for the efficacy of these interventions, few have offered resources for the translation of these constructs from theoretical concepts to tangible practice. This paper provides strategies and resources utilized in the Families Improving Together (FIT) for weight loss randomized controlled trial to create a warm, supportive climate characterized by positive communication within the parent-child relationship. Detailed descriptions of how Project FIT emphasized these constructs through facilitator training, intervention curriculum, and process evaluation are provided as a resource for clinical and community interventions.

Because it explicitly incorporates uncertainty, scenario planning is regularly employed in climate change adaptation. An early and essential step in developing scenarios is identifying “climate futures”—descriptions of the physical attributes of plausible future climates that could occur at a specific place and time. Divergent climate futures that describe the broadest possible range of plausible conditions support information needs of decision makers, including understanding the spectrum of potential resource responses to climate change, developing strategies robust to that range, avoiding highly consequential surprises, and averting maladaptation. Here, we discuss three approaches for generating climate futures: a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-ensemble, a quadrant-average, and an individual-projection approach. All are designed to capture relevant uncertainty, but they differ in utility for different applications, complexity, and effort required to implement. Using an application from Big Bend National Park as an example of numerous similar efforts to develop climate futures for National Park Service applications over the past decade, we compare these approaches, focusing on their ability to capture among-projection divergence during early-, mid-, and late-twenty-first century periods to align with near-, mid-, and long-term planning efforts. The quadrant-average approach and especially the individual-projection approach captured a broader range of plausible future conditions than the RCP-ensemble approach, particularly in the near term. Therefore, the individual-projection approach supports decision makers seeking to understand the broadest potential characterization of future conditions. We discuss tradeoffs associated with different climate future approaches and highlight suitable applications. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climate futures; Climate projection; Resource management; Scenario planning","Decision making; Resource allocation; Big Bend National Park; Climate change adaptation; Developing strategy; Ensemble approaches; Long term planning; National Park Service; Potential resources; Resource management; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; divergence; future prospect; long-term change; planning process; resource management; Big Bend National Park; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112404859

Different types of climate services include long-term warning systems, projections, monitoring/triggers and signals, risk evaluation tools, and behavior change tools. However, climate services are often promoted as “improving uptake” and “translating and communicating science” This framing, which assumes that climate services are developed by scientists and “provided” to users, has limitations for decision makers designing actions to address changing coastal hazard risk driven by sea-level rise. Acting upon the IPCC 1.5 Degree Special Report imperative for urgent actions to reduce exposure and vulnerability at the coast will require a transformation in the way climate services are developed and delivered, in tandem with an understanding of the decision-making and policy context. Tools and policies must explicitly address deepening uncertainty and changing risk over long timeframes. Their use also must be compatible with the jurisdiction’s institutional frameworks and decision-making practice and relevant to user needs as changing risks unfold. Attention to both short- and long-term decisions are paramount to avoid lock-in and path dependency of decisions taken today, and to ensure relevance for the timeframes of investments in infrastructure and settlements. This requires actionable science and usable tools developed through multi-disciplinary efforts by scientists, co-producing them with decision agencies and communities. We give examples of different types of climate services developed with users and draw out some universal lessons learned in developing and applying them in New Zealand. © Copyright © 2021 Lawrence, Stephens, Blackett, Bell and Priestley.","adaptive planning; climate services; coastal flooding; coastal hazards; policy; sea-level rise",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113165256

The present study aimed to carry out a health impact assessment in Recife, Brazil, hypothesizing a scenario in which the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 remained, throughout the year, as in the most restrictive period of human mobility. Particular material data (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured during the pandemic and population and health (mortality, hospital admissions for heart and respiratory problems) data from 2018 were used. We observed a reduction in the concentration of PM2.5 in up to 43.7% and PM10 up to 29.5% during the period of social isolation in the city of Recife. The reduction in PM2.5 would avoid 106 annual deaths from non-external causes and 58 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases. In this scenario, $ 294.88 million would be saved ($ 114.88 million from heart problems and $ 180 million from non-external causes). When considering hospitalizations avoided by the decrease in PM10, we observed 57 fewer hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, 42 for heart diseases and a reduction of 37 deaths due to non-external causes. The reduction in spending on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations would exceed $ 330,000. Therefore, the reduction of particulate matter could prevent hospital admissions, deaths and consequently there would be a reduction in disease burden in developing countries where economic resources are scarce. In this sense, governments should seek to reduce levels of pollution in order to improve the life quality and health of the population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Brazil; Health services; Particulate matter; Recife; SARS-CoV-2","atmospheric pollution; cause of death; COVID-19; health impact; hospital sector; metropolitan area; particulate matter; Brazil; Pernambuco; Recife; SARS coronavirus; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; city; environmental exposure; health impact assessment; human; pandemic; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Health Impact Assessment; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103380155

Thus, it is important to closely integrate the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Green New Deal with that of reducing deepening regional inequality from the Regionally Balanced New Deal. To accomplish these dual aims, this study provides a collaborative trans-regional R&D strategy and a precise framework with three key dimensions: regional, technological, and organizational. We demonstrate that future mobility is the most important project of the Green New Deal, comprising 1963 nationally funded projects worth USD 1285.4 million. We also illustrate the level of government investment in nationally funded research projects related to future mobility for 17 different regions and seven different technology clusters related to future mobility, and determine which research organizations played an important role in each cluster for all 17 regions between 2015 and 2020.

Given these circumstances, it is important to assess the degree to which continued expansion of solar and wind generating capacity is desirable from an economic perspective. Stochastic frontier models of utility-scale renewable generation allow us to extrapolate the net present value of new solar and wind projects for 47 U.S. states (41 wind and 47 solar). Innovation has played a key role in solar and wind expansion with construction costs falling by 64% and 40% since 2013, respectively. Using current construction costs and electricity prices, continued solar expansion is profitable in 79% of states and wind expansion is profitable in 76% of states. Assuming a costless shift to the electricity generation frontier for renewables increases solar and wind viability to 87% and 90% of states, respectively. Finally, the outlook for solar and wind further improves under a first-best carbon tax that renders solar economically viable in 94% of states and wind viable in 93% of states.

While there is substantial knowledge of the diversity and function of prokaryotes regulating CH4production and consumption, their active interactions with viruses in soil have not been identified. Metagenomic sequencing of soil microbial communities enables identification of linkages between viruses and hosts. However, this does not determine if these represent current or historical interactions nor whether a virus or host are active. In this study, we identified active interactions between individual host and virus populations in situ by following the transfer of assimilated carbon. Using DNA stable-isotope probing combined with metagenomic analyses, we characterized CH4-fueled microbial networks in acidic and neutral pH soils, specifically primary and secondary utilizers, together with the recent transfer of CH4-derived carbon to viruses. A total of 63% of viral contigs from replicated soil incubations contained homologs of genes present in known methylotrophic bacteria. Genomic sequences of 13C-enriched viruses were represented in over one-third of spacers in CRISPR arrays of multiple closely related Methylocystis populations and revealed differences in their history of viral interaction. Viruses infecting nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs and heterotrophic predatory bacteria were also identified through the analysis of shared homologous genes, demonstrating that carbon is transferred to a diverse range of viruses associated with CH4-fueled microbial food networks. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The concentrations of CO2 and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PM-PAHs) and NOx, were observed to increase linearly with traveling distance inside two successive roadway tunnels: the Hongjimun Tunnel and the Jeongneung Tunnel on the Naebu Express Way in Seoul, Korea, except for a small region of decrease. In the decreasing regions, within a few hundred meters of the entrance and before the exit, outside background air with low concentrations of air pollutants was thought to have intruded. From the slopes of the linear regression between distance and concentrations, a fleet-averaged (light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles with 54%, 36%, and 10%, respectively) emission factor of CO2, PM-PAHs, and NOx at an average speed of ~60 km h−1 could be calculated as 197 ± 38 g km−1, 4.2 ± 0.8 × 10−4 g km−1, and 0.530 ± 0.230 g km−1, respectively, which are within the ranges of values reported in the literature. For each tunnel, the emission factors of CO2, PM-PAHs, and NOx estimated on days with higher-than-normal fractions of heavy-duty vehicles, were higher than those on other days. From these results, the new fast method proposed in this study is considered useful for estimating real-world emission factors of air pollutants by using a mobile laboratory as a complementary tool to traditional tunnel studies. This method can be used to rapidly make emission maps at roadway tunnels in mega-cities like Seoul, Korea, for urban air-quality management. © 2021 by the authors.

Molluscs control their shell growth through biomineralisation, but the response of the mechanisms behind biomineralisation to OA conditions are relatively unknown. It is unclear how much carbon is taken into the shell from the environment compared to the uptake through the food source. Shell production is energetically costly to molluscs and metabolic processes and energetic partitioning may affect their ability to perform the underlying mechanisms of biomineralisation under OA. It is possible that additional food consumption might alleviate some impacts caused by acidification. We assessed the ability of extra feeding to alter the impacts of OA and increased temperatures on adult Mytilus edulis. Carbon isotopes (δ13C) were used to examine the change in biomineralisation pathway in mussels. OA did not alter the δ13C directly in separate analyses of the shell calcite and aragonite layers, mantle tissue and extrapallial fluid. However, ambient treatments with increased temperatures altered the mussel biomineralisation pathway in the shell calcite using CO32− instead of HCO3− as the main source of carbon. The proportion of metabolic carbon uptake into the mussel shell calcite layer increased under OA, with additive effects when exposed to increased temperatures and extra feeding. The proportion of metabolic carbon uptake is higher (7%–11%) in the shell aragonite layer compared to calcite, under ambient treatments. OA initially reduced the metabolic carbon uptake into the shell aragonite, but after a period of 4-months with extra feeding, the mussels were able to adjust their metabolic carbon uptake to a level experienced under ambient treatments. This indicates that an abundance of food resources may enable changes in mussel biomineralisation pathways to compensate for any decrease in seawater inorganic carbon associated with OA. The impact of OA on phytoplankton varies from species to species, changing the structure of the community which could provide sufficient food resources to maintain metabolic carbon uptake for mussel shell growth. This study of δ13C isotopic values has identified changes in biomineralisation pathway relating to the mussel metabolic carbon uptake from their food source, with varying results for the aragonite and calcite shell polymorphs. The implications of these findings suggest that some bivalve species with different shell composites may cope better under OA than others, demanding further study into species-specific biomineralisation pathways. © 2021 The Authors","Biomineralisation; Carbon isotopes; Increased temperature; Mussel; Ocean acidification","abundance; aquaculture; aragonite; bivalve; calcite; food consumption; global warming; ocean acidification; polymorphism; seawater; shell; Bivalvia; Mollusca; Mytilus edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103990772

The results of the fuel consumption levels and emissions from on-road tests are affected by many factors, such as driving conditions, routes and environmental conditions. Therefore, more research and analysis are needed for the effects of environmental factors and driving conditions according to RDE phase on the NOx emissions. In this study, RDE tests were conducted by season to analyze the on-road NOx emission characteristics of lean NOx trap (LNT)- and selective catalytic reduction (SCR)-equipped diesel vehicles corresponding to the Euro 6b regulation prior to the application of the RDE regulation. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of seasonal factors and phases of the RDE routes on the NOx emission and NOx conversion efficiency of catalyst. In spring/autumn and summer, the engine-out and tail-pipe NOx emissions were higher 1.3–5.9 times for vehicle A and 1.3–28.4 times for vehicle B in the urban phase than in other phases. In the urban phase, the engine bay temperature was probable to rise owing to frequent stops and low-speed driving, leading to a high intake air temperature, which causes excessive NOx emission, particularly in summer. The average air filter temperature in urban phase was 11–15 °C higher than the environment temperature for vehicle A. The NOx conversion efficiency of the LNT was highest at 54.1% on motorway and the efficiency was dependent on the phase of the test route. The NOx conversion efficiency of the SCR, which is dependent on the catalyst temperature, was highest at 98.7% in spring motorway and the efficiency was affected by the combined factors of season and phases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Conversion efficiency; Lean NOx trap; NOx emissions; Real driving emission; Selective catalytic reduction","Air intakes; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Exhaust systems (engine); Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Selective catalytic reduction; Catalytic reduction; Diesel vehicles; Driving conditions; Lean NOx trap; Light-duty; NOx conversion; NOx emissions; Real driving emission; Real drivings; Selective catalytic reduction systems; Conversion efficiency; carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; nitrous oxide; catalysis; diesel engine; environmental conditions; nitrogen dioxide; seasonal variation; traffic emission; acceleration; air temperature; Article; autumn; bioaccumulation; carbon footprint; catalyst; cold; combustion; controlled study; driving ability; environmental factor; exhaust gas; highway; nitrous oxide emission; process optimization; rural area; seasonal variation; speeding (driving); spring; summer; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104058696

The lack of real-time updated and high spatial resolution atmospheric NH3 point source information is one of the critical problems in the study of atmospheric pollution. Satellite-based NH3 observation data provide a new approach to NH3 point source detection. However current spatial resolution of NH3 concentration satellite data is still not sufficient to extract NH3 point sources at regional scale with high accuracy. Based on the traditional oversampling method to improve the spatial resolution of NH3 satellite data, this paper used high-resolution satellite image data with the geometric morphological features of NH3 point sources to detect the NH3 point sources at regional scale under deep learning techniques. The high-precision NH3 point source location and category information at regional scale is extracted concurrently, solving the current problem that multiple point sources cannot be detected in a single satellite NH3 concentration hotspot. After analyzing a priori knowledge, the industrial sources were further subdivided. The atmospheric ammonia point source detection technique in this paper were used in Northeast China, where the number and types of NH3 emission sources are abundant. The detection results significantly increased the number of NH3 potential point sources detected in Northeast China compared with the traditional oversampling method. The deep learning-based technology combines NH3 concentration remote sensing products with high resolution satellite image data to effectively detect the spatial distribution and types of NH3 point sources at regional scale, providing powerful technical support for NH3 emission regulation and control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; High resolution satellite imagery; IASI-NH3; NH3 point resources; Regional scale","Ammonia; Atmospheric aerosols; Deep learning; Emission control; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Atmospheric ammonia; Deep learning; High resolution satellite imagery; IASI-NH3; NH$-3$; NH3 point resource; Point source detection; Point-sources; Regional scale; Spatial resolution; Satellite imagery; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; point source pollution; real time; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103413264

Based on this situation, understanding the current research status of NPS can help guide future research. However, most of the current reviews only describe the research status of some specific aspects but fail to quantify the research hotspots and development trends on the whole, which limits the overall understanding of NPS. In this paper, bibliometrics was used to study the current status, hotspots, and frontiers of NPS research during 1991–2015, and the future research development was predicted. Over the past 15 years, there has been a remarkable growth trend in publication output, and the participation of countries/territories has also increased. Journal of Environmental Quality, Journal of Hydrology, and Total Environmental Science were the top three journals. Sharpley AN and Arnold JG from the USA were the most productive authors with the best quality articles. The major author clusters and research regions are located in North America and Europe, followed by East Asia. The United States dominates this research field, with the largest number of independent and collaborative articles. Chinese authors gained more attention through international cooperation. Keyword analysis confirmed that water quality and nutrients were the main concerns of NPS pollution research, which mainly involved a number of research topics, such as pollutant emission reduction research and the evaluation and simulation of pollutants’ migration and their transformation under different situations, while pesticides were less of a concern, which suggests that the abuse of pesticides has come under control. Meanwhile, SWAT was the dominating model in the last decade partly because it satisfied the growing needs of watershed-scale management. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the food sector is responsible for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gases. Food policies could substantially contribute to the EU’s ambitious climate goals. Currently, the debate on CO2-e labelling is gaining momentum. Consumers know very little about the climate footprint associated with food choices. A climate label would strengthen consumer knowledge, may eventually influence food choices, could trigger reformulation efforts, raises awareness, and contribute to better informed discussions about climate policy. Based on a review of the current state of research and industry developments on designing CO2 footprint labels, this article provides recommendations on how to develop a clearly understood and trustworthy label. We propose a government approved, multi-level, and categorical CO2-e label, with colour coding and numeric CO2 equivalents; primarily based initially on median values. The design of the label should allow for an adoption of other environmental dimensions in the future. It should be scaled to weight (CO2-e per kg) and apply to food products and meals. In the proposed form, a CO2-e label is a low-cost instrument. As more and more companies are already starting to label their products in different ways, consumer confusion is likely to rise if no uniform guidelines are established. © 2021 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists",,"carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; environmental policy; environmental protection; food consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113883096

We are interested in two such improvements in online CS education - besides being inclusive to each other, online CS students also need to be able to create inclusive technology. Objectives: We have begun developing a new approach that we term ""embedded inclusive design""to address both of these goals. The essence of the approach is to integrate elements of inclusive design education into mainstream CS coursework. This paper presents three curricular interventions we have developed in this approach and empirically investigates their efficacy in online CS post-baccalaureate education. Our research questions were: How do these three curricular interventions affect (RQ1) the climate among online CS students and (RQ2) how online CS students honor the diversity of their users in the tech they create? Method: To answer these research questions, we implemented the curricular interventions in four asynchronous online CS classes across two CS courses within Oregon State University's Ecampus and conducted an action research study to investigate the impacts. Results: Online CS students who experienced these interventions reported feeling more included in the major than they had before, reported positive impacts on their team dynamics, increased their interest in accommodating diverse users, and created more inclusive technology designs than they had before. Discussion: These results provide encouraging evidence that embedding elements of inclusive design into mainstream CS coursework, via the interventions presented here, can increase both online CS students' inclusivity toward one another and the inclusivity of the technology these future CS practitioners create. © 2021 ACM.","diversity; GenderMag; inclusion","E-learning; Action research; CS education; Inclusive design; Inclusive technologies; New approaches; Oregon State University; Research questions; Team dynamics; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113693919

Policy coherence aims to create synergies and avoid conflicts between policies. Mainstreaming adaptation across multiple sectors and achieving greater coherence amongst policies is needed. The paper applies qualitative document analysis, content analysis, and expert interviews to examine the degree of coherence between climate-sensitive sector policies in framing climate change adaptation and the adaptation goals outlined in the national development plan and national climate change policies in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Grenada, and Saint Lucia. The results indicate that adaptation is not fully integrated into the water, agriculture, coastal zone, and forestry policies. For example, while adaptation was explicitly addressed in Saint Lucia’s water policy, it was not explicitly addressed in SVG’s and Grenada’s water policy. The results show that Saint Lucia has the highest coherence score (93.52) while St. Vincent and the Grenadines has the lowest (91.12). The optimal coherence score that can be possibly obtained is 147, which indicates partial coherence in adaptation mainstreaming in sectoral policies. Expert interviews highlighted problems such as institutional arrangements, a silo approach, funding mechanisms, and policy implementation. Using the knowledge provided by the experts, a seven-step process is proposed to practically achieve policy coherence and operationalize the policies. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a game theory model between a manufacturer and a remanufacturer was constructed to analyze the impact of government subsidies and carbon tax policies on authorized remanufacturing. Based on the game theory model, the effects of two government policies on the optimal solution, namely, the unit cost of remanufacturing product authorization and the waste product recovery rate, were compared and analyzed. This analysis could provide a reference for the government to improve and formulate relevant remanufacturing policies. The main results are as follows: government subsidy policies may increase the unit cost of remanufacturing product authorization and the rates of waste product recovery; government carbon tax policies may not affect the unit cost of remanufacturing product authorization, and increase the rates of waste product recovery; the government subsidy policy may not affect the unit retail price of new products, and reduces the unit retail price of remanufactured products; the government subsidy and carbon tax policies may reduce sales of new products and increase sales of remanufactured products; the government subsidies may increase the revenue of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the remanufacturer; and the government carbon tax policies may increase the revenue of the reman-ufacturer. However, government carbon tax policies increase the revenue of the OEM only when the new product carbon tax amount is higher than a certain threshold. The impact of the two policies on the environment is related to the ratio of the two products’ impact on the environment, i.e., the quota ratio between the unit government carbon tax of the new product and the unit government subsidy of the remanufactured product. Finally, the consumer surplus is maximized when the government adopts the subsidy policy and lowest when the government adopts the carbon tax policy. © 2021 by the authors.

During the butanol production, ABE (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol) is a critical intermediate product. Many studies researched the direct application of ABE on engines instead of butanol to solve the production cost problem of butanol. ABE has the defects of large ignition energy and vaporization heat. Hydrogen is a gaseous fuel with small ignition energy and high flame temperature. In this research, ABE port injection combines with hydrogen direct injection, forming a stratified state of the hydrogen-rich mixture around the spark plug. The engine speed is 1500 rpm, and λ is 1. Five αH2 (hydrogen blending fractions: 0, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) and five spark timings (5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 25° CA BTDC) are studied to observe the effects of them on combustion and emissions of the test engine. The results show that hydrogen addition increases the maximum cylinder pressure and maximum heat release rate, increases the maximum cylinder temperature and IMEP, but the exhaust temperature decreases. The flame development period and flame propagation period shorten after adding hydrogen. Hydrogen addition improves HC and CO emissions but increases NOx emissions. Particle emissions decrease distinctly after hydrogen addition. Hydrogen changes the combustion properties of ABE and improves the test engine's power and emissions. The combustion in the cylinder becomes better with the increase of αH2, but a further increase in αH2 beyond 5% brings minor improvements on combustion. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Combustion; Emissions; Hydrogen direct injection; Hydrogen/acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) blends; Particle number","Blending; Costs; Direct injection; Energy policy; Engine cylinders; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Hydrogen; Ignition; Particulate emissions; Acetone butanol ethanols; Combustion characteristics; Cost problems; Emission; Hydrogen addition; Hydrogen direct injection; Hydrogen/acetone-butanol-ethanol blend; Ignition energies; Particle numbers; Production cost; Acetone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110504597

With the increasing pollution discharge upstream of the reservoir, the water quality of the reservoir is seriously threatened. Therefore, it is necessary to control the total amount of pollution and reduce the pollutants under the target water quality. In this paper, the upstream basin of the Yanghe Reservoir in Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province was used as the study area, and the 0-D water quality model was used to estimate the water environment capacity of the study area under the Class II water quality target. And compared with the current pollutants, proposed reduction targets and measures. The results indicated that the water environmental capacity of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia–nitrogen (NH3-N) in the study area were 3226.9t, 264.6t, 71,200.6t, and 5575.7 t, respectively. The COD and NH3-N water environmental capacity cannot be fully utilized. The TN and TP exceeded the standard seriously, exceeding 1.47 times and 1.13 times of the TN and TP water environmental capacity under the water quality target of Class II, respectively. TN and TP need to be reduced by 57% and 53% for satisfying quality requirements, respectively.

Three clays were co-pyrolyzed with hydrochar derived from poplar sawdust to obtain CHCs, which were applied to the paddy fields to investigate the effects on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Three CHCs were labeled as bentonite-hydrochar composite (BTHC), montmorillonite-hydrochar composite (MTHC), and kaolinite-hydrochar composite (KTHC), respectively. The effects of these three CHCs on GHG emissions were determined by monitoring the dynamic CH4 and N2O emissions in the paddy soil column ecosystem during the rice-growing season. The results showed that compared with the control group, three CHCs significantly mitigated CH4 and N2O emissions by 21.4%–47.5% and 5.2%–36.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the fluorescent components result displayed CHCs increased humic-like content by 29.62%–59.72%. A structural equation model was used to assess the hypothesis mitigation mechanism, which exemplified that GHG emissions negatively correlated with pmoA and nosZ genes, possibly resulting in the CH4 and N2O mitigation. Among the three CHCs, the KTHC amendment mitigated the CH4 and N2O emissions by 47.5% and 36.8%, respectively, which was superior to BTHC and MTHC. Hence, it was recommended for application to the field. Overall, this study demonstrates the mitigating effects of CHCs on GHG emissions for the first time, and the reduced CH4 and N2O emissions could contribute to increased soil C and N retention for better agricultural nutrients management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Functional gene; Greenhouse gas; Hydrothermal carbonization; Kaolinite-hydrochar composite","Bentonite; Carbonization; Gas emissions; Genes; Kaolinite; Nitrogen oxides; CH$-4$; Functional genes; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Hydrothermal carbonization; Kaolinite-hydrochar composite; N$-2$/O; Paddy fields; Paddy soils; Rice growths; Greenhouse gases; aluminum silicate; bentonite; methane; montmorillonite; nitrous oxide; adsorption; clay; composite; greenhouse gas; hydrothermal alteration; kaolinite; paddy field; rice; soil amendment; soil emission; Article; carbon footprint; chemical composition; controlled study; genetic analysis; ion exchange; microbial community; nonhuman; nosZ gene; nutritional assessment; physical chemistry; plant gene; plant growth; pmoA gene; polymerase chain reaction; rice; sawdust; soil; Populus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103339085

Within this autumn-winter transit season, domestic heating started. Such interesting period merits comprehensive chemical characterization, particularly the organic species, to look into the influence of additional heating sources and the control measures on air pollution. Therefore, this study performed daily and 6h time resolved PM2.5 sampling from the 24th October to 7th December, 2014, followed by comprehensive chemical analyses including water-soluble ions, elements and organic source-markers. Apparent alterations of chemical profiles were observed with the initiation of domestic heating. Through positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment modeling, six PM2.5 sources including secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emission, coal combustion, industry emission, biomass burning and dust were separated and identified. Coal combustion was successfully distinguished from traffic emission by hopane diagnostic ratio. The result of this study reveals a gradual shift of dominating sources for PM pollution episodes from SIA to primary sources after starting heating. BaPeq toxicity from coal combustion increased on average by several to dozens of times in the heating period, causing both long-term and short-term health risk. Air mass trajectory analysis highlights the regional influence of the industry emissions from the area south to Beijing. Control measures taken during APEC were found to be effective for reducing industry source, but less effective in reducing the overall PM2.5 level. These results provide implications for policy making regarding appropriate air pollution control measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; BaPeq; Beijing; Chemical composition; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Chemical analysis; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal dust; Coal industry; Factorization; Health risks; Heating; Toxicity; BaPeq; Beijing; Chemical compositions; Chemical profiles; Control measures; Domestic heating; Economic Co-operation; PM$-2.5$; Positive Matrix Factorization; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Matrix algebra; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; coal combustion; dust; heating; particulate matter; policy making; pollution control; seasonality; source apportionment; traffic emission; air pollution control; Article; bootstrapping; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; controlled study; health hazard; heating; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; mass fragmentography; meteorology; oxidation; PM2.5 exposure; pollution control; quality control; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Asia; China; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; heating; meteorology; particulate matter; prevention and control; season; toxicity; Beijing [China]; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Beijing; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102621315

Analyzing and understanding this geographic inequality and its drivers is crucial for balanced regional development and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. In this paper, we estimated the CO2 emissions of China's building sector at the provincial level and then calculated the Theil Index of per-capita CO2 emissions generated from different building types. Based on these results, a Kaya identity was applied to analyze the drivers of the inequality in CO2 emissions across China. We found that the inequality index of the different types of buildings makes a significant difference. In general, the Theil Index for public buildings and urban buildings is higher than that for rural buildings. Income, energy intensity and energy mix are the principal drivers of regional disparity of per-capita emissions. Economic growth helps to narrow regional disparities for residential buildings, but its contribution is not significant for public buildings. For all building types, energy intensity is the primary contributor to emissions inequality, and the imbalanced implementation of energy efficiency policies is a leading factor. Energy mix plays an increasing role in the regional disparities of per-capita CO2 emissions, especially for rural buildings. Reducing these regional disparities is crucial to China's goal of achieving peak GHG emissions and reaching carbon neutrality. This paper highlights the importance of per-capita CO2 emissions in formulating carbon peak planning, allocating regional emissions reduction targets, formulating building energy policies and allocating low-carbon resources. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building sector; CO2 emissions; Macroeconomic drivers; Regional disparities","Buildings; Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Regional planning; Building types; Buildings sector; China buildings; CO$-2$/ emission; Macroeconomic driver; Per capita; Public buildings; Regional disparities; Rural buildings; Theil's indices; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105295269

Herein, we provide a strategy to activate the bandgap-broken Ag3PO4/GdCrO3 heterojunction with small band gaps, very negative conduction band, and high valence band value for constructing a robust photothermocatalyst through inserting plasmonic metal Ag nanoparticles at Ag3PO4-GdCrO3 interface as a bridge for selective capture and interband transfer of the photothermal induced charges. The as-developed Ag3PO4/Ag/GdCrO3 heterojunction simultaneously exhibits full visible light response, efficient carriers separation, and high redox potentials.

The eCO2RR to CO is indispensable in promoting C-C coupling through bifunctional catalysis and achieving cascade conversion from CO2 to C2+. This work investigates a series of M/N-C (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) catalysts, for which the metal precursor interacted with the nitrogen-doped carbon support (N-C) at room temperature, resulting in the metal being present as (sub)nanosized metal oxide clusters under ex situ conditions, except for Cu/N-C and Zn/N-C. A volcano trend in their activity toward CO as a function of the group of the transition metal is revealed, with Co/N-C exhibiting the highest activity at -0.5 V versus RHE, while Ni/N-C shows both appreciable activity and selectivity. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the majority of Cu atoms in Cu/N-C form Cu0 clusters during eCO2RR, while Mn/, Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C catalysts maintain the metal hydroxide structures, with a minor amount of M0 formed in Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C. The superior activity of Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C is ascribed to the phase contraction and the HCO3- insertion into the layered structure of metal hydroxides. Our work provides a facile synthetic approach toward highly active and selective electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into CO.

There are significant differences in the development of laying hens feeding in different regions. It is of great significance to improve egg production and reduce pollution emission for China's laying hens industry. Based on the SBM model, this paper constructs MML index, considering unexpected output under common frontier, to comprehensively evaluate the green total factor productivity on Chinese laying hens (GTCL). The results show that: (1) GTCL shows a large spatial and temporal differentiation under both the common frontier and the regional frontier. Compared with the eastern region and central region, the western region has obvious advantages in GTCL. (2) GTCL overall shows a downward trend, however, it emerges an upward trend in recent years. (3) Compared with small-scale and large-scale, middle-scale GTCL has advantages. According to the above empirical results, combined with the China's actual national situation, this paper finally puts forward some policy recommendations to improve GTCL. © 2021 Li et al.

Compared to the non-thermal plasma (NTP) alone system, the degradation rate of toluene and CO2 selectivity improved significantly with the combination of plasma and photocatalysts, meanwhile, the CO selectivity and the by-products NO2 and O3 reduced.When the photocatalyst Ag-TiO2/γ-Al2O3 was packed into the discharge region,this plasma-photocatalytic system could completely remove toluene with above 81% CO2 selectivity and greatly reduced concentration of poisonous byproducts (O3 and NO2) at 5 kJ·L-1, while exhibiting superior stability. The energy efficiency of the hybrid system was increased by about 1.4-3 times, compared with the separated NTP. The main energy loss was the formation of by-products and the loss of light and heat. Finally, the intermediate products of the toluene degradation process of different catalyst systems were analyzed by GC-MS, and the mechanism of toluene degradation by the NTP-photocatalytic system was concluded.The process of NTP synergistic photocatalytic degradation of toluene mainly included three aspects: NTP degradation of toluene, photocatalytic oxidation degradation of toluene, and the synergistic effect between the two.

It is essential to study the fate of methane bubbles migrating from the seafloor, given the widespread occurrence of methane seeping in the seafloor. We investigated the kinetics of methane hydrate formation in bubble flow, including the mass transfer of the CH4 gas and water molecules at different flow patterns, morphological evolution and gas consumption during hydrate formation in the reactor, at 277.2 K and 12 MPa corresponding to temperature and pressure in ""Haima""cold seeping surroundings. We found that a critical-state flow rate existed between steady and unsteady flow patterns, which sharply shortened nucleation time in induction processes. Moreover, hydrates might be found not to form under high driving forces of pressure.

In this research, we constructed an evaluation framework of multiple land-use functions (LUFs) based on sustainable land-use theory. Specifically, we classified the multiple LUFs into three types: agricultural production function (APF), living function (LVF), and ecological service function (ESF). We then spatialized the economic and social data, and implemented the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model and RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model to evaluate each sub-LUF (crop production, aquatic production, woodlands production, livestock production, living space, life quality, water supply, soil conservation, climate regulation, biological conservation) in central China in 2000 and again in 2015. Moreover, by analyzing the changes to LUFs and the relationships between each LUF change, we were able to discern patterns of LUF change in central China. The results show that: 1) 42.12% of total territory in the study area increased their APF from 2000 to 2015, while 43.41% of the lands increased their ESF yet only 8.98% of the lands increased their LVF; 2) in Hubei and Hunan, there was more land with an increase of APF than in Anhui or Jiangxi. The APF in Jiangxi exhibited the greatest decline over time period, the LVF increased more in the provincial capital cities than in other regions, and the ESF expanded more in Jiangxi than in the other provinces; and 3) the changes in APF were significantly and positively correlated with changes in LVF. Additionally, changes in ESF were negatively but non-significantly correlated with changes in APF and LVF. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","central China; land planning; land-use function (LUF); synergies; trade-offs","ecosystem service; land use change; land use planning; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; territorial management; trade-off; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111625730

This paper attempts to investigate the relation between CO2 emissions and economic growth, industry structure, urbanization, research and development (R&amp;D) investment, actual use of foreign capital, and growth rate of energy consumption in China between 2000 and 2018. This study is important for China as it has pledged to peak its carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. We apply a suite of machine learning algorithms on the training set of data, 2000–2015, and predict the levels of CO2 emissions for the testing set, 2016–2018. Employing rmse for model selection, results show that the nonlinear model of k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model performs the best among linear models, nonlinear models, ensemble models, and artificial neural networks for the present dataset. Using KNN model, sensitivity analysis of CO2 emissions around its centroid position was conducted. The findings indicate that not all provinces should develop its industrialization. Some provinces should stay at relatively mild industrialization stage while selected others should develop theirs as quickly as possible. It is because CO2 emissions will eventually decrease after saturation point. In terms of urbanization, there is an optimal range for a province. At the optimal range, the CO2 emissions would be at a minimum, and it is likely a result of technological innovation in energy usage and efficiency. Moreover, China should increase its R&amp;D investment intensity from the present level as it will decrease CO2 emissions. If R&amp;D reinvestment is associated with actual use of foreign capital, policy makers should prioritize the use of foreign capital for R&amp;D investment on green technology. Last, economic growth requires consuming energy. However, policy makers must refrain from consuming energy beyond a certain optimal growth rate. The above findings provide a guide to policy makers to achieve dual-carbon strategy while sustaining economic development. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Siu and Zhao.","CO2 emissions; economic growth; forecasting; industry structure; Machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114325662

Based on the GTFP panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2017, this paper takes the “Air Pollution Control and Prevention Action Plan” (APCP Action Plan) as the proxy dummy variable of environmental regulation, and uses the difference-in-differences (DID) model to explore the impact of the implementation of the APCP Action Plan on GTFP. In addition, by constructing the industrial structure optimization index, this paper analyzes how the APCP Action Plan policy affects GTFP through the transformation and optimization of industrial structure. The following basic conclusions are obtained: First, environmental regulation policies like the APCP Action Plan can improve GTFP. Second, the APCP Action Plan has regional heterogeneity in promoting GTFP in different regions. The policy only significantly affects the GTFP in the Pearl River Delta region in southern China. Third, the “quantity” and “quality” of the optimization of industrial structure will weaken the promoting effect of the APCP Action Plan on GTFP. In contrast, the rationalization of industrial structure will aggravate this promoting effect. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper analyses the greenhouse gasses (GHG) and air pollutant emissions embodied in the cross-province trade of electricity in China, by using a Quasi-Input-Output model. The results of the analysis suggest that the trade-embodied emissions in China amounted to 607 Mt, 294 kt, 318 kt, and 61 kt, for GHG, SO2, NOx and dust, respectively, in 2017. Much of these emissions was transferred from the eastern coastal city-clusters (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta) to the resource-rich western provinces, especially Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, where coal has continued to occupy a central place in their generation technology-fuel mix. The amount of emissions transferred, however, reduced in relative term in 2017, for the Yangtze River and Pearl River regions, when compared with that in 2013, as indicated by emissions factors decreasing faster at the consumption side than that at the production side in these regions over the period 2013–2017. In contrast, in Beijing and Tianjin, the relative emissions transferred became more pronounced in 2017, as compared with that in 2013, due probably to the fact that much of their imported electricity was from Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang with large share of coal generation. Moreover, in addition to direct emissions transfer, indirect emissions transfer caused by electricity exporters purchasing electricity from other grids are also significant, and in some cases (such as, Hunan), these emissions account for over half of the total emissions transferred. This paper also discusses some key policy insights on issues related to the design of the national emissions trading scheme, network infrastructure investment, and consumer education aimed at encouraging the emissions-reduction behavior. © 2021","Cross-province electricity trade; Emission factors; Emissions transfer; Quasi-input-output model","Air pollution; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Rivers; Air pollutant emission; Cross-province electricity trade; Electricity trade; Electricity-generation; Emission factors; Emission transfer; Inner Mongolia; Quasi-input-output model; Tianjin; Xinjiang; Commerce; atmospheric pollution; electricity generation; electricity industry; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental assessment; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; policy approach; pollution monitoring; air pollutant; article; consumer; education; electricity; greenhouse; human; human experiment; Inner Mongolia; investment; purchasing; river; Xinjiang; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105830408

Identifying the key contributors to PM2.5 pollution is important in monitoring and managing atmospheric quality, for example, in controlling haze. Previous research has been aimed at quantifying the relationship between PM2.5 values and their underlying factors, but the spatial and temporal dynamics of these factors are not well understood. Based on random forest and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) algorithms, this study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in selected key factors influencing PM2.5 in Zhejiang Province, China, for the period 2000–2019. The results indicate that, while factors influencing PM2.5 varied significantly during the period studied, SHAP values suggest that there is consistency in their relative importance as follows: meteorological factors (e.g., atmospheric pressure) &gt; socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product, GDP) &gt; topography and land cover factors (e.g., elevation). The contribution of GDP and transportation factors initially increased but has declined in the recent past, indicating that economic and infrastructural development does not necessarily result in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Vegetation productivity, as indicated by changes in NDVI, is demonstrated to have become more important in improving air quality, and the area of the province over which it constrains PM2.5 concentrations has increased between 2000 and 2019. Mapping of SHAP values suggests that, although the relative importance of industrial emissions has declined during the period studied, the actual area positively impacted by such emissions has actually increased. Despite developments in government policy, greater efforts to conserve energy and reduce emissions are still needed. The study further demonstrates that the combination of random forest and SHAP methods provides a valuable means to identify regional differences in key factors affecting atmospheric PM2.5 values and offers a reliable reference for pollution control strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the precise characterization of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), its variability, trends, and predictability, and its associated uncertainty at the global scale is largely unexplored. In addition, gaps in satellite-retrieved AODs across space and time remain an obstacle to accurately revealing aerosol properties. This study uses MODIS Collection 6 AOD retrievals for a time series analysis and modeling of global aerosols from 2003 to 2015. Random forest (RF) regression is first applied to replace the missing data in the satellite AOD retrievals. AOD variations and trends are then investigated and future values are predicted using a Mann–Kendall analysis approach and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, respectively. The results indicate that the developed RF model enhances the AOD data coverage significantly, with the root mean square error and mean absolute error statistical metrics well below 0.13 and 0.08, respectively. High AOD loadings are found over East, South, and Southwest Asia, West and Central Africa, and northern South America. Prominent discrepancies are shown in aerosol variations and trends likely because of dust emissions, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and socioeconomic practices, which has significant implications for climate systems and mitigation policy-making. The ARIMA model delineates AOD features with clear annual and seasonal variations and with high accuracy over most regions. The performance of the model is jointly impacted by the data quality and data values. Overall, our study suggests the feasibility and applicability of the RF model in reconstructing area-scale satellite missing AOD retrievals, as well as the ability of the stochastic ARIMA model to accurately depict and forecast AOD profiles. The globally simulated and predicted aerosols will improve evaluations of aerosol effects for climate and epidemiological studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Aerosols; ARIMA; Driving factors; Random forest; Time series modeling","Climate change; Climate models; Decision trees; Fossil fuels; Harmonic analysis; Mean square error; Satellites; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical depths; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Driving factors; Global aerosol; Moving average model; Optical depth retrievals; Random forests; Times series models; Uncertainty; Aerosols; aerosol; climate change; data quality; fossil fuel; modeling; MODIS; observational method; optical depth; Asia; Central Africa; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107299244

However, the PFCs suffer from thermal stresses and physical sputtering induced by edge-localized modes (ELMs). ELMs in future fusion devices are expected to occur with a high plasma density compared to current day devices such that coupling of recycling neutrals and plasma ions will be strong. Because of the scale hierarchy of future fusion devices compared to the present ones, the influence of this coupling is difficult to predict. Here, we investigate the ELM-like hydrogen plasma induced heat loads on tungsten in the linear device Magnum-PSI, producing ∼1 ms plasma pulses with electron densities up to 3.5 1021 m-3. A combination of time-resolved Thomson scattering and coherent Thomson scattering was used to acquire plasma parameters in front of the target. Moreover, a fast infrared camera coupled to finite element thermal analyses allowed to determine the deposited heat loads on the target. We found a significant inconsistency between the plasma power calculated with a conventional collisionless sheath model and the absorbed power by the target. Moreover, plasma stagnation upstream and plasma cooling downstream were observed during the pulses. The observations are explained based on ionization and elastic collisions between the recycling neutrals and plasma ions. The results highlight the impact of plasma-neutral interaction on the power deposition behavior of ELM-like hydrogen plasma on tungsten. © 2021 DIFFER - Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research.","edge-localized modes; neutrals recycling; nuclear fusion; plasma flow; sheath physics","Coherent scattering; Deposition; Fluorocarbons; Fusion reactors; Hydrogen; Light scattering; Plasma density; Recycling; Thermal load; Thermoanalysis; Edge localized modes; Finite element thermal analysis; Fusion power plant; Infra-red cameras; Physical sputtering; Plasma-facing components; Thomson scattering; Time resolved Thomson scattering; Collisionless plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109996358

In this process, carbonic acid in-situ generated interacts with and ingeniously activates the aziridine ring, facilitating its subsequent transformation and promoting the selectivity of 5-substituted products. DFT calculations, FTIR spectroscopy and pH value monitoring reveal that the excellent 5-postion regio-selectivity is dictated by kinetics, which is attributed to the formation of a latent benzyl carbocation in the transition state. The confined nanospaces of hierarchical porous silica can be considered as plenty of nanoreactors, which would change concentrations of reagents and activation parameters, stabilize transition states and enhance the kinetics process. This environment-friendly system provides a synergistic strategy of optimizing both the chemical function and physical microenvironment to enhance CO2 activation, and enriches the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) coupling process by conversion of the waste (water-fixed CO2) into value-added compounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones; Confined nanospaces; In-situ carbonic acid; Synergetic effect; Water-promoted CO2cycloaddition","Chemical activation; Cycloaddition; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Organic acids; Silica; 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinone; Aziridines; Chemical functions; Confined nanospace; Hierarchical porous silicas; In-situ carbonic acid; Microenvironments; Nano-space; Synergetic effect; Water-promoted CO2cycloaddition; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106933939

We investigated this in a pot experiment with six fertilizer treatments involving K and two sources of N, using agricultural soil from the suburbs of Wuhan, central China. The aim was to determine the effects of the interaction between K and different forms of N on the N2O flux and the abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities, using static chamber-gas chromatography and high-throughput sequencing methods. Compared with no fertilizer control (CK), the addition of nitrate fertilizer (NN) or ammonia fertilizer (AN) or K fertilizer significantly increased N2O emissions. However, the combined application (NNK) of K and NN significantly reduced the average N2O emissions by 28.3%, while the combined application (ANK) of K and AN increased N2O emissions by 22.7%. The abundance of nitrifying genes amoA in ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) changed in response to N and/or K fertilization, but the denitrifying genes narG, nirK and norl were strongly correlated with N2O emissions. This suggests that N or K fertilizer and their interaction affect N2O emissions mainly by altering the abundance of functional genes of denitrifying microbes in the soil-plant system.

In the past five years, both PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations have decreased over the three Beijing regions, particularly during winters. The PM2.5/PM10 ratios have distinct seasonal characteristics, with more frequent high ratios in winter than in other seasons. The high ratio frequency decrease is most evident in winter and in the southern Beijing suburbs. This fine particle proportion decrease is related to air pollution control policies, including the national project ‘Coal to Gas’. High PM2.5/PM10 ratios are linked to heavy pollution levels and low wind speeds, indicating the importance of PM2.5 accumulation during pollution events in Beijing. The higher PM2.5/PM10 ratios in Beijing are also closely related to southerly winds and high humidity, indicating the contribution of anthropogenic pollution transported from the south. Due to similar geographic environments, Tianjin is similar to Beijing in terms of the frequency distribution characteristics of the PM2.5/PM10 ratios. The coastal city of Dalian is further north and not similar to Beijing or Tianjin, owing to a sea breeze influence.

Meanwhile, climate warming also promotes the plant growth and increases carbon assimilation. Presently, it is largely unknown about the carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the Arctic regions. In this study, to investigate the seasonal and annual net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), we collected 71 observation stations for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in the high latitude permafrost regions during 2002–2017. The results showed that the annual NEE was −8.2 ± 4.1 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for forest, −3.3 ± 2.6 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for shrub, −4.8 ± 4.1 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for grassland, −3.6 ± 3.0 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for wetland and 0.02 ± 0.62 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for tundra, respectively. From 2002 to 2017, the CO2 emissions of grassland (carbon source) showed a decreasing trend, and the CO2 assimilation of shrub and forest (carbon sink) has been increased. The wetland and tundra are shifting from carbon sources to sinks. There were great variations in temperature sensitivities (Q10) of NEE in different seasons, with larger values in winter and lower values in summer. These findings indicate that the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem presently acts as a carbon sink, while there is a possibility that future warming, especially the warming in winter, may decrease the carbon sink of the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors","Arctic; Carbon flux; Climate change; Ecosystem; Eddy covariance; Permafrost",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114373011

Fuel properties play important roles both in the physical process of fuel-air mixing and the chemical process of combustion in the cylinder of diesel engines. Alcohol additives in diesel will definitely change its fuel properties. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to investigate the combined impact of alcohol fuel properties on the performance and emissions characteristics of a diesel engine operated at the LTC mode. A total of 20% ethanol, 20% propanol, and 20% n-butanol by volume were added in the diesel (represented as E20, Pr20, and Bu20), respectively, at different exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates. The results show that when the EGR rate reaches up to 35%, the CA50 phase obviously retards for E20, while the corresponding EGR rates are 40% for Pr20 and 45% for Bu20. The effects of fuel properties on cycle-to-cycle variations may be random or stochastic. Medium EGR rates may be the best choice for the LTC. Fuel properties have little effect on CO, THC, and NOx emissions. But E20 can reduce soot emissions greatly within medium EGR regions. That is, E20 may be more proper as diesel LTC fuel. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Alcohols; Diesel engine; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel properties; Low-temperature combustion; Performance and emissions","Alcohol fuels; Combustion; Diesel engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Stochastic systems; Temperature; Alcohol additives; Chemical process; Cycle to cycle variation; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Low cetane number fuels; Low temperature combustion; Performance and emissions; Physical process; Fuel additives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105363508

Biochar soil amendment can enhance carbon sequestration and alter soil edaphic features (e.g., increase pH and water holding capacity) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effect of biochar amendment on rhizosphere microbiome is still an open question, especially for calcareous soils, which generally have neutral or alkaline pH. We investigated the impacts of biochar amendment on tomato rhizosphere bacterial community composition and diversity in alkaline calcareous soil. To characterize the bacterial communities that consume root-exudates, we grew tomato plants with and without the biochar amendment in plant growth chambers supplied with and without 13CO2 labeled gas for 35 days. Biochar amendment increased soil pH and total carbon (C) concentration but had little impacts on soil NO3–-N, NH4+-N, OlsenP concentrations, and total vegetative tomato biomass compared with unamended soil. Furthermore, the tomato rhizosphere bacterial community composition did not significantly change after biochar amendment. We observed 76 and 82 13C-labeled amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in the control and biochar treated rhizospheres, respectively, and 60 of the 98 ASVs were shared between the two treatment samples. The bacterial taxonomic composition of the 13C-labeled ASVs was similar between control and biochar treatments, and mainly belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria (e.g., Acinetobacter and Kaistia). Additionally, the relative abundance of 13C-labeled bacteria only accounted for approximately 2% of the total rhizosphere bacterial communities for both treatments. These results demonstrate that biochar amendment may have limited impacts on rhizosphere bacterial community composition and their utilization of plant-derived carbon in alkaline calcareous soils. Our study furthers our understanding of the association of plant and bacterial communities in response to biochar amendment in agricultural systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial communities; Biochar; Calcareous soil; Continuous labeling; Plant-derived carbon","Alkalinity; Carbon; Forestry; Fruits; Gas plants; Soils; $+13$/C; Amplicon sequences; Bacterial community; Bacterial community composition; Bio chars; Biochar amendments; Calcareous soils; Continuous labeling; Plant-derived carbon; Sequence variants; Bacteria; alkalinity; bacterium; biochar; biomass; calcareous soil; carbon sequestration; community structure; microbial community; nutrient cycling; relative abundance; rhizosphere; soil amendment; soil microorganism; Acinetobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Kaistia; Lycopersicon esculentum; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102902081

Therefore, this study proposes a water-centric nexus approach for the agriculture and forest sectors for improving the response to climate change in the Korean Peninsula. Two spatial models, i.e., Environmental Policy Integrated Climate and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, were used to assess the extent of changes in agricultural water demand, forest water supply, and their balance at the watershed level in the current and future climatic conditions. Climate changed has increased the agricultural water demand and forest water supply significantly in all future scenarios and periods. Comparing the results with RCP8.5 2070s and the baseline, the agricultural water demand and forest water supply increased by 35% and 28%, respectively. Water balance assessment at the main watershed level in the Korean Peninsula revealed that although most scenarios of the future water supply increases offset the demand growth, a risk to water balance exists in case of a low forest ratio or smaller watershed. For instance, the western plains, which are the granary regions of South and North Korea, indicate a higher risk than other areas. These results show that the land-use balance can be an essential factor in a water-centric adaptation to climate change. Ultimately, the water-centric nexus approach can make synergies by overcoming increasing water demands attributable to climate change. © 2021 by the author.

Since NR Mtb is highly tolerant to antibiotic effects and can mutate to become drug resistant (DR), our conventional tuberculosis (TB) treatment is not effective. Thus, a novel strategy to kill NR Mtb is required. Accumulating evidence has shown that repetitive exposure to sublethal doses of antibiotics enhances the level of drug tolerance, implying that NR Mtb is formed by adaptive metabolic remodeling. As such, metabolic modulation strategies to block the metabolic remodeling needed to form NR Mtb have emerged as new therapeutic options. Here, we modeled in vitro NR Mtb using hypoxia, applied isotope metabolomics, and revealed that phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is nearly completely depleted in NR Mtb. This near loss of PEP reduces PEP-carbon flux toward multiple pathways essential for replication and drug sensitivity. Inversely, supplementing with PEP restored the carbon flux and the activities of the foregoing pathways, resulting in growth and heightened drug susceptibility of NR Mtb, which ultimately prevented the development of DR. Taken together, PEP depletion in NR Mtb is associated with the acquisition of drug tolerance and subsequent emergence of DR, demonstrating that PEP treatment is a possible metabolic modulation strategy to resensitize NR Mtb to conventional TB treatment and prevent the emergence of DR. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

This study collected personal black carbon (BC) exposures for 141 drivers across seven sectors in London. The aim of the study was to assess the magnitude and the primary determinants of their exposure, leading to the formulation of targeted exposure reduction strategies for the occupation. Each participant's personal BC exposures were continuously measured using real-time monitors for 96 h, incorporating four shifts per participant. ‘At work’ BC exposures (3.1 ± 3.5 µg/m3) were 2.6 times higher compared to when ‘not at work’ (1.2 ± 0.7 µg/m3). Workers spent 19% of their time ‘at work driving’, however this activity contributed 36% of total BC exposure, highlighting the disproportionate effect driving had on their daily exposure. Taxi drivers experienced the highest BC exposures due to the time they spent working in congested central London, while emergency services had the lowest. Spikes in exposure were observed while driving and were at times greater than 100 µg/m3. The most significant determinants of drivers’ exposures were driving in tunnels, congestion, location, day of week and time of shift. Driving with closed windows significantly reduced exposures and is a simple behaviour change drivers could implement.

Such a roaming route bypasses the minimum energy path but produces the same molecular products. The photodissociation of the carbonyl compounds of study includes methyl formate (HCOOCH3), formic acid (HCOOH), and aliphatic aldehydes (RCOH, R-H, CH3, and large alkyl group). Methyl formate and formic acid were promoted to the excited state, followed by internal conversion via a conical intersection. Then, the energetic precursor dissociated to fragments, which proceeded along either TS or roaming path. As the excitation energy increases, the roaming fraction in methyl formate is significantly interfered with by an open channel of triple fragmentation (H + CO + CH3O), whereas such a channel may not occur in formic acid even at an excitation wavelength of 193 nm. As a distinct roaming type, aliphatic aldehydes are found to possess the structure of the roaming saddle point comprising two moieties weakly bound at a distance. The energy difference between the TS barrier and the roaming saddle point is indicative of the extent for the roaming contribution. The roaming route becomes increasingly dominant when the aliphatic aldehyde is larger. Experimentally, ion imaging was employed to visualize the rotational-level dependence of the roaming route, while time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared emission spectroscopy was applied to determine the vibrational-state dependence. The roaming signature was verified theoretically by quasi-classical trajectory calculations. As an alternative, a multi-center impulsive model was developed to simulate the roaming scalar and vector properties without involving the global energy surface. © 2021 The Chemical Society Located in Taipei & Wiley-VCH GmbH","impulsive model; ion imaging; QCT; roaming; time-resolved FTIR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101878094

However, all LUE models assume a constant value of maximum LUE at canopy scale (LUEmaxcanopy) over a given vegetation type. This assumption is not supported by observed plant traits regulating LUEmaxcanopy, which varies greatly even within the same ecosystem type. In this study, we developed an improved satellite data driven GPP model by identifying the potential maximal GPP (GPPPOT) and their dominant climate control factor in various plant functional types (PFT), which takes into account both plant trait and climatic control inter-dependence. We selected 161 sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset with eddy covariance CO2 flux data and continuous meteorology to derive GPPPOT and their dominant climate control factor of vegetation growth for 42 natural PFTs. Results showed that (1) under the same phenology and incident photosynthetic active radiation, the maximal variance of GPPPOT is found in different PFTs of forests (10.9 g C m−2 day−1) and in different climatic zones of grasslands (&gt;10 g C m−2 day−1); (2) intra-annual change of GPP in tropical and arid climate zones is mostly driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) changes, while temperature is the dominant climate control factor in temperate, boreal and polar climate zones; even under the same climate condition, physiological stress in photosynthesis is different across PFTs; (3) the model that takes into account the plant trait difference across PFTs had a higher agreement with flux tower-based GPP data (GPPflux) than the GPP products that omit PFT differences. Such agreement was highest for natural vegetation cover sites (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.79 g C m−2 day−1). These results suggest that global scale GPP models should incorporate both plant traits and their dominant climate control factor variance in various PFT to reduce the uncertainties in terrestrial carbon assessments. © 2021","Carbon flux; Climatic zones; Plant trait; Terrestrial carbon cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120692569

However, the definition of urban ES demand is still in the fuzzy conceptual stage. Therefore, this study proposed a conceptual framework for fine-scale mapping of urban ES demands from the perspective of population-income-environmental pressure/preference (PIEP). By integrating multi-source data, the framework was implemented in a metropolitan city of China, Hangzhou, focusing on demands for five exemplary urban ESs, i.e. cooling, air purification, noise reduction, carbon sequestration, and outdoor recreation. The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to dimensionality reduction and a comprehensively assessment of multiple ES demands. ES demand bundles were identified based on the k-means cluster analysis, where a hierarchical elbow method was devised for setting an optimal cluster number supported by practical decisions. The results showed that the demand for regulating services had more significant spatial aggregation characteristics than that for cultural services. Moreover, the high demand areas were concentrated in the city center and two sub-centers, while demand gradually decreased toward the urban periphery. The ES demand bundles presented three major patterns of composite modes: the multi-demand synergy type, regulating-cultural demand trade-off type, and local-based type. Our findings suggest that the PIEP framework is a promising decision-support tool which can tease out urban ES demands for urban planning and sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bundles; Conceptual framework; Ecosystem service demand; Mapping; Urban planning","Air cleaners; Cluster analysis; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; K-means clustering; Noise abatement; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Bundle; Conceptual frameworks; Ecological resources; Ecosystem service demand; Ecosystem services; Environmental pressures; Fine-scale; Optimal allocation; Service demand; Urban ecosystem; Mapping; conceptual framework; demand-side management; ecosystem service; mapping method; metropolitan area; sustainable development; urban ecosystem; urban planning; article; carbon sequestration; China; city planning; cluster analysis; conceptual framework; cooling; decision support system; ecosystem; elbow; noise reduction; principal component analysis; recreation; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103986389

This study identifies individual sources and entry pathways in a small-scale urban area. We investigate emissions of commonly used biocides (terbutryn, diuron, and octylisothiazolinone - OIT) and some of their transformation products (TPs; diuron-desmethyl, terbumeton, terbuthylazine-2-hydroxy, and terbutryn-desethyl) from a 2 ha residential area 13 years after construction has ended. Sampling utilizes existing urban water infrastructure representative for decentralized storm water management in central and northern Europe and applies a two-step approach to (a) determine the occurrence of biocides above water quality limits (i.e., predicted no-effect concentration, PNEC) and (b) identify source areas and characterize entry pathways into surface and groundwater. Monitoring focuses on the analysis of selected biocides and TPs by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in water samples taken from facades, rainwater pipes, drainage, and storm water infiltration systems. In standing water in a swale, we found high concentrations of diuron (174 ng L-1) and terbutryn (40 ng L-1) above PNEC for surface water. We confirmed expected sources, i.e., facades. Sampling of rain downpipes from flat roofs identified additional sources of all biocides and two TPs of terbutryn and one TP of diuron. Diuron and terbutryn were found in three drainage pipes representing different entry pathways of biocides. In one drainage pipe collecting road runoff, only diuron-desmethyl and terbutryn-desethyl were detected. In two other drainage pipes collecting infiltrated water through soil, terbuthylazine-2-hydroxy was additionally detected. One of the pipes collecting infiltrated water through soil concentration showed the highest concentrations of terbutryn and two of its TPs (terbutryn-desethyl and terbuthylazine-2-hydroxy). This suggests a high leaching potential of terbutryn. The applied two-step approach determined sources and pathways of biocide and their TPs.

Franco var. menziesii) stands, intensive forest management has resulted in variable responses in survival and growth and therefore stand biomass due to effects on microclimate and competition for limited resources. As seedling genetics and management practices develop over time, there is a need to re-evaluate how Douglas-fir survival and growth varies with intensive practices. Five-year Douglas-fir diameter at 15 cm (D15) and height growth, biomass, and nitrogen (N) pools after organic matter removals and soil compaction at a recently established site in central Oregon (NARA) were compared to five-year results from three Douglas-fir sites with organic matter removal and vegetation control treatments that were established 10–14 years earlier in central Washington (Fall River and Matlock) and northern Oregon (Molalla). The NARA site contained up to two times greater individual-tree foliar and branch biomass for the same stem D15 than the previously established sites, possibly due to a lower planting density, a warmer climate, and/or improved genetics/different seed sources. Prediction of stem biomass was similar at all sites using D152*height. Periodic D15 and height growth from 1 to 3 years and five-year Douglas-fir biomass was lower in the bole-only (BO) without compaction treatment at NARA compared to other treatment combinations. Greater periodic D15 and height growth after five years of annual vegetation control (Fall River, Matlock, and Molalla) resulted in larger Douglas-fir biomass compared to the initial vegetation control treatments. These results indicate the beneficial effects of vegetation control on early growth across a wide range of conditions. With one exception, whole-tree removal treatments did not affect five-year-old Douglas-fir biomass or N pools, indicating site resilience to increased OM removal across the region. A principal component analysis (PCA) clearly separated all four sites according to climate, soil temperature and moisture, N availability, D15 and height growth, and Douglas-fir and competing vegetation biomass. Within each site, the PCA showed that vegetation control was associated with the greatest differences in Douglas-fir and competing vegetation biomass. This supports the notion that site factors and vegetation control treatments are critically important in mitigating response to intensive management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Competing vegetation control; Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

The carbon–land–water implications of this policy are examined here by compiling and analysing detailed city-level life-cycle inventories of China’s staple crops. We find that in general potato, despite relatively low yields, has lower greenhouse gas emissions and water demand than other staple crops (maize, wheat and rice) on a per-calorie basis, but substantial regional variation exists for each crop. Integrating potato as a staple in China to meet increases in food demand and close the yield gap has the potential to reduce the total carbon–land–water impacts of staple crops by 17–25% by 2030. However, an unsuccessful integration runs the risk of global burden-shifting if the policy, for example, reduced domestic rice production and led to increased rice imports. Potential synergies between food security and environmental sustainability in China can be created by the potato policy, but greater efforts are needed to promote potato across the entire food supply chain from production to consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112691229

Herein, we reported a composite catalyst of 3D sponge-like pyrenyl-graphdiyne (Pyr-GDY) anchored ultrafine Ag nanoparticles (Ag/Pyr-GDY), with the average size of Ag NPs of only 1.6 nm. The porous 3D Pyr-GDY component can not only anchor and stabilize the capping agent free ultrafine Ag NPs by virtue of the strong affinity between alkynyl groups and Ag, but also enhance the local concentration of CO2 due to the porous nature of 3D Pyr-GDY. As a result, the optimized Ag/Pyr-GDY catalyst displays a record-high activity towards the catalysis of CO2 cycloaddition with propargylamines under ambient temperature and pressure, with a TON of 20 488 and a yield of 83%, and is 15.3 times more active than the most efficient catalyst Ag27-MOF (TON = 1333, yield = 34%).

To comprehensively explore the effects of irrigation across different climatic regions over China, we propose a novel combined irrigation scheme (including dynamic and fixed irrigation schemes) into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Noah-mosaic model. Two experiments (with and without irrigation) are designed to simulate the impacts of irrigation over China on regional climate. As irrigation increases the latent heat flux but decreases the sensible heat flux and surface temperature, and the magnitudes of corresponding change are highly dependent on the irrigation amounts and irrigation fraction, the evaporative cooling effects significantly reduce the warm bias over extensive irrigation area during crop growing seasons. Meanwhile, irrigation increases soil moisture during both irrigated and non-irrigated seasons. Compared with the dynamic irrigation scheme, the fixed irrigation scheme results in relatively higher subsurface runoffs due to the continuous infiltration. In addition, the irrigation-induced changes on precipitation during spring (March–May) are weaker than that during summer (June–August). The opposed effects of irrigation cooling and wetting on generating convective precipitation, and the irrigation-induced changes in large-scale circulation jointly give rise to the heterogeneous changes of precipitation. Besides, the subgrid-scale irrigation scheme can capture the climatic effects of irrigation in some grids where the dominant land use types are not cropland, indicating that in mesoscale simulation, climate model coupled with subgrid-scale irrigation scheme may improve climate variables trends attribution studies. © 2021.

However, since there is a lack of comprehensive assessment on emissions of air pollutants, meteorology, air quality, and heatwave occurrences under different climate goals, how significant the clean air cobenefits compared with the direct climate-related impact is uncertain. In this study, we assess the cobenefits of 1.5 °C pathways for air quality in China by linking multiple shared socioeconomic pathways, ensembling simulations of regional climate-air quality dynamic downscaling and an air pollution and climate-related health assessment model, and compare different kinds of benefits: the health benefits from direct slowing climate (reduced heatwaves) versus the health cobenefits from air quality improvement (the improved air quality from reduced air pollutants versus meteorological changes). The benefit of reduced air pollution emissions associated with sustainable development under 1.5 °C pathways dominated the overall impact, which could avoid 1 589 000 PM2.5-related and 526 000 O3-related deaths in 2050. Correspondingly, the impact of changed meteorology on air quality would avoid additional 8000 PM2.5-related deaths in 2050 under 1.5 °C pathways yet would lead to 22 000 O3-related deaths. Also, the heatwave-related deaths could be avoided by 7000.

Millennial-scale climate variability, as registered in Greenland ice cores, was transferred to the low-latitude regions by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). However, there is still some disputes regarding the mechanism of climatic variation in the tropical Indian Ocean. To explore the interplay responses to regional monsoons and global in the northeastern Indian Ocean, here we present new evidence of trace elements (Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca) and stable isotopes measured from the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white) in core ADM-159, which was collected from the central Andaman Sea. Twelve accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquedrina dutertrei from the core provide a reliable age model. Our results indicate gradual surface warming with several short-lived fluctuations since ~42 kyr ago. The SST during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was ~3 °C colder than the present SST, and a sharp increase in warming beginning at 18.5 cal ka BP indicated the transition from the LGM to the Holocene; these matched well with the warming trend in the Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels. The seawater δ18O record (defined as δ18Osw, presumably salinity-driven) and the Ba/Ca record, which is a measure of the continental riverine runoff from Myanmar, revealed a prominent millennial-scale variability pattern controlled by the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) as seen in speleothem records. The higher salinity values that suggested weakened ISM precipitation and a decrease in freshwater output from the Irrawaddy-Salween rivers were seen at 41.1 cal ka BP–39.9 cal ka BP, 34.9 cal ka BP–32.8 cal ka BP, 29.3 cal ka BP–28 cal ka BP, 25.7 cal ka BP–23.8 cal ka BP, 19.3 cal ka BP–15.8 cal ka BP, 13 cal ka BP–11.4 cal ka BP, and 4.0 cal ka BP–2.3 cal ka BP, reflecting strong correspondence with cold events in North Atlantic. Thus, this study provides evidence that climatic changes in the tropical Indian Ocean responded well to both regional monsoon and global climate changes, and during that atmospheric CO2, solar insolation, and AMOC played the most important roles in those responses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Andaman Sea; Global teleconnection; Indian monsoon; Last glacial period; Riverine runoff; Sea surface temperature","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Glacial geology; Mass spectrometry; Trace elements; Tropics; Accelerator mass spectrometry; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Global climate changes; Indian summer monsoon; Last Glacial Maximum; Planktonic foraminifera; Tropical Indian ocean; Variability patterns; Oceanography; accelerator mass spectrometry; climate change; foraminifera; global climate; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; monsoon; oceanic circulation; paleoclimate; regional climate; Andaman Sea; Antarctica; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Irrawaddy River; Myanmar; Southern Ocean; Foraminifera; Globigerinoides ruber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108101467

The paper summarizes the government mechanism, market mechanism, and public participation mechanism in Min'an Community and analyzes the provision, monitoring, and enforcement of each mechanism. We find that unlike the low carbon governance at the city or industry park levels, China's low carbon governance at the community level lacks a dominant mechanism. Even though it involves community-wide governance, the public participation mechanism is also inadequate. For improving low carbon governance at the community level, the government should broaden finance channels to strengthen the incentive mechanisms, make active use of new technologies, such as mobile Internet, encourage innovation of public participation mechanism, and employ various publicity and education measures to cultivate the low carbon culture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Community; Low carbon; Polycentric governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107046034

Climate change impacts forests in many aspects and is increasingly likely to undermine the ability of forests to provide basic ecosystem services. To help reduce the impact of climate change on Taiwan’s forests, people must be made aware of the relationship between climate change and forests. Based on questionnaires collected from 17 cities in Taiwan, this study applied spatial analysis to assess the respondents’ understanding of climate change and adaptation strategies for forest management. A total of 650 questionnaires were distributed and 488 valid ones were collected. The results show that (1) Most respondents believe that climate change is true and more than half of the respondents have experienced extreme weather events, especially extreme rainfall; (2) Most respondents believe that climate change will affect Taiwan’s forests with the majority recognizing the increasing impact of extreme events being the primary cause, followed by changes in the composition of tree species and the deterioration of forest adaptability due to climate change; (3) Most respondents expressed that forest management should be adjusted for climate change and called for measures being taken to establish mixed forests as well as monitoring forest damage; (4) In order to address the difficulties faced by forest owners on the impact of climate change, the majority of respondents felt that the government should raise forest owners’ understanding on climate change and adaptation policies, while the subsidy incentives must also be adjusted. The results of this study show that the respondents do realize the importance of climate change and forest management so much so their awareness in this matter led to their support for forest adaptation measures and policies. © 2021 by the authors.

Three modified CO2 systems are discussed for home heating, in which a transcritical CO2 cycle system combining technologies of two-stage compression, vapor injection and inter-stage cooling (CO2 HPTSC, VI, ISC) is proposed based on the other two modified CO2 systems. Meanwhile, they are evaluated with two basic systems of CO2 and R134a in energy, environment and economy. All modified CO2 systems in terms of energy efficiency are better than R134a base heat pump system (R134a HPbase). In particular, CO2 HPTSC, VI, ISC is the optimal system. By combining typical meteorological parameters of different regions in China, the seasonal performance factor (SPF), gases emissions and costs are studied. The annual gas emissions of modified CO2 heat pump systems are all lower than those of R134a HPbase. If the compressor cost could be decreased by 67.66%, the life cycle cost (LCC) of CO2 HPTSC, VI, ISC will rival that of R134a HPbase in Beijing area.

Surface ozone negatively impacts plant photosynthesis while aerosols can have positive or negative effects from its dual impact on light and temperature. Here, using a statistical model, we show that in the United States, as a result of improvements in air quality, the damages caused by ozone and aerosols have decreased since 1980. Historically, relative yield losses due to ozone were 8.7% and 4.8%, and due to aerosols were 11.3% and 23.2% for maize and soybean, respectively. Maize yields are more sensitive to ozone pollution while soybean yields are more sensitive to aerosol pollution. In future RCP 8.5 scenario, absent significant reductions in emissions or improvements in air quality, maize, and soybean would have on average, 58.5% and 36.9% additional yield reductions, respectively, mainly caused by warming. Future climate warming and fossil fuel combustion driven changes to air pollution may have differing impacts on crop yield and should be jointly considered in any assessment of U.S. food security. © 2021.

This paper focuses on the development of the EV industry in China and empirically examines the impact of the government's incentives on EV adoption in both the public and private domains using data from 61 cities spanning 2009–2018. EV-supportive policies, including financial incentives and convenience measures, are discussed, and a variable instrumental strategy is applied to solve the endogenous problem of charging facilities. The results reveal that in the public domain, financial subsidies can effectively promote the use of electric buses; however, the adoption of commercial EVs is mainly stimulated by charging facility construction and increasing fuel prices. Meanwhile, in the private domain, convenience measures, such as charging station construction and non-purchase limitations, contribute to increasing the demand for EVs, while the effect of financial incentives is not as significant as we expected. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Electric vehicles; Incentives; Technology adoption","Digital storage; Emission control; Finance; Carbon emissions reductions; Charging facilities; China; Energy; Financial incentives; Government incentive; Incentive; Policy incentives; Technology adoption; Vehicle industry; Electric vehicles; car use; electric vehicle; incentive; innovation; local government; public transport; technology adoption; transportation policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107668507

Compared with simple ZnO, ZNNG exhibited stronger green emissions, but no ultraviolet (UV) emission peak was observed. Through a comprehensive analysis of ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra, Mott Schottky (MS) plots, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, it was proved that the stable green emissions of ZnO and its composites originated from the quenching of electrons between Zn interstitial (Zni) and surface oxygen defects. The introduction of NiS@NiO caused the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of ZnO to change to lower energy states, effectively increasing the absorption intensities of ZnO in the visible light, while introducing numerous oxygen-related defects on the surface of ZnO. Further addition of rGO effectively promoted the migration of electrons from the CB to the Fermi energy (Ef). These effects effectively increased the green emission of ZnO and reduced the UV emission. Finally, a proper mechanism for the near-zero band gap NiS@NiO/rGO that can significantly enhance the green emission of ZnO was proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Green emission; Photoluminescence; ZnO; ZnO/NiS@NiO/rGO","Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Electrons; Energy gap; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nickel oxide; Oxygen; Paramagnetic resonance; Photoluminescence; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc oxide; Comprehensive analysis; Emission peaks; Green emissions; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy; Scanning electrons; Simple++; Ultraviolet emission; X- ray diffractions; ZnO; ZnO/NiS@NiO/rGO; II-VI semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104586083

However, we know little about the relative importance of these factors in driving the responses of multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) to nitrogen (N) enrichment. Here, we measured soil abiotic properties (soil pH; available nitrogen, AN; available phosphorous, AP; and dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and multiple plant diversity metrics (species diversity, SD; functional diversity, FD; and phylogenetic diversity, PD) after a 5-year N fertilization experiment (0, 5, 10, and 15 g N m−2 yr−1) to evaluate their roles in mediating the impacts of N addition on aboveground plant functions (APF), soil microbial functions (SMF), and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in a N-limited Tibetan alpine meadow. We found that N addition decreased APF but increased SMF and EMF. Structural equation models (SEMs) showed that APF was co-driven by soil DOC and the community weighted mean for plant traits (CWMs), and SMF was driven by soil DOC, soil AN, CWMs and functional dispersion (FDis). The effects of N addition on EMF were driven by soil AN and FDis. Our results suggest that the effects of N enrichment on APF, SMF, and EMF are driven by differential mechanisms.

Based on a framework that considers the impacts evolving from climate change to labor productivity to economic impact, we estimate the changes in labor productivity for indoor and outdoor activities and different work intensities at the grid level in China under a wide range of climatic and socioeconomic conditions and then evaluate the economic impacts in seven regions and eight sectors. The results show that (a) the negative impacts of labor productivity are concentrated in outdoor sectors, and the labor productivity of indoor sectors will decrease slightly or even increase due to high air-conditioning device penetration rates under relatively optimistic scenarios. (b) The national results show that total economic impacts increase by 0.28%–0.61% of the GDP for each 1°C rise in the temperature, and the total economic impacts of labor productivity reductions in the most pessimistic scenario reach 1.15%–2.67% of the GDP in 2100. (c) The regional results indicate that the regions with lower labor productivity impacts (Northwest and Northeast China) still suffer large economic impacts, highlighting the importance of economic impact assessments across the regions. (b) The sectors in the seven regions of China that are most sensitive to climate change are agriculture and construction. The economic impacts in the manufacturing and service sectors, which contribute 22%–35% and 11%–15% of regional GDP losses, respectively, cannot be ignored, and should receive more attention in climate mitigation policies. © 2021.

To better explain the mechanism behind the decoupling between economic growth and CO2 emissions, this paper extends the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) and production-theoretical decomposition (PDA) considering agricultural decoupling from both structural and technical perspectives. The results reveal that (1) China’s agricultural decoupling performance was not ideal. Investment and investment efficiency were the most important factors influencing the decoupling status. The main decoupling obstacle was a higher investment in productivity rather than in energy conservation and carbon reduction. (2) The decoupling status and investment orientation of decoupling efforts among regions were different. Strong negative decoupling statuses frequently occurred in the eastern region, whose main disadvantage was high potential energy intensity. The decoupling status of the central region exhibited expansive features. The decoupling key is to invest more in energy-saving technology rather than in production. The western region changed from weak decoupling to expansive negative decoupling. Both output technology and energy-related factors should be the main investment targets. (3) Weak decoupling and expansive negative decoupling were the most common statuses among provinces. The influence mechanism of drivers exhibited a high spatial heterogeneity at the provincial level. Therefore, the study offered a convincing basis for local governments to formulate low-carbon agricultural development policies by identifying the main decoupling drivers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural; Carbon emission; Decoupling; LMDI; PDA","agricultural development; agricultural market; agricultural policy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy conservation; industrial investment; potential energy; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; agriculture; China; economic development; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104517133

The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) materials for hydrogen storage technologies has been motivated by their open structures, which facilitates fast hydrogen kinetics. Herein, the hydrogen storage properties of lightweight metal functionalized r57 haeckelite sheets are studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. H2 molecules are adsorbed on pristine r57 via physisorption. The hydrogen storage capacity of r57 is improved by decorating it with alkali and alkaline-earth metals. In addition, the in-plane substitution of r57 carbons with boron atoms (B@r57) both prevents the clustering of metals on the surface of 2D material and increases the hydrogen storage capacity by improving the adsorption thermodynamics of hydrogen molecules. Among the studied compounds, B@r57-Li4, with its 10.0 wt% H2 content and 0.16 eV/H2 hydrogen binding energy, is a promising candidate for hydrogen storage applications. A further investigation, as based on the calculated electron localization functions, atomic charges, and electronic density of states, confirm the electrostatic nature of interactions between the H2 molecules and the protruding metal atoms on 2D haeckelite sheets.

In this context, the Icelandic government plans to ban new registrations of fossil fuel cars after 2030 as one of the strategies to make Iceland a carbon-neutral country by 2040. Upgraded biogas can be directly used in vehicles with CNG engines, reducing CO2 emissions by 80%. In this paper, several alternatives of biogas plants, simulated in previous research, were evaluated by considering techno-economic and environmental criteria through the application of multi-criteria decision-making tools. Twelve alternatives were analyzed using the Definite 3.1 software. A weighted summation algorithm, which transforms all criteria into the same scale by multiplying them by weights and then summing them to obtain the results, was used in the analysis. The multi-criteria analysis of the twelve proposed alternatives included eleven criteria (three technical, five economic, and three environmental) whose weights were changed in a total of eleven scenarios. From a global perspective, when all criteria were considered (9.1% weight) the best alternative with a score of 0.58 was the single-stage biogas plant working with municipal solid waste. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses also demonstrated that the multi-criteria results obtained were robust and reliable. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, performing the improvements at an urban level, for groups of buildings that hold similar significance and preservation status, would ensure the uniformity of intervention works and result in time- and money-saving than treating each building separately. Nevertheless, maintenance and adaptation interventions in historic buildings have a high level of difficulty. Specific protection statuses and considerable constraints for change lead to additional restrictions that need to be maintained. This added complexity, along with the demanding targets of energy efficiency in the building stock, are among the challenges that need to be faced for the present and future generations. The Zero Emission Refurbishment (ZER) method, applied here as an example to a historic block in the city of Trondheim in Norway, shows the reduction potential of the carbon footprint before undergoing large-scale interventions. The method includes legislative conservative requirements and the environmental impact of the actions to select the most adequate intervention measures. It is flexible and comprehensive and can be applied to diverse built environments. The overall carbon footprint of the intervention measures, linked with the operational energy improvement after the completion of the works, serve as an indicator for the estimation of renewable energy generated from the neighbourhood and therefore, for the transition to a low carbon society by developing sustainable historic neighbourhoods with zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. © 2021 The Author(s)","District scale; Framework; Historic buildings; Refurbishment; Zero-emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107858070

We therefore investigated carbon (C) allocation strategies in a widespread non-native woody plant, Tamarix. We predicted that genotypes with exposure to episodic freeze events would show elevated NSC concentrations compared to warm-adapted genotypes with the trade-off of reduced growth and reproduction relative to warm-adapted populations. We established an experimental common garden using genotypes of Tamarix, sourced across a strong thermal gradient within the introduced range. We measured seasonal NSC storage in coarse roots and stems, above-ground growth and flower production. Autumn NSC concentrations were 50% higher in genotypes from sites with episodic spring freeze events compared to genotypes from warmer sites. These cold-adapted genotypes also had a 2.3-fold higher starch to soluble sugar ratio than warm-adapted genotypes. Across all genotypes and seasons, NSC storage was inversely correlated with growth and reproduction. Results suggest that Tamarix from colder locations cope with freeze events by maintaining large storage pools to support tissue regrowth, but with the trade-off of overall reduced growth and reproduction. Our results are consistent with rapid selection in C allocation strategies in response to climate in introduced woody species.

We examine how support varies by policy type and citizen characteristics, focusing on nine climate policies relating to transport, including carbon taxes, financial and non-financial incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), and regulations (for fuels, vehicle emissions, and ZEVs). Citizen response to each policy was collected via a representative sample of Canadian citizens (n = 1552) in a 2019 survey. Support is high for vehicles emissions and low-carbon fuel standards, ZEV subsidies, investment in public charging infrastructure, and education campaigns (64%–77% support). Support is lower for carbon taxes (27%–42%), HOV lane access for ZEVs (49%), and ZEV mandates (48%–57%). Exploratory factor analysis indicates that the nine policies correlate into five policy types: “supply-focused regulations” (vehicle emissions and low-carbon fuel standards), “demand-focused initiatives” (ZEV subsidies, charger deployment, and education campaigns), carbon tax, HOV lane access for ZEVs, and ZEV mandate. Cluster analysis then identifies three groups of respondents, those who are: 1) “Universally Supportive” of the policies (34% of sample), 2) “Supportive Except Carbon Tax” (34%), and 3) “Mostly Opposing” (33%).

By promoting more efficient and complete resource use, mixture effects may also lessen individual-tree-level water stress, thus improving drought resistance. We investigated the influence of mixture effects on tree productivity, mortality and recruitment across broad compositional and moisture gradients in high-elevation Interior West US mixed-conifer communities, where Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) is the major contributor to functional diversity. Our goal was to provide a more complete scientific foundation for managing these drought-prone, fire-excluded systems under an uncertain climate. We used landscape-scale national forest inventory data to examine mixture effects on P. tremuloides and the major associated conifer species, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii. Using generalized linear mixed modelling, we isolated the influences of P. tremuloides relative density and climate on tree-level (stems ≥ 12.7 cm DBH) growth, mortality and stand-level recruitment (presence/absence of new trees). Cold-season precipitation (PPT) and warm-season vapour pressure deficit (VPD) served to represent soil moisture supply and demand, respectively. Populus tremuloides growth declined as interspecific density increased. In contrast, Pinus contorta and A. lasiocarpa growth increased with P. tremuloides density. For all species except A. lasiocarpa and P. menziesii, growth increased under higher PPT and VPD. Populus tremuloides mortality increased under high VPD but not with interspecific relative density. We found limited evidence that A. lasiocarpa mortality decreased as P. tremuloides density increased. Populus tremuloides recruitment declined steeply above 25% interspecific relative density. We found a decline in conifer recruitment odds as P. tremuloides density increased, ranging from strong in P. contorta to insubstantial in P. engelmannii. Synthesis. Our findings have implications for sustaining mixed-conifer communities impacted by climate change and historical fire exclusion. Mixtures of P. tremuloides and conifers may improve conifer growth while adversely impacting P. tremuloides growth relative to pure stands. Higher conifer productivity combined with lower P. tremuloides recruitment at high conifer relative density may accelerate succession. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

Successful Antarctic invasions to date have been recorded exclusively from terrestrial habitats. While non-native marine species such as crabs, mussels and tunicates have already been reported from Antarctic coasts, none have as yet established there. Among the potential marine invaders of Antarctic shallow waters is Halicarcinus planatus (Fabricius, 1775), a crab with a circum-Subantarctic distribution and substantial larval dispersal capacity. An ovigerous female of this species was found in shallow waters of Deception Island, South Shetland Islands in 2010. A combination of physiological experiments and ecological modelling was used to assess the potential niche of H. planatus and estimate its future southward boundaries under climate change scenarios. We show that H. planatus has a minimum thermal limit of 1°C, and that its current distribution (assessed by sampling and niche modelling) is physiologically restricted to the Subantarctic region.

For the historical period, the global carbon budget (GCB) can be compiled from observations and model simulations as is done annually in the Global Carbon Project's (GCP) carbon budgets. However, the historical budget only considers a single realization of the Earth system and cannot account for internal climate variability. Understanding the distribution of internal climate variability is critical for predicting the future carbon budget terms and uncertainties. We present here a decomposition of the GCB for the historical period and the RCP4.5 scenario using single-model large ensemble simulations from the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to capture internal variability. We calculate uncertainty ranges for the natural sinks and anthropogenic emissions that arise from internal climate variability, and by using this distribution, we investigate the likelihood of historical fluxes with respect to plausible climate states. Our results show these likelihoods have substantial fluctuations due to internal variability, which are partially related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We find that the largest internal variability in the MPI-GE stems from the natural land sink and its increasing carbon stocks over time. The allowable fossil fuel emissions consistent with 3 C warming may be between 9 and 18 Pg C yr−1. The MPI-GE is generally consistent with GCP's global budgets with the notable exception of land-use change emissions in recent decades, highlighting that human action is inconsistent with climate mitigation goals. © 2021.

Exposure to damaging frost can be affected by contemporary climatic change, which can include an increase in winter air temperatures, changes in precipitation and changes in the timing and severity of warm and cold events. In this review, we consider the specific adaptations of herbaceous plants to avoid harsh winter conditions via perennating organs, what is known about their responses to warming winters, and what future directions the research of overwintering in herbs should explore. Herbaceous plants have adapted to harsh winter conditions in part by investing carbohydrates into belowground organs of perennation instead of aboveground biomass. The location of renewal buds and stored carbohydrates belowground increases their protection against freezing temperatures, and they can be further protected via insulation from plant litter or snow cover. Climate change can affect overwintering organs by altering snow cover depth and duration, thus increasing or decreasing the exposure of plants to frost, and may initiate an earlier or a later onset of growth in the spring. Winter warming can increase productivity in some species, but directly or indirectly decrease it in others and may lead to a loss of specialized plants, for example, in snowbed communities. Plants with shallow structures and taproots may be particularly vulnerable to increased soil frost penetration resulting from reduced snow cover. Measures of organ biomass and storage carbohydrate content can be used to assess how winter conditions affect allocation, storage, and the potential for growth in the spring. When destructive measures cannot be taken, the use of trait measures, such as perennating organ type, or its traits, such as depth and size of bud bank, can add further strength to the assessment of responses across multiple species. To fully understand the effects of changing winter conditions on perennial herbaceous plants, researchers must better account for plant overwintering strategies, their drivers, costs, and benefits.

The analysis is based on a Bermuda high index (BHI): the difference in standardized, deseasonalized, and detrended sea level pressure (SLP) between northeast of Bermuda (408N, 608W) and New Orleans (308N, 908W). Negative values of BHI indicate a westward expansion of the Bermuda high relative to its climatological-mean location and reduced precipitation in the southeastern United States (SEUS), whereas positive values correspond to BH contraction and enhanced precipitation in the SEUS. Linear regression of the 200-hPa geopotential height based on the BHI reveals the existence of a Rossby wave train that extends zonally from the eastern North Pacific to the eastern North Atlantic. The troughs and ridges associated with this wave train are spatially collocated with the climatological-mean jet stream, indicating that the jet serves as their waveguide. Anomalous troughing in the SEUS associated with this wave train is linked to the contraction of the Bermuda high during JA. The enhanced precipitation is associated with anomalous ascent to the east and south of this trough where anomalous warm advection is observed. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that this Rossby wave train may partially explain the occurrence of suppressed precipitation tied to midsummer drought in the SEUS during July and August. It is found that the BHI has trended from negative to positive in recent decades, suggesting that it may be influenced by low-frequency variability. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

Drought-related plant functional traits can help species withstand filters in a semi-arid environment. Our objective was to provide guidance for selecting species to improve restoration success in a changing climate. We planted 12 native species in ambient rainfall and under 60% rain-out shelters in an invaded coastal grassland in central California. We measured survival and size annually for 4 years and quantified plant community and trait composition in the third and fourth years. We measured growth rate, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf C:N, leaf lobedness and leaf δ13C of all planted species and dominant extant species, and evaluated the effect of treatments, traits and phylogenetics on mortality risk using Cox proportional hazards. Native perennial species cover was greater, whereas thatch depth and per cent cover of shrubs and non-native annual grasses were lower, on drought plots. Drought plots had lower community-weighted leaf C:N and higher leaf lobedness. Planted species with resource conservative traits, such as higher leaf lobedness and lower growth rate, had lower mortality risk. Increased plasticity of morphological traits (SLA and lobedness) was associated with decreased mortality risk, whereas increased plasticity of physiological traits (leaf C:N and δ13C) and risk was positively correlated. Trait plasticity explained a greater degree of plant mortality risk compared to absolute trait values. Plants that were more phylogenetically related to the surrounding plant community had lower mortality risk. Traits of planted species that were important for determining plant mortality in this coastal grassland may be conserved, which was supported by a phylogenetic signal (Blomberg's K = 0.380, Pagel's λ = 0.830) in leaf C:N. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that leaf traits and phylogenetics could serve as plant selection criteria for reducing plant mortality risk during drought, thereby improving restoration outcomes. Because some traits have a phylogenetic signal that explains drought survival, restoration practitioners could expand the use of trait-based selection for closely related species when restoring other arid- and semi-arid ecosystems. ​. © 2021 British Ecological Society","Cox proportional hazard; environmental filter; leaf C:N; leaf lobedness; leaf δ13C; phylogenetic signal; relative distance plasticity index (rdpi); trait plasticity","climate change; coastal zone; community dynamics; extreme event; grassland; leaf area; mortality; phylogenetics; phylogeny; restoration ecology; survival; California; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107358535

A criterion to examine atmospheric drought events that encompassed the summer season (an important part of the growing season) was used to determine which years were driest, using precipitation, evaporation, and areal coverage. The relationship between drought and the character of the atmosphere, using the Dzerzeevsky weather and climatic classification scheme, atmospheric blocking, teleconnections, and information entropy, was used to study the atmospheric dynamics. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) re-analyses dataset archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, CO, USA, is used to examine the synoptic character and calculate the dynamic quantities for these dry events. The results demonstrate that extreme droughts over North America are associated with a long warm and dry period of weather and the development of a moderate ridge over the Central USA driven by surface processes. These were more common in the late 20th century. Extreme droughts over Eastern Europe and Western Russia are driven by the occurrence of prolonged blocking episodes, as well as surface processes, and have become more common during the 21st century. © 2021 by the authors.

The emphasis is on the regional climate policy and the existing biogas technology concepts, within a decentralized energy market located in the Southern part of Zealand. The case analysis will identify how such technology can be utilized as a lever for future “extraction-activities,” as for example protein, wax, and furfural substrates. Within Falster & Lolland Municipalities, it is identified that 800.000 tons of animal manure is readily available for biogas production, just as 880.000 tons and 220.000 tons of unused beet tops and residual cereal straw could be feed to biogas facilities as for example co-silage materials. With a potential gas yield of approximately 897.000 MWh, composed by the crop residues alone, the challenge is how to utilize such resources the most efficient when addressing future needs for bio-products and high value materials and energy. Through the lens of Circular Bio-Economy this article addresses three themes, by which biogas technology can become an “engine” for future bioenergy solutions, where cascading activities and use of side-streams are developed: 1) production of biogas by means of local agricultural residues (beet tops, residual straw, and animal manure), combined with 2) “extraction-activities” as furfural and wax from straw, as well as protein from beet tops. Besides this 3) opportunities for upgrading the biogas and distributing it on a natural gas network, hereby enlarging the supply market for energy services from the biogas plant and facilitating the development of a more “integrated energy system,” currently being promoted by the European Commission.

Owing to the scarcity of observational data, the characteristics and influencing factors of CH4 fluxes in paddy fields at different timescales need to be further investigated. Observations of CH4 fluxes via eddy covariance (EC) data were performed over four seasons in two paddy fields in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China. The pattern, magnitude and biophysical controls of CH4 emissions were explored by wavelet analysis and stepwise multiplicative modelling. The results revealed a distinct, single-peak diurnal pattern in CH4 fluxes during the vegetative stage in all four rice growing seasons and the reproductive stage of early rice. Large seasonal variations in daily CH4 emissions were observed in the two double-cropping paddy fields, and the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm (Ts5 ) explained most of the seasonality of the CH4 fluxes. At the inter-seasonal scale, under local farms’ traditional field management method, reducing the amount and frequency of irrigation during the vegetative stage could decrease CH4 emissions in southern China.

However, its carbon sequestration capacity and rate vary significantly across different climate regions and tree species. Haloxylon ammodendron sand-fixing plantation, a unique ecological shelter forest in desert areas of Asia, has not only the ecological functions of reducing wind speed and controlling soil erosion, but also those of improving soil quality and increasing the carbon storage of the desert ecosystem. To reveal the effect of H.ammodendron plantation on carbon sequestration of the desert ecosystem, 3, 10, 25 and 35 a H.ammodendron plantations were selected in the lower reaches of Shiyang River Basin by using a space-for-time method, and their characteristics, rates, and potential of carbon sequestration in the vegetation succession were studied. The results showed that the biomass and ecosystem carbon storage of the H.ammodendron plantations increased first and then decreased with the afforestation years. The average carbon fixation rates of vegetation and its ecosystem in 10 a were 0.274 and 0.434 kg C/m2·a, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of other three successional stages in desert areas. With the increase in plantation ages of H.ammodendron, the soil organic carbon (SOC) density in topsoil continued to increase. SOC density in 3, 10, 25 and 35 a were 1.03, 1.60, 2.27 and 2.48 kg C/m2, accounting for 71.0%, 36.9%, 71.4% and 76.8% of the carbon density in vegetation-soil ecosystem, respectively. Soil carbon pool was the main part of the carbon pool in ecosystem. The results of carbon benefits project (CBP) estimation show that the total carbon storage of H.ammodendron sand-fixing plantations in Shiyang River Basin is 0.18 Tg C, and the maximum carbon sequestration potential is 0.84 Tg C, and the maximum carbon emission potential is 1.95 Tg C on 0–100 a time scale. On the time scale of 0–100 a, the carbon efficiency of H.ammodendron sand-fixing plantations in Shiyang River Basin showed a rapid growth (0–20 a) - slow decline (25–40 a) - rapid decline (50–100 a). In order to increase the organic carbon storage and maintain the stability of the desert ecosystem, the H.ammodendron sand-fixing plantations should be constructed largely and conserved scientifically in Shiyang River Basin. © 2021","Biomass carbon density; Desert ecosystem; Haloxylon ammodendron; Sequestration rate; Soil organic carbon density",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107051559

The econometric analysis involved the application of the latest methods which can simultaneously account for cross-sectional dependency, slope heterogeneity, and structural break issues in the data. The overall findings revealed that provincial growth and tertiary sector development were responsible for the aggravation of the carbon dioxide emission trends in China. In contrast, higher energy investments, technological innovation, renewable energy use, expenditure on research and development, and carbon emission taxes are found to abate carbon dioxide emissions and, therefore, facilitate the carbon-abatement agenda of China. Besides, the findings also revealed emission taxes, investment in research and development, technological innovation, and renewable energy use jointly reduce carbon dioxide emissions further.

To predict the potential variability in C3/C4 biomass under future warmer climatic conditions, we determined the current spatiotemporal distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation by estimating the variability of δ13Corg values in 125 topsoil samples and investigating the geological period variability of C4 plants growing in Inner Mongolia, China. We examined the factors contributing to the growth of C4 plants and the variability in C4 plants for each 1 °C increase in temperature during recent and geological times. The results revealed that the relative abundance of C4 plants in Inner Mongolia shows an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast. The biomass of C4 plants was found to be positively correlated with temperature, although weakly correlated with precipitation, thereby indicating that temperature is the primary climatic factor determining the growth of C4 plants in this region. Furthermore, we found that in response to each 1 °C increase in temperature, there would be an approximate 2.1% increase in the spatiotemporal variation of present-day C4 plant biomass in Inner Mongolia, whereas during the geological period, there was a corresponding increase of 10.7%. Comparatively, the spatiotemporal variation in present-day C4 biomass on the Chinese Loess Plateau has undergone a 4.0% increase in response to each 1 °C increase in temperature, whereas 6.0% and 7.5% increases in the geological period were estimated based on core samples taken from the Lantian and Xingyang sections, respectively. Interestingly, for each 1 °C increase in temperature during the current growth month of C4 plants, there is a 6.6% increase in C4 biomass, which is essentially consistent with the results obtained for the geological period results (i.e., 6.0% and 7.5% for the Lantian and Xingyang sections, respectively). The findings of this study reveal a distinct contrast in the variation of C4 plants during recent and geological periods, thereby enabling us to quantitatively estimate the potential changes in C4 vegetation in response to projected climate conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","C4 plant; Chinese loess plateau; Climate change; Inner Mongolia; Organic carbon isotope","biomass; carbon isotope; climate variation; growth response; late glacial; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; vegetation; China; Loess Plateau; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103111784

It has been argued that climate mitigation policies can, if well-designed in response to contextual factors, also achieve environmental, economic, and social progress, but otherwise pose risks to economic inequity generally and health inequity specifically. Decisions around such policies are hampered by data gaps, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and among vulnerable populations in high-income countries (HICs). The rise of “big data” offers the potential to address some of these gaps. This scoping review sought to explore the literature linking energy, big data, health, and decision-making. Literature searches in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were conducted. English language articles up to April 1, 2020, were included. Pre-agreed study characteristics including geographic location, data collected, and study design were extracted and presented descriptively, and a qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the articles using NVivo. Thirty-nine articles fulfilled eligibility criteria. These included a combination of review articles and research articles using primary or secondary data sources. The articles described health and economic effects of a wide range of energy types and uses, and attempted to model effects of a range of technological and policy innovations, in a variety of geographic contexts. Key themes identified in our analysis included the link between energy consumption and economic development, the role of inequality in understanding and predicting harms and benefits associated with energy production and use, the lack of available data on LMICs in general, and on the local contexts within them in particular. Examples of using “big data,” and areas in which the articles themselves described challenges with data limitations, were identified. The findings of this scoping review demonstrate the challenges decision-makers face in achieving energy efficiency gains and reducing emissions, while avoiding the exacerbation of existing inequities. Understanding how to maximize gains in energy efficiency and uptake of new technologies requires a deeper understanding of how work and life is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities between and within countries. This is particularly the case for LMICs and in local contexts where few data are currently available, and for whom existing evidence may not be directly applicable. Big data approaches may offer some value in tracking the uptake of new approaches, provide greater data granularity, and help compensate for evidence gaps in low resource settings. © 2021, The New York Academy of Medicine.","Data; Energy; Global health; Inequity; Policy; Public health","article; big data; decision making; economic development; eligibility criteria; Embase; energy consumption; energy yield; English (language); global health; human; human experiment; Medline; middle income country; public health; systematic review; thematic analysis; Web of Science; income; poverty; Humans; Income; Poverty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112029139

The transport sector is responsible for a large share of energy consumption and GHGs emissions while contributing to the increase in air pollution. Although new technologies are available, the use of diesel in road transport is still predominant. These new technologies, nonetheless, still present inconsistencies in their environment, economic performances and do not necessarily provide improvements when considering the entire fuel life cycle used in medium and heavy-duty trucks. This systematic review addresses the uncertainties in life cycle studies regarding the road transport sector fuel consumption, GHGs, and air pollutant emissions economic analyses. Results show that there are higher chances of reducing GHGs emissions through biogas or fuel-cell hydrogen trucks, while PM2.5 and NOx emissions have higher chances of being reduced with fuel-cell hydrogen or natural gas trucks. There is, however, a reduced interest by the scientific community in the transport literature in dealing with air pollutants, and the focus is mainly on GHGs emissions. When it comes to economic viability, natural gas and hybrid trucks are the best substitutes.

In the present study, 32-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were subjected to 37 °C environmental temperature combined with 50% relative humidity for 4 or 8 h respectively. Following sampling, redox parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl levels as well as glutathione peroxidase activity were assessed in liver, spleen, and kidney homogenates. The concentrations of small heat shock proteins (sHSP-s) HSP27, αA- and αB-crystallins were also investigated. Among these organs, the liver was found the most susceptible to heat-provoked oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced lipid peroxidation and rapid activation of protective pathways, including the definite increase of glutathione peroxidase activity and the excessive utilization of αA- and αB-crystallin proteins. Heat-associated decline of protein carbonylation and GSH content was observed in the liver in correlation with the increased involvement of αA- and αB-crystallins in cellular defense, resulting supposedly in an overcompensation mechanism. These data highlight the hepatic sensitivity to acute heat shock, potential adaptation mechanisms, and the specific role of sHSP-s in the restoration of physiologic cell function. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Glutathione; Heat shock; HSP27; Lipid peroxidation; Oxidative stress; α-crystallins","alpha crystallin; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; malonaldehyde; small heat shock protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cell regeneration; cellular immunity; chicken; controlled study; correlational study; environmental temperature; enzyme activity; evolutionary adaptation; heat stress; humidity; kidney homogenate; lipid peroxidation; liver homogenate; male; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; protein carbonylation; protein content; signal transduction; spleen tissue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109074396

The analysis of pollution sources and the evaluation of possible scenarios are preliminary to the mitigation of impacts. In particular, the study of geometrical and functional characteristics of infrastructures through micro-simulation allows understanding of which schemes can support the reduction of emissions and guarantee high levels of service (LOS), reducing the problem of vehicular congestion in urban areas. The present work focuses on the small-scale analysis of vehicular traffic emissions at a multi-lane roundabout road intersection and the comparison of geometric schemes (current and design) and use with a turbo roundabout scheme as traffic volumes changes. These volumes have plummeted due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the geometric-functional modification of the roundabout intersection from a multi-lane to a turboroundabout intersection allows a reduction of up to 30% of the emissions considering the current composition of the traffic fleet in the city of Rzeszow in Poland. The proposed comparative analysis methodology can contribute to the drafting of sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) proposing a set of investments for new road works and considering a number of scenarios with interventions that can be implemented in the medium and long term that can provide the incentive to reduce road congestion and vehicular emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

To answer these, the article draws on the concept of climatization, which captures the process through which domains of international politics are framed through a climate lens and transformed as a result of this translation. It suggests that climate change has become a dominant framing and an inescapable topic of international relations and that the UNSC debates follow a logic of expansion of climate politics by securing a steady climate agenda, attributing responsibility to the Council in the climate crisis, involving climate actors and advocating for climate-oriented policies to maintain international security. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Climatization; International organizations; Securitization; Security Council; United Nations","climate change; environmental management; environmental policy; international organization; international relations; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100550351

However, in this study coupled scales were adopted to get more effective thermal adaptation guidelines; urban form planning (cluster scale), and geometrical details (canyon scale). The study investigates five urban forms and 18 urban geometry scenarios to quantify their thermal impacts on outdoor spaces. All scenarios were evaluated according to the differences in geometrical variables, with data introduced based on on-site measurements and microclimate simulations using ENVI-met software. The results are ranked according to its influence on pedestrian thermal comfort.

To ensure the sustainability of pavements against temperature rise, a county-level methodology based on machine-learning algorithms was developed. To show the applicability of the framework, the Isfahan County was studied. The county's climate was found to change from cold-semi-desert to relatively-warm-semi-desert in future decades. Then, optimal maintenance policies before and after climate change were identified. It was concluded that optimal policies of arterial roads before and after climate change were more intense than those of local roads. Furthermore, optimal policies after climate change were more intense than those before climate change at additional costs of 1379.57 MR/KM and 632.49 MR/KM respectively for arterial and local roads. The same methodology could be applied to sustainably adapt asphalt pavements of other counties. To validate the research, a questionnaire survey of pavement management and climate change experts was done. The experts confirmed that the methodology facilitates achieving sustainable development goals #9, #11, and #13 by improving maintenance budget allocation, enhancing policy-makers communication with authorities, maintaining adequate technical and end-user levels of service, and adapting pavements to climate change through cost-effective and performance-effective maintenance policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Machine-Learning; Markov Chain Model; Sustainable Pavement Maintenance; Temperature Rise","Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Budget control; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Learning algorithms; Maintenance; Markov processes; Planning; Surveys; Sustainable development; County level; Isfahan; Machine-learning; Maintenance policy; Markov chain models; On-machines; Optimal policies; Pavement maintenance; Sustainable pavement maintenance; Temperature rise; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104967813

Understanding land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, as well as the associated impacts on the multiple ecosystem service value (ESV), is extremely important in decision-making processes and effective implementation of an ecosystem-based management approach. This study analyzed the LULC dynamics from 1989 to 2019. The primary objective of the study was to assess its impact on ecosystem services (ES). The ESV was determined using LULC analysis and established global ESV coefficient. The LULC analysis showed a reduction in forest cover by 84.73% during the study period. Built-up, cultivated land, bare land, shrubs, and grassland increased considerably. Rapid population growth, climate change, government policy conflicts, and poverty were identified as the most important drivers of LULC dynamics. Based on ESVs estimations, the ES changes instigated by LULC dynamics in the study area result in an average loss of US$45.58 million during the study period. Within the same period, the lake fishery also recorded a net loss of US$8.63 million. The highest net loss of US$79.832 million was recorded from 1999 to 2019 due to increased loss of forest, a decrease in water bodies and marsh areas. The sensitivity analysis (CS) indicated that our estimates were relatively robust. This study findings provide a piece of empirical evidence that LULC dynamics in the Lake Malombe catchment have led to a significant loss of ESVs, with serious implications for the livelihoods of the local population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ecosystem service value; Lake Malombe; Land use/land cover change; Malawi; Riparian communities","Climate change; Decision making; Dynamics; Forestry; Lakes; Land use; Population statistics; Sensitivity analysis; Decision making process; Ecosystem service values; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based management; Land use and land cover; Land use/land cover; Primary objective; Rapid population growth; Ecosystems; climate change; ecosystem service; land cover; land use change; riparian vegetation; sensitivity analysis; East African Lakes; Lake Malombe; Malawi; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; lake; Malawi; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Lakes; Malawi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110361408

Six cattle and six buffaloes were fed on a similar diet comprising Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) green grass and concentrate in 70:30. After 90 days of feeding, the daily enteric methane emissions were quantified by using the SF6 technique and ruminal fluid samples from animals were collected for the diversity analysis. The daily enteric methane emissions were significantly greater in cattle as compared to buffaloes; however, methane yields were not different between the two species. Methanogens were ranked at different taxonomic levels against the Rumen and Intestinal Methanogen-Database. The archaeal communities in both host species were dominated by the phylum Euryarchaeota; however, Crenarchaeota represented <1% of the total archaea. Methanogens affiliated with Methanobacteriales were most prominent and their proportion did not differ between the two hosts. Methanomicrobiales and Methanomassillicoccales constituted the second largest group of methanogens in cattle and buffaloes, respectively. Methanocellales (Methanocella arvoryza) were exclusively detected in the buffaloes. At the species level, Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii had the highest abundance (55-57%) in both the host species. The relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter wolinii between the two hosts differed significantly. Methanosarcinales, the acetoclastic methanogens were significantly greater in cattle than the buffaloes. It is concluded that the ruminal methane yield in cattle and buffaloes fed on the same diet did not differ. With the diet used in this study, there was a limited influence (<3.5%) of the host on the structure of the ruminal archaea community at the species level. Therefore, the methane mitigation strategies developed in either of the hosts should be effective in the other. Further studies are warranted to reveal the conjunctive effect of diet and geographical locations with the host on ruminal archaea community composition. © 2021 Malik et al.

There are different systems available to measure methane from animals, but they are expensive, not easily accessible, and not suitable for large-scale methane measurements on the farm. Therefore exploring indicator traits, which are easy to measure, cost-effective, and suitable for large-scale measurement, are recommended. The objectives of this study were to examine the diversity of fecal methanogen profile among efficient and inefficient beef heifers on pasture and investigate methanogen profile as a possible proxy to predict methane emission in beef cattle consuming a forage diet. Forty pregnant (1st trimester) heifers previously classified for postweaning residual feed intake adjusted for off-test back fat (RFIfat; 20 high and 20 low) were included in this study. To determine individual pasture grazing intake, heifers were dosed with 1 kg of C32 labeled pellets once per day from Day 0 to Day 12, and fecal samples were collected twice daily from Day 8 to Day 15. Fecal samples from Days 8, 10, and 12 were analyzed for their methanogen profile. Animals were monitored individually for methane and carbon dioxide production using a GreenFeed Emissions Monitoring system. Total methanogen population and methanogenic community diversity of fecal samples were not different (P &gt; 0.1) between low and high RFIfat groups, as measured by quantitative PCR and α- and β-diversity indices. However, both groups had a different methanogen profile; the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter wolinii and relatives were higher (P &lt; 0.002), while that of Methanosphaera species ISO3-F5 was lower (P &lt; 0.01) in low RFIfat cattle compared to the high RFIfat group. We also demonstrated that fecal methanogen profiles may be a useful proxy in predicting daily methane and carbon dioxide emissions with an adjusted R2 of 0.53 and 0.33, respectively, for low RFIfat heifers and 0.46 and 0.57, respectively, for the high RFIfat group. © 2021","Cattle; Feed efficiency; Greenhouse Gas; Pasture; Proxy","methane; animal; animal food; bovine; diet; eating; feces; female; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Eating; Feces; Female; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109441698

This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical speciation and source apportionment of PM2.5 to assess the impact of the lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM2.5 in Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM2.5 were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of organic and elemental fractions of PM2.5 during the different phases of the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O3 concentrations with declining NOx levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe, leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air. These results have direct relevance to not only Delhi but the entire Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), citing similar geographical and meteorological conditions common to the region along with overlapping regional emission sources. Summary of main findings: We identify sources like vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) to be severely impacted by the lockdown, whereas ozone levels and, in turn, low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) rise by more than 95% compared to the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. However, other sources resolved in this study, like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, were mainly driven by the changes in the meteorological conditions rather than the lockdown. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; COVID-19 lockdown; Delhi; Elemental and organic fractions; PM2.5; Source apportionment","Air quality; Chemical speciation; Chlorine compounds; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal dust; Emission control; Factorization; Anthropogenic activity; COVID-19 lockdown; Delhi; Elemental and organic fraction; Meteorological condition; Organic aerosol; Oxygenated organics; PM$-2.5$; Pm2.5; Source apportionment; Aerosols; black carbon; chloride; coal; organic carbon; ozone; aerosol composition; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; chemical composition; COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; emission inventory; particulate matter; point source; pollution control; pollution monitoring; source apportionment; aerosol; air quality; ambient air; Article; biomass; chemical composition; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; electric power plant; environmental impact; hydrocarbon like organic aerosol; India; lockdown; low volatility oxygenated organic aerosol; particulate matter 2.5; pollutant; priority journal; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; air pollutant; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; particulate matter; season; Delhi; India; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103753559

To assess the contributions of rice-based cropping in lowland coastal ecosystems to environmental change, energy budgets, CF, exchange of CO2 and fluxes of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) were determined for an array of conservation tillage practices under rice-rice (RR) and rice-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) (RC) systems as main plot treatments, tillage intensity [zero tillage (ZT), reduced tillage (RT), conventional tillage (CT)] as sub-plot treatments, and residue (R) or no residue (NR) as sub-sub plot treatments. The energy use was calculated operation-wise and RT was recorded to be most efficient in terms of energy utilization. Rice-based cropping system enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) at the rate of 0.22 to 0.69, and 0.09 to 0.45 Mg ha−1yr−1 in rice-rice and rice-cotton systems, respectively, with the exception of RC-ZTNR which depleted SOC by 0.11 Mg ha−1yr−1. Static chamber-gas chromatography-based methodology along with biometric data collection was used for the carbon and GHG budgeting. The evaluation of net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB, based on net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and non-CO2 carbon via crop harvest, CH4-C, C inputs to soils and C loss through runoff), and GHG budget (GHGB, adding CH4 and N2O fluxes, and emissions from inputs used to the NECB on CO2 equivalent basis) showed that the rice-based cropping systems in lowland coastal ecologies functioned as carbon sinks (NECB:1523 and 944 Kg C ha−1yr−1 in rice-rice and rice-cotton system, respectively) but GHG source except under reduced tillage with residue (RTR) management which was a GHG sink (−68 to −228 Kg CO2-eq ha−1yr−1). The treatment RTR also recorded the least CF, and highest ecosystem service values of climate regulation among all tillage practices. © 2021","Carbon sequestration; Conservation tillage; Cropping system; Ecosystem service; Energy use efficiency; NECB; Sundarbans","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forestry; Gas chromatography; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Carbon sequestration; Conservation tillage; Cropping systems; Ecosystem services; Energy-use efficiency; Greenhouses gas; NECB; Net ecosystem exchange; Reduced tillage; Sundarbans; Greenhouse gases; carbon footprint; conservation tillage; cotton; energy budget; energy use; farming system; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; lowland environment; net ecosystem exchange; rice; soil organic matter; Gossypium hirsutum; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107786302

In this study, novel hybrid non-stoichiometric nanocomposite Co3S4/Co0.85Se electrocatalyst materials were synthesized using a simple and one-pot eco-friendly hydrothermal method. The as-prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) for structural features. Crystalline phases of Co3S4, Co0.85Se, and mixed phases in the hybrid samples were confirmed through XRD. Uniformly distributed agglomerated nanoparticles (30-80 nm) of Co3S4, clearly distinguishable nanoaggregates (20-90 nm) of Co0.85Se, and nanoflakes covered with nanoparticles (30-150 nm) of Co3S4/Co0.85Se were confirmed by FESEM. The synergistic effects of the hybrid nanocomposite due to the combination of Co3S4 (containing two different oxidation states of cobalt) and non-stoichiometric Co0.85Se, was investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic studies confirmed that the Co3S4/Co0.85Se electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 362 mV @ +30 mA.cm−2 towards the OER in an alkaline solution in comparison with Co3S4 and Co0.85Se electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a low overpotential of 1.59 V at a high current density and a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 210 cm2 was achieved due to the combined effects of chemical coupling between the Co3S4 and Co0.85Se. Chronoamperometric studies revealed excellent stability of the hybrid nanocomposite samples with negligible changes in the overpotential, even after 30 hours of testing. The synergetic effect of cobalt chalcogenides due to the nanoscale interaction was confirmed by the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. © 2021","Cobalt selenide; Cobalt sulfide; Electrocatalyst; OER; Water splitting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105491475

This invasion problem is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), high ambient temperatures, heatwaves, and droughts will facilitate the establishment, range expansion, and interference potential of this invasive species while making its management more difficult. Here, for the first time, we review the potential impact of climate change elements on parthenium weed biology and management at regional and global levels. We establish that (1) parthenium weed plants morphologically and physiologically adapt to sustain or promote their growth, fecundity, competitive ability, and allelopathic effect under most climate change scenarios; (2) climate change elements can reduce the relative vigor of neighboring plants, especially C4 grasses, in competition with parthenium weed, providing this invasive species a competitive edge; (3) elevated [CO2] has the most pronounced positive effect on parthenium weed performance compared to other climate change elements; (4) the efficacy of a widely used herbicide, glyphosate, may be reduced on parthenium weed grown under elevated [CO2]; (5) mixed effects have been reported for biological control agents, with some losing ground, while others are maintaining or improving their efficacy; and (6) a greater risk of spread and range expansion under sustained climate change will pose greater challenges for management in natural and managed ecosystems. There has been a disturbing transition of this weed from noncropped landscapes to agroecosystems in response to recent climatic and land use changes. All evidence presented in this review suggests that the situation will be greatly aggravated if drastic management interventions are not implemented. Therefore, the research, policy, and outreach focus must be revisited and revamped considering the impacts of climate change to develop pragmatic solutions to combat this “superweed”. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Agroecosystem; Biological control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Invasive plant; Parthenium weed; Weed management","adaptation; biological control; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem management; invasive species; literature review; range expansion; weed; Parthenium; Parthenium hysterophorus; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108913986

Callas 4, Bologna, 40131, Italy","Many researchers in industry and academia are showing an increasing interest in the definition of fuel surrogates for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation applications. This need is mainly driven by the necessity of the engine research community to anticipate the effects of new gasoline formulations and combustion modes (e.g., Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition, Spark Assisted Compression Ignition) to meet future emission regulations. Since those solutions strongly rely on the tailored mixture distribution, the simulation and accurate prediction of the mixture formation will be mandatory. Focusing purely on the definition of surrogates to emulate liquid phase and liquid-vapor equilibrium of gasolines, the following target properties are considered in this work: density, Reid vapor pressure, chemical macro-composition and volatility. A set of robust algorithms has been developed for the prediction of volatility and Reid vapor pressure. A Bayesian optimization algorithm based on a customized merit function has been developed to allow for the efficient definition of surrogate formulations from a palette of 15 pure compounds. The developed methodology has been applied on different real gasolines from literature in order to identify their optima surrogates. Furthermore, the ‘unicity’ of the surrogate composition is discussed by comparing the optimum solution with the most different one available in the pool of equivalent-valuable solutions. The proposed methodology has proven the potential to formulate surrogates characterized by an overall good agreement with the target properties of the experimental gasolines (max relative error below 10%, average relative error around 3%). In particular, the shape and the end-tails of the distillation curve are well captured. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of key chemical macro-components such as ethanol and aromatics and their influence on evaporative behavior is achieved. The study of the ‘unicity’ of the surrogate composition has revealed that (i) the unicity is strongly correlated with the accuracy and that (ii) both ‘unicity’ and accuracy of the prediction are very sensitive to the high presence of aromatics. © 2021 by the authors.

The restrictions on working activities, journeys and relationships imposed by the lockdown have had important consequences, including for environmental quality. This review aims to provide a structured and critical evaluation of the recent scientific bibliography that analyzed and described the impact of lockdown on human activities and on air quality. The results indicate an important effect of the lockdown during the first few months of 2020 on air pollution levels, compared to previous periods. The concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide have decreased. Tropospheric ozone, on the other hand, has significantly increased. These results are important indicators that can become decision drivers for future policies and strategies in industrial and logistics activities (including the mobility sector) aimed at their environmental sustainability. The scenario imposed by COVID-19 has supported the understanding of the link between the reduction of polluting emissions and the state of air quality and will be able to support strategic choices for the future sustainable growth of the industrial and logistics sector. © 2021 The Authors.

For decades, claims of mistrust and distrust have dominated climate change policy arenas: doubts about climate change science and disagreements over rights and responsibilities related to mitigation, adaptation, loss, and damages undermine trust, impeding progress toward effective global climate action. And although frequently invoked in explanations of weak or failed climate action, there is limited research exploring the role of trust as a distinct concept in global climate governance. Here we seek to address this gap by developing a relational framework that focuses attention on how trust dynamics shape cooperation in four types of relationships: reliance, reciprocity, responsibility, and recognition. Applying this framework to the UNFCCC, we consider how efforts like expanded participation impact the relational landscape in global climate governance. We focus in particular on Indigenous Peoples and non-state actors to demonstrate how the UNFCCC's efforts to address its legitimacy and credibility problems have neither adequately considered trust nor created opportunities to develop the transformative relationships needed for more effective climate governance. We suggest that greater attention to trust can help scholars and practitioners better understand how relational phenomena shape the landscape of governance possibilities.

This study aimed to justify the possibility of using vegetable oils of different sources as a 10% additive in blended biofuel for diesel engines of agricultural machinery and commercial vehicles. Seven different vegetable oils were investigated. Experiments have been performed by fueling a diesel engine with blended biofuels of 90% petroleum diesel fuel and 10% vegetable oil. In the maximum power and maximum torque modes, the brake power drop was no more than 1.5%, and the brake-specific fuel consumption increase was less than 4.3%; NOx emissions were reduced by up to 8.3%, exhaust smoke—up to 37.5%, CO—up to 20.0%, and unburned HC—up to 27.9%. In the operating modes of the European 13-mode steady-state test cycle, the integral specific emissions of HC decreased by up to 30.0%, integral specific emissions of CO—up to 15.0%, and integral specific emissions of NOx—up to 16.0%.

The United Nations (UN), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have emphasized the impact of urban structures on microclimatic. A better understanding of these effects is important to formulate effective strategies that would contribute to address the impacts of increased urban growth. Here we address a case study of the Vila Rodrigues neighborhood, located in Passo Fundo City in southern Brazil to analyze the variations of emissivity, temperature and vegetation of the terrestrial surface, with influence of buildings. We employ Landsat satellite images, and unpublished data provided by the NASA, interpolated and classified in the QGIS software, using Bands 4, 5 and 10, converted to Gray Level (NC). This procedure allowed the spectral radiance of the reflectance temperature to be obtained. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used, with correction of emissivity and spectral error, in the identification of the surface temperature of different areas in the Villa Rodrigues. The results showed a total variation of 3.86ºC among the sampled points, which is increased by the difference in significance of the thermal balance in urban areas under open sky with buildings. We suggest that green areas and parks with abundant vegetative cover and the application of new building materials in future constructions would help to improve the urban climate, and such regulation of the local temperature on global scale is an effective step towards addressing the adverse effects from climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Air Temperature; Engineering; Global environment; Microclimate; Remote Sensing","Climate change; Electromagnetic wave emission; Land surface temperature; NASA; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban growth; Vegetation; Air temperature; Global environment; Land surface temperature; Microclimate; National aeronautic and space administrations; Remote-sensing; Surface vegetation; Temperature index; Urban areas; Vegetation index; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108097680

Namely, the added resistance in waves causes an increase in fuel consumption and the emission of harmful gases in order for the ship to maintain the design speed, especially in more severe sea states. For this reason, it is very important to estimate the added resistance in waves with sufficient accuracy in the preliminary design phase. In this paper, the possibility of applying an ANN to evaluate added resistance in waves at the different sea states that the ship will encounter during navigation is investigated. A numerical model, based on the results of hydrodynamic calculations in head waves, and ANN is developed. The model can estimate the added resistance of container ships with sufficient accuracy, based on the ship characteristics, sailing speed, and the sea state using two wave energy spectra. © 2021 by the authors.

These lake emissions are regulated by methanotrophs which can oxidize up to 99% of the methane produced in the sediments and the water column. Despite their importance, the diversity and distribution of the methanotrophs in lakes are still poorly understood. Here, we used shotgun metagenomic data to explore the diversity and distribution of methanotrophs in 40 oxygen-stratified water bodies in boreal and subarctic areas in Europe and North America. In our data, gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs (order Methylococcales) generally dominated the methanotrophic communities throughout the water columns. A recently discovered lineage of Methylococcales, Candidatus Methylumidiphilus, was present in all the studied water bodies and dominated the methanotrophic community in lakes with a high relative abundance of methanotrophs. Alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs were the second most abundant group of methanotrophs. In the top layer of the lakes, characterized by low CH4 concentration, their abundance could surpass that of the gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. These results support the theory that the alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs have a high affinity for CH4 and can be considered stress-tolerant strategists. In contrast, the gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are competitive strategists. In addition, relative abundances of anaerobic methanotrophs, Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae and Candidatus Methylomirabilis, were strongly correlated, suggesting possible co-metabolism. Our data also suggest that these anaerobic methanotrophs could be active even in the oxic layers. In non-metric multidimensional scaling, alpha- and gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs formed separate clusters based on their abundances in the samples, except for the gammaproteobacterial Candidatus Methylumidiphilus, which was separated from these two clusters. This may reflect similarities in the niche and environmental requirements of the different genera within alpha- and gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. Our study confirms the importance of O2 and CH4 in shaping the methanotrophic communities and suggests that one variable cannot explain the diversity and distribution of the methanotrophs across lakes. Instead, we suggest that the diversity and distribution of freshwater methanotrophs are regulated by lake-specific factors. © Copyright © 2021 Martin, Rissanen, Garcia, Mehrshad, Buck and Peura.","greenhouse gas; lakes; metagenomics; methanotroph; microbial diversity; thaw ponds","nitrogen; oxygen; RNA 16S; aquatic environment; Article; Candidatus methylumidiphilus; environmental parameters; Gammaproteobacteria; greenhouse gas; metagenomics; methanotroph; Methylococcales; Methylomonas; microbial community; microbial diversity; multidimensional scaling; nonhuman; photosynthesis; seasonal variation; water aerobics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113726185

The mechanism by which soot nanoparticles form within hydrocarbon flames is still an unsolved problem in combustion science. Mechanisms proposed to date involving purely chemical growth are limited by slow reaction rates, whereas mechanisms relying on solely physical interactions between molecules are limited by weak intermolecular interactions that are unstable at flame temperatures. Here, we show evidence for a reactive π-diradical aromatic soot precursor imaged using non-contact atomic force microscopy. Localization of π-electrons on non-hexagonal rings was found to allow for Kekulé aromatic soot precursors to possess a triplet diradical ground state. Barrierless chain reactions are shown between these reactive sites, which provide thermally stable aromatic rim-linked hydrocarbons under flame conditions. Quantum molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate physical condensation of aromatics that survive for tens of picoseconds. Bound internal rotors then enable the reactive sites to find each other and become chemically cross-linked before dissociation. These species provide a rapid, thermally stable chain reaction toward soot nanoparticle formation and could provide molecular targets for limiting the emission of these toxic combustion products. © 2021 The Authors.

However, CO2 fertilization responses in field conditions have seldom included methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), particularly in natural and mature forests, which are expected to have an important role in climate change mitigation. Herein, we aimed to capture the effect of elevated CO2 (eCO2; ambient vs. +150 ppm) on long-term temporal dynamics of CH4 and N2O fluxes, followed by identification of climo-edaphic factors explaining feedback responses. To achieve this, continuous monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes using a manual chamber technique, over a 3-year period was implemented in a mature dryland Eucalypt forest FACE (EucFACE) facility in Australia. The relationship between CH4 and N2O fluxes with rainfall indices and soil properties was also explored since they directly impact the microbial communities in the soil responsible for CH4 and N2O net emissions. Our results showed that in 3 years of eCO2 treatment, the amount and frequency of rainfall predicted GHG emissions in this native forest. We also found a significant reduction in CH4 sink (15%–25%) for some of the years as well as an overall treatment effect index reduction in N2O emissions under eCO2. Higher frequency of rain events with lower intensity led to highest CH4 sink followed by lowest N2O emissions due to fewer wet–dry cycles. Of all the environmental variables included, soil moisture, rainfall and pH were the main predictors of net CH4 and N2O emissions. Methane flux was also strongly influenced by soil texture. Our findings highlight the need to account for reduced forest CH4 sink under eCO2 in dryland ecosystems, which has implications for GHG budget predictions under future climate conditions.

However, tree detection in cities is challenging, given the irregular shape, size, occlusion, and complexity of urban areas. With the advance of environmental technologies, deep learning segmentation mapping methods can map urban forests accurately. We applied a region-based CNN object instance segmentation algorithm for the semantic segmentation of tree canopies in urban environments based on aerial RGB imagery. To the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the performance of deep learning-based methods for segmentation tasks inside the Cerrado biome, specifically for urban tree segmentation. Five state-of-the-art architectures were evaluated, namely: Fully Convolutional Network; U-Net; SegNet; Dynamic Dilated Convolution Network and DeepLabV3+. The experimental analysis showed the effectiveness of these methods reporting results such as pixel accuracy of 96,35%, an average accuracy of 91.25%, F1-score of 91.40%, Kappa of 82.80% and IoU of 73.89%. We also determined the inference time needed per area, and the deep learning methods investigated after the training proved to be suitable to solve this task, providing fast and effective solutions with inference time varying from 0.042 to 0.153 minutes per hectare. We conclude that the semantic segmentation of trees inside urban environments is highly achievable with deep neural networks. This information could be of high importance to decision-making and may contribute to the management of urban systems. It should be also important to mention that the dataset used in this work is available on our website. © 2021 by the authors.

The FDP from Escherichia coli, which, apart from the two core domains, possesses a rubredoxin-like domain at the C-terminus (therefore named flavorubredoxin (FlRd)), is a bona fide NO reductase, exhibiting O2 reducing activity that is approximately ten times lower than that for NO. Among the flavorubredoxins, there is a strictly conserved amino acids motif,-G[S,T]SYN-, close to the catalytic diiron center. To assess its role in FlRd’s activity, we designed several site-directed mutants, replacing the conserved residues with hydrophobic or anionic ones. The mutants, which maintained the general characteristics of the wild type enzyme, including cofactor content and integrity of the diiron center, revealed a decrease of their oxygen reductase activity, while the NO reductase activity—specifically, its physiological function—was almost completely abolished in some of the mutants. Molecular modeling of the mutant proteins pointed to subtle changes in the predicted structures that resulted in the reduction of the hydration of the regions around the conserved residues, as well as in the elimination of hydrogen bonds, which may affect proton transfer and/or product release. © 2021 by the authors.

Crack surface rubbing of WECs transforms the original bainitic/martensitic microstructure into white etching areas (WEAs), comprised of nanocrystalline ferrite. The grain size and carbon content vary within the WEA. Here, we show by atom probe tomography and scanning electron microscopy, that there is an inversely proportional relationship between grain size and carbon content in WEAs formed in 100Cr6 bearings that failed by WECs in service. We explain this phenomenon by the reduction of grain boundary energy through carbon segregation. Depending on the carbon content, this reduces the driving force for recrystallization and grain coarsening, thereby stabilizing the nanocrystalline microstructure. No such effect is observed for the substitutional element chromium. The smallest grain size (< 10 nm) is found directly next to decomposing cementite precipitates, which act as carbon sources, leading to carbon contents as high as ~9.5 at% in ferrite. Correspondingly, the WEA segments with the lowest carbon contents exhibit the largest grain sizes. Increasing carbon contents in sub regions of WEAs do not only lead to smaller grain sizes but also to higher average carbon contents at the grain boundaries as well as in the grain interior. Our results show that the mechanisms of ferrite microstructure stabilization through carbon grain boundary segregation shown in model experiments are also valid for the microstructure alterations associated with WEC failure occurring in practical bearing applications of the technical alloy 100Cr6. © 2021","Atom probe tomography; Bearing steel; Grain boundary segregation; Nanocrystalline materials; White etching cracks","Carbides; Coarsening; Cracks; Etching; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Nanocrystals; Scanning electron microscopy; Segregation (metallography); Atom probe tomography; Cementite precipitates; Grain boundary segregation; Microstructure alteration; Nanocrystalline ferrites; Nanocrystalline microstructures; Proportional relationships; Rolling contact fatigue; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108412354

Water for irrigation and low soil fertility are among the main challenges. One way to decrease water consumption in paddy fields is to change the irrigation regime for rice production, replacing continuous flooding with alternate wetting and drying. In order to assess the impact of different irrigation regimes and nitrogen fertilizer applications on growth, yield, and water productivity of rice, a greenhouse pot experiment with soil from lowland rice ecology was conducted at Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania during the 2019 cropping season. The experiment was split-plot based on randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and 3 replications. Water regimes were the main factors comparing continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) with nitrogen fertilizer levels as the subfactor, comparing absolute control (no fertilizer) with 0 (P and K fertilizers), 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg Nha−1 . Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) significantly improved water productivity by 8.3% over CF (p &lt; 0.05). Water productivity (WP) ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 kg of rice per m3 of water. Average water use ranged from 36 to 82 L per season, and water saving was up to 34.3%. Alternate wetting and drying significantly improved yields (p &lt; 0.05) by 13.3%, and the yield ranged from 21.8 to 118.2 g pot−1 . The combination of AWD water management and 60 kg N ha−1 nitrogen fertilization application was found to be the optimal management, however there was no significant difference between 60 and 90 kg N ha−1, in which case 60 kg N ha−1 is recommended because it lowers costs and raises net income. Nitrogen levels significantly affected water productivity, water use, and number of irrigations. Nitrogen levels had significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on plant height, number of tillers, flag leaf area, chlorophyll content, total tillers, number of productive tillers, panicle weight, panicle length, 1000-grain weight, straw yield, grain yield, and grain harvest index. The results showed that less water can be used to produce more crops under alternative wetting and drying irrigation practices. The results are important for water-scarce areas, providing useful information to policy makers, farmers, agricultural departments, and water management boards in devising future climate-smart adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

This is one of the most comprehensive in-use emissions studies conducted to date, which played a key role in the development of CARB's (California Air Recourses Board) updated EMission FACtor (EMFAC) model, especially for natural gas vehicles. In-use emissions testing was performed on school and transit buses, refuse haulers, goods movement vehicles, and delivery vehicles while were driven over their normal operating routes in the South Coast Air Basin. Engine technologies included diesel engines with and without selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, compressed natural gas (CNG) engines and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) engines, and SCR-equipped diesel hybrid electric vehicles. For most vehicles, the in-use NOx emissions were higher than the certification standards for the engine. Diesel vehicles generally showed higher brake-specific NOx emissions compared to the CNG vehicles. NOx emissions were strongly dependent on the SCR temperature, with SCR temperatures below 200 °C resulting in elevate brake-specific NOx. The 0.02 g/bhp-hr certified CNG vehicles showed the largest reductions in NOx emissions. The diesel hybrid electric vehicles showed important distance-specific NOx benefits compared to the conventional diesel vehicles, but higher emissions compared to the CNG and LPG vehicles. Overall, average NOx reductions were 75%, 94%, 65%, 79%, respectively, for the 0.2 CNG, 0.02 CNG, diesel hybrid electric, and LPG vehicles compared to diesel vehicles, due in part to some diesel vehicles with particularly high emissions, indicating that the widespread implementation of advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles could provide important NOx reductions and a path for meeting air quality targets in California and elsewhere. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Diesel hybrid electric trucks; Natural gas vehicles; NOx emissions; PEMS; Selective catalytic reduction","Air quality; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Compressed natural gas; Gas emissions; Hybrid vehicles; Liquefied petroleum gas; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Selective catalytic reduction; California; Catalytic reduction; Compressed natural gas vehicles; Diesel hybrid electric truck; Diesel vehicles; Engine technology; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Petroleum gas; Portable emission measurement system; Real-world; Diesel engines; natural gas; nitric oxide; petroleum derivative; air quality; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; diesel; electric vehicle; emission inventory; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; road transport; traffic emission; air pollutant; air quality; Article; calibration; California; catalysis; certification; diesel engine; highway; pollution monitoring; temperature sensitivity; vocation; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104713947

The objective was to better understand their life paths toward such work. The research showed that higher education is not adequately preparing individuals for engaging in systems-level change, and it is also not accessible to many looking to pursue this work. Given these institutional inadequacies, transdisciplinary programs and practical applications of systems-level frameworks remain underdeveloped and underutilized. There is a need for inclusive, hands-on, solutions-based frameworks that can confront the growing and complex contemporary concerns and can be integrated throughout academic programs and institutional structures.

Energy storage provides an important means to supply these services but there are many uncertainties in terms of technology, market readiness, economics, and regulatory requirements. The aim of this study is to undertake a global state-of-the-art review of the techno-economic and regulatory status of energy storage and power quality services at the distribution level.

In the Coastal basins, western San Joaquin Valley (SJV), and eastern SJV; 82, 76, and 0% of samples are premodern (pre-1953 recharge), respectively; and 3, 0, and 31% are modern (recharged during or after 1953), respectively. Carbon-14 and helium-4 data indicate most premodern samples are 1000 to 10,000 (33%) or >10,000 (50%) years old. Organic chemicals that could be associated with deeper hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g. thermogenic gases and benzene) occur most frequently in premodern groundwater, suggesting premodern groundwater has a higher risk of degradation from upward migration of hydrocarbons than modern and mixed-age groundwater. Low sulfate concentrations in some premodern groundwater containing high thermogenic-methane concentrations (>28 mg/L) indicate methane attenuation associated with sulfate reduction can be limited in premodern groundwater. The more common occurrence of manufactured compounds, like tetrachloroethene, in modern and mixed-age groundwater than in premodern groundwater indicates modern and mixed-age groundwater has a higher risk of degradation from land-surface sources than premodern groundwater. Time-series data for chloride in groundwater affected by disposal of oil-field water in unlined ponds indicate some modern and mixed-age groundwater are susceptible to chemical migration within 2–3 km of surface sources. Timescales for diluting chloride concentrations in groundwater with fresh recharge once disposal ponds are decommissioned are shorter in mixed-age groundwater with large fractions of modern water (9–14 years in one example) than in mixed-age groundwater with large fractions of premodern water (no evidence of dilution after 12 years of monitoring in one example). The presence of predominantly premodern groundwater in the Coastal basins and western SJV indicates these areas have relatively high risk from upward migration of hydrocarbons, reduced methane attenuation capacity, and long dilution times, whereas predominantly modern- and mixed-age groundwater in the eastern SJV indicates this area has relatively high risk from chemical migration from land-surface sources and subsequent extensive spreading. Age-based characterizations of relative risk could inform the design of groundwater-monitoring programs near oil fields in terms of the spatial distribution of monitoring points relative to source areas and monitoring frequency and duration. © 2021","Chloride; Contamination risk; Helium-4; Methane; Oil fields; Radiocarbon; Tritium","Carbon; Contamination; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Lakes; Methane; Oil fields; Organic chemicals; Risk perception; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; California; Carbon 14; Coastal basins; Contamination risks; Groundwater quality degradation; Helium 4; Radiocarbon; Relative risks; San Joaquin Valley; Surface sources; Chlorine compounds; chemical compound; groundwater; hydrocarbon; hydrocarbon reservoir; spatial distribution; California; San Joaquin Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107991178

However, renewables require significant land assets per unit energy and could come at high cost to ecosystems, creating potential conflicts between global climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Here, we explore the potential biodiversity implications of alternative future global electrification pathways as depicted under the Shared Socioeconomic Scenarios (SSPs), i.e., alternative trends in societal development. We examined the intersection of high-resolution estimates of global energy densities for ten renewable and conventional technologies with global richness data to estimate technology-specific biodiversity footprints (species per GWh), whereas a Cumulative Biodiversity Impact (CBI) score was used to assess land and biodiversity outcomes of alternative scenarios. Downscaled electricity generation scenarios (2020−2100) were also constrained by alternative land conservation and energy development policies. Unexpectedly, variation among SSPs did not exhibit a clear tradeoff between global climate mitigation and CBI. Rather, CBIs were an outcome of total infrastructure development to meet electricity demand (from population growth and GDP) and the total magnitude of renewable energy development and storage technologies. Renewables assembled along a spectrum from land sharing to sparing. At the land sharing end, biomass-powered electricity from dedicated crops contributed the most to biodiversity impacts due to low energy density, whereas land-sparing technologies (solar) caused more-intense land degradation, but in smaller areas. Our results suggest that local land conservation practices and strategies promoting energy diversification could have greater implications for future biodiversity conflicts than global socioeconomic drivers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Land sharing; Land sparing; Renewable energy","alternative energy; biodiversity; electricity generation; electrification; global climate; global perspective; Gross Domestic Product; land degradation; population growth; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111283453

The nursing profession reacted innovatively to meet demands placed on the National Health Service during COVID-19. Temporary changes to professional regulation enabled final-year United Kingdom nursing students to voluntarily undertake paid placements in the National Health Service. Neither full-time employees nor full-time students, volunteers undertook a unique hybrid role bolstering the front-line health workforce. Using reflective qualitative inquiry, 17 volunteers evaluated reasoning for entering practice in acute hospitals. Online surveys based around the UK Nursing and Midwifery Council Competency Framework (NMC 2012) were completed weekly for 6 weeks. Data were thematically analysed. Six themes were identified, including sense of duty, and opting-in or out. These highlighted the importance of collaboration and the tripartite relationship between University, host and student during placement, and the influence of these on the learning experience. Several significant insights emerged for nurse education and curricula during pandemics related to patient safety, safety climate and governance. The insights were used to develop a “Student Nurses Placement Framework” with recommendations for Pre-During-Post placement, offering a guide for future nursing workforce recruitment and retention. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the effects of irrigation management on carbon emission are not well documented in this region. Due to the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall, irrigation is mainly concentrated in the winter wheat growing season in the North China Plain. In this study, we estimated CO2 emission and soil CH4 uptake from winter wheat fields with different irrigation methods and scheduling treatments using the static chamber-gas chromatography method from April to May 2017 and 2018. Treatments included three irrigation methods (surface drip, sprinkler, and border) and three irrigation scheduling levels that initiated as soon as the soil moisture drained to 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity for a 0–100 cm soil profile were tested. The results showed that both the irrigation methods and scheduling significantly influenced (p < 0.05) the cumulative CO2 and CH4 emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), GWP Intensity (GWPI), GWPI per unit irrigation applied, and water use efficiency (WUE). Compared to 60% and 70% FC, 50% FC irrigation scheduling decreased accumulated CH4 uptake 26.8–30.3% and 17.8–25.4%, and reduced accumulated CO2 emissions 7.0–15.3% and 12.6–19.4%, respectively. Conversely, 50% FC reduced GWP 6.5–13.3% and 12.5–19.4% and lower grain yield 10.4–19.7% and 8.5–16.6% compared to 60% and 70% FC irrigation scheduling in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Compared to sprinkler irrigation and border irrigation, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased the accumulated CH4 uptake 11.3–12.1% and 1.9–5.5%, while reduced the accumulated CO2 emissions from 7.5–8.8% and 10.1–12.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Moreover, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.2–7.5% and 6.3–6.8%, WUE 0.9– 5.4% and 5.7–7.4%, and lowered GWP 8.0–9.8% and 10.1–12.0% compared to sprinkler and border irrigation in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The interaction of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods significantly impacted accumulated CH4 uptake, cumulative CO2 amount, and GWP in 2018 only while grain yield and WUE in the entire study. Overall, drip irrigation at 60% FC is the optimal choice in terms of higher grain yield, WUE, and mitigating GWP and GWPI from winter wheat fields in North China Plain. © 2021 by the authors.

However, does the movie with environment themes also apply a green production conducted to minimize environmental impact? The movie industry is reported as one most of the most significant contributors to the carbon footprint. Film with budget estimated over $70m can produced 2,840 tonnes of CO2 and it's equivalent of 11 times trip from moon to the earth. This paper explores the emerging phenomenon of sustainability and eco-friendly movement in film production by collecting data from movie production and sustainability reports from various industries contributing to filmmaking production. Instead of ruining the earth, the green production movement already moves and is supported by the university, nation, and community planning to reduce emissions to net zero before 2051. Researchers hope this paper will elaborate on how green production becomes valuable lessons for filmmakers to produce a green film using 5 keys area that have been identified to reduce emissions.

The path coefficient of the structural model was obtained. The influence of government subject behavior (0.20) on the integration of BTH environmental governance is stronger than that of enterprise subject behavior (0.16). However, the main government actions (0.73) was found to have the greatest influence on the environmental collaborative governance effect of integrated development in the BTH region, followed by the integrated action of environmental governance (0.40), main enterprise actions (0.33), and main societal actions (0.25).

Here, taking as-grown centrosymmetric NaY(CO3)2 and NCS YOHCO3 crystals as an example, a partial anion substitution strategy in the carbonate system is provided to develop NLO materials with remarkable NLO property for the first time, while the outstanding linear optical properties such as wide bandgap and large birefringence are maintained. Notably, benefiting from the planar π-conjugated (CO3)2− anions and closed shell electronic structure of Y3+ cations, the YOHCO3 crystal simultaneously manifests a deep UV cutoff (&lt;200 nm), sturdy second-harmonic-generation signal (2 × KH2PO4), and gigantic birefringence (0.07 at 1064 nm), enabling phase-matching in short-wavelength UV region. In addition, first-principles calculations are conducted for the in-depth analysis on the structure–optical property connection. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","nonlinear optical crystals; rare-earth carbonates; second harmonic generation response; structural transformation","Birefringence; Calculations; Crystal structure; Crystallites; Crystals; Electronic structure; Nanocrystalline materials; Negative ions; Phase matching; Sodium compounds; First-principles calculation; Large birefringence; Laser technologies; Linear optical properties; Noncentrosymmetric (ncs); Nonlinear optical crystal; Nonlinear optical response; Structural arrangement; Nonlinear optics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106236019

According to IPCC Working Group II (WGII) a change in a natural, human or managed system is attributed to climate change by quantifying the difference between the observed state of the system and a counterfactual baseline that characterizes the system's behavior in the absence of climate change, where ""climate change refers to any long-term trend in climate, irrespective of its cause""(IPCC, 2014). Impact attribution following this definition remains a challenge because the counterfactual baseline, which characterizes the system behavior in the hypothetical absence of climate change, cannot be observed. Process-based and empirical impact models can fill this gap as they allow us to simulate the counterfactual climate impact baseline. In those simulations, the models are forced by observed direct (human) drivers such as land use changes, changes in water or agricultural management but a counterfactual climate without long-term changes. We here present ATTRICI (ATTRIbuting Climate Impacts), an approach to construct the required counterfactual stationary climate data from observational (factual) climate data. Our method identifies the long-term shifts in the considered daily climate variables that are correlated to global mean temperature change assuming a smooth annual cycle of the associated scaling coefficients for each day of the year. The produced counterfactual climate datasets are used as forcing data within the impact attribution setup of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a). Our method preserves the internal variability of the observed data in the sense that factual and counterfactual data for a given day have the same rank in their respective statistical distributions. The associated impact model simulations allow for quantifying the contribution of climate change to observed long-term changes in impact indicators and for quantifying the contribution of the observed trend in climate to the magnitude of individual impact events. Attribution of climate impacts to anthropogenic forcing would need an additional step separating anthropogenic climate forcing from other sources of climate trends, which is not covered by our method. © 2021 Matthias Mengel et al.",,"anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; long-term change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114346423

This study investigates the grid balancing role of bioenergy in a sub-Saharan Africa's fully renewable power sector to address the energy poverty challenge in the region, using Ghana as a case country. Two methods are employed: the bioenergy estimation method, for deriving Ghana's technical bioenergy potential, and the LUT model, for the power sector transition modelling. The Ghanaian bioenergy potential of 48.3 TWh is applied on the power sector using the LUT model to develop six alternative scenarios, emphasising on the role of bioenergy, greenhouse gas emissions costs, and climate change mitigation policies. The results of the Best Policy Scenario reveal that with an electrical efficiency of 37.2%, 18 TWh of electricity, which is 16.9% of Ghana's electricity demand by 2050, could be produced from bioenergy for grid balancing. Also, the levelised cost of electricity declines from 48.7 €/MW in 2015 to 36.9–46.6 €/MWh in 2050. Whereas the cost of electricity increases to 76.4 €/MWh in the Current Policy Scenario without greenhouse gas emissions costs. The results show the viability of a relatively cheap and bioenergy balanced sustainable renewable power system for the sub-Saharan African region. © 2021 The Author(s)","100% renewable Energy; Bioenergy potential estimation; Dispatchable renewable energy; Energy transition; Sub-Saharan Africa; Variable renewable energy","Biomass; Climate change; Climate models; Electric power transmission networks; Greenhouse gases; 100% renewable energy; Bio-energy; Bioenergy potential estimation; Dispatchable renewable energy; Energy transitions; Grid balancing; Power sector; Renewable Power; Sub-saharan africa; Variable renewable energies; Gas emissions; alternative energy; bioenergy; biomass; climate change; electricity generation; energy market; greenhouse gas; numerical model; poverty; power generation; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104057320

Restoration is needed to restore forest structure and function so that a more natural regime of higher frequency, lower intensity wildfires returns. However, restoration has been hampered by the significant cost of restoration and other institutional barriers. To create additional revenue streams to pay for restoration, the National Forest Foundation supported the development of a methodology for the estimation and verification of carbon offsets generated by the restoration of ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona. The methodology was submitted to the American Carbon Registry, a prominent carbon registry, but it was ultimately rejected. This paper presents a post-mortem examination of that methodology and the reasons it was rejected in order to improve the development of similar methodologies in the future. Using a mixed-methods approach, this paper analyzes the potential atmospheric carbon benefits of the proposed carbon offset methodology and the public and peer-reviewed comments from the associated review of the methodology. Results suggest a misalignment between the priorities of carbon registries and the context-specific ecosystem service benefits of this type of restoration; although findings confirm the potential for reductions in released carbon due to restoration, these results illuminate barriers that complicate registering these reductions as voluntary carbon offsets under current guidelines and best practices, especially on public land. These barriers include substantial uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of carbon benefits. Overcoming these barriers will require active reflexivity by the institutions that register voluntary carbon offsets and the institutions that manage public lands in the United States. Such reflexivity, or reconsideration of the concepts and purposes of carbon offsets and/or forest restoration, will allow future approaches to better align objectives for successfully registering restoration-based voluntary carbon offsets. Therefore, the results of this analysis can inform the development of future methodologies, policies, and projects with similar goals in the same or different landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

Among the different sources contributing to noise generation in vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines, exhaust flow noise is one of the most significant, being generated by turbulence development in the exhaust gases, and robust and reliable numerical methodologies for its prediction in early design phases are currently still needed. To this extent, Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) can be considered a valuable approach to characterize the physical mechanisms leading to flow noise generation and its propagation, and it could therefore be used to support exhaust system development prior to the execution of experimental testing campaigns. This paper describes the development of a CAA methodology suitable for automotive applications that can be used to support the design of new exhaust system components in their early phases. In particular, the work focuses on the flow noise generated in a complex heavy-duty exhaust system, featuring three tailpipes located next to the ground. Firstly, the near-field acoustic field is obtained with a Direct Noise Computation (DNC) approach from an unsteady compressible 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (3D-CFD) simulation, carried out by means of the commercially available 3D-CFD software STAR-CCM+. A Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) technique is implemented to reduce the high computational cost of the DNC approach and it has been initialized by a steady-state converged solution. The steady-state simulation has been also exploited to extract qualitative predictive indexes, as a preliminary characterization of the system in terms of mean flow and broadband noise generation. Finally, predicted near-field noise levels are evaluated to obtain an assessment of engine exhaust system acoustic performance. © 2021 SAE International.

This work aims to complement impact assessment methods currently used in the literature with the application of the statistical desirability function, and create novel desirability-based indicators to evaluate the environmental and mechanical performance of concrete production. Six new eco-efficiency indicators associated with different impact categories addressed by international, national, and regional agreements in the sustainability area were proposed: Energy Impacts Reduction (EIR); Material Impacts Reduction (MIR); Greenhouse Gases Reduction (GGR); Ecotoxicity Potential Reduction (EPR); Acidification, Eutrophication, and Ozone Abatement (AEO); and Eco-efficiency Potential (EEP). A case study was developed to carry out a life cycle assessment (LCA) of conventional and sustainable concretes, apply the individual desirability methodology and calculate the novel indicators. The application of the desirability function was able to adjust and combine LCA midpoint or endpoint characterization factors and provide very flexible and intuitive desirability-based indicators of concrete eco-efficiency.

RCCI engine development requires optimum in-cylinder combustion metrics as desired objective across different operating conditions. Physics-inspired control models are a cost-competitive option to achieve these objectives in engine control systems. Combining these control models with machine learning can offer computational efficiency, higher accuracy and lower number of experiments needed for control system calibration. In this context, the present paper proposed a novel hybrid control model by combining physics-inspired parametrized double Wiebe function (D-W) and Random Forest Machine Learning (RFML) to predict both the average and cyclic variation trends of combustion metrics in an RCCI engine. In this work, firstly, an optimized D-W parameters matrix was formulated that can stochastically reconstruct pressure cycles in agreement with 99.7% of the experimental confidence interval. RFML was then employed to develop correlative learning models between experimental control variables such as premix ratio, engine load, injection timing etc. with corresponding D-W parameters matrix. The hybrid control model was used to predict peak pressure (PP), indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), crank angle for 50% of fuel mass fraction burnt (θ50) and maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) across 60 test cases and 36000 cycles.

The effluents generated by this industry are rich in proteins, lipids, fibres, and carbohydrates. All these pollutants have the potential to be used as a resource for energy recovery. The organic matters obtained from the farm animal and meat processing industry are critical sources for biogas production via anaerobic digestion. This process leads to the production of energy-rich biogas, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study attempts to determine biogas amount and the energy value produced from the farm animal and meat processing industry in Australia. Australia's livestock population mainly consists of dairy cattle, meat cattle, sheep and lambs, pigs, layers, and meat chickens. Results show a potential biogas amount of 23,874,165 million m3 (Mm3), 215,670 Mm3, 288,228 Mm3, 18,430 Mm3, and 392,284 Mm3 can be obtained from cattle, lamb, sheep, pig, and poultry annually, respectively. The methane generated from slaughterhouse waste and wastewater is estimated to provide 4.52E+ 14 MJ/yr of heat energy with total electricity generation potential from livestock wastes of 4.4E+ 13 kWh/yr. About half of the electricity can be generated in Queensland State. Finally, the present study suggests farm animal and meat processing industry effluent as a potential sustainable energy source in Australia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes a scoping review and identifies connections between telework and sustainability outcomes from previous academic studies. These connections were categorised, and are discussed, based on their contributions to different United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Most research was found to focus on countries classified as having a very high human development index status. The SWOT matrix technique was used to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses identified in the existing literature, and the threats and opportunities for future work. This aims to ensure policy coherence so that strategies to promote one outcome, such as economic productivity improvements, do not undermine another, such as improved health. Practical implications and research opportunities were identified across a range of SDG impact areas, including good health and well-being, gender equality, reduced inequality, climate mitigation, sustainable cities, and resilient communities. Overall, our impression is that increased rates of telework present an important opportunity to improve sustainability outcomes. However, it will be important that integrated and holistic policy is developed that mitigates key risks. © 2021 by the authors.

We investigated methanogenic biodegradation of iso-alkane mixtures comprising either three (2-methylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane) or five (2-methylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 2-methylhexane, 2-methylheptane, 2-methyloctane) iso-alkanes representing paraffinic and naphtha solvents, respectively. Mature fine tailings (MFT) collected from two tailings ponds, having different residual solvents (paraffinic solvent in Canadian Natural Upgrading Limited (CNUL) and naphtha in Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL)), were amended separately with the two mixtures and incubated in microcosms for ~1600 d. The indigenous microbes in CNUL MFT produced methane from the three-iso-alkane mixture after a lag of ~200 d, completely depleting 2-methylpentane while partially depleting 2-methylbutane and 3-methylpentane. CNRL MFT exhibited a similar degradation pattern for the three iso-alkanes after a lag phase of ~700 d, but required 1200 d before beginning to produce methane from the five-iso-alkane mixture, preferentially depleting components in the order of decreasing carbon chain length. Peptococcaceae members were key iso-alkane-degraders in both CNUL and CNRL MFT but were associated with different archaeal partners. Co-dominance of acetoclastic (Methanosaeta) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanolinea and Methanoregula) methanogens was observed in CNUL MFT during biodegradation of three-iso-alkanes whereas CNRL MFT was enriched in Methanoregula during biodegradation of three-iso-alkanes and in Methanosaeta with five-iso-alkanes. This study highlights the different responses of indigenous methanogenic microbial communities in different oil sands tailings ponds to iso-alkanes. © 2021 by the authors.

The higher resource consumption, variety of dyes, and auxiliary chemicals used for textile manufacturing classify it as a highly polluting industry. Standards for color, organics, and dissolved solids are becoming more stringent with time, and local regulators are forced to insist on the establishment of zero liquid discharge (ZLD) units. However, the application of the ZLD concept has the major limitation of high energy consumption when compared with the conventional wastewater treatment plant. The application of carbon footprint analysis to both units would provide a comprehensive solution to the carbon footprint computation and bring out the advantages of the ZLD. The carbon footprint of a typical ZLD treatment facility in south India was found to be 10,598 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (tCO2eq/year), which is only one-third more than that of a conventional treatment plant. The carbon footprint of a given ZLD treatment facility can effectively be used as a performance indicator to limit the overall energy consumption. © 2021 The Authors.","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas emission; Sustainability; Zero liquid discharge","Carbon dioxide; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Liquids; Sewage; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Textiles; Wastewater treatment; Effluent treatment plants; Footprint analysis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Industrial effluent; Resources consumption; Textile manufacturing; Textile wastewater; Through the lens; Treatment plants; Zero-liquid discharge; Carbon footprint; carbon footprint; effluent; textile industry; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; India; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120916230

The bore has a prominent leading dark front followed by trailing waves and it propagates with a mean observed phase velocity of ~31 ± 5 m/s. It also shows a small-scale undulation and clockwise rotation in its phase front. In order to understand the evolution of the bore, vertical temperature profiles from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard TIMED satellite and HWM14 wind maps are used. SABER temperature shows a mesospheric inversion layer prior to the occurrence of the bore event which acted as a thermal duct layer to guide the propagation of the bore. The analyses also suggest that inhomogeneity in the duct depth at different parts of the bore's horizontal extension could lead the small-scale undulations in the bore phase fronts. The same can also be responsible for the rotation of the bore. Additionally, the peak separation of the bore's trailing waves suggests that large-scale gravity wave interaction with pre-existing thermal duct could be the potential source for the generation of the undular bore at mesospheric height. Furthermore, the present results indicate that neutral instabilities and weakening duct layer in the path of the bore propagation might have accelerated the faster dissipation of the bore's energy and consequently suppress its long-distance horizontal propagation. © 2021 COSPAR","All-sky airglow imager; Gravity waves; Mesospheric bore; O(1S) 557.7 nm airglow emission; Ripples","Ducts; All-sky airglow imager; Case-studies; Mesospheric bore; O(1S) 557.7 nm airglow emission; Phase front; Ripple; Small scale; Sounding of the atmosphere using broadband emission radiometry; Thermal ducts; Trailing waves; Gravity waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104303009

The objective of the present study was to estimate the burden of disease including years of life lost (YLL) and expected life remaining (ELR) attributed to long-term exposure to PM2.5 in Ahvaz, one of the most polluted cities of the world, during March 2014 through March 2017. AirQ + software was used for the estimation of YLL and ELR due to all natural causes of death. Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 were acquired from the Department of Environment (DoE) of Ahvaz. Several steps were performed to validate the raw air quality data. Only the monitors were included that had minimum data completeness of 75%. Two age groups were selected for this study, including 0–64 and 65 &lt; years. The life table approach was used to estimate YLL and ELR. Annual averages of PM2.5 were 5.2–8 times higher than the air quality guideline (10 μg/m3) set by WHO for long-term exposure to PM2.5. In total, PM2.5 has caused 234,041 years of life lost due to mortality. About 84% of YLLs were attributed to people older than 65 years old. The YLLs of men were higher than those for women. The YLLs in the third year were greater than the first two years. PM2.5 has caused the average age of total population, people aged 0–64 years old, and people &gt; 65 years old decreased by 2.5, 3, and 1.6 years, respectively. These studies indicated that people in a city that the air quality is highly affected by dust storms, industrial emissions, and urban air pollution are significantly at risk.

The special issue on “Urban food policies for a sustainable and just future” aims to reflect on a decade of work and identify key concepts to deepen and broaden a transformative urban food agenda. This editorial provides an overview of the twelve papers that make up this collection, demonstrating some of the breadth of approaches used to study this phenomenon in different regions of the world, informed by different epistemic traditions and exemplified by diverse case studies such as urban agriculture, street vending, public procurement, spatial planning, city networks or deep explorations of specific urban policy-making processes. Building on this work and the broader literature, in this paper we identify three core turns in the urban food governance scholarship: a shift towards systemic engagement with the food system; increased engagement with scalar complexity; and a growing focus on relational aspects of urban food governance and policy-making dynamics. However, our analysis also points out three key aspects that require further focus for the field to be transformative: a stronger conceptualisation of the urban; a clearer definition and articulation of the nature of governance and policy; and a more engaged focus on issues of power and inequities. To address these gaps, we propose a set of tools in the form of definitions and frameworks to support the unfolding of an urgently needed more just and transformative urban food agenda. © 2021 The Authors","Equity; Sustainable food systems; Transformative; Urban food policies; Urban governance","equity; food policy; food supply; future prospect; sustainability; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111069566

Despite its effectiveness on the abatement of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and disinfection, previous studies have shown that regrow of bacteria may occur upon storage of the ozonated UWW. This reactivation has been attributed to the high content of assimilable organic carbon after treatment. In order to investigate if ozonation by-products are the main biological regrowth drivers in stored ozonated UWW, the ozonation surviving cells were resuspended in sterile bottled mineral water (MW), simulating a pristine oligotrophic environment. After 7 days storage, organisms such as Acinetobacter, Methylobacterium, Cupriavidus, Massilia, Acidovorax and Pseudomonas were dominant in both ozonated UWW and pristine MW, demonstrating that bacterial regrowth is not strictly related to the eventual presence of ozonation by-products, but instead with the ability of the surviving cells to cope with nutrient-poor environments. The resistome of UWW before and after ozonation was analysed by metagenomic techniques. Draft metagenome assembled genomes (dMAGs), recovered from both ozonated UWW and after cell resuspension in MW, harboured genes conferring resistance to diverse antibiotics classes. Some of these antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were located in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements, suggesting their potential to be mobilized. Among these, dMAGs affiliated to taxa with high relative abundance in stored water, such as P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., harboured ARGs conferring resistance to 12 and 4 families of antibiotics, respectively, including those encoding carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases. The results herein obtained point out that the design and development of new wastewater treatment technologies should include measures to attenuate the imbalance of the bacterial communities promoted by storage of the final treated wastewater, even when applying processes with high mineralization rates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acinetobacter; Antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes; Metagenome-assembled genome; Ozonation; Pseudomonas; Wastewater treatment","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Beverages; Genes; Organic carbon; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Acinetobacters; Antibiotic resistance genes; Antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance gene; Bacteria regrowth; Chemical contaminants; Condition; Metagenome-assembled genome; Metagenomes; Mineral water; Urban wastewater; Wastewater treatment; atrazine; benzalkonium chloride; bicozamycin; carbapenem; cephalosporin; cephamycin; glycylcycline derivative; lincosamide; macrolide; methiocarb; mineral water; organic carbon; pesticide; pleuromutilin; rifamycin; RNA 16S; simazine; streptogramin derivative; sulfonamide; tetracycline; triclosan; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; genome; mineralization; ozonation; regrowth; relative abundance; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water treatment; Acidovorax; Acinetobacter; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial load; controlled study; Cupriavidus; DNA extraction; filtration; hydrophilicity; lipophilicity; mass spectrometry; metagenomics; Methylobacterium; microbial community; mobile genetic element; nonhuman; ozonation; physical chemistry; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; real time polymerase chain reaction; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; waste water management; water treatment; bacterial gene; bacterium; genetics; wastewater; water management; Acidovorax; Acinetobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cupriavidus; Massilia; Methylobacterium; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108883803

Sea ice extent (SIE) in the Weddell Sea does not show any significant trend in the four-decade satellite observation period but does experience large interannual-to-decadal variability. Physical processes underlying this variability are difficult to examine because of a paucity of prolonged observations. Using a coupled general circulation model, we corroborate the observational finding that decadal increases in SIE are preceded by weakening of the mean westerly winds linked to the Southern Annular Mode. Weakening of the westerly winds over the Weddell Sea reduces the northward Ekman current and suppresses upwelling of warm water from the subsurface ocean; this lowers the upper-ocean temperature, causing an increase in sea ice. In a sensitivity experiment where the interannual sea surface temperature variations are suppressed outside the South Atlantic and the Weddell Sea, decadal increase in the SIE over the Weddell Sea is induced by a decrease in the upper-ocean temperature owing to enhanced horizontal advection by the Weddell Gyre. The strengthening of the Weddell Gyre increases the upper-ocean salinity as a result of enhanced evaporation and brine rejection associated with the sea ice increase. These results demonstrate that both the remote atmospheric forcing and local ice-ocean interaction are crucial for generation of decadal sea ice variability in the Weddell Sea. © 2021.

The introduction of Urban Vehicle Access Regulations such as Low Emission Zones represents one policy that is being actively considered in city governance to address this problem, whereby the access of highly polluting vehicles is restricted to reduce traffic-related emissions. For such a policy to be implemented, an understanding of public support can prove useful by identifying the issues that underpin citizen reaction. This paper presents an assessment of public acceptability to Low Emission Zones through the application of a conceptual framework. This framework integrates an array of socio-psychological constructs sourced from theoretical models of behaviour and empirical findings on acceptability to Transport Demand Management measures. The framework is applied through a Structural Equation Model with the results of the analysis indicating that attitudes, policy specific beliefs, trust in government, and problem awareness all represent significant constructs in terms of their direct and in-direct effects on acceptability.

Complex interactions between soil conditions, climatic variations, plant maturity and genotype influence yields and nutrient dynamics, which in turn impacts crop sus-tainability. To investigate the flux of growth and nutrients in response to a changing environment, M. × giganteus was grown in southwest Poland and sampled monthly (June–November) from 2010 to 2012. Measurements examined the interaction between plant growth and leaf development, and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) concentrations of rhizomes, stems and leaves. The three growth years studied were markedly different for growth and meteorological conditions. Between 2010 and 2011, above ground biomass yield increased significantly from 16.5 ± 0.4 t ha−1 to 20.1 ± 0.5 t ha−1 . The 2012 rhizome weights at the beginning of the growth season were halved due to extreme frost; however, resulting yield was similar (19.9 ± 0.6 5 t ha−1 ). Final yield from all three years were successfully predicted using MISCANFOR, and modelling indicated crop yield was water-limited. The seasonal flux of N and K from rhizome to stems and leaves then back to the rhizome at the onset of senescence was as expected in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, no such trend was evident especially for N suggesting different macronutrient sources from rhizome and soil improves the resilience of perennial crop yield across a range of diverse growth conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

We report a trend of 3.3 ± 4.7 μg.m−3 year−1 in the annual mean maximum daily average ozone over an 8-h period (MDA8 ozone) across China between 2015 and 2019. Leveraging the Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filter method, we find that meteorology enhanced the ozone levels in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) while the reduction of solar radiation and the planetary boundary layer height accelerated ozone decreases in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) after 2017. Solar radiation and temperature increases, together with the reduction in sea level pressure, were the main contributors to enhance ozone in the YRD. They also contributed to 32% of ozone increases in BTH. Weaker meridional wind, lower relative humidity, and higher temperature escalated ozone enhancement in the PRD between 2016 and 2018. Regarding precursor emissions, NO2 long-term components showed a noticeable decline in all regions after 2017, partially due to the introduction of the most current action plan to reduce air pollutants over China in 2018. In contrast, the satellite-retrieved data suggest that VOC concentrations did not change substantially in target regions during the study period. After 2017, however, VOCs slightly increased in BTH, the YRD, and the PRD, which might be driven by temperature enhancements. Overall, the impact of meteorology on ozone variations was dominant in the YRD, the PRD, and the SCB from 2015 to 2019. Precursor emissions, however, played a leading role in ozone enhancement over the BTH. We also found that BTH and the YRD were in a transitional ozone formation regime while the PRD and the SCB tended to be more NOx-sensitive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; KZ filter; Multiple linear regression; OMI; Ozone formation regime; Ozone trend","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Computational complexity; Linear regression; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sea level; Solar radiation; % reductions; KZ filter; Multiple linear regressions; OMI; Ozone formation regime; Ozone trends; Pearl River delta; Sichuan Basin; Tianjin; Yangtze river delta; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; concentration (composition); formation mechanism; multiple regression; nitrogen oxides; ozone; relative humidity; solar radiation; trend analysis; China; Guangdong; Jingjinji; Sichuan Basin; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103307188

The paper is focused on characteristics of green roofs in the quantitative management of storm water: the reduction of the runoff volume, the peak attenuation and delay at the rainfall event. There are many factors affecting the hydrological performance of green roofs: local climate conditions, substrate depth and composition, drainage layer, type of vegetation cover, rainfall pattern, thus the influence on the drainage infrastructure is uncertain..

Literature establishes an existence of cooperation and cognition gaps due to informational and residential differences that make the strategies' implementation difficult. While little is known about how such gaps can be reduced, therefore, we examine the effect of information provision on people's cooperation and cognition for reducing salinity problems in urban and rural areas. It is hypothesized that information provision about salinity through some lecture is effective at reducing cooperation and cognition gaps among people. We conduct a field experiment, collecting data on donations, prosociality, cognitive and sociodemographic factors of 900 subjects from one urban and two rural areas in Bangladesh. A climate donation game is instituted to measure cooperation among people where they are asked to donate to salinity risk reduction with or without the information provision. The analysis shows that people who have prosocial orientation and perception of human-induced climate change donate more than do those who do not, and urban people tend to donate less than do rural people. However, urban people are identified to increase their donations by receiving the information provision much more than do rural people.

Profound shifts in ship-accessible season length are projected across the Canadian Arctic, with the largest increases in the Beaufort region (100–200 d at 2 °C to 200–300 d at 4 °C). Projections along the Northwest Passage and Arctic Bridge trade routes indicate 100% navigation probability for part of the year, regardless of vessel type, above 2 °C of global warming. Along some major trade routes, substantial increases to season length are possible if operators assume additional risk and operate under marginally unsafe conditions.

However, questions persist as to whether cities' 'self-reported inventories' (SRIs) are accurate, precise, and consistent enough to track progress toward city mitigation goals. Although useful for broad policy initiatives, city SRIs provide annual snapshots that may have limited use to city managers looking to develop targeted mitigation policies that overlap with other issues like equity, air quality, and human health. An emerging approach from the research community that integrates 'bottom-up' hourly, street-level emission data products with 'top-down' GHG atmospheric observations have begun to yield production-based (scope 1) GHG estimates that can track changes in emissions at annual and sub-annual timeframes. The use of this integrated approach offers a much-needed assessment of SRIs: the atmospheric observations are tied to international standards and the bottom-up information incorporates multiple overlapping socio-economic data. The emissions are mapped at fine scales which helps link them to attribute information (e.g. fuel types) that can further facilitate mitigation actions. Here, we describe this approach and compare results to the SRI from the City of Indianapolis which shows a yearly difference of 35% in scope 1 emissions. In the City of Baltimore, we show that granular emission information can help address multiple issues, e.g. GHG emissions, air pollution, and inequity, at the sub-zip code scale where many roots and causes for each issue exist. Finally, we show that the incorporation of atmospheric concentrations within an integrated system provides rapid, near-real-time feedback on CO2 emissions anomalies that can uncover important behavioral and economic relationships. An integrated approach to GHG monitoring, reporting and verification can ensure uniformity, and provide accuracy to city-scale GHG emissions, scalable to states and the nation-ultimately helping cities meet stated ambitions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Water and land resources are fundamental for smallholder farmers and their productivity. The concept of IKS plays a significant role in climate change adaptation in Zimbabwe’s rural communities. Climate change has a considerable influence on the success of agricultural production in the rural communities of Zimbabwe. Hence, it becomes fundamental to assess the community-based methods of climate governance. Qualitative multiple case study exploratory designs were employed with data collected through individual interviews with smallholder farmers, and thematic content analysis was used to analyse data. This study found that enhancing and embracing IKS is of paramount importance for inclusion in local-level strategies in the development process with special reference to climate governance in water and land resource management, particularly in under-resourced communities. It also established that the use of IKS enhances communities’ adaptive capacity and it should not be conducted at the expense of scientific methods but rather should be employed in order to complement the existing scientific global knowledge systems. © 2021 The Authors.","Climate change; Climate governance; Indigenous knowledge systems; Rural Zimbabwe","Agriculture; Climate change; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Climate governance; Indigenous knowledge; Indigenous knowledge system; Knowledge system; Rural community; Rural zimbabwe; Smallholder farmers; Under-resourced; Waters resources; Zimbabwe; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120943642

Pakistan is facing severe crises of changing climate and it is ranked one of the most vulnerable countries due to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is the main strategy of Pakistan to deal with climatic impacts. Implementing the GBI plays a key role in urban areas for promoting adaptive governance towards climate change. Many efforts have been initiated to manage the issue of climate change by the national, provincial, and local governments in Pakistan. The latest and notable strategy by Pakistani government was devised in the form of the Clean Green Pakistan Strategy (CGPS) to promote the GBI as adaptation strategy to address climate change. However, there are multiple challenges and hurdles for effective implementation of the CGPS. On the heels of Paris Agreement 2015, the CSOs have growing role to overcome such challenges and to prepare the local communities in collaboration with local institutions especially in cities for advancing the GBI and tackling climate change effectively. This study is conducted to understand and uncover the role of the CSOs for promoting the GBI as adaptive strategy in dealing with climate change in Islamabad city of Pakistan. The study focuses to investigate and dig out the prominent initiatives of the CSOs towards the GBI in Pakistani governance system. It also identifies the hurdles and challenges for the CSOs in relation to promote the GBI in Pakistan. A case study approach as research methodology is employed where semi-structured interviews were conducted with relevant actors in Islamabad city. The study finds that the CSOs are actively involved in promotion of the GBI in collaboration with Islamabad administration through plantation drive, educating school students on the GBI, arranging training programs for the local community, providing advocacy assistance and helping the city government for establishing policies and action plans for the GBI. The CSOs act as representative of the local community in devising the GBI policies and implementation actions at local scale through consistent engagements with the local administration and the local community in the city. The CSOs have emerged as a mediator in aligning intergovernmental relations for implementing the GBI as the CSOs are closely working with local, provincial, and federal institutions, thus they are key for all tiers of the government. The major challenges faced by the CSOs are identified: weak linkage and cooperation among local and international organizations, limited financial resources, and weak capacity of local organizations. The role of the CSOs appears in an infancy stages but it is emerging with a reasonable pace for effective adaptive governance in relation with the GBI in Pakistan. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Civil society organizations; Green and blue infrastructure; Local governance; Pakistan","Public policy; Adaptive governance; Changing climate; City; Civil society; Civil society organization; Green and blue infrastructure; Islamabad; Local community; Local governance; Pakistan; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105792656

We attempted to map the dust emission prone (DEP) areas in this region of Iran using the most accurate model among the random forest (RF), conditional RF (CRF), parallel RF (PRF), and extremely randomized trees (ERT) models. These models were evaluated using the Taylor diagram, Nash Sutcliffe coefficient, and Kling–Gupta efficiency. The generated map of DEP areas was also validated based on an aerosols optical depth (AOD) dataset. The Shapely values were used to determine the contribution of factors controlling dust events in DEP areas. The high performance and reliability of the ERT model for mapping DEP territories were confirmed by both error assessment statistics and reclassified AOD map. Using the ERT-generated map, five dust generation susceptibility classes including very low (20.16%), low (19.99%), moderate (19.82%), high (24.11%), and very high (15.92%) were identified in the study region. Drought severity, solar radiation, soil moisture, geology, soil sand content, bulk density, vegetation cover, land use, and slope were detected as the key features controlling dust emissions in central Iran.

Negative changes in the climate severely affect the functioning of human beings, e.g.The accumulation of carbon dioxide impact plant growth negatively, which in turn impact animal life that is dependent on plant, and thus the food chain as a whole. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) focuses on transforming agricultural development under the stresses of climate change (CC). Various actors from different fields need to collaborate in order for CSA to succeed. Transdisciplinary information sharing and access needs to be addressed so that each member's concerns and solutions can be heard. The building of an ontology for CSA helps this and adds the element of automation to a task that would otherwise be daunting and extremely labour intensive. This ontology will thus provide a formal representation of all relevant CSA information and solutions needed by users. This ontology focuses on practices and techniques of CSA that will help reduce the effects of climate change. This ontology is designed to educate stakeholders better who will benefit from the use of CSA practices and techniques in their various fields of work by linking them with the climate, crop, and economic modeling communities through information technology. It also serves as a quick and efficient means to find the most suitable practice options or techniques for climate change signals. © 2021 IEEE.","Climate Smart Agriculture; Ontology; OWL; Protege","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Agricultural development; Climate smart agriculture; Food chain; Human being; Information access; Information sharing; Ontology's; Plant growth; Protege; Smart agricultures; Ontology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115363123

MAO deaminates norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine to produce H2O2 and highly reactive ""catecholaldehydes,""which may be toxic to mitochondria due to the localization of MAO to the outer mitochondrial membrane. We performed a comprehensive analysis of catecholamine metabolism and its impact on mitochondrial energetics in atrial myocardium obtained from patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Results: Content and maximal activity of MAO-A and MAO-B were higher in the myocardium of patients with diabetes and they were associated with body mass index. Metabolomic analysis of atrial tissue from these patients showed decreased catecholamine levels in the myocardium, supporting an increased flux through MAOs. Catecholaldehyde-modified protein adducts were more abundant in myocardial tissue extracts from patients with diabetes and were confirmed to be MAO dependent. NE treatment suppressed mitochondrial ATP production in permeabilized myofibers from patients with diabetes in an MAO-dependent manner. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was substantially decreased in atrial myocardium from these patients, and metabolomics confirmed lower levels of ALDH-catalyzed catecholamine metabolites. Proteomic analysis of catechol-modified proteins in isolated cardiac mitochondria from these patients identified >300 mitochondrial proteins to be potential targets of these unique carbonyls. Innovation and Conclusion: These findings illustrate a unique form of carbonyl toxicity driven by MAO-mediated metabolism of catecholamines, and they reveal pathogenic factors underlying cardiometabolic disease.

Variational inverse methods can optimize surface emissions at any resolution but do not readily quantify the error and information content of the posterior solution. The information content of satellite data may be much lower than its coverage would suggest because of failed retrievals, instrument noise, and error correlations that propagate through the inversion. Analytical solution of the inverse problem provides closed-form characterization of posterior error statistics and information content but requires the construction of the Jacobian matrix that relates emissions to atmospheric concentrations. Building the Jacobian matrix is computationally expensive at high resolution because it involves perturbing each emission element, typically individual grid cells, in the atmospheric transport model used as the forward model for the inversion. We propose and analyze two methods, reduced dimension and reduced rank, to construct the Jacobian matrix at greatly decreased computational cost while retaining information content. Both methods are two-step iterative procedures that begin from an initial native-resolution estimate of the Jacobian matrix constructed at no computational cost by assuming that atmospheric concentrations are most sensitive to local emissions. The reduced-dimension method uses this estimate to construct a Jacobian matrix on a multiscale grid that maintains a high resolution in areas with high information content and aggregates grid cells elsewhere. The reduced-rank method constructs the Jacobian matrix at native resolution by perturbing the leading patterns of information content given by the initial estimate. We demonstrate both methods in an analytical Bayesian inversion of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) methane data with augmented information content over North America in July 2009. We show that both methods reproduce the results of the native-resolution inversion while achieving a factor of 4 improvement in computational performance. The reduced-dimension method produces an exact solution at a lower spatial resolution, while the reduced-rank method solves the inversion at native resolution in areas of high information content and defaults to the prior estimate elsewhere. © 2021 The Author(s)..",,"atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission; GOSAT; matrix; observational method; satellite data; North America; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112800038

Our observations in the 3.49-4.13 μm spectral region, obtained with a 0.″375 slit width that provided a spectral resolving power λ/Δλ ∼ 80,000, have resulted in the unequivocal detection of the R(0)-R(3) and P(1)-P(10) transitions within the v = 1-0 band of CH+. The R-branch transitions are anomalously weak relative to the P-branch transitions, a behavior that is explained accurately by rovibronic calculations of the transition dipole moment reported in a companion paper. Nine infrared transitions of H2 were also detected in these observations, comprising the S(8), S(9), S(13), and S(15) pure rotational lines; the v = 1-0 O(4)-O(7) lines; and the v = 2-1 O(5) line. We present a photodissociation model, constrained by the CH+ and H2 line fluxes that we measured, that includes a detailed treatment of the excitation of CH+ by inelastic collisions, optical pumping, and chemical (""formation"") pumping. The latter process is found to dominate the excitation of the observed rovibrational lines of CH+, and the model is remarkably successful in explaining both the absolute and relative strengths of the CH+ and H2 lines. © 2021.

It follows the EU initiative for implementing at least 100 PED in Europe by 2025. Four urban typologies have been assessed using the bottom-up energy modelling tool MAPED that enables a simplified energy demand- supply analysis at the district scale. Considering relevant urban typologies in different construction periods, the analysis focused on converting the allocated building stocks into PED by employing comprehensive thermal refurbishment and energy efficiency measures, electrification of end-uses and fuel switching, exploitation of local renewable energy potential, and flexible interaction with the regional energy system. The results reveal that a detached housing district can achieve a positive annual energy balance (for heat and power) of 110% due to the fact that there are sufficient surfaces (roofs, facades, open land) available for the production of local renewable energy, whereas the remaining typologies fail to achieve the criteria with an annual balance ranking between 61% and 97%, showing additional margins for improvement to meet the PED conditions. The presented concept offers a practical approach to investigate the PED suitability of urban typologies. It will help the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action and Environment to identify appropriate strategies for the refurbishment of existing urban areas towards the PED standard. © 2021 by the authors.

Using models that analyze vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation, this paper estimates impacts to railroad, roads, and coastal properties under three infrastructure management response scenarios: No Adaptation; Reactive Adaptation, and Proactive Adaptation. Comparing damages under each of these potential responses provides strong support for facilitating effective adaptation in these three sectors. Under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario and without adaptation, overall costs are projected to range in the $100s of billions annually by the end of this century. The first (reactive) tier of adaptation action, however, reduces costs by a factor of 10, and the second (proactive) tier reduces total costs across all three sectors to the low $10s of billions annually. For the rail and road sectors, estimated costs for Reactive and Proactive Adaptation scenarios capture a broader share of potential impacts, including selected indirect costs to rail and road users, and so are consistently about a factor of 2 higher than prior estimates. The results highlight the importance of considering climate risks in infrastructure planning and management. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coastal development; Infrastructure; Proactive adaptation; Rail; Roads","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway administration; Railroad transportation; Roads and streets; Sea level; Climate effects; Coastal development; Estimated costs; Infrastructure managements; Infrastructure planning; Potential impacts; Potential response; Proactive adaptations; Cost benefit analysis; adaptation; climate effect; coastal development; economic development; infrastructure planning; railway construction; road; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113150456

We use an integrated framework that combines climate models, biophysical models, and an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model based on a 2007 Social Accounting Matrix to assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture, economic growth, and household welfare in Zambia. We address the uncertainty associated with climate change by using data from the general circulation models based on 819 potential future climate scenarios. There are three main results. First, rainfall is projected to decline with the Southern and Western regions of Zambia worst affected, and temperature is projected to increase by 2050. Second, climate change is projected to reduce crop yield and production, with maize expected to be the hardest hit. These impacts are progressive over time. And lastly, based only on the agricultural impact channel, climate change will likely reduce national gross domestic product (GDP), agricultural production, and household welfare. There are significant regional differences, with the Southern and Western regions projected to bear the most substantial negative impacts of climate change on crop yield and production.

The enhanced photocatalytic activity of functional CdS quantum dots could be attributed to the cooperative interaction between localized protons and surface Cd atoms, which behave as a Lewis acid and Lewis base, respectively.

It plays a critical role for various purposes, such as reducing urban heat island effect and air pollution, regulating torrential run-off and offering joyful routes for walking, jogging and cycling based on personal interest as well as a platform for social networking. It is especially important in a populated country like Taiwan with population highly concentrated in cities. It is rather vulnerable to strong winds and heavy precipitation brought up by typhoons, while there are no existing frameworks to access its vulnerability to typhoons in Taiwan. Here, we examine the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons in Taiwan by a novel assessment framework considering 21 indicators organized into three dimensions, including hazard, exposure/sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The 21 indicators are derived from the Sentinel-2 MSI data obtained from European Space Agency (ESA), typhoon data acquired from Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), and census data achieved by the government official sites of Taiwan. Google Earth Engine and GIS are used to analyze the deviation of UGS variables. Five major metropolitan areas of Taiwan are selected as the study sites, consisting of Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, and Kaohsiung cities. Interestingly, it is found that (i) There exists a great spatial gap between hazard levels and the top-priority regions to enhance the strategies and adaptive capacity in order to better respond to typhoons in Taiwan; (ii) The Northern and middle parts of Taiwan exhibit high and very high hazard levels since the occurrence frequency and wind speed of typhoons are higher. In contrast, the Southern Taiwan is characterized by low and very low hazard levels occupying over approximately half of the study sites; (iii) Exposure and sensitivity of the UGS in Taiwan vary greatly from very low to very high levels over the study sites with 43 % attributed to high and very high levels; and (iv) 22 % of the metropolitan areas are classified as high and very high vulnerable, mainly distributed over the Taoyuan, Taichung, Taipei, and New Taipei cities. Results suggest that the presented framework is useful in evaluating the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons and implicates proper management of urban trees as a nature-based solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)","Disaster risk reduction; GIS; Sentinel-2 MSI; Typhoons; Urban greenspace (UGS); Vulnerability; Vulnerability assessment framework","census; greenspace; heat island; typhoon; urban ecosystem; vulnerability; wind velocity; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111030133

First, the real-world driving data, instantaneous velocity versus time, in the city was collected using the global positioning system (GPS) technology with the signal update of 1 Hz. Then, a data processing procedure consisting of nine steps was applied to remove errors and to smooth the GPS data. After that, the processed GPS data was used to develop the typical driving cycle for BRT in Hanoi based on the Markov chain theory. Emission factors of air pollutants including CO, CO2, VOC, NOx, SO2, and PM10 were determined based on the developed driving cycle with the use of the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model. The health effect was estimated using the AirQ+ model. It is found that, compared to the regular buses, deploying the BRT in Hanoi can reduce the emissions of air pollutants 17.3–22.6 % and the amount of CO2eq emission up to 22.4 %. It is also indicated that at least 4.8 % of prevalence of bronchitis symptoms in asthmatic children aged 5–14 years, and 2.4 % of total mortality due to all causes except accidents in aged 30+ years in Hanoi can be reduced through deploying the BRT.

These drawbacks are primarily due to the battery, which is generally the heaviest and most expensive component of a BEV. Lightweight measures (strategies to decrease vehicle mass, e.g., by changing materials or downsizing components) lower energy consumption and reduce the amount of battery energy required (and in turn battery costs). Careful selection of lightweight measures can result in their costs being balanced out by a commensurate reduction in battery costs. This leads to a higher efficiency vehicle, but without affecting its production and development costs. In this paper, we estimate the lightweight potential of BEVs, i.e., the cost limit below which a lightweight measure is fully compensated by the cost savings it generates. We implement a parametric energy consumption and mass model and apply it to a set of BEVs. Subsequently, we apply the model to quantify the lightweight potential range (in €/kg) of BEVs. The findings of this paper can be used as a reference for the development of cheaper, lighter, and more energy-efficient BEVs. © 2021 by the authors.

A partial lockdown aimed to mitigate the advance of the virus by raising the social isolation rates, by limiting the operation of several services and the mobility of the population. Thus, this study aims to analyze the relationship between the social isolation index in the city of São Paulo and the emission levels of the main air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, NO, NO2, SO2 and CO), as well as air temperature. We analyzed the data collected from three urban air quality monitoring stations located in the city center of São Paulo from March 16, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The data for 2020 were compared with those of the previous period in 2020 and the same period in the previous 5 years (2015–2019), and also to the city’s official indices of social isolation. The relationships between pollutant concentrations and the social isolation index showed that the decrease in mobility influenced the reduction in air pollution. Pollutants NO2, NOx, NO and CO had the strongest negative associations (Pearson’s correlation = − 0.582; 0.481; − 0.433 and − 0.367, respectively). Our results showed that the partial lockdown (from March 17, 2020, to July 20, 2020) had a positive impact on air quality, with a reduction in the emission of pollutants NO (31.75%), NO2 (20.60%), NOx (27.21%) and CO (29.95%). The greatest reductions in the emission of pollutants were observed when the social isolation index reached an average of 52.20%. Small negative fluctuations in the social isolation index broke the most significant reductions observed at the beginning of social isolation.

The support vector machine–based model order reduction algorithm is used to reduce the number of features of a 34-feature full-order model by evaluating the regression performance of the support vector machine–based model. Then, the support vector machine–based model order reduction algorithm is used to reduce the number of features of the full-order model. Two models for (Formula presented.) emission and break mean effective pressure are developed via model order reduction, one complex model with high accuracy, called high-order model, and the other with an acceptable accuracy and a simple structure, called low-order model. The high-order model has 29 features for (Formula presented.) and 20 features for break mean effective pressure, while the low-order model has nine features for (Formula presented.) and six features for break mean effective pressure. Then, the steady-state low-order model and high-order model are implemented in a nonlinear control-oriented model. To verify the accuracy of nonlinear control-oriented model, a fast response electrochemical (Formula presented.) sensor is used to experimentally study the engine transient (Formula presented.) emissions. The high-order model and low-order model support vector machine models of (Formula presented.) and break mean effective pressure are compared to a conventional artificial neural network with one hidden layer. The results illustrate that the developed support vector machine model has shorter training times (5–14 times faster) and higher accuracy especially for test data compared to the artificial neural network model. A control-oriented model is then developed to predict the dynamic behavior of the system. Finally, the performance of the low-order model and high-order model is evaluated for different rising and falling input transients at four different engine speeds. The transient test results validate the high accuracy of the high-order model and the acceptable accuracy of low-order model for both (Formula presented.) and break mean effective pressure. The high-order model is proposed as an accurate virtual plant while the low-order model is suitable for model-based controller design. © IMechE 2020.","control-oriented model; diesel engine; emissions; Machine learning; model order reduction; support vector machine","Controllers; Diesel engines; Multilayer neural networks; Reduction; Support vector machines; Vectors; Artificial neural network modeling; Brake mean effective pressures; Control oriented models; Mean effective pressure; Model based controller design; Model order reduction; Non linear control; Support vector machine models; Support vector regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087756701

Here, we evaluated the potential of grazing exclosures to contribute to the “4 per 1000” initiative by analyzing the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and sequestration (SCS) rates after their establishment on degraded communal grazing lands in Tigray region of Ethiopia. We selected grazing areas that were excluded from grazing for 5 to 24 years across the three agroecological zones of the region and used adjacent open grazing lands (OGLs) as control. Soil samples were collected from two depths (0–15 cm and 15–30 cm) and SOC and aboveground C stocks were quantified in both exclosures and OGLs. The mean SOC stock and SCS rate in exclosures (0–30 cm) were 31 Mg C ha−1 and 3 Mg C ha−1 year−1, which were respectively 166% and 12% higher than that in the OGLs, indicating a positive restoration effect of exclosures on SOC storage. With increasing exclosure age, SOC stock and SCS rate increased in the exclosures but decreased in the OGLs. Higher SOC stock and SCS rate were recorded in 0–15 cm than in 15–30 cm. The relative (i.e., to the SOC stock in OGLs) rates of increase in SOC stocks (70–189‰ year−1) were higher than the 4‰ year−1 and were initially high due to low initial SOC stock but declined over time after a maximum value of SOC stock is reached. Factors such as aboveground biomass, altitude, clay content and precipitation promoted SOC storage in exclosures. Our study highlights the high potential of exclosures for restoring SOC in the 0–30 cm soil depth at a rate greater than the 4‰ value. We argue that practices such as grazing exclosure can be promoted to achieve the climate change mitigation target of the “4‰” initiative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Land degradation; Organic carbon accumulation; Sink saturation; Space-for-time approach; Tigray region; Tree-mediated carbon sequestration","Climate change; Forestry; Restoration; Soils; Ethiopia; Grazing exclosures; Grazing land; Land degradation; Organic carbon accumulation; Sink saturation; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Space-for-time approach; Tigray region; Tree-mediated carbon sequestration; Organic carbon; carbon; magnesium; organic carbon; agricultural land; bioaccumulation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; grazing pressure; organic carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; altitude; Article; biomass; bioremediation; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecosystem restoration; environmental factor; Ethiopia; grazing; precipitation; priority journal; soil analysis; soil depth; soil property; topography; vegetation; Ethiopia; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103775569

A repeatedly proposed strategy to overcome these limitations is calibration through co-location with public measurement stations. Here we test the idea of using machine learning algorithms for such calibration tasks using hourly-averaged co-location data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter of particle sizes smaller than 10 μm (PM10) at three different locations in the urban area of London, UK. We compare the performance of ridge regression, a linear statistical learning algorithm, to two non-linear algorithms in the form of random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). We further benchmark the performance of all three machine learning methods relative to the more common multiple linear regression (MLR). We obtain very good out-of-sample R2 scores (coefficient of determination) >0.7, frequently exceeding 0.8, for the machine learning calibrated low-cost sensors. In contrast, the performance of MLR is more dependent on random variations in the sensor hardware and co-located signals, and it is also more sensitive to the length of the co-location period. We find that, subject to certain conditions, GPR is typically the best-performing method in our calibration setting, followed by ridge regression and RFR. We also highlight several key limitations of the machine learning methods, which will be crucial to consider in any co-location calibration. In particular, all methods are fundamentally limited in how well they can reproduce pollution levels that lie outside those encountered at training stage. We find, however, that the linear ridge regression outperforms the non-linear methods in extrapolation settings. GPR can allow for a small degree of extrapolation, whereas RFR can only predict values within the training range. This algorithm-dependent ability to extrapolate is one of the key limiting factors when the calibrated sensors are deployed away from the co-location site itself. Consequently, we find that ridge regression is often performing as good as or even better than GPR after sensor relocation. Our results highlight the potential of co-location approaches paired with machine learning calibration techniques to reduce costs of air pollution measurements, subject to careful consideration of the co-location training conditions, the choice of calibration variables and the features of the calibration algorithm. © 2021 Peer Nowack et al.",,"algorithm; calibration; machine learning; nitrous oxide; particulate matter; satellite sensor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113812428

One of the sectors playing an important role in the development of bioeconomy is agriculture, which accounts for the largest part of biomass used as a raw material for producing bioproducts. This paper is an attempt to answer the following questions: What is the essence and significance of the bioeconomy sector in the EU? How significant is agriculture to the bioeconomy sector? What is the potential and competitiveness of agriculture in EU countries? Data used in surveys is sourced from the Data-Modelling platform of agro-economics research and covers the years 2008–2017. The position of agriculture in the bioeconomy was determined based on measures such as level of employment and gross value added (GVA), turnover, while its competitiveness was assessed based on labour productivity. The results of surveys showed that more than 50% of all bioeconomy workers were employed in agriculture. The sector produced nearly 30% GVA and had a more than 18% share in bioeconomy turnover. Member states of the European Union featured diverse agricultural potential. At the same time, the productivity of agriculture was one of the lowest in the bioeconomy sector. The importance of agriculture stems not only from its food function, but also from the production of biomass. However, its social function is equally important, and in the face of escalating environmental problems the function connected with reducing external costs and producing environmental public goods has become complementary. © 2021 by the authors.

The InVEST carbon model was used for estimation and valuation of carbon stock between 2004 and 2028. Results show a 16% decline in carbon stock with a loss of 21 billion US$ under the BAU scenario. On a regional scale, results show a gradual decline in carbon stock in the Coastal and Central regions while other regions exhibited mixed results. This trend can be reversed by the implementation of a REDD + scenario with a possible increase of 1.6% between 2016 and 2028, translating to a gain of 1 billion US$.

Recent traffic emission changes under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated using emerging non-fuel consumption data, such as human mobility data that tech companies reported as AD, due to the unavailability of timely fuel statistics. The use of such unconventional activity data (UAD) might allow us to provide emission estimates in near-real time; however, the errors and uncertainties associated with such estimates are expected to be larger than those of common FFCO2 inventory estimates, and thus should be provided along with a thorough evaluation/validation of the methodology and the resulting estimates. Here, we show the impact of COVID-19 on traffic CO2 emissions over the first six months of 2020 in Japan. We calculated CO2 monthly emissions using fuel consumption data and assessed the emission changes relative to 2019. Regardless of Japan's soft approach to COVID-19, traffic emissions significantly declined by 23.8% during the state of emergency in Japan (April-May). We also compared relative emission changes among different estimates available. Our analysis suggests that UAD-based emission estimates during April and May could be biased by -19.6% to 12.6%. We also used traffic count data for examining the performance of UAD as a proxy for traffic and/or CO2 emissions. We found the assumed proportional relationship between traffic changes and CO2 emissions was not enough for estimating emissions with accuracy, and moreover, the traffic-based approach failed to capture emission seasonality. Our study highlighted the challenges and difficulties in repurposing data, especially ones with limited traceability/reproducibility, for modeling human activities and assessing the impact on the environment, and the importance of a thorough error and uncertainty assessment before using these data in policy applications. © 2021 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to determine and quantify the main drivers of irrigated potato yield variance; as influenced by crop management practices as well as climate and soil factors. Using a locally calibrated crop model (APSIM), three planting dates × three irrigation strategies (plus a non-water limited treatment) were simulated using 30 years of historical weather data across potato production areas in Tasmania, Australia. We used (i) correlation analysis, (ii) variance decomposition and (iii) maps to visualise the spatial decomposition of variance of potato yield. Our results showed that the implementation of potential irrigation compensated for the impact of planting date on climate drivers of simulated yield and changed the most important yield driving factors from irrigation and planting date to global solar radiation (r = 0.69−0.81). Under early-planting, we found positive correlations of simulated yield vs. global solar radiation (r up to 0.75 under high and medium irrigation) and between the simulated yield and rainfall (r up to 0.55 under low irrigation). In general, a mix of negative and positive correlations were found for minimum and maximum temperature depending on soil type. Using variance decomposition analysis, we found that crop management factors explained the greatest yield variance depending on soil type related to plant available water capacity (PAWC). For soils with high PAWC (>200 mm), most variance was explained by global solar radiation (56–62 %) followed by planting date (43–47 %). However, when PAWC values decreased from 242 mm to 94 mm, the contribution of global solar radiation and planting date were reduced from 62 % to 5.8 % and from 47 % to 4.4 %, respectively, and the contribution of irrigation strategy increased from 0.4%–32.5%. We identified a need to quantify and differentiate the variance contribution of environmental and crop management factors on crop yield and within these factors, discriminate the key drivers of yield variance at regional scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Irrigation; Planting date; Regional modelling; Solanum tuberosum L.; Spatial variance","agricultural management; available water capacity; crop yield; environmental effect; irrigation; potato; scale effect; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; Australia; Tasmania; Solanum tuberosum; Tasmania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112490890

This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Perception; Ricardian model and double-hurdle model; Rice production","Climate change; Climate models; Economics; Food supply; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Change perceptions; Climate change impact; Educational levels; Extreme weather; Individual's perception; Nigeria; Ricardian model and double-hurdle model; Rice farmers; Rice production; Selection bias; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106297985

This study draws strength from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) and their impact by 2030. These SDGs encompass pertinent targets on responsible energy consumption (SDG-12), access to clean and affordable energy (SDG-7), and climate change action (SDG-13). Empirical evidence from the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) technique corroborated by the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) technique shows that a percent rise in renewable energy consumption level significantly abates carbon emission among these countries by about 0.26% while growing globalization vis-à-vis a percent increase in openness to trade significantly hampers environmental quality via inducement of carbon emission level by 0.32%. Extended findings from the Granger causality analysis corroborate the significance of the long-run coefficients with regard to the double-edged benefits of renewable energy consumption in enhancing both environmental quality and income levels through lower carbon emission and sustainable economic growth stimulations among the countries. The study confirmed the inverted U-shape relation between income growth and environmental deterioration, thus validating the EKC hypothesis for Turkey and the Caspian countries. This suggests that both blocs are still at the scale stage of their growth trajectory, where the emphasis is focused on increasing income level relative to environmental sustainability. As such, important policy measures were provided in the concluding section of this study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission reduction; EKC; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energy; Trade; Turkey and Caspian countries","action plan; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic growth; empirical analysis; energy use; globalization; Granger causality test; liberalization; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; trade-environment relations; Azerbaijan; Caspian Coast [Iran]; Iran; Kazakhstan; Russian Federation; Turkey; Turkmenistan; Meleagris gallopavo; carbon dioxide; economic development; renewable energy; sustainable development; turkey (bird); Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103415177

Total hardness (TH) ranged from 4 ± 3–6 ± 2 mg/L. Turbidity ranged from 1.0 ± 0.02–4.3 ± 1.32 NTU and redox potential ranged from 37 ± 3–74 ± 10 mV. The values obtained for pH, salinity, temperature, alkalinity, ammonia, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate for the water samples were within the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. Liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction (LLE-SPE) method was utilized for total extraction of PAHs from water samples and analyzed using gas chromatography – flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Individual PAH levels ranged from below the detection limit (BDL) to 33.21 μg/L. Total concentrations of the PAHs varied as BDL–55.11 μg/L have exceeded the maximum admissible concentrations (MAC) of PAHs (0.20 μg/L) for the water standard of the European Union (EU). Diagnostic ratios suggest that target hydrocarbons (HCs) are predominantly from pyrogenic sources. Carcinogenic risks calculated for both adults and children were higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) acceptable cancer risk, and much higher for children, which suggests that children could be liable to cancer through ingestion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carcinogen; Gas chromatography; Physicochemical parameters; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Pyrogenic; Redox potential","Alkalinity; Ammonia; Diseases; Environmental Protection Agency; Extraction; Gas chromatography; Health risks; Ionization of gases; Ionization of liquids; Liquid chromatography; Mineral oils; Phase separation; Pollution; Redox reactions; Sulfur compounds; Flame ionization detection; Liquid-liquid extraction; Maximum admissible concentration; Physicochemical characteristics; Physicochemical parameters; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); United states environmental protection agencies; World Health Organization; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; borehole; concentration (composition); ecosystem health; electrical conductivity; gas chromatography; hardness; health risk; PAH; physicochemical property; redox potential; turbidity; Nigeria; environmental samples (Ammonia)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108403775

As such, urban soils are becoming more important in the delivery of a broad range of ecosystem services (ESs), including carbon storage and climate regulation, biomass provision for food and water flow regulation, and recreational benefits. In this review, we aim to support the development of this emerging research area and, subsequently, support the improved treatment and management of urban soil and ES delivery. We present a systematic review of which ESs have been studied and examine trends in research using a co-occurrence analysis of key terms. We then provide a summary review of current knowledge on ESs and identify the gaps in knowledge. Our review highlights that this is a young, but growing, field of research, with a marked increase in publications since 2014. We found that supporting processes and regulating services were most commonly studied, with 88% and 71% of the papers relating to quantitative studies addressing these, respectively. Cultural, provisioning and water-related ESs were relatively understudied, suggesting key gaps for future research. However, this may be attributable to a disconnection between academic communities rather than a lack of knowledge. Fewer than 20% of quantitative studies addressed more than two ESs simultaneously, leading us to suggest that urban soil multifunctionality is a key area for future research, and highlighting the need to integrate understanding of urban soil ESs across disciplines and professions. In addition to this overarching suggestion, we propose six research gaps and opportunities: further research into biomass provision for food, water-related ESs and cultural ESs; greater geographical representation; further interconnection between research and practitioner communities; and a focus on the future drivers of soil change in urban environments. © 2021 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Multifunctionality; Soil ecosystem services; Soil functions; Sustainability; Urban planning; Urban soils","Ecosystems; Flow of water; Food storage; Soils; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic impacts; Carbon storage; Ecosystem services; Futures researches; Multifunctionality; Quantitative study; Soil ecosystem service; Soil function; Urban areas; Urban soils; Urban planning; academic research; anthropogenic effect; carbon storage; ecosystem service; literature review; recreational development; regulatory approach; soil ecosystem; sustainability; urban ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102969628

However, lighting sources can be an important predictor of personal exposure to HAP in countries with limited access to electricity. We modeled the health and environmental impacts of hypothetical intervention scenarios that replace kerosene-based lighting with renewable electricity in East Africa. Methods: We used comparative risk assessment methods to quantify the ischemic heart disease-, stroke-, lung cancer-, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- and lower respiratory infection-related morbidity and mortality attributable to personal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure due to kerosene-based lighting for residents of East Africa in 2015. We used health and demographic data from the Global Burden of Disease; PM2.5 exposure estimates from a previous study replacing kerosene-based lighting with solar lighting; and exposure-response functions from the literature to estimate the number of deaths and DALYs that could be avoided with increased scaling-up of the lighting source intervention. We estimated avoided black carbon emissions using emission factors from published literature. Results: We estimated that 6218, 10,092, 12,723 deaths and 409, 654, 814 hundred thousand DALYs could be avoided if 33%, 66%, and 100% respectively of households using kerosene-based lighting replaced it with electricity in East Africa in 2015. Including lighting fuel in estimates of deaths due to PM2.5 from household air pollution in the region would add a further 9% in addition to those from cooking with solid fuel. Full replacement of kerosene-based lighting with renewable electricity would have reduced black carbon emissions by 4.4 Gg/year or 3957 CO2eq Gg in 2015, with the largest emission reductions in Uganda and Kenya. Conclusion: Kerosene-based lighting is a non-negligible source of HAP in the region and should be included in assessments of the health burden attributable to HAP. © 2021 The Authors","Black carbon; East Africa; Household air pollution; Kerosene lighting; Mortality","Air pollution; Carbon; Emission control; Kerosene; Particulate emissions; Pulmonary diseases; Risk assessment; Black carbon emission; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Comparative risk assessments; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Ischemic heart disease; Lower respiratory infections; Renewable electricity; Response functions; Lighting; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; electricity supply; environmental impact; health impact; health risk; light; mortality; risk assessment; East Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106961324

Analysis of data shows that the degree of impact of climate on yield of rice is varied across different climatic zones in the former state of Andhra Pradesh. Climatic zones which have traditionally higher temperature and lesser rainfall are more susceptible to variations in climate than others. Though the negative impact of temperature is similar among all the zones, there are observable spatial variations and differences in the degrees of impact The study also found that the impact of irrigation is significantly higher in traditionally drier zones than others.

Sundarban-India, the largest contiguous mangrove of the world lost 10.5% of its green during 1930–2013 which primarily converted to rice-based systems. Presently degraded mangrove and adjacent rice ecology in Sundarban-India placed side by side and create typical ecology which is distinct in nature in respect to soil physicochemical properties, carbon dynamics, and microbial diversities. We investigated the structural and functional diversities of bacteria and archaea through Illumina MiSeq metagenomic analysis using V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA gene approach that drives greenhouse gases emission and carbon-pools. Remote sensing-data base were used to select the sites for collecting the soil and gas samples. The methane and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in mangrove (−0.04 mg m−2 h−1 and −52.8 μg m−2 h−1) than rice (0.26 mg m−2 h−1 and 44.7 μg m−2 h−1) due to less availability of carbon-substrates and higher sulphate availability (85.8% more than rice). The soil labile carbon-pools were more in mangrove, but lower microbial activities were noticed due to stress conditions. A unique microbial feature indicated by higher methanotrophs: methanogens (11.2), sulphur reducing bacteria (SRB): methanogens (93.2) ratios and lower functional diversity (7.5%) in mangrove than rice. These could be the key drivers of lower global warming potential (GWP) in mangrove that make it a green production system. Therefore, labile carbon build-up potential (38%) with less GWP (63%) even in degraded-mangrove makes it a clean production system than wetland-rice that has high potential to climate change mitigation. The whole genome metagenomic analysis would be the future research priority to identify the predominant enzymatic pathways which govern the methanogenesis and methanotrophy in this system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial diversity; GHGs emissions; Global warming potential (GWP); Soil carbon pools; Sundarban-India","Bacteria; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Methanogens; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; RNA; Sea level; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Wetlands; Bacterial diversity; Functional diversity; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Global warming potential; Green production; Production system; Soil carbon pool; Sundarban-india; Sundarbans; Global warming; carbon; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; sulfate; sulfur; methane; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; carbon emission; climate change; gene expression; global warming; greenhouse gas; mangrove; microbial activity; RNA; soil carbon; wetland management; ammonia oxidizer; Article; bacterial structures; biodegradation; carbon footprint; Chloroflexi; climate change; controlled study; DNA isolation; ecology; environmental protection; environmental stress; enzyme activity; gas analysis; greenhouse effect; illumina sequencing; mangrove; metagenomics; methanogen; methanogenesis; methanotroph; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; priority journal; Proteobacteria; remote sensing; rice; soil analysis; wetland; whole genome sequencing; agriculture; archaeon; bacterium; ecosystem; genetics; India; Oryza; soil; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Agriculture; Archaea; Bacteria; Ecosystem; India; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103409081

The aim of the study is to optimize wood procurement (upstream of supply chain) of energy and material production in integrated situations, and to consider the effects of production changes on the management of procurement regions. Three scenarios described integrated production situations in a carbon-neutral forest industry: (1) declining export, (2) energy reform, and (3) extensive energy reform. Time-varying capital-, cost-, and energy efficiency of the dynamic wood-flow model affected the competitiveness of the procurement regions. As a novel contribution, energy efficiency was modeled using the price of emission allowance as a cost parameter. The results show the positive effects of the energy reforms, which partly compensate for the declining exports. In addition, it is possible to change wood procurement in the regions in a market-oriented way. Decision makers should optimize purchases, inventories, and procurement resources as business processes, which are also considered success factors for the forest industry in integrated production situations. The strategic solution of extensive energy reform provides a potential approach for carbon-neutral customer-oriented supply chains, but it needs tactical energy efficiency analysis in future studies of sustainability, if the ultimate goal is to implement a carbon-free forest industry and bioeconomy. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparing the estimated warranty-life benefit of 7.9 million tons of GHG reductions to USD 603 million in corresponding rebates results in USD 76 of state incentives per metric ton reduced over the first 100,000/150,000 miles of rebated vehicle use. Uncertainty in estimates presents opportunities for further refinement using additional participant-specific, time-variant, or otherwise detailed inputs. Nevertheless, the contributions of this work increased average first-year GHG reductions per vehicle by 35–45% compared to previous work, demonstrating that use of program-derived data can enhance the understanding of EV impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

The flame is forced at the inlet with velocity modulation and the coolant is injected from a cooling hole located on the wall at the same temperature as the premixture. FRS cases featuring a combination of blowing ratios, forcing frequencies, position of the cooling hole and the coolant type (air and N2) are studied to understand the effects of these parameters on flame dynamics and CO emissions. The results show a negligible impact of the forcing frequency on the exhaust CO emissions. However, increasing the blowing ratio and the cooling hole streamwise location both increase the exhaust CO emissions. Using air instead of nitrogen as the coolant reduces the CO emission by providing additional oxygen and therefore enhancing CO oxidation. Furthermore, analysis of the CO mass fraction in the near-wall, post-cooling hole region shows a strong dependence on the local temperature and the mixture fraction used as a measure of dilution. CO mass fraction—temperature (YCO- T) scatter plots reveal the same trends as those of one-dimensional (1D) freely-propagating flames at different equivalence ratios up to a limit, identified using a progress variable based on the CO2 mass fraction.

In this study, we experimentally investigated how a cushion bog plant community responded to elevated surface temperature conditions as they are predicted to occur in a future climate. We conducted the study in a cushion bog dominated by Astelia pumila on Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. We installed a year-round passive warming experiment using semicircular plastic walls that raised average near-surface air temperatures by between 0.4 and 0.7g€¯g C (at the 3 of the 10 treatment plots which were equipped with temperature sensors). We focused on characterizing differences in morphological cushion plant traits and in carbon dioxide exchange dynamics using chamber gas flux measurements. We used a mechanistic modeling approach to quantify physiological plant traits and to partition the net carbon dioxide flux into its two components of photosynthesis and total ecosystem respiration. We found that A. pumila reduced its photosynthetic activity under elevated temperatures. At the same time, we observed enhanced respiration which we largely attribute, due to the limited effect of our passive warming on soil temperatures, to an increase in autotrophic respiration. Passively warmed A. pumila cushions sequestered between 55g€¯% and 85g€¯% less carbon dioxide than untreated control cushions over the main growing season. Our results suggest that even moderate future warming under the SSP1-2.6 scenario could decrease the carbon sink function of austral cushion bogs. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"bog; carbon flux; carbon sink; community response; ecosystem response; evergreen tree; global warming; photosynthesis; plant community; soil respiration; Southern Hemisphere; surface temperature; Argentina; Patagonia; Tierra del Fuego [(PRV) Argentina]; Astelia pumila; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113875207

Historically, TYR activity has been blocked by anoxia resulting from persistent waterlogging; however, recent events of prolonged summer drought have boosted TYR activity and, consequently, the release of carbon stored in the form of organic compounds from peatlands. Since 30% of the global soil carbon stock is stored in peatlands, a profound understanding of the production and activity of TYRs is essential to assess the impact of carbon dioxide emitted from peatlands on climate change. TYR partial sequences identified by degenerated primers suggest a versatile TYR enzyme community naturally present in peatlands, which is produced by a phylogenetically diverse spectrum of bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. One full-length sequence of an extracellular TYR (SzTYR) identified from a soda-rich inland salt marsh has been heterologously expressed and purified. SzTYR exhibits a molecular mass of 30 891.8 Da and shows a pH optimum of 9.0. Spectroscopic studies and kinetic investigations characterized SzTYR as a tyrosinase and proved its activity toward monophenols (coumaric acid), diphenols (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid), and triphenols (gallic acid) naturally present in peatlands. © 2021 The Authors.

Three distinct types of groundwater have been considered: springs, domestic wells and mine water. The previous stable isotope results (2H/1H and 18O/16O) showed that the recharge source of the groundwater is local meteoric water. All obtained per cent modern carbon (pMC) values are less than 100% which indicates old groundwater or mixture of old groundwaters and modern water coming from precipitation. The distribution of pMC data clearly shows an increasing trend from 40.86% in mine water to values as high as 93% in phreatic water sampled in domestic well. Springs show an intermediate position with pMC values varying from 54.03% to 79.41%. Mean calibrated date vary from 6065 BC to 2553 BC in mine water, from 3754 BC to 186 AC in springs, and from 563 AC to 1354 AC in phreatic water. Non-renewable paleo-waters could not be recognized in the study area. Correlation between pMC values and δ18O values of groundwater allowed to recognize inputs from the late-glacial (Younger Dryas) recharge in the case of mine water and several springs, as well as contributions from modern precipitation in the case of other springs and phreatic water sampled in domestic wells. Using radiocarbon dating for pairs of sampling points allowed the calculation of flow transit velocities of groundwater.

The development of a public charging infrastructure network is a key element for promoting EVs, and with them reducing greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the operation of conventional cars and improving the local environment through reductions in air pollution. This paper discusses the effectiveness, efficiency, and feasibility of city strategic plans for establishing a public charging infrastructure network to encourage the uptake and use of EVs. A holistic analysis based on the Value Creation Ecosystem (VCE) and the City Model Canvas (CMC) is used to visualise how such plans may offer public value with a long-term and sustainable approach. The charging infrastructure network implementation strategy of two major European cities, Nantes (France) and Hamburg (Germany), are analysed and the results indicate the need to involve a wide range of public and private stakeholders in the metropolitan areas.

This study investigates the impact of the lockdown restrictions in India on atmospheric composition, using Sentinel–5Ps retrievals of tropospheric NO2 concentration and ground-station measurements of NO2 and PM2.5 between March–May in 2019 and 2020. Detailed analysis of the changes to atmospheric composition are carried out over six major urban areas (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) measurements in the lockdown year 2020 and pre-lockdown (2015–2019). Satellite-based data showed that NO2 concentration reduced by 18% (Kolkata), 29% (Hyderabad), 32–34% (Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore), and 43% (Delhi). Surface-based concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and AOD also substantially dropped by 32–74%, 10–42%, and 8–34%, respectively over these major cities during the lockdown period and co-located with the intensity of anthropogenic activity. Only a smaller fraction of the reduction of pollutants was associated with meteorological variability. A substantial negative anomaly was found for LST both in the day (−0.16 °C to −1 °C) and night (−0.63 °C to −2.1 °C) across select all cities, which was also consistent with air temperature measurements. The decreases in LST could be associated with a reduction in pollutants, greenhouse gases and water vapor content. Improvement in air quality with lower urban temperatures due to lockdown may be a temporary effect, but it provides a crucial connection among human activities, air pollution, aerosols, radiative flux, and temperature. The lockdown for a shorter-period showed a significant improvement in environmental quality and provides a strong evidence base for larger scale policy implementation to improve air quality. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","AOD; Atmospheric pollutants; LST; Net radiative flux; Water vapor","nitrogen dioxide; air quality; air temperature; COVID-19; land surface; MODIS; policy implementation; surface temperature; urban area; water vapor; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; environmental parameters; greenhouse gas; India; land surface temperature; lockdown; meteorological phenomena; optical depth; pandemic; particulate matter 2.5; temperature; temperature measurement; travel restriction; urban area; water vapor; air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; India; particulate matter; temperature; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107999377

Such changes are being analyzed using data of energy generated from coal and renewable sources and fossil-based daily CO2 emissions. Results revealed that coal-fired (fossil-based) energy generation fell by –13% in March, –29% in April, and –20% in May, and –16.6% in mid-June 2020 as compared with the same period in 2018–2019. Conversely, the renewable energy generation increased by 19% in March, 12% in April, 17% in May, and 7% in June 2020. The share of fossil-based energy fell by –6.55% in 2020 compared with mean levels, which was further offset by increases of renewable energy. India’s daily fossil-based CO2 emissions fell by –11.6% (–5 to –25.7%) by mid-June 2020 compared with mean levels of 2017–2019 with total change in fossil-based CO2 emission by –139 (–62 to –230) MtCO2, with the largest reduction in the industry (–41%), transport (–28.5%), and power (–21%) followed by the public (–5.4%), and aviation (–4%) sectors. If some levels of lockdown persist until December 2020, both energy consumption and CO2 emissions patterns would be below the 2019 level. The nationwide lockdown has led to a reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions and, subsequently, improved air quality and global environment and has also helped in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the local level but not on the global level. With suitable government policies, switching to a cleaner mode of energy generation other than fossil fuels could be a viable option to minimize CO2 emissions under increasing demand for energy. © The Author(s) 2020.","atmospheric CO2 concentrations; coal-based energy; Lockdown; renewable energy","alternative energy; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; energy use; renewable resource; India; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093938589

This study develops a low-cost CO2 instrument called the Seoul National University CO2 Measurement (SNUCO2M) to monitor and analyze intra-city CO2 concentrations over Seoul, Korea. The first step of establishing this low-cost CO2 sensor network involved installing the SNUCO2M at the Yongsan Building (YSB; 113 m MASL) and Namsan Seoul Tower-High (NSTH; 385 m MASL) on October 18, 2018 and July 8, 2019, respectively. For comparison with the SNUCO2M, we utilized CO2 concentrations measured by the Picarro instrument (high-cost CO2 sensor) at Gwanak Mountain (GWA) background measurement site and the lower part of the NST (NSTL). The initial CO2 measurements from the SNUCO2M, show that 1) the SNUCO2M has a 0.71% maximum error range and is sufficient to measure urban atmospheric CO2 concentrations; and 2) the SNUCO2M captures 26.92 and 20.30 ppm of Seoul’s summer and winter time CO2 enhancement compared to the GWA background site. Our results suggest that the low-cost sensors such as SNUCO2M successfully detect urban CO2 characteristics over the megacity and has great potential to replace high-cost sensors with cost and management limitations. © 2020, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.","CO2; Ground observation; Low-cost sensor; Megacity; Urban enhancement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088872458

Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) provides an entry point to examine the intersecting assumptions and politics around climate change and how it is managed. Actors in the REDD+ regime promote particular assumptions about the causality and temporality of climate change, which are often privileged over local ways of being and knowing. Through ten months of ethnographic fieldwork with communities implicated in the Central Suau REDD+ Pilot Project in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG), this research engages with storytelling as a methodology to investigate how people in Suau perceive and perform climate change. While people in Suau draw on a multiplicity of assumptions to make sense of complex socio-ecological change, they often foreground relational assumptions of causality and temporality. By destabilising and problematising the notion of a “common understanding” of climate change, this paper contributes to emerging work on political ontology. The ongoing privileging of categorical causal and temporal assumptions in the REDD+ regime in PNG is political – it not only places blame on subsistence agriculturalists but marginalises relational ways of seeing and addressing climate change. By telling stories, we can open up to the multiplicity of assumptions about how and why climate change is occurring and make space for alternative approaches to manage this change that may avoid reinscribing inequalities. © 2019 The Authors","Causality; Climate change; Papua New Guinea; REDD+; Storytelling; Temporality","climate change; deforestation; emission control; environmental management; governance approach; Milne Bay; Papua New Guinea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072822677

However, the impact of repetitive genomic regions on these inferences has mostly been ignored by masking of repeats. We use the Populus trichocarpa genome (Pop_tri_v3) to show that masking of repeat regions leads to lower estimates of effective population size (Ne) in the distant past in contrast to an increase in Ne estimates in recent times. However, in human datasets, masking of repeats resulted in lower estimates of Ne at all time points. We demonstrate that repeats affect demographic inferences using diverse methods like PSMC, MSMC, SMC++, and the Stairway plot. Our genomic analysis revealed that the biases in Ne estimates were dependent on the repeat class type and its abundance in each atomic interval. Notably, we observed a weak, yet consistently significant negative correlation between the repeat abundance of an atomic interval and the Ne estimates for that interval, which potentially reflects the recombination rate variation within the genome. The rationale for the masking of repeats has been that variants identified within these regions are erroneous. We find that polymorphisms in some repeat classes occur in callable regions and reflect reliable coalescence histories (e.g., LTR Gypsy, LTR Copia). The current demography inference methods do not handle repeats explicitly, and hence the effect of individual repeat classes needs careful consideration in comparative analysis. Deciphering the repeat demographic histories might provide a clear understanding of the processes involved in repeat accumulation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.",,"accumulation; coalescence; comparative study; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; demographic history; genomics; polymorphism; Populus trichocarpa; demography; genomics; human; molecular evolution; nucleotide repeat; plant genome; Demography; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Humans; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108818535

The PMUY may yield large health benefits because of increased LPG use, and more importantly, reduced chulha use, and thus may significantly reduce household air pollution exposures. This research, conducted in a tribal, difficult-to-reach area of Pune District, leveraged PMUY to study the uptake, adoption, usage, and health benefits of LPG. This work highlighted barriers to and facilitators of adoption and sustained LPG usage. Our findings have program implications and need to be addressed to ensure that poor households continue to use LPG as their primary cooking fuel. Our study indicates that most households expressed a desire to own an LPG gas stove but are not aware about the methods to avail the scheme and rely on the local governments to obtain the LPG. The perceived benefits of using LPG differ among people, depending on their own experiences. The most common perceived benefits include ease of use and less time spent on cooking. However, most people are unaware of the severe health effects of HAP, which, if known, might influence their decision to own and use LPG for cooking. The challenges in availing the scheme include varying registration amount, lesser awareness of the document requirements and multiple trips to the distributors' office to fulfil the documentary requirements. Further, the sustained use is hampered by the non-subsidized refills and unavailability of transport facilities for the refill replacement. Further, the beneficiaries are unaware that the subsidy goes towards the repayment of the loan and more clarity is expected from the distributor when availing the scheme. In conclusion, the population in tribal regions is willing to use the LPG regularly if the refill costs are subsidized. Further increasing logistical and financial support to rural distributors will help in better uptake. © 2021","Barriers; Facilitators; LPG; PMUY; Sustained LPG usage","Health; Air pollution exposures; Financial support; Health benefits; Health effects; Local government; Perceived benefits; Poor households; Transport facilities; Liquefied petroleum gas; cooking appliance; energy policy; energy use; governance approach; health impact; liquefied petroleum gas; local government; logistics; sustainability; India; Maharashtra; Pune",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106337691

The use of plants for air pollution mitigation is increasing in popularity, particularly in the form of green wall systems, making the identification and classification of pollution sensitive and tolerant species essential. This study aimed to examine the health of common green wall species exposed to ambient air pollution in situ, and thus to identify tolerant species for use in high pollution environments. To do this, 11 plant species were sampled across 15 outdoor green walls, over a 6 month period, and tested for leaf chlorophyll, pH, relative water content and carbon content. Control glasshouse samples were collected simultaneously. Linear mixed models were used to examine patterns in plant health traits across species. Significant differences in plant health between control and in situ samples were observed, however, plant species were not consistent in their responses across health variables. As such, there no clear distinction of the most tolerant species could be made. As most species showed no significant health differences from pollution exposure, it is reasonable to conclude that all test species were able to withstand pollution exposure at the trial sites without any adverse effects. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Air pollution; Green infrastructure; Green walls; Plant health","ambient air; atmospheric pollution; biochemistry; morphology; physiology; pollution exposure; pollution tolerance; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107692184

Researching how climate variables affect different trees within the same site is a step forward for the management of cork production since current knowledge focusses only on the average tree response. Quantile regression methodology was applied for the first time to a large data set containing measurements of cork growth, sampled in 35 stands across the cork oak distribution area in Portugal. This methodology proved to be useful for testing the hypothesis raised: does climate affect differently the annual cork growth, and ultimately cork thickness of individual trees located in the same stand? Estimating the amount of cork produced by one stand that has the required thickness for the production of natural cork stoppers is essential to support cork oak management. However, no model, before this work, had been developed to provide managers with this information. A downward parabolic relationship between annual cork growth and annual precipitation was determined for all quantiles, with optimum annual average precipitation value ranging from 1103 to 1007 mm. April to August monthly temperatures, spring average temperature or summer average temperature, showed a negative relationship with annual cork growth, in particular for lower quantiles. Maximum annual temperature was shown to negatively affect annual cork thickness, in particular for the trees under the 6th quantile. The ratio between annual precipitation and average temperature, that define the Lang index (LI), showed a downward parabolic relationship with annual cork growth. Best cork growth conditions are found for Lang index values around 60, corresponding for the transition between semi-arid climate and humid climate. The application of the final model developed for estimating cork thickness of an eight years’ cork growth period allowed the prediction and mapping of the percentage of cork suitable for natural cork stopper production. It showed that higher values are expected in the Southern and Central coastal regions and along the Tagus River basin. The Northern coastal and mountain regions, characterised by Lang index values higher to 60 (humid climates), present lower estimated values for the percentage of cork suitable for natural cork stopper production. The estimated values are expected to be reduced under climate change scenarios in the Southern and Central coastal regions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Cork growth index; Cork ring; Cork stopper; Cork thickness; Quercus suber L","climate change; climate effect; deciduous tree; growth rate; growth response; mapping method; prediction; regression analysis; Portugal; Arthrobacter sp.

In these particularly vulnerable communities where the existing infrastructural vulnerabilities faced by residents are exacerbated by the hazards of climate change, multi-level approaches involving more inclusive forms of governance are needed for the implementation of climate action. Drawing from the case of a sanitation upgrading project in the informal settlement of Murray, located in Philippi, Cape Town, this paper adds to current understandings of multi-level rapid climate action in informal settlements by endeavouring to address two gaps in this body of literature. Firstly, this paper demonstrates a link between climate change and sanitation which has received little attention by showing that improving sanitation infrastructure makes communities more resilient to extreme weather events associated with climate change. Secondly, the paper addresses how and by whom rapid climate action can be implemented in complex socio-institutional contexts such as informal settlements where the impacts of climate change are felt particularly strongly. This paper identifies what enabled and constrained climate action in the Murray informal settlement in an attempt to provide lessons for local government from the case of the sanitation upgrading project. Bottom-up initiation of multi-level climate action is dependent on fragile partnerships which require the support and involvement of a skilled and dedicated local government. Nevertheless, cooperative and transparent engagements across levels hold the potential to contribute to transformative adaptation through the establishment of new partnerships and forms of governance which recognise community groups as legitimate stakeholders and acknowledge the importance of lived experiences and mentalities. © 2021 by the authors.

However, monitoring data to analyze these processes is scarce in alpine ecosystems, particularly in the highland tropics. The Andean páramos constitute the coldest biodiversity hotspot on Earth, and their species and ecosystems are among the most exposed and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Here, we analyze for the first time baseline data for monitoring plant phenological dynamics and plant–pollinator networks along an elevation gradient between 4,200 and 4,600 m asl in three mountain summits of the Venezuelan Andes, which are part of the GLORIA monitoring network. We estimated the presence and density of plants with flowers in all the summits and in permanent plots, every month for 1 year. Additionally, we identified pollinators. We calculated a phenological overlap index between species. We summarized the plant–pollinator interactions as a bipartite matrix and represented a quantitative plant–pollinator network, calculating structural properties (grade, connectance, nestedness, and specialization). We also evaluated whether the overall network structure was influenced by differences in sampling effort, changes in species composition between summits, and phenology of the plant species. Finally, we characterized the pollination syndrome of all species. Flowering showed a marked seasonality, with a peak toward the end of the wet season. The overall phenological overlap index was low (0.32), suggesting little synchrony in flowering among species. Species richness of both plants and pollinators decreased along the elevation gradient. Flies, bumblebees, and hummingbirds were the most frequent pollinators in the network, while entomophily and anemophily were the prevailing pollination syndromes. The interaction network in all summits showed high connectance values, significant specialization (H2), and low nestedness. We did not find a significant effect of sampling effort, summit plant species composition, or plant phenology on network structure. Our results indicate that these high tropical alpine plant communities and their plant-pollination networks could be particularly vulnerable to the loss of species in climate change scenarios, given their low species richness and functional redundancy coupled with a high degree of specialization and endemism. © Copyright © 2021 Pelayo, Llambí, Gámez, Barrios, Ramirez, Torres and Cuesta.","alpine ecosystems; animal-plant interactions; GLORIA; plant reproduction; vegetation dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114623692

Wildfires in coniferous forests are becoming more frequent in many regions, potentially causing large C emissions. Repeated low-intensity prescribed fires can mitigate wildfire severity, but repeated combustion may decrease soil C unless compensatory responses stabilize soil organic matter. Here, we tested how 30 years of decadal prescribed burning affected C and nitrogen (N) in plants, detritus, and soils in coniferous forests in the Sierra Nevada mountains, USA. Tree basal area and litter stocks were resilient to fire, but fire reduced forest floor C by 77% (−36.4 Mg C/ha). In mineral soils, fire reduced C that was free from minerals by 41% (−4.4 Mg C/ha) but not C associated with minerals, and only in depths ≤ 5 cm. Fire also transformed the properties of remaining mineral soil organic matter by increasing the proportion of C in a pyrogenic form (from 3.2% to 7.5%) and associated with minerals (from 46% to 58%), suggesting the remaining soil C is more resistant to decomposition. Laboratory assays illustrated that fire reduced microbial CO2 respiration rates by 55% and the activity of eight extracellular enzymes that degrade cellulosic and aromatic compounds by 40–66%. Lower decomposition was correlated with lower inorganic N (−49%), especially ammonium, suggesting N availability is coupled with decomposition. The relative increase in forms of soil organic matter that are resistant to decay or stabilized onto mineral surfaces, and the associated decline in decomposition suggest that low-intensity fires may promote mineral soil C storage in pools with long mean residence times in coniferous forests. © 2021 The Authors.

The main purpose of this paper is to determine the perceptions and experiences of climate change among coastal community residents in the Philippines. This study used a combination of methods, such as participatory mapping exercises, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document analyses. The data, which were primarily collected from three coastal villages in the province of Bulacan, were subjected to a thematic network analysis. The findings revealed four dominant themes pertaining to climate change adaptation in a coastal community setting: vulnerability conditions, risk awareness, risk perceptions, and climate change awareness and perceptions. In particular, it was found out that the communities were exposed to the threats of natural hazards like flood and storm surge. Such exposure highlighted the residents' concerns over the risks of hazards on their livelihoods and properties. The residents also observed the unpredictability and the worsening effects of climate change. With their direct experiences of the natural hazards' impacts and awareness of the presence of risks, residents had undertaken actions to build their adaptive capacity. This study then highlights the value of integrating local knowledge into the mapping exercises, revealing crucial information regarding vulnerabilities, risks, and adaptation practices. © 2021, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

We aimed at assessing the effectiveness of biochar from pruning trees combined with compost from urban solid refuse (USR) to ameliorate the conditions of barren acidic (pH ~5.5) metal(loid) mine tailing soils (total concentrations in mg kg−1: As ~220, Cd ~40, Mn ~1800, Pb ~5300 and Zn ~8600) from Mediterranean semiarid areas and promote spontaneous plant colonization. Two months after amendment addition were enough to observe improvements in chemical and physico-chemical tailing soil properties (reduced acidity, salinity and water-soluble metals and increased organic carbon and nutrients content), which resulted in lowered ecotoxicity for the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus. Recalcitrant organic carbon provided by biochar remained in soil whereas labile organic compounds provided by USR were consumed over time. These improvements were consistent for at least one year and led to lower bulk density, higher water retention capacity and higher scores for microbial/functional-related parameters in the amended tailing soil. Spontaneous growth of native vegetation was favored with amendment addition, but adult plants of remarkable size were only found after three years. This highlights the existence of a time-lag between the positive effects of the amendment on tailing soil properties being observed and these improvements being translated into effective spontaneous plant colonization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Community-level physiological profile; Ecotoxicity; Mine wastes; Organic amendments; Phytomanagement; Soil functionality","calcium ion; carbohydrate; carbon; carboxylic acid; lead sulfide; liquid nitrogen; nitrogen; organic carbon; organic compound; oxidoreductase; pyrite; sodium ion; zinc sulfide; biochar; charcoal; metal; acid mine drainage; biochar; colonization; environmental risk; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean soil; phytoremediation; remediation; semiarid region; soil management; solid waste; tailings; urban pollution; adult plant; Article; autumn; bulk density; catabolism; conductance; ecotoxicity; Enchytraeus crypticus; evapotranspiration; microbial biomass; mine tailings; mine waste; moisture; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; nutrient; particle size; pH; salinity; sandy loam; seasonal variation; semiarid climate; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; soil treatment; spring; summer; temperature; total organic carbon; tree pruning; vegetation; water retention; winter; Zygophyllum; soil; soil pollutant; Enchytraeus crypticus; Invertebrata; Charcoal; Metals; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106385850

Public transport, which is highly dependent on fossil fuels, accounts for 17% of all emissions from the Brazilian energy sector. This paper aims to identify the carbon dioxide emissions reduction potential by switching Curitiba's public transport bus fleet from diesel fueled buses to electric buses. The calculation, which was based on data collected from the system management company and from the literature, was applied into three scenarios. In the first, we estimate the system's CO2 emission for the current fuel choice, diesel; in the second, we consider the adoption of electric buses, by meeting the energy demand with the national energy matrix; and in the third, the demand would be fed by photovoltaic systems. The results indicated a CO2 emission reduction potential of about 81%, 90% and 93%, considering three different analysis: (1) buses energy demand supplied by the national electric matrix in a context of a rainfall worst-case; (2) buses energy demand supplied by the national electric matrix in a context of a rainfall best-case; and (3) energy demand supplied by solar energy. It would represent a reduction of, respectively, 68, 75 or 78 thousand tons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere per year. The results suggest that a switch from fossil fuel run buses to electric buses has a great potential to contribute to decarbonising transport, especially in cities with a large bus fleet and distance traveled. © 2021, Research Centre in Public Administration and Public Services,cademy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania.

Inventory agencies need to include, in national GHG inventories, emission and removal estimates based on scientific data following specific reporting guidance under the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, using the methodologies defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines. Often however, research communities and inventory agencies have approached the problem of climate change from different angles and by using terminologies, metrics, rules and approaches that do not always match. This is particularly true dealing with “Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry” (LULUCF), the most challenging among the inventory sectors to deal with, mainly because of high level of complexity of its carbon dynamics and the difficulties in disaggregating the fluxes between those caused by natural and anthropogenic processes. In this paper, we facilitate the understanding by research communities of the current (UNFCCC) and future (under the Paris Agreement) reporting requirements, and we identify the main issues and topics that should be considered when targeting improvement of the GHG inventory. In relation to these topics, we describe where and how the research community can contribute to producing useful inputs, data, methods and solutions for inventory agencies and policy makers, on the basis of available literature. However, a greater effort by both communities is desirable for closer cooperation and collaboration, for data sharing and the understanding of respective and common aims. © 2021 The Authors","Atmospheric observations; Climate change; Developing countries; Emission estimates; GHG inventory; Research contribution","article; carbon dynamics; climate change; developing country; forestry; France; greenhouse gas; land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105282517

However, a particular challenge has been making seemingly temporally and geographically distant climate change more immediate and local so as to prompt behavioural change. Environmental humanists, anthropologists and historians have tried to address the challenge through analysis of the experiences, philosophies and memories of weather. Archaeology, commonly preoccupied by hard science approaches to climate change, has largely been absent from this conversation. Nevertheless, with its insights into material outcomes of human experiences and relations, it can become integral to the discussion of 'weathering' climate change and historicizing weather. Here, drawing on the subtleties of responses by Ilchamus communities in Kenya and using a mix of historical and archaeological sources, we highlight their experiences of weather since the end of the Little Ice Age and explore the potential of building archaeologies of weather. © 2021 The Author(s).

In a recent manuscript (Rational engineering of single-component heterogeneous catalysts based on abundant metal centers for the mild conversion of pure and impure CO2 to cyclic carbonates; Chemical Engineering Journal 422 (2021) 129930) we have developed strategies to prepare efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides. Such materials consist of dispersions of metal halides (ZnCl2 or SnCl4) on silica support that is further functionalized with ionic liquids bearing nucleophilic halide moieties for cooperative epoxide activation and ring-opening.

Smart parking is one of the building blocks of intelligent mobility, innovative mobility that aims to be flexible, integrated, and sustainable and consequently integrated into a Smart City. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors located in the parking areas or the underground car parks in combination with a mobile application, which indicates to citizens the free places in the different areas of the city and guides them toward the chosen parking, it is possible to reduce air pollution and fluidifying noise traffic. In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street. The proposed approach has been assessed on a real IoT dataset composed by over than 15M of collected sensor records. Obtained results demonstrate that our method outperforms both single predictors and the widely used strategy of the mean providing inherently robust predictions. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","artificial intelligence; Deep learning; internet of things; predictive analytics; smart city","Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Predictive analytics; Smart city; Ensemble techniques; Intelligent mobility; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning approach; Mobile applications; Polluting emission; Robust predictions; Underground car parks; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114274135

In this study we modelled the potential effect of climate change on bat communities within two high-drought risk regions of the world and assessed the magnitude and direction of the predicted shifts in climatic suitability, locating climate change refugia and identifying species at greatest risk of population declines. To do this, we compared climate suitability models for 43 species using three global climate models and three emissions scenarios for current (1950–2000) and future (2061–2080) climates within two regions where droughts are predicted to increase, the Western Palaearctic and Western North America. Our models predicted an overall reduction in bat richness with future climates. Areas projected to support high species richness in the current climate coincided with greatest predicted species loss and greatest future drought risk. For species with the potential to extend their range, high velocity range shifts would be required to keep pace with these changes, particularly in the Western Palaearctic, where additional barriers to movement include seas and areas of high human population density. Predicted refugial zones were limited and occurred in similar areas across continents (montane and high latitude with some coastal areas). The area of climate suitability was predicted to contract for around half of study species, with nine identified as species of conservation concern due to low overlap between current and future modelled ranges. The best-case scenario for bat diversity in semi-arid and dry regions in the future is likely to be reduced species richness, with many species facing rapid range expansion over challenging landscapes to access climatically suitable areas. Conservation of bats in high drought risk regions will likely depend on protection of identified refugia and networks of water sources, as well as global measures to protect biodiversity and human wellbeing, such as reduction in global carbon emissions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bats; Climate change; Drought; Europe; Mediterranean climate; North Africa; North America; Range-shifts; Refugia; Semi-arid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105883039

Most information on soil respiratory responses to temperature comes from laboratory incubations of isolated soils and typically subsamples of individual horizons. Inconsistencies between field and laboratory results may be explained by microbial priming supported by cross-horizon exchange of labile C or N. Such exchange is feasible in intact soil profiles but is absent when soils are isolated from surrounding depths. Here we assess the role of soil horizon connectivity, by which we mean the degree to which horizons remain layered and associated with each other as they are in situ, on microbial C and N substrate use and its relationship to the temperature sensitivity of respiration. We accomplished this by exploring changes in C : N, soil organic matter composition (via C : N, amino acid composition and concentration, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and the δ13C of respiratory CO2 during incubations of organic horizons collected across boreal forests in different climate regions where soil C and N compositions differ. The experiments consisted of two treatments: soil incubated (1) with each organic horizon separately and (2) as a whole organic profile, permitting cross-horizon exchange of substrates during the incubation. The soils were incubated at 5 and 15° C for over 430 d. Enhanced microbial use of labile C-rich, but not N-rich, substrates were responsible for enhanced, whole-horizon respiratory responses to temperature relative to individual soil horizons. This impact of a labile C priming mechanism was most emergent in soils from the warmer region, consistent with these soils' lower C bioreactivity relative to soils from the colder region. Specifically, cross-horizon exchange within whole soil profiles prompted increases in mineralization of carbohydrates and more 13C-enriched substrates and increased soil respiratory responses to warming relative to soil horizons incubated in isolation. These findings highlight that soil horizon connectivity can impact microbial substrate use in ways that affect how soil effluxes of CO2 are controlled by temperature. The degree to which this mechanism exerts itself in other soils remains unknown, but these results highlight the importance of understanding mechanisms that operate in intact soil profiles - only rarely studied - in regulating a key soil-climate feedback. © 2021 Frances A.

The analysed example concerns the trolleybus transport system in Gdynia, in northern Poland, which also partially serves the neighbouring city of Sopot. In the last few years, two bus lines have been electrified with trolleybuses in the In-Motion-Charging technology, which enables operation on sections without an overhead network. Using the actual operational data, a comparative analysis of the emissivity of diesel buses and trolleybuses used on the same lines in an identical operating regime was conducted. Moreover, an attempt was made to estimate the damage costs of the emission of air pollutants for the above-mentioned means of transport. Research has shown that trolleybuses significantly help to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and particulate matter, while increasing sulphur dioxide emissions on the served lines. They also generate lower specific emissions of carbon dioxide compared to diesel buses. However, taking into account the differences in the number of seats in these vehicles, the length of routes result-ing from a need to provide access to the necessary infrastructure and the total amount of kilometres covered on a given route, they may cause higher emissions per year and per the product life cycle than diesel buses. This is related to the unfavourable structure of energy production in Poland, which is dominated by coal sources. The research results clearly show that the use of trolleybuses in public transport contributes to a reduction of the damage costs of the emission of pollutants that amount to approximately EUR (€) 30,000–60,000 per year for the analysed lines. © 2021 by the authors.

Growing the same varieties under these altered climatic conditions often requires mitigation strategies, but quantitative, generalized understanding of the impacts of such strategies can be difficult or time consuming to determine through field trials. This work developed and validated a detailed three-dimensional (3D) model of grape berry temperature that could fully resolve spatial and temporal heterogeneity in berry temperature, and ultimately predict the impacts of potential high berry temperature mitigation strategies such as the use of alternative trellis systems. A novel experimental data set was generated in which the temperature of exposed grape berry clusters was measured with thermocouples at four field sites with different trellis systems, topography, and climate. Experimental measurements indicated that the temperature of shaded berries closely followed the ambient air temperature, but intermittent periods of direct solar radiation could generate berry temperatures in excess of 10∘C above ambient. Validation results indicated that by accurately representing the 3D vine structure, the model was able to closely replicate rapid spatial and temporal fluctuations in berry temperature. Including berry heat storage in the model reduced the errors by dampening extreme temporal swings in berry temperature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biophysical model; Energy balance; Fruit temperature; Grapevine; Three-dimensional model","ambient air; experimental study; simulation; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; three-dimensional modeling; vine; viticulture; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104778922

Therefore, there is a need to find new, locally available and economical nutrient-rich feed resources. By-products from the agri-industry could be one such alternative to improve livestock feed quality. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial population of additive fermented cassava pulp with residues from noodle factory (CN). Four beef cattle at ∼2-3 years of age were randomly assigned according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Four feed treatments had cassava pulp:residue ratios of 0:0 (NCN), 70:30 (CN1), 60:40 (CN2), 50:50 (CN3). In conclusion, feeding with CN at 60:40 might be an alternative to improve rumen fermentation efficiency, estimated energy, apparent digestibility and bacteria population. Aims: The aim of the present study was to determine feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial population of cattle fed additive fermented cassava pulp with residues from noodle factory (CN). Methods: Four beef cattle of ∼2-3 years of age and of initial bodyweight of 150 ± 40 kg were randomly assigned to the following four treatments, according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design: cassava pulp:residue at ratios of 0:0 (NCN), 70:30 (CN1), 60:40 (CN2) and 50:50 (CN3) was added. All animals were fed concentrated 16% crude protein and cassava pulp-residue at 1% of bodyweight of animals. Rice straw, water and mineral salt block were offered ad libitum. Key results: Feed intake and bodyweight change were not affected, while estimated energy intake and nutrient digestibilities increased (P < 0.05) after animals were fed CN2 and CN3. Ruminal pH, ruminal temperature, ammonia nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen were not altered by CN, whereas total volatile fatty acids and the proportion of propionate increased with an increasing proportion of residues from noodle factory (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, methane production was reduced by CN. In addition, bacterial population and efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis were increased (P < 0.05) by CN. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the populations of total bacterial and F. succinogenes increased (P < 0.05), whereas populations of protozoa, R. flavefaciens and R. albus were not significantly different among the treatments. Conclusions: It is concluded that feeding with CN can improve rumen fermentation efficiency, estimated energy, apparent digestibility and bacterial population.

They host unique resources, including diverse collections of plant species growing in natural conditions, historical records, and expert staff, and attract large numbers of visitors and volunteers. Networks of botanical gardens spanning biomes and continents can expand the value of these resources. Over the past decade, research at botanical gardens has advanced our understanding of climate change impacts on plant phenology, physiology, anatomy, and conservation. For example, researchers have utilized botanical garden networks to assess anatomical and functional traits associated with phenological responses to climate change. New methods have enhanced the pace and impact of this research, including phylogenetic and comparative methods, and online databases of herbarium specimens and photographs that allow studies to expand geographically, temporally, and taxonomically in scope. Botanical gardens have grown their community and citizen science programs, informing the public about climate change and monitoring plants more intensively than is possible with garden staff alone. Despite these advances, botanical gardens are still underutilized in climate change research.

However, the fear of range anxiety—that a vehicle has insufficient range to reach its destination—is slowing down the adoption of EVs. The integration of an auxiliary power unit (APU) can extend the range of a vehicle, making them more attractive to consumers. The increased interest in optimizing electric vehicles is generating research around range extenders. These days, many systems and configurations of extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) have been proposed to recover energy. However, it is necessary to summarize all those efforts made by researchers and industry to find the optimal solution regarding range extenders. This paper analyzes the most relevant technologies that recover energy, the current topologies and configurations of EREVs, and the state-of-the-art in control methods used to manage energy. The analysis presented mainly focuses on finding maximum fuel economy, reducing emissions, minimizing the system’s costs, and providing optimal driving performance. Our summary and evaluation of range extenders for electric vehicles seeks to guide researchers and automakers to generate new topologies and configurations for EVs with optimized range, improved functionality, and low emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

A good performing green building is seen as a solution for energy efficiency and environmental protection, but performance of green building is largely affected by maintenance management. Studies have suggested that green buildings might not be performing as intended. While maintenance management has been widely researched, green maintenance performance has rarely been studied. Hence, a systematic literature review was conducted on the integration of green maintenance principles into maintenance performance indicators for green buildings. This review was based on the publication standard, namely RepOrting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) and integrated multiple research designs. Two leading databases (Web of Science and Scopus) were utilized. Based on the data, for green maintenance principles and performance indicators, 4 main aspects were established, namely environment, economy, technical and social with 5 green maintenance principles. For green maintenance performance, 11 green maintenance indicators and 25 sub-indicators were identified. This study has offered significant contribution to the body of knowledge on this topic. The findings explained the importance of integrating green maintenance principles into maintenance performance for green building to ensure desired maintenance performance, as follows: 1) to encourage green building managers to realise their role in maintenance performance; 2) to plan integration strategies according to the desired maintenance performance; and 3) to inform on the knowledge gap existence on specific areas and future studies suggestions. © 2021, University of Malaya.

As ~80% of the existing housing stock is expected to be in use by 2050, low carbon retrofit is essential in meeting climate and fuel poverty targets. Recent policy has failed to deliver retrofit at scale, leading to an emerging movement of grassroots initiatives approaching the challenge through community governance. This paper explores the role of these grassroots initiatives in the UK, identifying and evaluating how they address key barriers associated with delivering retrofit at scale, including engaging households, developing local supply chains and overcoming economic barriers. The research takes a qualitative approach with ten semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives of community practitioners, intermediaries and policymakers. Our findings suggest community-led retrofit is effective at engaging households, can contribute to local supply chain development, help households access financing, and be a valuable delivery partner for local authority fuel poverty schemes. However, while community-led retrofit offers an alternative approach to retrofit governance, it is unlikely to deliver residential retrofit at scale without a broader government programme of financial and regulatory support. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Community; Governance; Policy; Retrofit; United Kingdom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107829885

The progression of aeolian landforms expands arid and barren landscapes, leading to the degradation of adjacent areas. The Gonghe Basin, as a typical plateau with abundant sand sources, is highly sensitive to changes in the local climate conditions. In order to quantify the spatial-temporal variations in the aeolian landforms in the Gonghe Basin, we conducted field surveys and also analyzed twelve remote sensing (Landsat5 TM and Landsat8 OLI) images that sample the Gonghe Basin from 1989 to 2019. In the Gonghe Basin, we identified aeolian landforms such as climbing dunes on the windward slopes of the foothills, checkerboard dunes in the southeastern part of the basin, flat dunes, parabolic dunes and crescent dunes on the east and west sides of Longyangxia Reservoir, shrubby sandbanks on the valley slope in Shazhuyu, Tanggemu, and Indel, and sandy thickets at the bottom of the valley near the Dalian Sea, the Longyangxia Reservoir, and the tributaries of the Yellow River. From 1989 to 2005, the area of the aeolian regions expanded by 816.7 km2, with an annual conversion rate of 0.05%. From 2015 to 2019, the area of the aeolian regions shrunk by 2411.9 km2, with an annual conversion rate of −0.15%. The number and size of the fixed and semi-fixed dunes (e.g. the shrubby sandbanks on the valley slope and the sandy thickets at the bottom of the valley) were more stable than those of the mobile dunes (e.g. the checkerboard dunes, the flat dunes, the crescent dunes, the parabolic dunes, and the climbing dunes). The fixed and semi-fixed dunes were arranged in an irregular ring shape, and the location of the center of gravity of this ring did not change significantly from 1989 to 2019; in this time, the mobile dunes migrated to the northwest. © 2021, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aeolian processes; Center of gravity migration; Gonghe Basin; Remote sensing interpretation; Spatial-temporal variation; Transfer matrix analysis","data interpretation; dune; eolian process; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sediment transport; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Gonghe Basin; Qinghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112593021

The Barents Sea is one of the most productive ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean, seems to be a hot spot of warming, and as such merits special attention. A biogeochemical model is used to simulate phytoplankton variability and dimethylsulfide (DMS) flux in year 2005. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique is used to calibrate the biogeochemical model parameters. The CMIP5 (Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5) model output is used to provide changes in relevant model forcings under 1×CO2 (contemporary) and 4×CO2 (which could be reached by 2100 under worst case greenhouse gas emissions scenarios). Satellite data and meteorological forcings are used to characterize contemporary biophysical conditions in a region of the Barents Sea (70°N-80°N, 30°E-40°E). Under contemporary climate, meteorological forcings are studied for year 2003–2013. Mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) reach a peak in late May and increase from north to south. Sea ice cover (ICE) decreases from March to September and is almost zero after year 2005 in the southern region (70°N-75°N). In the northern region (75°N-80°N), seasonal ice melt is closely related to the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom. In general, the vernal increase of CHL coincides with an increase of sea surface temperature (SST) and decrease in surface wind speed (WIND). Under 4×CO2 climate conditions, spring ICE decreases around 60% and the mixed layer depth (MLD) increases around 112%. The simulated deepening of the mixed layer leads to less favorable light conditions for phytoplankton growth. DMS sea-to-air flux hence decreases annual around 12%–46% due to a delay in the vernal bloom of phytoplankton. However, sea ice melt with concomitant increase in open waters promotes a DMS flux increase of around 9%–20% from May to mid of July. The change in DMS flux is influenced more by deepening of the MLD, rather than the increase in open water due to reduced sea ice cover. Importantly, these results contrast with previous studies that simulated increases in DMS sea-air flux in the Arctic Ocean under warming. © 2021","Barents Sea; Biogeochemical model; Chlorophyll; Dimethylsulfide; Sea ice; Sea-to-air flux","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Sea ice; Springs (components); Surface waters; Wind; Biogeochemical modeling; Biophysical conditions; Mean concentrations; Mixed layer depths; Phytoplankton bloom; Phytoplankton growth; Sea surface temperature (SST); Surface wind speed; Climate change; biogenic emission; chlorophyll a; climate change; CMIP; dimethylsulfide; greenhouse gas; ice cover; simulation; surface wind; warming; wind velocity; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106895749

In this framework, the adsorption-based CO2 post-combustion capture is considered one of the most promising approaches because it can provide remarkable energy savings with respect to the standard amine-based absorption capture. To date, most of the research effort has been devoted to the development of novel cutting-edge adsorbent materials with the primary purpose of enhancing the adsorption capacity and lifetime while reducing the heat of adsorption, thus lessening the energetic requirement of the sorbent regeneration. Anyway, other factors, beyond the sorbents, greatly affect the competitiveness of the CO2 capture based on the adsorption route, namely, the gas-solid contacting system, impacting the sorbent utilization efficiency, and the regeneration strategies, determining most of the global CO2 capture costs. This review describes the state-of-the-art and most recent progresses of the adsorption-based CO2 post-combustion capture. In particular, the first section describes the CO2 adsorption performances of different classes of solid sorbents on the basis of the most important evaluation parameters (equilibrium adsorption capacity, multi-cyclic stability, etc.).

Experimental and numerical modeling were performed to study the effect of different operating conditions, excess air ratio, fuel staging, and NG blending. An optimal experimental design using a response surface methodology was adopted to examine the significance of the operating parameters. Analysis of variance indicates that the regression equation can correctly represent the responses (p-value &lt; 0.0001). It is also indicated that the excess air ratio and percentage of preheated PC have significant effects on NOx emissions (p &lt; 0.005). The optimal conditions were determined to include an excess air ratio of 1.2 and 50% PC injection into the preheating stream. Meeting these conditions, the predicted average NOx emission was 430 ± 3.1 ppm and the average measured NOx emission 436 ± 11.2 ppm, with 6% O2. Moreover, further reduction of NOx emission by up to 50% highlights the beneficial approach of NG co-firing. This design allows intensifying of recirculation and a mixture of fuels and oxidizers appropriate for improving the combustion characteristics significantly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Co-firing; Flame stability; NOx reduction; Preheating approach; Swirl burner","Blending; Coal combustion; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Preheating; Pulverized fuel; Co-firing; Dual-fuels; Environment friendly; Excess air ratios; Flame stability; NO$-x$/ emission; NO$-x$/ reduction; Preheating approach; Pulverized coals; Swirl burner; Coal; coal combustion; coal-fired power plant; experimental design; experimental study; natural gas; numerical method; operations technology; pulverized fuel ash",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104605122

Abstract: In the era of global climate change, plant resources able to tolerate adverse stressful environments particularly drought, heat, cold and salt stresses have immense importance. The adaptation of plants towards different abiotic stresses depend on the coordination and regulation of multiple stress-responsive genes. The tree species vital to arid environments possess a gene pool representing useful characteristics related to abiotic stresses. Utilization and characterization of genetic resources of plants of arid regions can lead to an increase in our knowledge of the genes that are linked to abiotic stress related traits. Prosopis cineraria is an important tree of Indian Thar desert and is able to survive in adverse environmental conditions. Genomics and identification of genomic resources of this important tree species may be useful in determination of its adaptive evolution under adverse environmental conditions. Little progress has been made for this tree species in the area of population genetics, genomic and genetic resources development in the form of transcriptome sequencing, generation of ESTs against the heat and drought stresses, and identification of genomic SSRs. The feasibility of micropropagation as a non-GM biotechnology has also been demonstrated in P. cineraria. In this review, we also compared the genomic resource development in P. cineraria with other Prosopis species and some other model forest tree species like Populus, Eucalyptus, Quercus, Pinus, Picea, Castanea. However, genomic resource developed in P. cineraria is almost negligible comparatively to other model plants and still considered as less studied species. Although, many stress-responsive genes have been identified in a number of model plants, the native plant species grown naturally under harsh environment are rich source of novel abiotic stress-tolerant genes. More efforts are therefore needed to characterise this tree species using most modern genomic, genetic and biotechnological tools. More genomic research would accelerate gene discovery and molecular breeding in P. cineraria and increase its acceptability as classical tree species at global level for abiotic stress tolerance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Abiotic stress; Genomic resources; Micropropagation; Phylogenetics; Population genetics; Transcriptome","Biotechnology; Climate change; Drought; Forestry; Abiotic stress tolerances; Biotechnological tools; Crop improvement program; Environmental conditions; Global climate changes; Population genetics; Prosopis cineraria; Stress-responsive gene; Genes; Biotechnology; Drought; Forestry; Genes; Plants; Prosopis; Stresses; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099603930

Climate change threatens both objectives through potentially compounding supply- and demand-side climate-induced impacts. Uncertainty surrounds each of these future potential impacts. Given long planning horizons, system planners must weigh investment costs against operational costs under this uncertainty. Here, we developed a comprehensive and coherent integrated modeling framework combining physically based models with cost-minimizing optimization models in the power system. We applied this modeling framework to analyze potential tradeoffs in planning and operating costs in the power grid due to climate change in the Southeast U.S. in 2050. We find that planning decisions that do not account for climate-induced impacts would result in a substantial increase in social costs associated with loss of load. These social costs are a result of under-investment in new capacity and capacity deratings of thermal generators when we included climate change impacts in the operation stage. These results highlight the importance of including climate change effects in the planning process. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","climate change; climate impacts; climate mitigation; energy economics; power system modeling","Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Operating costs; Planning; Climate change impact; Electricity system; Integrated model framework; Optimization models; Physically based models; Planning horizons; Supply and demand; Thermal generators; Climate change; climate effect; cost analysis; electricity; energy planning; induced response; article; climate change; economics; electricity; human; investment; uncertainty; Climate Change; Electricity; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113659202

Understanding the relationships between land cover and land use changes and climate change is thus very important. Understanding the interactive and cumulative effects of climate and land-use changes are a priority for urban planners and policy makers. The present investigation is based on Landsat satellite imagery to explore changes in vegetation spatial distribution between the years from 2000 to2018 The methodology is focused on vegetation indexes tracking and algebraic overlay calculation to analyzed vegetation and their spatial differentiation, land cover change pattern, and the relationships between vegetation dynamics and land cover change in Dhofar Governorate. The study results have revealed that the vegetation vigor is lower in all years compared to 2000. The scene of 2010 shows the minimum vegetation vigor, overall. Besides, the investigation shows a statistical relationship between rainfall and the status of the health of vegetation. Monsoon rainfall has an impact of the growth of vegetation. Between 2012 and 2013, the vegetation activity shows a decreasing trend. The analysis diagnoses an area affected by the worst degree of aridity situated in the southeastern of Dhofar Mountains.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we used predefined eligibility criteria to search the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO Host for peer-reviewed published literature that investigated the nexus between COVID-19 and air quality in China. After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts of the retrieved results, two reviewers independently evaluated the relevant data. 35 of 508 studies met our criteria. The majority of the eligible studies reported data from central China (e.g., Wuhan and Hubei Province), and the most frequently measured air pollutant was nitrogen dioxide (NO2; 51 values in 28 studies), followed by fine particulate matter (PM2.5; 49 values in 26 studies). We found evidence of a substantial reduction in air pollution immediately after lockdown measures were implemented, with traffic-related NO2 exhibiting the largest decrease. The reported reductions in air pollution varied by region and period. Specifically, urban, industrial and highly populated areas of China experienced greater improvements in air quality than rural, residential and less populated areas. Additionally, owing to meteorological factors, the effects differed between inland and coastal regions. However, despite the changes, the pollutant concentrations in many regions (e.g., Beijing, where PM2.5 and PM10 levels remained above 100 μg m−3) still exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 24-hour mean guidelines (e.g., 25 μg m−3 and 50 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively). Without the support of adaptive environmental strategies, the recent gains in air quality will be unsustainable. © The Author(s).","2019-nCov; Air contamination; Air pollution; Atmospheric environment; Coronavirus","Environmental management; Nitrogen oxides; Eligibility criterion; Environmental strategy; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological factors; Pollutant concentration; Substantial reduction; Systematic literature review; World Health Organization; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; China; Coronavirus; Scopus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114294705

The in-situ air quality index (AQI) values from cities across the GB have been obtained during pre-lockdown (February, 29 - March 20, 2020) and lockdown phase-1 period to evaluate changes. Non-parametric pairwise comparison is performed to evaluate the significant change in the pollutants including AOD, and quantile regression is used to explore the effect of meteorology on AOD and other pollutants. The results show a significant reduction (p ≤ 0.05) in AOD, BC, OC, SO4, dust, dust particulate matter (PM2.5), sea salt, sea salt PM2.5, and estimated total PM2.5 during the lockdown phase-1 with respect to the reference period. The analysis also reveals that meteorological factors do not play a vital role in the reduction of AOD during the lockdown phase-1 period. The estimated reductions for AOD, BC, OC, SO4, dust, dust PM2.5, sea salt, and sea salt PM2.5 are 33%, 21%, 24%, 20%, 18%, 17%, 64%, and 61%, respectively due to imposition of lockdown measures. As many as 28 cities in the GB have shown substantial improvement in the air quality during the lockdown phase-1 period. The reduction in the emission quantity and subsequent improvement in AQI has opened up a new discourse for combatting the persistent air quality issues for million-plus cities in particular and for the north Indian plain in general. The findings of this study thus provide insightful views to the environmentalists and policymakers for framing better emission policy to deal with the air quality issue. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; Air quality index; COVID-19 lockdown phase-1; Estimated total PM2.5 surface mass concentrations; Ganga river basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108729663

We examined decadal variability in the carbon isotope (δ13C) composition of subfossil zooplankton (Branchiopoda: Cladocera) in seven large clear perialpine lakes, including three previously studied sites, to decipher different patterns in summer surface CO2 concentrations. Generalized additive models were used to examine whether and how these patterns connect to changing nutrient regimes and anthropogenic warming over the past century. In all but one of the lakes shifts in cladoceran δ13C values coincided with turning points in the eutrophication history, broadly implying decreasing summer surface CO2 concentrations driven by phosphorus fertilization of pelagic primary production. Yet where nutrient concentrations remained below mesotrophic levels, the positive relationship between δ13C and phosphorus diminished indicating that the strong biotic control of CO2 concentrations was overwritten, probably by catchment inorganic carbon inputs and internal biochemical processes. Even under extensive nutrient loading, the connection was further weakened in lakes with high catchment to lake area ratio attributable to increased catchment interference and shorter water residence times. Warming of the perialpine region was also imprinted in the isotope records, yet the temperature effects appeared modest and were restricted to three smaller lakes with lower drainage ratios. In these lakes, warming contributed to declining cladoceran δ13C values likely partially driven by epilimnetic deepening increasing CO2 in surface waters. Overall, our results manifest the broad heterogeneity of lake responses to global change and point to the importance of hydrogeomorphic context in shaping the sensitivity and responses of lake CO2 to changing nutrient regimes and warming at the regional scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycling; Climate warming; Eutrophication; Paleolimnology; Stable carbon isotopes; Subfossil Cladocera","Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Eutrophication; Isotopes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Runoff; $+13$/C; C values; Carbon cycling; Carbon dioxides (CO); Climate warming; CO$-2$/ concentration; Global change; Heterogeneous landscapes; Stable carbon isotopes; Subfossil cladocerum; Lakes; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; phosphorus; alpine environment; anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; concentration (composition); decadal variation; eutrophication; global warming; nutrient; paleolimnology; subfossil; zooplankton; Article; biochemistry; catchment area (hydrology); Cladocera; climate warming; concentration (parameter); environmental change; eutrophication; hydrodynamics; lake; priority journal; sediment; temperature sensitivity; trend study; water temperature; Branchiopoda; Cladocera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103974259

The biofuel production involves collecting biomass, breaking down cell wall components followed by the conversion of sugars to ethanol. The lingo-cellulosic biomass comprises 40-50% cellulose, 20-30% hemi-cellulose, and 10-25% lignin. Sorghum is a widely adapted energy crop for biofuel production. Biomass with low lignin, high cellulose, and high hemicellulose contents are exploited to attain maximum biofuel production efficiency. Resistance to lodging, pest, disease, and abiotic stresses related to cell wall components is well documented, and quantitative trait loci were identified to understand these traits' genetic correlation. Selection for reduced lignin and in-creased cellulose content in stover can increase the ethanol yield. The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a complementary approach to evaluating the marker and phenotype associations among large diversity panels. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were scanned to identify loci associated with the traits of interest. In this study, the GWAS was performed on 245 sorghum minicore genotypes to analyze agronomic traits (days to 50%flowering, fresh biomass yield, dry biomass yield) and cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Further, in-silico validation of the candidate genes was performed in a global gene expression data from large-scale RNA sequencing studies in sorghum available in the NCBI GEO database was used. Objective: The objectives of this study are to evaluate native variations in biofuel related agronomic traits and stalk cell wall components and to identify significant SNPs or loci related to the cell wall components. Methods: In this article, an association mapping panel, comprising of 245 sorghum minicore germplasm accessions, was evaluated during two post rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014, and observations were recorded on the whole plot-for days to 50% flowering, fresh biomass yield (tha-1 ), and dry biomass yield (tha-1 ). The biomass of sun-dried plants from both seasons was collected separately, chopped, dried, and ground to powder. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents were determined in the powdered. The content of each of these three components in sorghum was expressed in percent of dry matter. The data on agronomic traits and composition analysis was subjected to Analysis of Variance. For the current study, we remapped the raw GBS data with the sorghum assembly version v3.1. A total of 27,589 SNPs were obtained with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;1% and missing data &lt;50%. The GWAS was performed in a single minicore population using FarmCPU, in R software. The synteny positions of the identified significant SNPs between sorghum and other model crop species viz., maize, switchgrass, and Arabidopsis were represented using CIR-COS software for traits viz., dry biomass yield, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The transcriptome dataset from where sorghum gene atlas studies of grain, sweet, and bioenergy sorghums are available through NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE49879, was used to cross-validate the identified SNPs for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin through GWAS. Results: High broad-sense heritability was exhibited for all the traits in individual seasons along with significant geno-type × environment interaction across seasons except lignin. Association mapping with a P &lt; 1×10−4 revealed genomic regions associated with the-(i) agronomic traits (days to 50% flowering, fresh and dry biomass), and (ii) biochemical traits (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) associated with biofuels production, in individual seasons. Twelve significant SNPs for flowering time, 30 fresh biomass yields, and 24 for dry biomass yield, 25 for cellulose, 7 for hemicellu-lose, and 21 for lignin were identified. CIRCOS plot was constructed to identify and analyze similarities and differences while comparing the sorghum genome with different crops. For cellulose high similarity of &gt;80% was observed for all sorghum gene sequences with the maize homologs. The overall similarity of sorghum homologs with foxtail millet was &gt;65%, for Arabidopsis from 30.6% to 48.6%, and rice from 28.2% to 92.8%. SNPs for hemicellulose displayed maximum similarity to foxtail millet followed by maize. The sequence similarity of lignin SNPs in sorghum was high-est with the maize genome followed by Arabidopsis. Both rice and foxtail millet showed &gt;55% similarity to the sorghum genome. Conclusion: This study reports large variability for agronomic and biofuel traits in the sorghum minicore collection with high heritability. The genetic architecture of cell wall components using the GWAS approach was studied and candidate genes for each component were annotated. These results give a better understanding of the genetic basis of the sorghum cell wall composition. The association analysis identified regions of the genome that could be targeted to enhance the quality of biomass and yield along with the desired composition promoting breeding efficiency for enhanced biofuel yield. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Association mapping; Cellulose; Hemicellulose; Lignin; Manhattan plots; SNP; Sorghum minicore","biofuel; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; transcriptome; agronomic trait; Arabidopsis; Article; bioenergy; biofuel production; biomass; cell wall; computer model; controlled study; cross validation; flowering; foxtail millet; gene frequency; gene identification; gene locus; gene mapping; gene sequence; genome-wide association study; genotype; germplasm; heritability; maize; nonhuman; Panicum virgatum; phenotypic variation; plant breeding; plant environment interaction; plant genome; plant stem; rainy season; rice; sequence homology; single nucleotide polymorphism; sorghum; synteny; biomass; genetics; genome-wide association study; growth, development and aging; plant genome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Biofuels; Biomass; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sorghum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116958786

Advocates suggest that ILAs are viable implementing pathways for addressing global challenges such as biodiversity loss, poverty alleviation, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, we argue that recent advances in ILA research and discourse have tended to emphasize the social and governance dimensions, while overlooking ecological factors and inadequately considering potential trade-offs between the two fields. Objectives: By raising the issue of inadequate integration of ecology in ILAs and providing some general design suggestions, we aim to support and incentivise better design and practice of ILAs, supplementing existing design principles. Methods: In this perspective we draw on the recent literature and our collective experience to highlight the need, and the means, to re-integrate ecology into landscape approaches. Results: We suggest that better incorporation of the ecological dimension requires the integration of two approaches: one focusing on conventional scientific studies of biodiversity and biophysical parameters; and the other focusing on the engagement of relevant stakeholders using various participatory methods. We provide some general guidelines for how these approaches can be incorporated within ILA design and implementation. Conclusion: Re-integrating ecology into ILAs will not only improve ecological understanding (and related objectives, plans and monitoring), but will also generate insights into local and traditional knowledge, encourage transdisciplinary enquiry and reveal important conservation-development trade-offs and synergies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biodiversity conservation; Convention on biological diversity; Ecosystem restoration; Landscape approaches; Landscape ecology; Social-ecological systems","adaptive management; biodiversity; biotic factor; climate change; conservation status; environmental factor; governance approach; integrated approach; landscape ecology; stakeholder; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105999384

The building sector is responsible for one-third of total energy consumption and, notably, construction activities account for 39% of the total carbon emissions in the world. Therefore, nowadays, the promotion of green building concepts is essential for all countries. Typically, the sustainability level of a building is evaluated by specified certification systems through rating assessment tools. The development of national assessment tools is necessary for the developing world due to environmental, social, and economic issues; consequently, a national assessment tool adopted under specific local conditions would provide a more precise assessment. This paper analyzes the rating system of BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, and Green Globes certification systems and discusses their adoption with assessment measures for the existing buildings in Kazakhstan’s reality. The following main criteria were discussed during six roundtable sessions: sustainable site and landscape, energy and carbon footprint reduction, water and wastewater management, indoor environmental quality, sustainable building materials, commissioning, and maintenance. A set of assessment criteria and measures were suggested, and 43 existing buildings were assessed. Only eight buildings reached a high rating level. The “sustainable site and landscape” and “indoor environmental air quality” categories were the categories with the highest scores; otherwise, “energy and carbon footprint reduction” with “water and wastewater management” had the lowest average scores. One of the buildings was evaluated separately by several experts to check the consistency of the suggested assessment measures. This evaluation also provided insight into how the assessors’ knowledge and experience may change the overall rating scores obtained. The most critical issues for the existing buildings in Kazakhstan’s reality were discussed. Despite the widespread adoption of green certification methodology, the application of global certification systems in Kazakhstan remains complicated due to the lack of knowledge and limited awareness. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding how resilient marine organisms respond to OA may help predict how community dynamics will shift as CO2 continues rising. The common slipper shell snail Crepidula fornicata is a marine gastropod native to eastern North America that has been a successful invader along the western European coastline and elsewhere. It has also been previously shown to be resilient to global change stressors. To examine the mechanisms underlying C. fornicata’s resilience to OA, we conducted two controlled laboratory experiments. First, we examined several phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression of C. fornicata in response to pH treatments (7.5, 7.6, and 8.0) throughout the larval stage and then tested how conditions experienced as larvae influenced juvenile stages (i.e., carry-over effects). Second, we examined genome-wide gene expression patterns of C. fornicata larvae in response to acute (4, 10, 24, and 48 h) pH treatment (7.5 and 8.0). Both C. fornicata larvae and juveniles exhibited resilience to OA and their gene expression responses highlight the role of transcriptome plasticity in this resilience. Larvae did not exhibit reduced growth under OA until they were at least 8 days old. These phenotypic effects were preceded by broad transcriptomic changes, which likely served as an acclimation mechanism for combating reduced pH conditions frequently experienced in littoral zones. Larvae reared in reduced pH conditions also took longer to become competent to metamorphose. In addition, while juvenile sizes at metamorphosis reflected larval rearing pH conditions, no carry-over effects on juvenile growth rates were observed. Transcriptomic analyses suggest increased metabolism under OA, which may indicate compensation in reduced pH environments. Transcriptomic analyses through time suggest that these energetic burdens experienced under OA eventually dissipate, allowing C. fornicata to reduce metabolic demands and acclimate to reduced pH. Carry-over effects from larval OA conditions were observed in juveniles; however, these effects were larger for more severe OA conditions and larvae reared in those conditions also demonstrated less transcriptome elasticity.

The estimations were performed for 2028 and 2038, using the State Environmental Agency's official methodology and the fleet evolution was calculated using recent trends. The tested abatement scenarios comprise changes in fuels in light-duty vehicles, buses and trucks, in engine technologies (electric versus internal combustion) and the mode of transportation. Fleet evolution shows a tendency of increase, except for buses. Results show that most pollutant emissions will decrease if no local measure is taken due to fleet renewal and newer vehicles' lower emission factors. Still, greenhouse gases and vehicular anthropogenic heat emissions will increase, contributing to climate change and a more intense urban heat island. The most impacting future scenarios are increased use of ethanol in light-duty vehicles and a change in transportation mode, from cars to buses, decreasing passenger car activity. Considering greenhouse gases emissions, the only scenario that leads to a decrease is an incentive for the use of ethanol. The substitution of internal combustion vehicles by electric vehicles leads to a decrease in emissions; however, because only a small part of the fleet is being changed to electric, its impact is insufficient. Combining all scenarios leads to the best result and is the only case with a decrease in vehicular anthropogenic heat. The method and results presented here support a range of interdisciplinary studies, such as estimations of economic and health impacts, and are useful for urban planners and the society to test the impact of policies before they are implemented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative fuels; Anthropogenic heat; Emission scenarios; GHG emission; Urban mobility; Vehicular emissions","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Buses; Climate change; Combustion; Ethanol; Fleet operations; Internal combustion engines; Urban transportation; Air pollutants; Anthropogenic heat; Emission scenario; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heat emission; Light duty vehicles; Urban mobility; Vehicular emission; Greenhouse gases; alcohol; fuel; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; car use; carbon emission; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; traffic emission; transportation planning; Article; Brazil; car; climate change; combustion; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; heat; human impact (environment); planning; priority journal; traffic and transport; urban area; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104156532

Here we estimated the effect of nine abiotic and biotic factors on local occupancy and an index of abundance (few or chorus) for four amphibian species (Eleutherodactylus wightmanae, E. brittoni, E. antillensis, and E. coqui) in Puerto Rico, USA. We also assessed how the same factors influenced reproductive activity of E. coqui and how species responded to hurricane María (20 September 2017). As predicted, occupancy and abundance of E. wightmanae, E. brittoni and E. coqui were positively and strongly influenced by abiotic covariates (e.g., relative humidity) that characterize high elevation, mesic habitats. E. antillensis exhibited the opposite pattern, with highest probabilities (≥0.6) recorded at ≤300 m and with average relative humidity<75%. Biotic covariates (e.g., canopy cover) had a weak influence on both parameters, regardless of species. High probabilities (≥0.9) of detecting an E. coqui chorus and active nests occurred at sites experiencing average relative humidity of>80% and temperature of ≤26 °C. Moderate to high probabilities of detecting a chorus (0.4–0.7) were recorded at sites with average temperatures>26 °C, but no reproductive activity was detected, implying that monitoring abundance alone could misrepresent the capacity of a local population to sustain itself. The possibility underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between local demographic and environmental parameters in the advent of global warming to help guide monitoring and management decisions, especially for high elevation specialists. Hurricanes can inflict marked reductions in population numbers, but impacts vary by location and species. We found that the abundance (chorus) of E. antillensis and E. brittoni increased after the hurricane, but the abundance of the other two species did not differ between years. Lack of impacts was probably mediated by low structural damage to forest tracts (e.g., 9% canopy loss). Our findings help assess habitat suitability in terms of parameters that foster local population growth, which provides a basis for testing spatio-temporal predictions about demographic rates in potential climate refugia and for designing criteria to help guide managed translocations. © 2021 United States Geological Survey","Abundance; Climate change adaptation; Eleutherodactylus; Global warming; Hurricanes; Occupancy; Puerto Rico; Reproduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105733261

The meta-analysis focuses on experimental studies that included a control condition and measured climate change attitudes among participants in the United States. After a large literature search, 396 effect sizes were retrieved from 76 independent experiments (N = 76,033 participants). Interventions had a small, significant positive effect on attitudes, g = 0.08, 95% CI [0.05, 0.10], 95% prediction interval [-0.04, 0.19], p < .001. Surprisingly, type of intervention was not a statistically significant moderator of this effect, nor was political affiliation. However, type of attitude was a significant moderator: the treatment-control difference in attitudes was smaller for policy support than for belief in climate change, indicating that policy attitudes are more resistant to influence than belief in climate change. Interventions that aimed to induce skepticism (e.g., misinformation) had a significantly stronger average effect on attitudes than did ones that intended to promote belief in climate change, suggesting that belief in climate change is more easily weakened than strengthened. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Climate change; Interventions; Meta-Analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110396553

Our study provides the first assessment of Hg stock trends on the entire Majorca surface, identifying major Hg sources by studying the spatiotemporal soil Hg variation at two successive times (2006 and 2016–17). The Hg soil concentration ranged from 14 to 258 μg kg−1 (mean 52 μg kg−1). Higher concentrations (over 100 μg kg−1) were found in two areas: (i) close to the Alcudia coal-fired power plant; (ii) in the city of La Palma. During the 11-year, the total Hg stock in Majorcan soil increased from 432.96 tons to 493.18 tones (14% increase). Based on a block kriging analysis, soil Hg enrichment due to power plant emissions was clearly detectable on a local scale (i.e. a shorter distance than 18 km from the power plant). Nonetheless, a significant island-wide Hg increase due to diffuse pollution was reported. This result could be extrapolated to other popular tourist destinations in the Mediterranean islands where tourism has increased in recent decades In short, more than 60 tons of Hg have accumulated on Majorca island in 11 years. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-fired power plant; Hg pollution; Mediterranean soil; Soil Hg enriched; Spatial-temporal analysis","Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Food supply; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; Soil pollution; Adverse effect; Coal-fired power plant; Health foods; Hg pollution; Hg sources; Human health; Mediterranean soils; Pollution sources; Soil hg enriched; Spatial temporal analysis; Soils; mercury; coal; mercury; coal-fired power plant; Mediterranean soil; mercury (element); pollutant source; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Article; concentration (parameter); electric power plant; environmental enrichment; human activities; kriging; land use; mercurialism; soil analysis; soil pollution; Southern Europe; Spain; spatiotemporal analysis; trend study; environmental monitoring; human; island (geological); soil; soil pollutant; Southern Europe; Balearic Islands; Majorca; Mediterranean Sea; Spain; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Islands; Mediterranean Islands; Mercury; Power Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106373186

Most assessments of life-cycle GHG emissions from LNG have employed national or regional average emission estimates; however, there is significant variability in emissions across different suppliers and across the natural gas supply chain. This work describes a framework for compiling supplier-specific GHG emission data for LNG, from the producing well to regasification at the destination port. A case study is presented for Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass Liquefaction (SPL) LNG supply chain from production in the United States and delivered to China. GHG emission intensities are estimated to be 30-43% lower than other analyses employing national or regional average emission profiles. The segments driving these differences are gas production and gathering, transmission, and ocean transport. Extending the boundaries of this analysis to the power plant illustrates the effect of fuel switching from coal to natural gas; the effect of fuel switching in China is a 47-57% reduction in GHG emission intensity, cradle through power generation.

Interior dry forests of the southwestern United States face increasing development pressures; however, this region differs from others with well-developed biomonitoring programs in having drier climates and a greater fraction of deposition delivered in dry forms. We measured throughfall N and S deposition at 12 sites in Utah and 10 in New Mexico and co-located collection of 6 lichen species. Throughfall N deposition ranged from 0.76 to 6.96 kg/ha/year and S deposition from 0.57 to 1.44 kg/ha/year with elevated levels near human development that were not predicted by commonly used simulation models. Throughfall N was 4.6 and 1.6 times higher in summer compared with fall-spring in Utah and New Mexico and S deposition was 3.9 and 1.8 times higher in summer. Lichen N and S concentrations ranged from 0.97 to 2.7% and 0.09 to 0.33%. Replicate samples within plots showed high variability in N and S concentrations with within-plot coefficients of variation for N ranging between 5 and 10% and for S between 7 and 15%. In Utah, N and S concentrations in lichen species were correlated with each other in most cases, with R2 ranging from 0.52 to 0.85. N concentrations in Melanohalea exasperatula and Melanohalea subolivacea could be correlated with average annual throughfall N deposition in Utah (R2 = 0.58 and 0.31). Those relationships were improved by focusing on deposition in fall-spring prior to lichen sampling in Utah (R2 for M. exasperatula, M. subolivacea, and X. montana = 0.59, 0.42, and 0.28). In New Mexico, lichens exhibited greater coefficients of variability within plots than between plots and could not be correlated with throughfall N deposition. In neither study area was S correlated between lichens and throughfall deposition, which may be the result of low S deposition over a narrow deposition range or complex lichen assimilation of S. Lichen biomonitoring for N deposition in the region shows promise, but could potentially be improved by sampling more thalli to reduce within-plot variability, repeated lichen collection synchronized with throughfall changeouts to explore temporal variability, and washing lichen collections to distinguish N and S that has been incorporated by the thalli from dry deposition that may accumulate on lichen surfaces. © 2021 The Authors","CMAQ; Energy development; Ion exchange resin samplers; Lichen; Seasonal deposition; TDep; Throughfall","Cost effectiveness; Deposition; Forestry; Ion exchange; Ion exchange resins; Nitrogen; 'Dry' [; CMAQ; Dry forests; Energy development; Ion exchange resin sampler; N-deposition; New Mexico; Seasonal deposition; Tdep; Throughfall; Fungi; bioindicator; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); dry forest; lichen; nitrogen; organic sulfur compound; pollution exposure; seasonal variation; sulfur; throughfall; New Mexico; United States; Utah; Melanohalea exasperatula; Melanohalea subolivacea; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104812810

This, in turn, significantly impacts their planetary emission, yet only limited investigations on the atmospheric effects have so far been conducted. Here, we investigate the heat redistribution caused by this dissociation/recombination reaction, alongside feedback mechanisms between the atmospheric chemistry and radiative transfer, for a planetary and stellar configuration typical of UHJs. To do this, we have developed a time-dependent pseudo-2D model, including a treatment of time-independent equilibrium chemical effects. As a result of the reaction heat redistribution, we find temperature changes of up to ∼400 K in the atmosphere. When TiO and VO are additionally considered as opacity sources, these changes in temperature increase to over ∼800 K in some areas. This heat redistribution is found to significantly shift the region of peak atmospheric temperature, or hotspot, towards the evening terminator in both cases. The impact of varying the longitudinal wind speed on the reaction heat redistribution is also investigated. When excluding TiO/VO, increased wind speeds are shown to increase the impact of the reaction heat redistribution up to a threshold wind speed. When including TiO/VO there is no apparent wind speed threshold, due to thermal stabilization by these species. We also construct pseudo-2D phase curves from our model, and highlight both significant spectral flux damping and increased phase offset caused by the reaction heat redistribution. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","planets and satellites: Atmospheres; planets and satellites: Composition; planets and satellites: Gaseous planets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109013115

In the cities of south-central Chile, households experience extremely high ambient air pollution levels due to massive combustion of wood as fuel for residential heating. To address this problem, in recent years new residential wood stoves—equipped with improved combustion technologies that are designed to be less-polluting—have replaced high-polluting ones. However, users’ behaviour in operating these improved stoves is a key factor that drives actual emissions. When users ‘choke the damper’ to extend the burning time of their wood fuel, it constrains the air flow in the wood stoves and creates a highly polluting combustion process. To address this issue, a behavioural intervention was designed to provide users with real-time feedback on their wood stoves’ air pollution emissions with the goal of ‘nudging’ them to use their stoves in a less polluting way. The intervention consists of an information sign that aligns with the wood stove’s damper lever and informs users about pollution emission levels according to the chosen setting of the wood stove’s damper. The information sign is complemented by the visit of a field assistant that explains the sign and provides an informational flyer (fridge magnet). To assess the effectiveness of this behavioural intervention a randomized controlled trial was conducted with selected households in the city of Valdivia, Chile. Results from this intervention show that households that were provided with the information sign reduced the frequency with which they used the most polluting settings of their stoves, inducing a behavioural change that results in a 10.8% reduction in residential pollution emissions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Air pollution; Behavioural intervention; Environment and development; Field experiment; Wood stoves","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Combustion; Developing countries; Heating; Housing; Wood; Ambient air pollution; Behavioural changes; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion technology; Experimental evidence; Pollution emissions; Randomized controlled trial; Residential heating; Stoves; airflow; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; detection method; equipment; urban pollution; wood; Chile; Los Rios [Chile]; Valdivia; Valdivia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112168615

This plant could form part of every region’s cultural heritage and can be transferred to the next generation. Moreover, Amaranthus is a multipurpose plant that has been identified as a traditional edible vegetable endowed with nutritional value, besides its fodder, medicinal, nutraceutical, industrial, and ornamental potentials. In recent decade Amaranthus has received increased research interest. Despite its endowment, there is a dearth of awareness of its numerous potential benefits hence, it is being underutilized. Suitable cultivation systems, innovative processing, and value-adding techniques to promote its utilization are scarce. However, a food-based approach has been suggested as a sustainable measure that tackles food-related problem, especially in harsh weather. Thus, in this review, a literature search for updated progress and potential uses of Amaranthus from online databases of peer-reviewed articles and books was conducted.

The present study attempted regional climate classification to divide the Borneo region into several homogenous groups based on long-term average climate behavior. Daily gridded rainfall and temperature (Tavg, Tmax, and Tmin) data at 0.25° resolution spanning 56 years (1960–2016) was used. The classification was done using non-hierarchical k-mean and several hierarchical methods, namely, Single, Complete, McQuitty, Average, Centroid, Median, and two algorithms of Ward’s method, wardD, and wardD2. The results showed that k-mean, wardD, and wardD2 were able to classify the climate of Borneo into four zones, namely ‘dry and hot’ (DH), ‘wet and hot’ (WH), ‘wet’ (W), and ‘wet and cold’ (WC) with a considerable difference at the boundaries. Spatial relevancy, stability, and variability of the clusters based on correlation and compromise programming showed that the wardD method was the most likely to yield acceptable results with optimum 4-cluster to partition the area into four principal climate zones. The constructed cluster plot, centroid plot, and probability distribution function (PDF) showed a distinct climatic characteristic between the climate zones in terms of rainfall, temperature, and seasonality.

But what are the effects of conveying that people are angry? And how do they contrast with more traditional norm messages about climate policy support? Here, we investigate whether social norm messaging about collective anger can impact perceptions of consensus and public support for climate mitigation. In a pilot study and two survey experiments (total N = 1529), we find that relative to control messages, normative appeals that convey growing public anger about U.S. inaction on climate change (i.e., dynamic anger consensus messaging) can enhance Americans' consensus estimates of other Americans' climate-related beliefs and support for mitigation policy, and expectations for future climate-mitigating collective action. Moreover, exposure to a dynamic anger consensus message led to similar estimates of Americans’ policy support and belief in climate change as messages that explicitly conveyed public support for climate mitigation (Study 1) or consensus belief in anthropogenic climate change (Study 2). When tailored for a cross-partisan audience, anger consensus messaging was also effective in bolstering personal support for climate mitigation (Study 2). Notably, similar effects were observed across partisan groups. These findings suggest that, by signaling shared motivational states, emotion consensus appeals can enhance expectations for social change, with the potential to mobilize bipartisan support for climate mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion; Normative influence; Policy support; Public opinion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108850334

Almost every expert in the urban sector believes that future cities should be sustainable, smart, and environmentally friendly, where energy is one of the most critical factors to achieve these goals. They also agree that smart and sustainable energy provision for cities requires a comprehensive and responsive legal and policy framework to be in place at the national level. However, this research’s findings reveal a lack of such frameworks for this group of countries. Considering the challenges and unique nature of Low-Income-Developing (LID) countries, there should be a framework based on the realities in these countries. In this research, key challenges of urban and energy sectors of LID countries, specifically Afghanistan, are identified, and a framework for the integration of sustainable and smart energy in the urban planning processes for LID countries is proposed. To make it easily replicable and adaptable for LID countries, the proposed framework is studied and analyzed around Afghanistan’s urban and energy sectors. This is one of the few frameworks of its kind for LID economies to the best of the authors’ knowledge. This framework lays a solid foundation for sustainable and smart energy integration in the urban planning process of developing countries. This study highlights that sustainable and smart energy systems could ensure climate change mitigation and economic growth enhancement but require close cross-sectoral coordination and policy maker’s commitments and involvement. This research will help many existing and emerging cities in the LID countries’ worldwide use and benefit from the proposed framework in their urban planning processes. It also enables policymakers, urban planners and designers, municipalities leadership, and other stakeholders of the urban, energy, and environment sectors to work together and make smart and rational decisions for the future of their cities and lead them towards smart and sustainable cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Tillage strategies change soil physicochemical characteristics, consequently modifying crop yields. Conservation tillage is generally used to improve the soil physicochemical characteristics globally. However, the impact of conservation tillage on different soil depths under wheat cultivation is not well doc-umented. A 3-year study was conducted using a randomized complete block design (RCDB). The objective of this research was to specifically study soil physicochemical indicators (soil bulk density, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, water content, temperature, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, C:N ratio, pH) and (crop yield) in conventional tillage (CT), straw incorporation into the conventionally tilled soil (CTS), no-tillage (NT), and stubble-retention to the no-tilled soil (NTS) measures under wheat monocropping system across different soil layers. Averaged over 0–40 cm soil layer, the results depicted scarce differences among the tillage practices regarding soil bulk density, porosity, water content and hydraulic conductivity. CT increased soil temperature over conservation tillage systems. Overall, conservation tillage improved soil total nitrogen, available phosphorous, total potassium, C:N ratio and yield than CT, whilst it decreased soil pH. We conclude that NTS and CTS are the best strategies to enhance soil health under wheat mono-cropping system conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

The emission of this greenhouse gas may reduce or even offset the environmental gain from energy recovery through anaerobic treatment. We demonstrate here the removal and elimination of these comparably small methane concentrations using an ecologically engineered methanotrophic community harbored in oxygenic photogranules. We constructed a syntrophy between methanotrophs enriched from activated sludge and cyanobacteria residing in photogranules and maintained it over a two-month period in a continuously operated reactor. The novel community removed dissolved methane during stable reactor operation by on average 84.8±7.4% (±standard deviation) with an average effluent concentration of dissolved methane of 4.9±3.7 mg CH4∙l−1. The average methane removal rate was 26 mg CH4∙l−1∙d−1, with an observed combined biomass yield of 2.4 g VSS∙g CH4−1. The overall COD balance closed at around 91%. Small photogranules removed methane more efficiently than larger photogranule, likely because of a more favorable surface to volume ratio of the biomass. MiSeq amplicon sequencing of 16S and 23S rRNA revealed a potential syntrophic chain between methanotrophs, non-methanotrophic methylotrophs and filamentous cyanobacteria. The community composition between individual photogranules varied considerably, suggesting cross-feeding between photogranules of different community composition. Methanotrophic photogranules may be a viable option for dissolved methane removal as anaerobic effluent post-treatment. © 2021","anaerobic digestion; bioaugmentation; Dissolved methane; ecological engineering; effluent polishing; interactions","Dissolution; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Greenhouse gases; RNA; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic effluents; Anaerobic treatments; Community composition; Dissolved methane; Effluent concentrations; Methane concentrations; Standard deviation; Surface-to-volume ratio; Methane; genomic DNA; methane; RNA 16S; RNA 23S; activated sludge; biomass; effluent; greenhouse gas; methane; microbial community; wastewater; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; amplicon; anaerobic digestion; analytic method; Article; biocatalyst; cyanobacterium; effluent; maximum entropy model; methanotroph; methylotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; reactor operation; symbiosis; syntrophy; thermal conductivity; waste water management; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109388358

Terrestrial plants and seaweeds, known as prolific producers of volatiles, harbour a plethora of microbes on their surfaces like phyllosphere of plant leaves and eco-chemosphere of seaweeds, respectively, where complex ecological interactions are regulated through infochemicals. Although plant leaf volatiles have been well-studied for their ecological functions in mediating microbial interactions, seaweed volatiles have been mostly investigated for their roles in climate regulation and with regard to climate change research. However, seaweed volatiles appear to be related to terrestrial plant volatiles both in terms of chemistry and ecology. Synthesis. Evidence supports that seaweed volatiles can have important ecological functions in mediating interactions with microbes on their surface, just like plant leaf volatiles. Based on the existing vast literature on ecological interactions mediated by plant volatiles at phyllosphere and on the very few works on ecological roles of seaweed volatiles at eco-chemosphere, we advocate for the detailed investigation of volatile-mediated interactions regulating microbial colonisation processes on seaweed surfaces. Although of great ecological importance, this new field of research has remained largely unexplored. Thus, we also set directions for future research programs investigating the roles of seaweed volatiles at seaweed–microbe interface. © 2021 The Authors.

We analyzed 754 K-feldspar single-grains from 17 samples from the surface to ∼9 m-depth in a trench located downstream of the Mission Creek catchment. Single-grain luminescence subpopulation ages significantly overlap at least eight times since ∼12.0 ka indicating a common depositional history.

Earlier studies suggested that air pollutants and meteorological factors were considered as the risk factors for acute respiratory infection, which carries harmful pathogens and affects the immunity. The study intended to explore the correlation between air pollutants, meteorological factors, and the daily reported infected cases caused by novel coronavirus in India. The daily positive infected cases, concentrations of air pollutants, and meteorological factors in 288 districts were collected from January 30, 2020, to April 23, 2020, in India. Spearman’s correlation and generalized additive model (GAM) were applied to investigate the correlations of four air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2) and eight meteorological factors (Temp, DTR, RH, AH, AP, RF, WS, and WD) with COVID-19-infected cases. The study indicated that a 10 μg/m3 increase during (Lag0-14) in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 resulted in 2.21% (95%CI: 1.13 to 3.29), 2.67% (95% CI: 0.33 to 5.01), and 4.56 (95% CI: 2.22 to 6.90) increase in daily counts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19)-infected cases respectively. However, only 1 unit increase in meteorological factor levels in case of daily mean temperature and DTR during (Lag0-14) associated with 3.78% (95%CI: 1.81 to 5.75) and 1.82% (95% CI: -1.74 to 5.38) rise of COVID-19-infected cases respectively. In addition, SO2 and relative humidity were negatively associated with COVID-19-infected cases at Lag0-14 with decrease of 7.23% (95% CI: -10.99 to -3.47) and 1.11% (95% CI: -3.45 to 1.23) for SO2 and for relative humidity respectively.

Bifacial modules boost the energy yield by 4% to 15% depending on the module type and ground reflectivity with an average of 9%. The selection of tilt angle depends on several factors, including the geographical location, weather variation, etc. Compared to the variable tilt angle, a constant angle is preferred from the point of view of the cost of installation and the cost of maintenance. This paper proposes a new method for analysing bifacial modules. A simpler rear-side irradiance model is presented to estimate the energy yield of a bifacial solar photovoltaic module. The detailed analysis also explores the optimum tilt angle for the inclined south–north orientation to obtain the maximum possible yield from the module. Taking four regions into account, i.e., Kharagpur, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Thiruvananthapuram, in the Indian climate, we studied several cases. The Kharagpur system showed a monthly rear irradiance gain of 13%, and the Delhi climate showed an average performance ratio of 19.5%. We studied the impact of albedo and GCR on the tilt angle. Finally, the estimated model was validated with the PVSyst version 6.7.6 as well as real field test measurements taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in the USA. © 2021 by the authors.

Precise accounting and characterisation of the losses can assist in developing effective management policies that help to build resilient communities. This study applies trans-disciplinary approaches to assess total, monetary and non-monetary, NHD-related losses, estimated at AUD 156 million per year (2010–2019 average), for Australia’s Northern Territory where bushfires, cyclones, storms and floods are destructive and frequent events. Non-monetary losses, often overlooked or omitted, were estimated at AUD103 million per year, accounting for two-thirds of total disaster-related losses. Marketable losses, estimated at AUD 53 million per year, were inferred, using standard and non-standard datasets, from the Australian Government’s Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, insurance costs (Insurance Council of Australia database), and other relevant sources. Non-monetary losses were accounted for by the loss of ecosystem services from natural systems caused by cyclones and bushfires only, applying ecological economics approaches, but without considering long-term losses over the duration of recovery. This study informs disaster management policies to invest in collective emergency and environmental management planning for reducing NHD risk and building resilience of local communities to manage and prepare for rapidly changing climates. Such an accounting approach is essential in contexts where NHDs disproportionately affect the lives and well-being of disadvantaged remote communities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bushfires; Cost of natural disasters; Cyclones; Floods; Loss from natural disasters; Natural hazard-induced disasters","bushfire; disaster management; flood damage; flooding; local government; natural hazard; policy making; tropical cyclone; Australia; Northern Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103612036

Thus, this work presents a proposal for reducing the emissions, fuel cost, and respiratory disease hospitalizations using environmental cost accounting principles to produce biodiesel production from waste frying oil. In our methodology, we conducted surveys, and collected waste cooking oil samples from local households and restaurants in São Paulo city, Brazil. Then, we produced biodiesel using these samples. Data on air pollutants were collected and correlated with the number of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases and their costs. Our results indicate that 330,000 respiratory disease hospitalizations were recorded in São Paulo city between 2009 and 2018, and the total cost for the Brazilian government reached US $117 million. Improving the city air quality by switching from fossil fuels to biodiesel could reduce the annual number of hospitalizations to 9880 and cost US $3.518 million, because the amount of pollutants emitted from burning fossil fuels was positively correlated with the number of respiratory disease hospitalizations and their costs. Moreover, the emission rates of particulate matter with particles less than 10 and 2.5 µm in diameter exceeded the World Health Organization limits throughout the study period. Using the survey data, we estimated that the average monthly quantity of waste cooking oil was 9794.6 m3, which could generate 9191.2 m3 of biodiesel and produce 239,713 t CO2 of carbon credits. Environmental cost accounting revealed that it would be possible to achieve an annual profit of approximately US $300 million from the sale of excess biodiesel, carbon credits, and glycerine, and fuel acquisition savings which could improve the image of São Paulo city and quality of life of its residents. Thus, we present this as a way to reduce cost and hospitalizations, and increase the number of available hospital beds for other diseases, such as COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.

The knowledge on how N. elegantalis respond to temperature may help in the development of pest management strategies, and in the understanding of the effects of climate change on its voltinism. In this context, this study aimed to select models to describe the temperature-dependent development rate of N. elegantalis and apply the best models to evaluate the impacts of climate change on pest voltinism. Voltinism was estimated with the best fit non-linear model and the degree-day approach using future climate change scenarios representing intermediary and high greenhouse gas emission rates. Two out of the six models assessed showed a good fit to the observed data and accurately estimated the thermal thresholds of N. elegantalis. The degree-day and the non-linear model estimated more generations in the warmer regions and fewer generations in the colder areas, but differences of up to 41% between models were recorded mainly in the warmer regions. In general, both models predicted an increase in the voltinism of N. elegantalis in most of the study area, and this increase was more pronounced in the scenarios with high emission of greenhouse gases. The mathematical model (74.8%) and the location (9.8%) were the factors that mostly contributed to the observed variation in pest voltinism. Our findings highlight the impact of climate change on the voltinism of N. elegantalis and indicate that an increase in its population growth is expected in most regions of the study area.

This paper evaluates both the future impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes and the impacts of climate change on the streamflow and sediment yield in the Tapacurá River basin in northeastern Brazil, using a novel combination of approaches. Projected climate data derived using global circulation model HadGEM2-ES were coupled to regional circulation model ETA-CPTEC/HadCM3 for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), with bias correction. Two future LULC scenarios were generated: (a) optimistic (current LULC), and (b) pessimistic (land use change trends continue), using the multilayer perceptron algorithm (MP). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to estimate future streamflow and erosion for different periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2099). The SWAT model was calibrated for period of 1995–2003 and validated for 2004–2013. The results showed good accuracy in relation to R2, NSE and PBIAS for the calibration and validation of the runoff, as well as for the verification of the sediment yield. Simulations indicated significant increases in erosion for the pessimistic scenario under RCP 8.5, followed by the pessimistic scenario and RCP 4.5. Lower sediment yields occurred for the optimistic and RCP 8.5, with lower still for the optimistic and RCP 4.5. However, the latter estimates are still considerably higher than baseline conditions. Although higher flows are found for some scenarios, the increases in sediment yield have serious implications for reservoir siltation and storage reduction. Despite modeling uncertainty, the results demonstrate that the proposed methodology has promising scope to contextualize potentially significant regional hydrological changes which have implications for land and biodiversity management and the sustainability of water resources in the Caatinga/Atlantic forest ecotone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Degradation; Erosion; Future scenarios; Hydrologic modeling; Streamflow","caatinga; climate change; ecotone; environmental impact assessment; environmental modeling; future prospect; land cover; land use change; runoff; sediment yield; streamflow; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Pernambuco; Tapacura Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104727261

Air quality issues abound in developing Asian countries, but during COVID-19 lockdowns, urban air quality improved due to the reduction in public mobility and fuel consumption. In Indonesia, the Large-Scale Social Restriction (LSSR) program was implemented to prevent the wider spread of COVID-19, especially in large urban areas. It was not a total lockdown program but had the purpose of reducing urban public mobility. This study investigated the effects of social restrictions on air quality in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data were obtained from our long-term monitoring of fine (PM2.5) and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) and compositions collected at a site in South Jakarta. Other data were obtained from the environmental protection agency’s (EPA’s) air quality monitoring station in Central Jakarta including PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Jakarta measured by a sun photometer and satellite data were used to assess the spatial distribution of AOD across Jakarta. During the first LSSR implementation period from 15 March to 30 May 2020, there were decreased average SO2, CO, NO, NO2, and NOx concentrations of 40 to 60% compared to the same period in 2019. However, O3 increased by 33% likely due to reduction in NOx emissions. The PM2.5 decline reached ~40%, but a similar decline was not observed for PM10. Elemental and black carbon concentration data showed reductions that ranged from 30% to more than 50%. Consistent with the PM observations, both ground and satellite based AOD showed reductions in the aerosol column burden over the city.

We collected crop and livestock management data and associated soil and climatic data from variety of primary and secondary sources outlined below in our methodology. The datafiles on crops and livestock contain model outputs for three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and their global warming potential, which are linked, to the information on crop/livestock management, soil and climatic conditions presented in the supplementary data of the associated manuscript. The datafiles on mitigation potential contain district-level annual GHG mitigation potential by 2030 and 2050 segregated by different crops/livestock types and mitigation options. This dataset is useful for Bangladesh's GHG accounting from the agricultural sector, and can be used to update its nationally determined contributions. Administrative level emissions and mitigation potential estimates segregated by crop-livestock types and mitigation options are useful to prioritize agricultural research and development interventions consistent with food security and environmental goals and to organize agricultural extension and support services to better inform farmers on food production and move towards GHG mitigation goals. © 2021","Climate smart agriculture; Crop; Greenhouse gas; Livestock; Mitigation",,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107933985

We argue that temporality is a key analytical entry point to unpack how energy infrastructure changes. Using the case of transitions to low-carbon mobility in urban transport in Bergen, Norway, we highlight how attention to temporality enables us to not only understand and explain, but also engage with and influence, changes in sociotechnical matters. Empirically, we deconstruct the ongoing development of car-free zones in Bergen's suburban spaces, and show how the temporal organisation of events is a key constraint in the project. Car-free zone planning occurs within a continuously evolving context, with trade-offs between requisite time to build sufficient knowledge, fast-approaching project deadlines, and the timing of parallel synergistic processes. An analytical appreciation of the significance of time in setting and swaying the politics of material change is, we argue, instrumental to both unpacking the black box of sociotechnical matters and to informing and impacting change. © 2021 The Authors","Car-free zones; Energy infrastructure; Sociotechnical matters; Temporality; Urban mobility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106906746

Recently, hydrogen energy becomes one of the key alternatives addressing these concerns under the increasing press effect of the international community. The use of hydrogen as an energy source in ships is provided by fuel cell technologies. Although there are many types of fuel cells, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is the most widely used fuel cell type in the maritime industry. The most important handicap for the use of hydrogen in ships seems to be the production and storage of it. For this reason, fuel cell technology and hydrogen production and storage systems must be developed in order to use hydrogen as the main propulsion system in long-distance transportation in the maritime sector. In this study, Reference Energy System (RES) is established for a chemical tanker ship to determine the current energy flow from various resources to demands. Then the appropriate parameters are assigned and this framework is specified by the respective data. Following this phase; the current situation has been developed as the base scenario and analyzed by using the Low Emission Analysis Programme (LEAP) energy modeling platform. Additionally, two alternative scenarios including the hydrogen-based have been applied against the base scenario to compare the environmental results in the 2017–2050 time period. When the results are evaluated, it is predicted that although it is not sufficient for IMO and EMSA targets, implementation of hydrogen contributes to the carbon emission reduction positively and it will be more beneficial to apply to the main drive system with the technological developments to be made in the near future. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen; LEAP; Reference energy system; Ship energy system analysis; Ship energy system modeling","Digital storage; Emission control; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Ship propulsion; Waterway transportation; Auxiliary power; Fossil resources; Fuel cell technologies; Impact assessments; Low emission analyse program; Maritime transportation; Reference energy system; Ship energy system analyse; Ship energy system modeling; Transportation sector; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108006405

However, limited studies have explored these over oceanic areas close to high anthropogenic activities and emissions. The Bay of Bengal (BoB) basin is one such region adjacent to the highly populated South Asian region. We find that Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over the BoB declined by as much as 0.1 or 30% during the peak lockdown of April 2020 compared to long-term climatology during 2003–2019. Simultaneously, the sea surface temperature (SST) rose by 0.5–1.5°C over the central and north-western parts of the BoB with an average increase of 0.83°C. We show that up to 30% of this observed warming is attributable to reduced atmospheric aerosols.

Here, we assessed carbon stocks, carbon emissions, removals, and reductions due to deforestation and management of the natural (NFs) and plantation forests (PFs) in Southeast Asia. We found that area of NFs declined about 1.09 million ha or 0.52% yr−1 over the last 20 years but only approximately 0.29 million ha was converted to PFs. Between 2000 and 2030, Southeast Asia emitted 477.7 TgCO2 yr−1 from NFs but gained 44.0 TgCO2 yr−1 in PFs. As area of production forest continues to decline, future timber production in the region is likely to come from the PFs. Using the retrospective approach, forest reference emission level in Southeast Asia was estimated at 431.2 TgCO2 yr−1 during the implementation period of the Paris Agreement between 2020 and 2030. If REDD+ activities were implemented to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks, 1922.1 TgCO2 of carbon credits could be achieved and the net carbon revenues were US$8–180 billion between 2020 and 2030 depending on the chosen carbon prices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon credits; Emission reductions; FREL; Plantation forests; Production forests; REDD+; Removals","Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Carbon credits; Carbon emissions; Carbon removal; Carbon stocks; Emission reduction; FREL; Plantation forests; Production forest; REDD+; Southeast Asia; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107261110

The main predictors of climate change response efficacy (CCRE) were PSGC and egalitarianism, followed by risk concern and climate knowledge. Among the facets of mindfulness, observing, and describing were the only ones associated with CCRE. The results found that mindfulness observing predicted response efficacy both directly and through the mediation of risk concern and sense of global community. Conversely, egalitarianism was not a significant mediator. Community psychologists should promote a sense of belonging to all humanity, and a more egalitarian view of the world, beyond risk concern, to increase climate efficacy.

Conservation-focused climate change studies are often conducted on a national or local level and can use different sources of occurrence records (e.g., local databases, national biodiversity monitoring) collated at different geographic extents. However, little is known about how these restrictions in geographic space (i.e., Wallacean shortfall) can lead to restrictions in environmental space (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall) and accordingly affect conclusions about a species’ vulnerability to climate change. Location: Americas with a focus on Mexico. Methods: We present an example study constructing SDMs for three Mexican tree species (Alnus acuminata, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis) using datasets collated at a global (Americas), national (Mexico) and local (cloud forests of eastern Mexico) level to demonstrate the potential effects of a Wallacean shortfall on the estimation of the environmental niche—and thus on a Hutchinsonian shortfall—its projection in space and time and, consequently, on species’ potential vulnerability to climate change. Results: The consequence of using the three datasets was species-specific and strongly depended on the extent to which the Wallacean shortfall affected estimations of environmental niches (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall). Where restrictions in geographic space lead to an underestimation of the environmental niche, vulnerability to climate change was estimated to be substantially higher. Additionally, the restrictions in geographic space may increase the likelihood of issues with non-analogue climates, increasing model uncertainty. Main conclusion: We recommend assessing the extent to which a species’ entire realized environmental niche is captured within the target conservation area, and increasing the geographic extent, if needed, to account for environments and occurrences reflecting potential future conditions. This way, the risk of underestimating the climatic potential of the species (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall), as well as the errors induced by extrapolation into “locally novel” climates, can be minimized. © 2021 The Authors.

Their elevated areas provide essential ecosystem services both for the surrounding mountainous regions and particularly for adjacent lowlands. Impacts of a warmer climate affect these services and have negative consequences on the supply of water, on biodiversity and on protection from natural hazards. Mountain social-ecological systems are affected by these changes, which also influence communities' risk perception and responses to changing climate conditions. Therefore, to understand individual and societal responses to climate change in mountain areas, aspects and drivers of risk perception need to be scrutinised. This article presents the findings of a literature review of recent English language publications on risk perception in connection to climate change and related natural hazards in mountain regions worldwide. Studies were selected from recorded entries in JSTOR, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science covering the period 2000–2019 and analysed in two steps (structured exploratory analysis, n = 249 and in-depth analysis, n = 72) with respect to the studies' research question, methodology, geographical scope and risk perception drivers. The review reveals that socio-demographic factors, like gender, age and personal experiences, have a crucial impact on individual risk perception. Some of the less tangible but nevertheless decisive factors are important in mountain regions such as place attachment and socio-cultural practices. In conclusion, there is however little information in the literature which addresses the specific situation of risk perception in mountain areas and its influence on communities' responses to environmental changes. Further, we observed a strong gap concerning the integration of indigenous knowledge in risk perception research.

These targets have previously been reported as showing evidence for suppressed star formation based on cavities in the narrow H α emission at the location of outflows traced with [O III] emission. Here, we combine the ALMA observations with a re-analysis of the VLT/SINFONI data to map the rest-frame far-infrared emission, H α emission, and [O III] emission. In all targets, we observe high velocity [O III] gas (i.e. W80 - 1000–2000 km s−1) across the whole galaxy. We do not identify any H α emission that is free from contamination from AGN-related processes; however, based on SED analyses, we show that the ALMA data contain a significant dust-obscured star formation component in two out of the three systems. This dust emission is found to be extended over ≈1.5–5.5 kpc in the nuclear regions, overlaps with the previously reported H α cavities and is co-spatial with the peak in surface brightness of the [O III] outflows. In summary, within the resolution and sensitivity limits of the data, we do not see any evidence for a instantaneous shut down of in situ star formation caused directly by the outflows. However, similar to the conclusions of previous studies and based on our measured star formation rates, we do not rule out that the global host galaxy star formation could be suppressed on longer time-scales by the cumulative effect of quasar episodes during the growth of these massive black holes. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: evolution; Infrared: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109513811

While many studies explore factors driving coastal adaptation, generally, few evaluate how residents consider relationships between in situ, protective adaption vs. retreat from at-risk areas. What is the relationship between residents’ exposure, perceptions of climate trends, and concerns about the future? How do these factors influence openness to different adaption strategies? Are these strategies considered to be progressive—where protection is indexed to minor threats and retreat occurs when protection measures fail—or are these dichotomous choices? We apply structural equation modeling to evaluate these decision pathways using a 2017 household survey in North Carolina’s (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula (n = 147). Our results reveal that residents commonly view protection and retreat as mutually exclusive, rather than progressive, methods for reducing risk, and that their preferences are correlated with different understandings of climate threats. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation thresholds; Climate change adaptation; Environmental migration; Flood risk; Structural equation model (SEM)","Climate change; Climate models; Adaptation decisions; Climate trends; Coastal population; Household surveys; North Carolina; Protection measures; Risk areas; Structural equation modeling; Surveys; climate effect; coastal protection; decision making; household survey; numerical model; perception; resident population; Carolina; North Carolina; Puerto Rico; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112739077

However, application of this method to the plant-fossil record currently relies on a series of untested assumptions surrounding the ecological factors driving the response of pollen grains in the contemporary environment. Here, we investigate the relationship of Pinus spp. pollen to UV-B radiation using individuals of five populations sampled from three elevation gradients across Europe. We develop a novel radiation-modelling approach, which allows us to estimate the UV-B radiation dose of individual trees, weighted by different UV-B action spectra. We then use linear mixed-effects modelling to investigate: (a) whether the variations in UV-B-absorbing compounds in Pinus pollen are best described by models using coarser (subgenus) or finer (population) taxonomic levels; and (b) the duration of the period of accumulation of UV-B-absorbing compounds in pollen, ranging from 8 to 28 days. Our results demonstrate an overall positive relationship between para-coumaric acid and UV-B radiation, best described by applying a UV-B-accumulation period spanning 12–19 days. However, we also show clear evidence for population-level factors influencing this relationship across the study locations. Synthesis. Our multidisciplinary approach, which combines expertise from palaeoecology, plant physiology and atmospheric physics, provides clear evidence that pollen-grain chemistry is subject to population-level variations. We suggest that quantitative reconstructions of long-term changes in springtime UV-B radiation are still achievable using fossil reconstructions, but only with careful consideration of the factors leading to pollen representation in sediments. Future improvements are dependent on mechanistic understanding of the local factors which mediate the UV-B response across different populations, and on upscaling knowledge at the plant level to incorporate longer-term chemical variations represented within sediment samples. © 2021 The Authors.

Of the various forms of air pollution, fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5; particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) appears to pose the greatest risk to human health. While even moderate levels of PM2.5 can be detrimental to health, spikes in PM2.5 to atypically high levels are even more dangerous. These spikes are believed to be associated with regionally specific meteorological factors. To quantify these associations, we develop a Bayesian spatiotemporal quantile regression model to estimate the spatially varying effects of meteorological variables purported to be related to PM2.5 levels. By adopting a quantile regression model, we are able to examine the entire distribution of PM2.5 levels; for example, we are able to identify which meteorological drivers are related to abnormally high PM2.5 levels. Our approach uses penalized splines to model the spatially varying meteorological effects and to account for spatiotemporal dependence. The performance of the methodology is evaluated through extensive numerical studies. We apply our modeling techniques to 5 years of daily PM2.5 data collected throughout the eastern United States to reveal the effects of various meteorological drivers. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","conditional autoregressive models; penalized splines; random effects; spatiotemporal modeling","atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; health impact; identification method; industrial development; meteorology; particulate matter; pollution effect; regression analysis; spatial analysis; urban development; United States; Elliptio dilatata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100902775

Such policies concentrate primarily on on-farm development and overlook rich prospects for off-farm diversification. Livelihood diversification of small-scale farmers plays a major role in reducing hunger and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze livelihood diversification in managing catastrophic risks among rural farm households of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. We have interviewed a total of 600 farm households through a standardized questionnaire in two districts (Nowshera and Charsadda) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan that were badly affected by the 2010 flood. For empirical analysis, a logistic regression model was chosen to analyze the important attributes that are correlated to livelihood diversification of the rural households in flood-susceptible areas of Pakistan. The survey findings indicate that 50% of the total sample respondents adopted off-farm livelihood diversification strategies, while 40.5% of farm households adopted on-farm livelihood diversification strategies in managing catastrophic risks. The logistic regression model results show that attributes including socioeconomic and demographic, institutional, and risk perception significantly influenced households’ choices of livelihood diversification. Also, the findings indicated a wide range of livelihood diversification constrained including climatic risks and uncertainties (23%), inadequate natural resources (17%), limited level of skills and training (15%), lack of institutional support (12%), lack of credit facilities (11%), poor infrastructure including markets and roads (16%), and lack of labor availability (4%). The study urges the need for robust climate change adaptation policies, in particular, by aiming at training initiatives, improving access to services, and enhancing institutional assistance, and better infrastructure. The livelihood of small-scale farmers could only improve if the Government pays due consideration and adopts the right policy initiatives that promote the diversification of livelihoods as part of the creation of national jobs to save many lives and improve livelihoods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Climate change; Farm households; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; On-farm/off-farm livelihood diversification; Pakistan","agricultural diversification; catastrophic event; flood damage; household survey; livestock farming; risk perception; rural area; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Nowshera; Pakistan; agricultural worker; agriculture; disaster; flooding; human; Pakistan; Agriculture; Disasters; Farmers; Floods; Humans; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103348666

Despite the magnitude of the threat, surprisingly few climate-related discussions take place on social media. What factors drive online discussions about climate change? In this study, we examined the occurrence of Reddit discussions around three types of climate-related events: natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), political events (i.e., 2016 United States Presidential election), and policy events (i.e., United States’ withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement, release of IPCC report). The objective was to understand how different types of events influence collective action as measured by discussions of climate change. Six large US cities were selected based on the occurrence of at least one locally-relevant natural disaster since 2014. Posts (N = 4.4 million) from subreddits of the selected cities were collected to obtain a six-month period before and after local natural disasters as well as climate-related political and policy events (which applied equally to all cities). Climate change discussions increased significantly for all three types of events, with the highest discussion during the 2016 elections. Further, discussions returned to baseline levels within 2 months following natural disasters and policy events but continued at elevated rates for up to 4 months following the 2016 elections. The findings suggest that collective discussions on climate change are driven more by political leaders’ controversial positions than life-threatening local natural disasters themselves. Implications for collective action are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Shah, Seraj and Pennebaker.","climate change; climate denial; collective action; natural disasters; political leaders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114682960

Air pollution is responsible for millions of deaths and chronic and acute health problems every year, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The fossil‐fuel‐based transportation system releases tons of toxic gases into the atmosphere putting human health at risk, especially in urban areas. This analysis aims to determine the economic burden of environmental and health impacts caused by Highway 401 traffic. Due to the high volume of vehicles driving on the Toronto Highway 401 corridor, there is an annual release of 3771 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). These emissions are mainly emitted onsite through the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuel. The integration of electric and hydrogen vehicles shows maximum reductions of 405–476 g CO2e per vehicle‐kilometer. Besides these carbon dioxide emissions, there is also a large amount of hazardous air pollutants. To examine the impact of air pollution on human health, the mass and concentrations of criteria pollutants of PM2.5 and NOx emitted by passenger vehicles and commercial trucks on Highway 401 were determined using the MOVES2014b software. Then, an air dispersion model (AERMOD) was used to find the concentration of different pollutants at the receptor’s location. The increased risk of health issues was calculated using hazard ratios from literature.

Three indicators—climate natural capacity, urban climate pressure, and urban coordinated development capacity—are used as input factors to study the climate-carrying capacity. The Nemerow index method and comprehensive evaluation method based on entropy weight are employed to calculate inputs. Pollution emissions such as carbon dioxide emissions, waste gas, wastewater, and solid waste pollution are included as energy undesirable outputs, and industry output value is included as a desirable output to calculate the non-radial directional distance of the output of climate-carrying capacity that combines desirable and undesirable outputs. The total factor non-radial directional distance function and energy-environmental non-radial directional distance function are used to obtain the efficiency index of total factor climate-carrying capacity and the efficiency of climate-carrying capacity performance, respectively. These two indices are included in the analysis to estimate the impact of energy undesirable output on climate-carrying capacity. Results from empirical analysis showed that when two types of undesirable outputs, namely waste gas and wastewater outputs, in Shanghai are constrained, the efficiency and performance efficiency of climate environmental carrying capacity are both lower than 0.8, indicating that undesirable outputs had a substantial influence on the climate-carrying capacity. In Shanghai, the major approach to improve the regional climate-carrying capacity is to improve energy efficiency and reduce undesirable outputs of power grid-based economy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climatic environment; Energy undesirable output; Impact assessment; The carrying capacity","carbon dioxide; carrying capacity; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; entropy; index method; performance assessment; smart grid; wastewater; China; Shanghai; China; environmental protection; productivity; solid waste; wastewater; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Efficiency; Solid Waste; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091508958

Tangshan is the largest iron and steel manufacturing city in China, and its air quality rankings belong to the worst 10 among 168 monitored cities of China in a decade. It is extremely important to adopt cleaner production strategies to facilitate high quality development. This study originally created an integrated plan (DOMCLP) to propose feasible pathways to underpin policy making by local authorities and managers from multiple perspectives. These include “Top-Down” measures—financial subsides and environmental efficiency improvement from a macro vision and industrial restructuring from a mezzo vision—and a “Bottom-Up” strategy of optimal technology selection from a micro vision. The DOMCLP simulated the environmental and economic impacts of different cleaner production strategy mixes from 2020 to 2030. Under the cleaner production scenario, which integrates all three measures, the targeted annual economic growth rate can reach 6.56% over the study period without deterioration of the air environment, and air pollutant emissions can be reduced by more than 74%. Meanwhile, the production of the iron and steel industry can achieve a 43% capacity growth, in which the intensity of SO2 and NOX can be reduced by 97 and 87%, respectively. Furthermore, upgrading the optimal air pollutant control technology is proven to be more effective than other incentive measures and calls for systematic optimization and technology choice shift from end treatment to source and process treatment in the long run. This study proves that the integrated cleaner production strategies can realize a strong decoupling effect on the scale of −5.89 to −0.58 to accomplish balanced economic development and environmental improvement in heavily air-polluted cities, which is significant as other industrial cities begin to move toward a high quality development. © 2021 by the authors.

In contrast, renewable energy consumption is shown to negatively impact economic growth. The results reveal explain the reasoning for unimpressive performance of Europe on the front of climate action, and average performance on clean energy, notwithstanding reasonable economic growth.

While there is increasing attention to the temporal dynamics shaping country-specific transition challenges, sub-national level assessments of transition implications, especially in the Global South remain critically under-studied. This is an area of increasing significance due to the highly localised nature of the complex social institutional context shaping global energy futures. India presents a particularly challenging setting for a smooth energy transition. It has one of the world's most ambitious renewable energy development plans. At the same time, its reliance on coal – for reliable and affordable energy, to support its economically upward movement – is expected to continue for several decades. This paper analyses potential bottlenecks to India's decarbonisation plans drawing on a case study in the eastern state of Odisha. It considers coal's deep ties with local and regional economic, industrial, political, and social institutions, that have caused India's sub-national political economies to be deeply complex and multi-dimensional.

To mitigate the nocuous impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and to create a carbon-neutral building stock, alternate lower-GWP refrigerants must also replace the predominant use of R-410A, without re-engineering the mechanical hardware. In this paper, we analyze the performance of lower-GWP alternative refrigerants (R-32, R-452B, R-454B, and R-466A) relative to the conventional R-410A and draw conclusions on the relative performances to meet cooling loads. The simulations are accomplished using the heat pump design model, a well-known, public-domain design tool with a free web interface and downloadable desktop version to support public use and the HVAC R&D community. The contributions contain detailed, hardware-based heat exchanger and system analyses to provide a comprehensive assessment. The results of the simulation are scrutinized from the first (capacity and energy efficiency) and second laws (exergy analysis) to identify sources of systemic inefficiency, the root cause of lost work. This rigorous approach provides an exhaustive analysis of alternate lower-GWP refrigerants to replace R-410A using the same hardware. The results have practical value in engineering heat pumps in an economy that is compelled to alter by the consequences and uncertainties of climate change, to reduce its anthropogenic carbon footprint. © 2021 by the authors.

The influences of commission and carbon trading on the optimal decisions of LCE-SC are discussed and then verified through numerical analysis. On this basis, the influence of carbon trading on regional sustainable development is empirically analyzed. The results show that the establishment of carbon trading pilots alleviates the negative impact of unfair profit distribution. Increasing the commission rate in a reasonable range improves the profitability of LCE-SC. Nevertheless, with the enhancement of consumers’ low-carbon preference, a lower commission rate is more beneficial to carbon emission reduction. The total carbon emission is positively related to the commission rate. However, the unit carbon emission decreases first and then increases with the commission rate. The influence of the carbon price sensitivity coefficient on the service level is first positive and then negative, while the influence on the manufacturer’s profit goes the opposite.

However, understanding the connection between surface heterogeneity and the locations where photogenerated charge carriers are preferentially extracted is challenging. Herein we use single-molecule fluorescence imaging to map the spatial distribution of active regions and quantify the activity for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions on individual bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) nanoplates. Through a coordinate-based colocalization analysis, we quantify the spatial correlation between the locations where fluorogenic probe molecules are oxidized and reduced on the surface of individual nanoplates. Surprisingly, we observed two distinct photochemical behaviors for BiOBr particles prepared within the same batch, which exhibit either predominantly uncorrelated activity where electrons and holes are extracted from different sites or colocalized activity in which oxidation and reduction take place within the same nanoscale regions. By analyzing the emissive properties of the fluorogenic probes, we propose that electrons and holes colocalize at defect-deficient regions, while defects promote the selective extraction of one carrier type by trapping either electrons or holes. Although previous work has used defect engineering to enhance the activity of bismuth oxyhalides and other semiconductor photocatalysts for useful reductive half-reactions (e.g., CO2 or N2 reduction), our results show that defect-free regions are needed to promote both oxidation and reduction in fuel-generating photocatalysts that do not rely on sacrificial reagents. ©",,"Bromine compounds; Carrier mobility; Extraction; Fluorescence imaging; Molecules; Nanostructures; Oxidation; Photocatalytic activity; Probes; Redox reactions; Surface properties; Surface structure; Charge carrier extraction; Oxidation and reduction; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photocatalytic reactions; Photochemical behaviors; Photogenerated charge carriers; Semiconductor photocatalyst; Single molecule fluorescence; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111314784

It is different from the temporary, partial, and limited pollution control measures taken to ensure the regional environmental quality during several important events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). During the COVID-19 epidemic period, extensive movement of people and almost all unnecessary industrial production (necessary industrial production refers to the production of food, epidemic prevention materials, etc.) have been severely restricted, so transportation and industrial production have been greatly reduced. This is a rare extreme emission reduction scenario that presents a unique opportunity for atmospheric research. In this study, based on hourly mass concentration data of NO2 and SO2 from atmospheric monitoring sites in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during the COVID-19 epidemic period, the changes in transportation and industrial production in the region, data statistics, and spatial analysis were used to analyze the pollution changes and their causes. The results indicate that the NO2 and SO2 concentrations in the BTH region decreased significantly during the epidemic period. The spatial distribution pattern of NO2 pollution in the BTH region was “high in the southeast and low in the northwest,” and SO2 pollution in the BTH region was high in the southern and eastern parts of Hebei. The initiation of emergency response level 1 had an obvious effect on reducing NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region, while the impact of emergency response level 2 and below was limited. Compared with the single traffic control, the comprehensive control, similar to the emergency response, had a better effect on reducing NO2 pollution in the region. The control of major large cities in the region also had a certain effect on alleviating NO2 and SO2 pollution in the entire region. Moreover, for activities under short-term control, it is particularly important to guard against the “retaliatory growth” after the control is lifted. By reducing and controlling some polluting industries in industrial production, the degree of NO2 and SO2 pollution in the region can be effectively reduced. The manufacturing industry of chemical raw materials and the chemical products and non-metallic mineral products industry made a great contribution to the change in industrial source pollution emissions in the BTH region during the COVID-19 epidemic. Road traffic emissions remained an important source of NO2 emissions in the BTH region during this period. NO2 emission reduction can be effectively achieved by controlling road traffic and transportation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; COVID-19; NO2; SO2; Variation characteristics","COVID-19; environmental quality; epidemic; industrial production; pollution control; road traffic; spatial distribution; traffic emission; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103604921

According to the national requirements, the emissions of four pollutants, namely sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, need to be counted. The research objective of this paper is to establish a combined model applicable to the emission prediction of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand by analyzing the impact of population factors and industrial distribution on pollutant emissions and combining the grey system theory and neural network theory. According to the characteristics of pollutant discharge in a certain city, a pollutant discharge prediction model based on GM (1,1), GM (0,4) and BP neural network is proposed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BP neural network; GM (1,1); Neural network theory; The grey system theory","Ammonia; Backpropagation; Big data; Emission control; Forecasting; Industrial research; Information systems; Information use; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Predictive analytics; Sulfur dioxide; System theory; Ammonia nitrogen; BP neural networks; Grey system theory; Industrial distribution; Pollutant discharges; Pollutant emission; Research objectives; Risk early warning; Chemical oxygen demand",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112743917

Acetylene is well known as an inhibitor of N2O reductase activity, however, to date, few studies have utilized long-term cultivation with acetylene to achieve denitrifying N2O recovery. This work assessed the performance of N2O production and shifts in the denitrifying community in response to long-term exposure of acetylene during nitrite denitrification. Batch tests showed that long-term exposure to acetylene at high concentrations (volume fraction &gt;40 %) resulted in high N2O accumulation, up to 98.6 %. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene analysis suggested that Saprospiraceae dominated the microbial community at the end of the cultivation period with its abundance increasing from the initial 3.2% to 42.2%. Metagenomic analysis revealed that after the long-term cultivation under high level acetylene, the relative abundance of nosZ in the community did not change significantly. Instead, the nosZⅡ-harboring bacteria became dominant. Batch tests in series demonstrated that N2O reduction could be restored rapidly upon removal of acetylene. This study describes an effective method for high yield production of N2O during nitrite denitrification that can be used to enhance energy recovery and improves our understanding of the long-term effect of acetylene on the denitrifying community. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acetylene; Denitrification; Denitrifying community; Metagenomics; N2O recovery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106296479

Therefore, many countries signed the 《The Paris Agreement》 launched by the United Nations in 2016, aiming at reducing the ecological risk of climate change to the earth and the survival crisis to human beings through various measures. At the same time, the aviation industry has responded positively to the call to reduce carbon emissions with a number of programs. The technology development of hybrid-electric and full-electric powered aircraft has been vigorously promoted. Due to the advantages of low noise, low pollution, high propulsion efficiency and other advantages that traditional aircraft do not have. The distributed leading edge electric power aircraft has improved the comfort and environmental protection of the aircraft, and has become a research hotspot for many research institutions, companies and universities. This paper firstly proposes a kind of distributed propeller electric general aviation aircraft aerodynamic configuration. Then on the basis of this design, Slip Grid Technology is used to complete numerical simulation of propeller slipstream. In this numerical simulation, the Reynolds-averaged Navier - Stokes equations(RANS) and standard mathrm{k}-varepsilon turbulence model are used to complete simulation calculation of aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft in the cruise state, take-off and landing state. Finally the effect of reducing the number of motors on the aerodynamic performance of the wing is studied when the total power of the leading edge motor is constant. The results show that: (1) The propeller slipstream increases the dynamic pressure on the wing surface, and increases the maximum lift-drag ratio and the maximum lift coefficient. (2) When the total power is constant, the slipstream generated by multiple small propellers is stronger than that generated by large propellers, and the lifting capacity is stronger. © 2021 IEEE.","distributed leading edge electric propulsion; full-electric aircraft; propeller slipstream","Civil aviation; Greenhouse gases; Lift; Navier Stokes equations; Numerical models; Propellers; Turbulence models; Wings; Aviation aircrafts; Distributed leading edge electric propulsion; Electric aircrafts; Environmental pollutions; Full-electric aircraft; General aviation; Greenhouses gas; Propeller slipstream; Total power; United Nations; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119085747

Soil organic carbon is the largest carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in global greenhouse gas balance. Enzymatic reaction is the rate-limiting step of SOC degradation. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the heating characteristics and the binding characteristics of SOC and soil enzymes. This relationship is very important for soil carbon sequestration and emission reduction. On this basis, combined with the adaptive weighted data fusion technology, this paper uses the clustering algorithm to optimize the dual sensor cluster to study the active components of mountain soil. With the development and popularization of the Internet, the Internet has become an important part of students’ study and life. A network learning platform can make smartphones become an important learning tool, so that students can learn new methods and teachers can provide new ideas and models of English teaching, and combine information technology to improve the efficiency of English teaching, thus greatly improving the students’ interest in learning. In this context, the traditional teaching evaluation method should be changed, and students should be regarded as the core part of classroom evaluation, so that teachers can have a more complete understanding of students, pay attention to students’ personal needs, and achieve the goal of obtaining high-quality education. Therefore, this paper analyzes how to effectively evaluate English teaching according to informatization, and puts forward several effective strategies. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Active ingredient; Clustering algorithm; English teaching evaluation; Internet; Mountain soil","algorithm; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; information technology; Internet; learning; mountain region; soil carbon",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111540604

However, the state-of-the-art air cathodes suffer from either limited catalytic activity or high cost, which thus hinder their applications. Herein, we designed ZIF-8 derived nitrogen and atomic iron dual-doped porous carbon nanocubes as high-quality catalysts for ORR, through a novel gas-doping approach. The porous carbon nanocubic architecture and abundant Fe-Nx active species endow ZIF-8 derived single atomic iron catalyst (PCN-A@Fe SA) with superior catalytic activity, and surpass Pt/C and a majority of the reported catalysts. Both XAS and DFT calculations suggest that Fe2+N4 moieties are the main active centers that are favorable for oxygen affinity and OH* intermediate desorption, which can result in promising catalytic performance. Most importantly, PCN-A@Fe SA can achieve power density of 514 mW cm−2 as cathodic catalyst in a PEMFC and discharge peak power density of 185 mW cm−2 in an alkaline Zn-air battery. The outstanding performance is derived from both the high specific surface area and high-density of iron single atom in nitrogen doped nanocubic carbon matrix. © 2020 Science Press","Electrocatalysts; Fe single atoms; Fe-Nx sites; Gaseous doping; Oxygen reduction reaction","Atoms; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Cathodes; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Iron; Iron compounds; Nanocatalysts; Nitrogen; Porous materials; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Zinc compounds; Catalytic performance; DFT calculation; Electrocatalytic activity; High specific surface area; Oxygen affinity; Peak power densities; Power densities; State of the art; Zinc air batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097477593

To understand the impact of corrected SST on regional climate simulation, we integrated the experiments using uncorrected (UC_SST) and Bias- and Variance-corrected (BCVC_SST) HadGEM2-AO SST and used the simulated data driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis data and HadGEM2-AO data. Examination of the spatial distribution, statistics, and interannual variation on wintertime precipitation over East Asia indicates that BCVC_SST reduced the overestimation of the climatological mean precipitation. In order to understand the impact of corrected SST on variability, we investigated the relationship between winter snowfall in South Korea and SST over East Asia. The negative correlation coefficient between the winter precipitation and the SST of the seas surrounding Korea appears in the result of observation data. The experiment result using BCVC_SST simulated the negative correlation between the winter snowfall and the SST around Korea more realistically than that of the simulations using UC_SST and HadGEM2-AO data. These results indicate that corrected SST helps to improve the variability of snowfall and SST simulated by HadGEM3-RA. However, time lag about the years when had peak point of SST appeared in the results compared between BCVC_SST experiment and observation data. The peak years shown in the result of the BCVC_SST experiment were similar to that of HadGEM2-AO data. At these results, even though the corrected SST improves climatological mean and variability of simulated data, it has the limitation not to overcome the error such as time lag showed in GCM SST. Additionally, the analysis of the snowfall in South Korea describes that SST is passively used for the source of snowfall and atmospheric variables mainly lead the intensity and the amount of snowfall. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bias- and variance-corrected SST; Cold surge; Dynamical downscaling; HadGEM3-RA; Wintertime precipitation and snowfall",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084484065

To date, no studies have published actual fuel use data, analyzed drivers for the decline of emission intensities (EIs) from in situ oil sands extraction, and evaluated the effectiveness of the cap and trade system in Alberta that aims to control GHG emissions for the world's fourth largest oil production region. This study retrieved operating fuel use data from a public database for 18 in situ oil sands extraction schemes. From 2015 to 2019, the weighted average of fuel use was 0.23 103 m3/m3 undiluted bitumen. The weighted averages of fuel use for the schemes using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) were 0.20 103 m3 fuel/m3 of undiluted bitumen and 0.34 103 m3 fuel/m3 of undiluted bitumen, respectively. The average EIs for SAGD ranged from 0.25 metric ton (t) CO2e/m3 to 0.98 t CO2e/m3, and the average EIs for CSS ranged from 0.61 t CO2e/m3 to 1.18 t CO2e/m3. In addition, the study pointed out that production ramping up and maturity of reservoirs contributed to the decline in EIs. The study concluded that the current Alberta cap and trade system is not effective to control GHG emissions from in situ oil sands extraction. Some operations were rewarded for emission credits because of production increases, rather than actual emission reductions.

As decarbonization efforts accelerate, CCS can target the emissions of large point-source emitters, such as coal- or natural gas-fired power plants, while also supporting the production of renewable or low-carbon fuels. Furthermore, CCS can enable decarbonization of difficult-to-abate industrial processes and can support net CO2 removal from the atmosphere through bioenergy coupled with CCS or direct air capture. Here we review the development of porous materials as next-generation sorbents for CO2 capture applications. We focus on stream- and sector-specific challenges while highlighting case studies within the context of the rapidly shifting energy landscape.

Study focus: Given the effects of climate change on extreme precipitation, updated Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) relationships have been adopted across Canada. Since the IDFs’ generation is based on the assumption of stationarity, the rainfall statistics information may be unreliable. Recent research is attempting to develop a new methodology to integrate non-stationarity and climate change into IDFs updating process. Up to now, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the IDFs updating procedure at different locations. In this study, we analyzed the combined effect of non-stationarity and climate change on future IDFs at six selected gauging stations across Canada. New hydrological insights for the region: A comparison of the updated future IDFs with historical IDFs indicates an intensification of extreme events for all study areas, increasing hazard to them. Sites located in the Northeast coastal region will be the most affected in the future by the extreme precipitation. In addition, there is a clear indication that rare events (100-year return period) will become more frequent (in some cases increase up to 443 % of the water infrastructure risk of failure has been observed). We argue that the above findings (i) offer a new overview of future extreme precipitation across Canada, and (ii) should be considered by the stakeholders with respect to climate change adaptation decisions. © 2021 The Authors","Canada; Climate change; Extreme precipitation; IDF curves; Non-stationarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110609788

However, their use can cause major impacts on the environment, especially on water resources. In this regard, algae have been intensively used as a strategy for remediation and monitoring of environmental pollution due to its efficient absorption of contaminants. In this work, samples of seaweed collected in Niterói/RJ-contaminated with kerosene and diesel-were analyzed by radiocarbon (14C) accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and by n-alkane quantification with gas chromatography to evaluate bioaccumulation in function of the dosage of contaminants. The biogenic content measured by radiocarbon analysis resulted in 95.6% for algae contaminated with 10 mL of kerosene and 67.6% for algae contaminated with 10 mL of diesel. The maximum intensity of n-C17 n-alkane in algae with 5 mL, 10 mL, and 15 mL of diesel was 768.2, 1878.1, and 5699.2 ng.g-1, respectively. While the maximum concentration of n-C27 in algae with 5 mL, 10 mL and 15 mL of kerosene was 3.3, 35.9, and 150.3 ng.g-1. We concluded that, for both contaminants, their incorporation into algae increases as the contamination dosage increases, making this methodology an effective technique for monitoring and remediation of urban aquatic ecosystems. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

While applied in urban, natural forest or wetland ecosystems, they are underutilized in agricultural landscapes. This paper presents a technical framework to characterise NBS in agricultural systems. NBS in the agriculture sector is proposed as “the use of natural processes or elements to improve ecosystem functions of environments and landscapes affected by agricultural practices, and to enhance livelihoods and other social and cultural functions, over various temporal and spatial scales.” The framework emerges from a review of 188 peer-reviewed articles on NBS and green infrastructure published between 2015 and 2019 and three international expert consultations organized in 2019–2020. The framework establishes four essential functions for NBS in agriculture: 1) Sustainable practices — with a focus on production; 2) Green Infrastructure — mainly for engineering purposes such as water and soil, and slope stabilization; 3) Amelioration — for restoration of conditions for plants, water, soil or air and climate change mitigation; and 4) Conservation — focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem connectivity. The framework connects the conventional divide between production and conservation to add functionality, purpose and scale in project design. The review confirmed limited evidence of NBS in agricultural systems particularly in developing country contexts, although specific technologies feature under other labels. Consultations indicated that wider adoption will require a phased approach to generate evidence, while integrating NBS in national and local policies and agricultural development strategies. The paper concludes with recommended actions required to facilitate such processes. © Copyright © 2021 Simelton, Carew-Reid, Coulier, Damen, Howell, Pottinger-Glass, Tran and Van Der Meiren.","agrobiodiversity conservation; climate-resilience; green infrastructure (GI); nature-based solutions (nbs); people-centered; restoration; sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113263115

The major air eight pollutants are considered for calculation of Air Quality index i.e. CO, NO., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, O3, NH3, and Pb. The prediction of air pollution is performed in two phases. The first phase computes the Air Quality Index values for all the pollutants in a day. The second phase computes threshold value of Air Quality Index as an average of previous values. The air pollution for the days in chosen month is predicted by comparing the threshold value with the average of the previous two-month values. A computer aided program is drafted and compiled on JAVA programming language of Oracle Corporation using BlueJ development environment in order to compute the Air Quality index. The program uses pollutant level values user enters and it analyses the different levels for pollutants and thereafter computes the Air Quality index level of every pollutant and tells the prominent pollutants along with its final computed value. The AQI generated can be used to analyse the level of exposures a person faces in day-to-day life and how remedies can be opted to cure the exposure towards indoor air pollution. The collected pollutants data and computed Air Quality index shows that the people in DELHI-NCR region are exposed to huge air pollution and it is relevant to the indoor air quality also. The study lessening that the air contaminations at indoor, individuals should utilise the clean energies and an improvement should be done in ovens to consume the fuel productively and vent outflows to the outside.

An effective interaction potential model has been employed for caffeine, using the intramolecular geometry and charge distribution from quantum chemical calculations performed in the present treatment and adopting well-established Lennard-Jones parameters from the literature. The solvation structure and related dynamics have been further investigated by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. The results obtained have revealed an enhancement of the local mole fraction of ethanol around caffeine due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between caffeine and its nearest ethanol molecules. This effect becomes less pronounced as the pressure of the system increases due to the denser packing of CO2 molecules in the first solvation shell of caffeine. The reorientational dynamics of caffeine is controlled by the intermittent hydrogen-bond dynamics, and its translational diffusion has been found to be significantly lower in comparison with the values obtained for ethanol and CO2. The pressure effects on the self-diffusion have also been found to be more pronounced in the cases of CO2 and EtOH in comparison with caffeine. The findings of the present study confirm a previous hypothesis in the literature, according to which polar solutes approach the polar domains formed by the alcohol aggregates and become more easily dissolved in the mixed CO2-ethanol solvent than in pure supercritical CO2. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Caffeine; Carbon dioxide; Ethanol; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Molecules; Pressure effects; Quantum chemistry; Solvation; Classical molecular dynamics; Effective interactions; Lennard-Jones parameters; Multi-scale molecular modeling; Quantum chemical calculations; Reorientational dynamics; Supercritical solvents; Translational diffusion; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112685728

As these gases consist of methane up to 15 vol%, they should be utilized onsite to reduce the impact of climate change. However, due to low calorific value, the combustion process of these gases could be complicated or even impossible inconvenient gas burners. For this reason, this work focuses on an investigation to clarify a complex of measures affecting the flammability limits and effectiveness of burning waste gas in a designed low swirl burner with different swirlers. The swirlers were made with vanes angles of 37°, 45°, and 53°. Critical regions of the flame structure were experimentally examined by means of chemiluminescence to determine the intensity of OH* emissions under syngas and oxygen enrichment. It revealed that the most appropriate combustion conditions taking into account the stable flame and lowest CO emissions were achieved using the swirler with a vanes angle of 45°.

Treatment duration, however, is rarely limited, and this results in a significant number of chronic users. Long-term BZD use is associated with cognitive impairment, falls with hip fractures, traffic accidents, and increased mortality. The BENZORED IV trial was a hybrid type-1 trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an intervention to reduce BZD prescription in primary care. The purpose of this qualitative study was to analyze the facilitators and barriers regarding the implementation of the intervention in primary care settings. Methods: A qualitative interview study with 40 GPs from three Spanish health districts. Focus group meetings with GPs from the intervention arm of the BEN-ZORED IV trial were held at primary healthcare centers in the three districts. For sampling purposes, the GPs were classified as high or low implementers according to the success of the intervention measured at 12 months. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to conduct the meetings and to code, rate, and analyze the data. Results: Three of the 41 CFIR constructs strongly distinguished between high and low implementers: the complexity of the inter-vention, the individual Stage of Change, and the key stakeholder’s engagement. Seven constructs weakly discriminated between the two groups: adaptability in the intervention, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, relative priority, self-efficacy, compatibility, and engaging a formally appointed implementation leader. Fourteen constructs did not discriminate between the two groups, six had insufficient data for evaluation, and eleven had no data for evaluation. Conclu-sions: We identified constructs that could explain differences in the efficacy in implementation of the intervention. This information is relevant for the design of successful strategies for implementation of the intervention. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper takes into account the decreasing emissions of CO2 and its relation to the size of business (in terms of transported cargo or number of passengers), and thus by the company’s business success (income, profit). In the empirical part of this research—ecological, operational, and business factors were analyzed on a sample of road carriers from Serbia, i.e., the most common type of organized transport of people or physical goods. Key difference was made between large and small companies engaged in transport activities, followed by difference between those companies which have business activities only in Serbia, or engage also in international activities in the Balkan region (or in the rest of world). The main goal of this paper is to determine statistically significant differences between transport companies in terms of key performance indicators, depending on whether they operate only domestically or abroad. In relation to company size, this paper examined the sustainability of operations in the case of the largest transport companies, which represent half of the total transport activity in the country (by number of people transported or the amount of transported cargo), compared to all small carriers with less than 50 employees. Future research involves extending this sample of road transport companies to all Balkan countries, which have not yet become a part of the European Union and including additional operational as well as environmental indicators that are not conventionally measured during vehicle inspections. © 2021 by the authors.

Regional Climate Models from the CORDEX database for the South American domain at two horizontal resolutions, 50 km and 25 km, short-term simulations at 20 km and at 4 km convective-permitting resolution and statistical downscaling techniques based on the analogue method and the generalized linear model approach were evaluated. The analysis includes observational datasets based on gridded data, station data and satellite products that allow assessing the observational uncertainty that characterizes extreme events in the region. It is found that the ability of the modelling strategies in capturing the main features of the extreme rainfall varies across the events. The higher the horizontal resolution of the models, the more intense and localized the core of the rainfall event, being the location of the exit region of the low-level jet and the low-level moisture flux convergence during the initial stages of the events the most relevant features that determine models’ ability of capturing the location and intensity of the core of the heavy rainfall. ESD models based on the generalized linear approach overestimate the spatial extension of the events and underestimate the intensity of the local maxima. Weather-like convective-permitting simulations depict an overall good performance in reproducing both the rainfall patterns and the triggering mechanisms of the extreme events as expected, given that these simulations are strongly controlled by the initial conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convective permitting simulations; Extreme precipitation events; Southeastern South America; Statistical and dynamical downscaling","atmospheric moisture; computer simulation; convective system; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105229299

Phragmites australis is a dominant ecosystem engineer with broad distribution, high intraspecific variation and great socio-economic importance. Coastal ecosystems inhabited by P. australis are threatened by salinization. Here, we investigated salinity tolerance of freshwater and salt marsh population of the species, grown under two soil salinities and in two common gardens. Salinity significantly affected the growth, biomass, leaf physiological parameters and ion concentration. Climate altered morphology and ion concentration of P. australis. In contrast to our hypothesis, the salt marsh population was not more salt tolerant than the freshwater population, and both showed a low degree of salt stress, maintaining their photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration, and only showing small decreases in biomass and height when salt-treated. We therefore ruled out local adaptation to soil salinity. Instead, both populations acclimated by phenotypic plasticity of biomass, root: shoot ratio, stomatal conductance and ion content. The salinity tolerance strategy of both populations was ion concentration by tissue desiccation, which was most efficient in the drier climate common garden. Hence, plants utilizing tissue desiccation as salinity tolerance strategy will have an advantage in areas where climate change leads to drier air humidity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Compatible osmolytes; Intraspecific diversity; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Salinity tolerance; Yellow River Delta","biomass; chlorophyll; climate change; concentration (composition); grass; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; relative humidity; root-shoot ratio; salinity; salinity tolerance; saltmarsh; stomatal conductance; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084840748

The empirical analysis of projected data for 2025 shows that the looser the restrictions of energy consumption, the greater the optimal economic output. When the energy consumption of each province is allowed to fluctuate within the range of 85% to 115% of the initial quota, the total GDP is the largest and 20.62% higher than the initial GDP. The optimal allocation scheme is more equitable than the initial scheme and realizes absolute interpersonal equity and economic equity. Eighteen provinces bear the pressures of energy saving, emission reduction or GDP growth, with average pressure indexes of 11.46%, 16.85% and 40.62%, respectively. The pressures on the major regions involved in the “Belt and Road”, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Yangtze River Economic Belt national strategies will thus be reduced significantly; the maximum pressures on energy saving, emission reduction and GDP growth are 10.03%, 12.17% and 29.84%, respectively. China can take a series of measures to promote regional coordinated development and improve the realization of optimal allocation schemes, including establishing unified resource asset trading platforms, improving the methods of regional cooperation, building effective transportation and logistics transport networks to weaken the barriers among regions and implementing differentiated regional policies and regional interest coordination mechanisms. © 2021 by the authors.

However, large-scale evidence regarding key methanogenic taxa and their relative importance to abiotic factors in mediating methanogenesis remains limited. Here, we explored the methanogenic community, potential CH4 production and its determinants in the active layer and permafrost deposits based on soil samples acquired from 12 swamp meadow sites along a μ1000 km permafrost transect on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results revealed lower CH4 production potential, mcrA gene abundance, and richness in the permafrost layer than those in the active layer. CH4 production potential in both soil layers was regulated by microbial and abiotic factors. Of the microbial properties, marker OTUs, rather than the abundance and diversity of methanogens, stimulated CH4 production potential. Marker OTUs differed between the two soil layers with hydrogenotrophic Methanocellales and facultative acetoclastic Methanosarcina predominant in regulating CH4 production potential in the permafrost and active layer, respectively. Besides microbial drivers, CH4 production potential increased with the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio in both soil layers and was also stimulated by soil moisture in the permafrost layer. These results provide empirical evidence for model improvements to better predict permafrost carbon feedback to climate warming. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","anaerobic decomposition; carbon cycle; climate warming; methane; methanogens; permafrost thaw","Carbon; Climate models; Deposits; Soil moisture; Abiotic factors; Active Layer; Climate warming; Methanogenesis; Methanogenic archaea; Methanogenic community; Permafrost thaws; Tibetan Plateau; Permafrost; carbon; dissolved organic matter; methane; methyl coenzyme M reductase; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; active layer; climate change; meadow; methane; methanogenesis; permafrost; soil moisture; swamp; transect; Article; carbon cycle; climate warming; DNA extraction; high throughput sequencing; methanogen; methanogenesis; methanogenic archaeon; Methanosarcina; methanotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; permafrost; physical chemistry; sequence analysis; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; swamp; Tibet; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Archaea; Methanosarcina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112581301

The continued loss of intact freshwater wetlands heightens the need for effective wetland creation and restoration. However, wetland structure and function are controlled by interacting abiotic and biotic factors, complicating efforts to replace ecosystem services associated with natural wetlands and making ecologically-driven management imperative. Increasing waterfowl populations pose a threat to the development and persistence of created wetlands, largely through intensive grazing that can shift vegetation community structure or limit desired plant establishment. This study capitalized on a long-term herbivore exclusion experiment to evaluate how herbivore management impacts carbon cycling and storage in a created wetland in Western New York, USA. Vegetation, above-and belowground biomass, soil carbon, carbon gas fluxes and decomposition rates were evaluated in control plots with free access by large grazers and in plots where grazers had been excluded for four years. Waterfowl were the dominant herbivore at the site. Grazing reduced peak growing season aboveground biomass by over 55%, and during the summer, gross primary productivity doubled in grazer exclusion plots. The shift in plant productivity led to a 34% increase in soil carbon after exclusion of grazers for five growing seasons, but no change in belowground biomass. Our results suggest that grazers may inhibit the development of soil carbon pools during the first decade following wetland creation, reducing the carbon sequestration potential and precluding functional equivalence with natural wetlands. © 2021 by the authors.

Over the years, decreased agriculture production and water quality degradation have been observed due to climatic abnormalities. Crop production is highly sensitive to climate. It gets affected by long-term trends in average rainfall and temperature, annual climate variations, shocks during different stages of growth, and extreme weather events. Globally, the areas sown for the major crops of barley, maize, rice, sorghum, soya bean, and wheat have all seen an increase in the percentage of area affected by drought as defined in terms of the Palmer Drought Severity Index since the 1960s, from approximately 5–10% to approximately 15–25%. Increase in temperature will be observed in terms of wheat yield losses − 5.5 ± 4.4% per degree Celsius for the United States, − 9.1 ± 5.4% per degree Celsius for India, and − 7.8 ± 6.3% per degree Celsius for Russia as these countries are more vulnerable to temperature increase. Water management through increasing storage capacity (or rainwater storage), fair policies for water supply and distribution, river health, and watershed management can reduce the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability. Similarly, climate change-resistant crop development, water management in irrigation, adapting climate-smart agriculture approach, and promoting indigenous knowledge can ensure the food security via increasing agricultural yield. Technical intervention can equip the farmers with the scientific analyses of the climatic parameters required for the sustainable agriculture management. These technologies may include application of software, nutrient management, water management practices, instruments for temperature measurement and soil health analysis etc. Holistic efforts of the stakeholders (farmers, local society, academia, scientists, policy makers, NGOs etc.) can provide better results to reduce the risks of climate change on agriculture and water resources as discussed in this paper.

Although the importance of blue carbon within these ecosystems has been addressed in some countries of Southeast Asia, the regional and national inventories with the application of nature-based solutions are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate national coastal blue carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystems in the countries of Southeast Asia including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. This study further assesses the potential of conservation and restoration practices and highlights the seagrass meadows as nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. The average value of the total carbon storage within seagrass meadows of this region is 121.95 ± 76.11 Mg ha−1 (average ± SD) and the total Corg stock of the seagrass meadows of this region was 429.11 ± 111.88 Tg, with the highest Corg stock in the Philippines (78%). The seagrass meadows of this region have the capacity to accumulate 5.85–6.80 Tg C year−1, which accounts for $214.6–249.4 million USD. Under the current rate of decline of 2.82%, the seagrass meadows are emitting 1.65–2.08 Tg of CO2 year−1 and the economic value of these losses accounts for $21.42–24.96 million USD. The potential of the seagrass meadows to the offset current CO2 emissions varies across the region, with the highest contribution to offset is in the seagrass meadows of the Philippines (11.71%). Current national policies and commitments of nationally determined contributions do not include blue carbon ecosystems as climate mitigation measures, even though these ecosystems can contribute up to 7.03% of the countries' reduction goal of CO2 emissions by 2030. The results of this study highlight and promote the potential of the southeast Asian seagrass meadows to national and international agencies as a practical scheme for nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Coastal ecosystem; Nature-based solution; Organic carbon","Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; International cooperation; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; CO$-2$/ emission; Coastal ecosystems; Nature-based solution; Organics; Philippines; Seagrass meadows; Seagrasses; Southeast Asia; Climate change; blue carbon; carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; bioremediation; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; coastal zone; conservation management; emission control; emission inventory; marine ecosystem; mitigation; organic carbon; quantitative analysis; seagrass; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; controlled study; disaster mitigation; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; environmental economics; environmental protection; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; seagrass; Southeast Asia; India; Philippines; sediment; Andamans and Nicobars; India; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Matthiola; Asia, Southeastern; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; India; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105696545

Spaceborne observations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), including formaldehyde (HCHO), glyoxal (CHOCHO), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), reveal important changes over China in 2020, relative to 2019, in response to the pandemic-induced shutdown and the subsequent drop in pollutant emissions. In February, at the peak of the shutdown, the observed declines in OVOC levels were generally weaker (less than 20%) compared to the observed NO2 reductions (-40%). In May 2020, the observations reveal moderate decreases in NO2 (-15%) and PAN (-21%), small changes in CHOCHO (-3%) and HCHO (6%). Model simulations using the regional model MAGRITTEv1.1 with anthropogenic emissions accounting for the reductions due to the pandemic explain to a large extent the observed changes in lockdown-affected regions. The model results suggest that meteorological variability accounts for a minor but non-negligible part (~-5%) of the observed changes for NO2, whereas it is negligible for CHOCHO but plays a more substantial role for HCHO and PAN, especially in May. The interannual variability of biogenic and biomass burning emissions also contribute to the observed variations, explaining e.g., the important column increases of NO2 and OVOCs in February 2020, relative to 2019.

The future scaling-up of these solutions, however, requires more knowledge about the mitigation potential, costs and financing options, including crowdfunding (CF). Our objective is to explore the driving factors behind the public’s willingness to pay for crowdfunded climate mitigation projects at the farm level. In this study, four mitigation options from the perspective of farmers were identified: Solar panels on the barn roof, biogas from animal manure, drag hoses for improved manure dispersal, and the addition of biochar to soils. The study investigates the optimal characteristics of crowdfunding campaigns to finance such mitigation measures. The most influential factors on the respondents’ WTP is neither climate concern nor proximity, but instead the knowledge regarding CF, combined with how comprehensible and salient the suggested measure is. The main implications are that future projects that aim to achieve broad participation in CF campaigns need to communicate well, to improve both public knowledge of the funding mechanism (CF) itself and the comprehensibility and salience of the agricultural measure. © 2021 by the authors.

Plaintiffs have sought, inter alia, compensation for climate-related losses and to compel governments to reduce their GHG emissions. So far, most of these claims have been unsuccessful. Here we assess the scientific and legal bases for establishing causation and evaluate judicial treatment of scientific evidence in 73 lawsuits. We find that the evidence submitted and referenced in these cases lags considerably behind the state of the art in climate science, impeding causation claims. We conclude that greater appreciation and exploitation of existing methodologies in attribution science could address obstacles to causation and improve the prospects of litigation as a route to compensation for losses, regulatory action and emission reductions by defendants seeking to limit legal liability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109303008

There has been a drive toward electrifying transport, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at the forefront. Reliance on single-technology policy development can lead to consequential impacts, often not considered, or dismissed. Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be transformed. While BEVs may represent zero tailpipe emissions, the battery energy must be sourced elsewhere. An ideal policy scenario will come from “renewable” sources; however, current global energy mixes require the electricity to come from carbon-burning point source emitters. Therefore, the emissions are deferred to low socioeconomic regions. The move to ban new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales has been accelerated. High BEV costs will preclude low-income groups from making purchases. Such groups typically rely on used cars for mobility. Without considered consequential policy analysis, transport underclasses may result, where private transport is only accessible by the wealthy. Synthetic fuels derived from CO2 represent a social bridge in the energy transition, also helping to accelerate toward net zero. The Covid-19 lockdown provided a unique opportunity to experience an environment with reduced transport-related emissions. Global studies allowed the consequential effects of pollution reduction to be studied. These are surprising and offer the opportunity for policies, driven by science, to be developed. Here, we consider the consequential effects of clean air policies, and how these can be used to propose dynamic responses to policy recommendations. © Copyright © 2021 Styring, Duckworth and Platt.","electric vehicle; ICE; net zero carbon; policy development; social impact; synthetic fuel","Alcohol fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Secondary batteries; Energy transitions; Policy analysis; Policy recommendations; Pollution reduction; Private transport; Tailpipe emission; Technology policy; Temperature increase; Battery electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113150841

Suppressing nitrifier activity is an effective strategy to limit N losses from agriculture. Production and release of nitrification inhibitors from plant roots is termed “biological nitrification inhibition” (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of a chromosome region that controls BNI production in “wheat grass” Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev, located on the short arm of the “Lr#3Nsb” (Lr#n), which can be transferred to wheat as T3BL.3NsbS (denoted Lr#n-SA), where 3BS arm of chromosome 3B of wheat was replaced by 3NsbS of L. racemosus. We successfully introduced T3BL.3NsbS into the wheat cultivar “Chinese Spring” (CS-Lr#n-SA, referred to as “BNI-CS”), which resulted in the doubling of its BNI capacity. T3BL.3NsbS from BNI-CS was then transferred to several elite high-yielding hexaploid wheat cultivars, leading to near doubling of BNI production in “BNI-MUNAL” and “BNI-ROELFS.” Laboratory incubation studies with root-zone soil from field-grown BNI-MUNAL confirmed BNI trait expression, evident from suppression of soil nitrifier activity, reduced nitrification potential, and N2O emissions. Changes in N metabolism included reductions in both leaf nitrate, nitrate reductase activity, and enhanced glutamine synthetase activity, indicating a shift toward ammonium nutrition. Nitrogen uptake from soil organic matter mineralization improved under low N conditions. Biomass production, grain yields, and N uptake were significantly higher in BNI-MUNAL across N treatments. Grain protein levels and breadmaking attributes were not negatively impacted. Wide use of BNI functions in wheat breeding may combat nitrification in high N input-intensive farming but also can improve adaptation to low N input marginal areas. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

In this context, it is necessary for China to study the nexus of agricultural economic growth and carbon emissions. Taking Jilin province as an example, this paper applied the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and a decoupling analysis to examine the relationship between crop production and agricultural carbon emissions during 2000–2018, and it further provided a decomposition analysis of the changes in agricultural carbon emissions using the log mean Divisia index (LMDI) method. The results were as follows: (1) Based on the results of CO2 EKC estimation, an N-shaped EKC was found; in particular, the upward trend in agricultural carbon emissions has not changed recently. (2) According to the results of the decoupling analysis, expansive coupling occurred for 9 years, which was followed by weak decoupling for 5 years, and strong decoupling and strong coupling occurred for 2 years each. There was no stable evolutionary path from coupling to decoupling, and this has remained true recently. (3) We used the LMDI method to decompose the driving factors of agricultural carbon emissions into four factors: the agricultural carbon emission intensity effect, structure effect, economic effect, and labor force effect. From a policymaking perspective, we integrated the results of both the EKC and the decoupling analysis and conducted a detailed decomposition analysis, focusing on several key time points. Agricultural economic growth was found to have played a significant role on many occasions in the increase in agricultural carbon emissions, while agricultural carbon emission intensity was important to the decline in agricultural carbon emissions. Specifically, the four factors’ driving direction in the context of agricultural carbon emissions was not stable. We also found that the change in agricultural carbon emissions was affected more by economic policy than by environmental policy. Finally, we put forward policy suggestions for low-carbon agricultural development in Jilin province. © 2021 by the authors.

Repetitive dengue epidemic is one of the main health problems that, due to its rapid spread and geographically widespread, has become a major concern for the government authorities in dealing with this disease. In Malaysia, cases of dengue are reported annually. To keep cases under control, it is important to examine the possible factors that help the growth of the virus. Climatological factors such as rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and humidity are expected to have high potential to increase the growth of the virus in this study, and their spatial variation is associated with cases of dengue. The result revealed that Ordinary Least Square was not an effective method for modelling the relationships between dengue cases and climate variables, as climate variables in different spatial regions act differently. During the analysis, there could be some issues of non-stationarity since the geographical aspect and spatial data were involved. Hence, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is implemented due to its capability to identify the spatial non-stationarity behavior of influencing factors on dengue incidence and integrate the geographical location and altitude for the spatial analysis. GWR analysis found that the influenced factors exhibited a significant relationship with dengue incidence. GWR also shows a significant improvement in Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values with the lowest value and the highest adjusted R square. It is expected that the developed model can help the local hygienic authorities design better strategies for preventing and controlling this epidemic in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","climatological factors; Dengue epidemic; geographically weighted regression; non-stationarity; spatial variation","Epidemiology; Least squares approximations; Military operations; Viruses; Wind; Akaike information criterion; Climatological factors; Geographical locations; Geographically weighted regression; Government authorities; Non-stationarities; Ordinary least squares; Spatial non-stationarity; Factor analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114202440

To investigate the effects of eutrophication on GHG dynamics, we conducted field measurements every three months from January 2019 to October 2019 in Lake Ulansuhai, a shallow eutrophic lake (mean depth of 0.7 m) located in a semi-arid region in Northern China. We found that Lake Ulansuhai was a predominantly source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); however, it converted to a CO2 sink in July due to eutrophication. It was also a strong source of methane (CH4) with a mean CO2 emission of 35.7 ± 12.1 mmol m−2 d−1 and CH4 emission of 5.9 ± 2.9 mmol m−2 d−1. The CO2 concentrations in most sites and CH4 concentrations in all sites were supersaturated, with the average partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) being 654±34 μatm and the partial pressure of CH4 (pCH4) being 157±37 μatm. The partial pressures and emissions of the greenhouse gases exhibited substantial seasonal and spatial variations. The correlation analysis between the trophic level index and the partial pressure of the greenhouse gases indicated that eutrophication could significantly decrease the CO2 emissions but increase the CH4 emissions from the lake, resulting in a CH4 and CO2 emission ratio of approximately 2 in terms of global warming potential.

The biggest consumer of energy in a supermarket is its refrigeration system, which accounts for 40–60% of its total electricity usage and is equivalent to about 2–3% of the total energy consumed by commercial buildings in United States, or around 0.5 quadrillion Btu (or 0.53 quadrillion KJ). Also, the supermarket refrigeration system is one of the biggest consumers of refrigerants. Current supermarket refrigeration systems rely on high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. Reducing refrigerant usage or using environment friendly alternatives can result in significant climate benefits. The refrigeration system can also be adapted to handle flexible building loads and be integrated into grid response transactive control to balance the supply and demand of the electric grid. Even minor improvements in the efficiency and operational reliability of supermarket refrigeration systems can create significant value in terms of saving energy, improving food quality, protecting the environment, reducing carbon footprint, and enhancing electric grid resilience. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) techniques can be used to support refrigeration system operators in achieving these benefits. However, compare to FDD of other building heating, ventilation and air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&amp;R) equipment and systems which has attracted extensive FDD studies for decades, FDD of supermarket refrigeration systems, especially for low GWP refrigerant supermarket refrigeration system, has not gained enough attention from researchers. One of the key challenges is lack of available testing datasets to benchmark the system performance and record the faulted performance for system FDD research. This study selects several common faults of supermarket refrigeration systems, including display case door open, ice accumulation, expansive valve failure, and fan failure, to conduct experimental study to identify their fault characteristics, benchmark their faulted performance, then create a FDD characteristics matrix to support next step research on the development of supermarket refrigeration system FDD methods and field automated FDD implementation. © 2021 The Authors","Experimental study; Fault detection and diagnostics; Global warming potential (GWP); Supermarket refrigeration","Air conditioning; Benchmarking; Carbon footprint; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Global warming; Office buildings; Refrigerants; Retail stores; Environment-friendly alternatives; Experimental investigations; Fault characteristics; Fault detection and diagnostics; Global warming potential; Operational reliability; Supermarket refrigeration; Ventilation and air conditioning; Commercial refrigeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108965767

There are also many sustainable development ideas in the economic field. The main topic is circular economy, which is mainly to cultivate a harmonious coexistence environment for the development of man and nature by strengthening the construction of the ecological environment and ecological industries. Therefore, when solving environmental problems, we must adapt measures to local conditions and develop a circular economy to fundamentally solve the problems that have always existed between resources, environment and development. For regional economies, we must create new ideas on the road to industrialization and make full use of Resources provide a foundation for the realization of the overall construction goals of a well-off society in the near future, and contribute to the realization of grand goals. In this study, we will take the environmental problems in a certain area as an example, aiming at the environmental problems in the area and the goals of national policies for ecological environment construction, summarizing the content of existing research, and conducting a preliminary analysis of this content. A framework of thinking based on ecological environment quality evaluation is proposed. Technically, remote sensing and geographic information systems are used, and the survey results and research results summarized with sufficient reasons are used to conduct a single-factor analysis of the ecological environment in the area, and establish a relevant database of the ecological environment in the area. The focus of this article is to establish a complete set of evaluation system compared with the current situation and development of circular economy, and compared with foreign circular economy development models. The main contents include the evaluation of the reduction of resource input, the evaluation of the effect of resource recovery and reuse, the evaluation of the reduction of pollution emissions, the evaluation of the improvement of ecological environment quality, and the evaluation of the comprehensive development level of the socio-economic development of the area.

Additionally, changes in the evaporation potential in the NCP have altered from decreasing to sharply increasing. Therefore, it is critical to understand the actual cropland water consumption (i.e., the actual evapotranspiration, AET) and crop water use efficiency (WUE) under this new trend. This understanding is significant for agricultural water management in the NCP. This study investigated the historical AET and WUE trends for the winter wheat–summer maize cropping system during 1992–2014. This investigation was based on a long-term AET dataset obtained using a large lysimeter from 1992 to 2014 at the Yucheng Comprehensive Experiment Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences near the Lower Yellow River. The results showed that annual AET decreased pre-2008 and rebounded post-2008. The rebound rate of annual AET from 2008 to 2014 was more than three times the annual decrease rate of AET from 1992 to 2008. The significant increase in summer maize AET mainly contributed to the rebound of the annual AET after 2008. Following the changes in AET and crop yield, the annual WUE had evidently increased for 1992–2008 and sharply decreased from 2008 to 2014. The significant decrease in winter wheat WUE mainly contributed to the annual decrease in WUE post-2008. Climate change, agricultural management, and crop yields were observed to regulate the changes in AET and WUE. In the context of accelerating climate change and the increased frequency of extreme climatic events, strategies to improve WUE by the Lower Yellow River have been proposed, which may also be helpful in the NCP and similar regions worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Actual crop water consumption; Evaporation potential; North China Plain; Water use efficiency; Winter wheat–summer maize cropping system","agricultural land; climate change; data set; evaporation; food production; lysimeter; maize; water use; China; Yellow River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104930492

The priorities set concentrate on decarbonizing the energy sector, mainly by promoting renewables. At the same time, it is of great importance to effectively manage the energy generated in-situ within a community. That community can be approached as a micro-grid able either to be connected to the main grid or to be independent. In addition to this, storage of electricity seems the unavoidable solution for the effective energy management with the micro-grid. Due to the technological developments and the reduction in production costs that are expected to decrease even further in the coming years (50% reduction), batteries are a crucial factor for the effective integration of renewables on a residential scale. Thereafter, the proper size of a battery system plays an important role for the total minimization of system's cost during its lifetime. The purpose of the paper is to present a mathematical tool, able to manage the energy produced by residential photovoltaic panels, the energy stored in the batteries and the energy purchased from the main grid. Continuing with the energy management, the framework should come up with an optimized life cycle cost solution, regarding both the energy management within the grid and the optimum size of energy battery system. Main findings of the paper indicate that storage is a feasible option, whenever selling electricity to the main grid is not applicable, as for that case the battery capital cost should decrease to 400 (€/kWh); this is a 20% cost reduction compared to current prices and 30 (€/kWh). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Dimensioning; Life cycle cost; Micro-grid; Optimization; Photovoltaic panels","Battery storage; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Energy policy; Global warming; Housing; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; % reductions; 'current; Battery systems; Dimensioning; Energy; Life-cycle cost optimisation; Micro grid; Optimisations; Photovoltaic panels; Residential photovoltaic; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105887753

During the 2019–2020 austral summer, the western Sydney Local Government Area (LGA) of Penrith experienced unprecedented high temperatures with less than 60 % of average rainfall compared with the proceeding five summers. This culminated in the highest temperature ever recorded in greater Sydney, of 48.9 °C. It is increasingly important that trees for urban applications are selected to be able to withstand such conditions. In early 2020, we conducted a visual assessment of canopy damage on street trees found in the Penrith LGA following the 2019–2020 summer heatwaves. We assessed the health of over 5500 trees and classified them as undamaged, lightly damaged, heavily damaged or defoliated. We found that more than 10 % of all the trees assessed displayed some level of canopy damage, with exotic deciduous species showing the greatest proportion of canopy damage. A logistic regression revealed that for exotic deciduous species, the probability of having sustained no canopy damage was 79 % lower than that for native evergreen species. Using these data, the economic costs to replace damaged trees was calculated using two scenarios that incorporated costs of tree planting and maintenance: low cost (replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with juvenile trees) and high cost (replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with advanced trees), with costs ranging from $500,000 to $800,000 (AUD). We also calculated the cost of replacing all individuals of the most damaged species with more climate-resilient species in order to secure the urban forest and found that the cost would be over AUD$1,000,000. This research highlights the importance of careful planning to ensure urban forest resilience and economic sustainability in the face of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Canopy cover; Drought stress; Heat damage; Strategic planning; Street trees; Urban forest; Vulnerability","assessment method; deciduous tree; drought; extreme event; heat wave; local government; rainfall; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; sustainability; tree planting; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107971357

In some plant groups, high floral trait diversity and uneven species diversity between insular systems and the continental area suggest other factors may have important roles too. The primary purpose of this study is to reveal how abiotic and biotic factors have shaped the species diversity anomaly of Heterotropa between the insular systems and the continental area. Location: The Sino-Japanese Floristic Region. Taxon: Section Heterotropa (genus Asarum; Aristolochiaceae). Methods: Using ddRAD-seq and chloroplast genome data, we built a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree including 79 species. We estimated the patterns of floral traits (flowering time and floral size) evolution using macroevolutionary modelling, and tested the correlation of speciation rate with the trait evolution rates. Finally, we estimated the isolation factors of all taxa pairs and sister-taxa pairs based on distribution range and floral traits. Results: Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Heterotropa was diverged into two clades (continental clade and insular clade) in the Miocene, and the major subclades corresponded to geographic entities. Most rate shifts accelerating floral trait's evolution occurred during the Pleistocene period. Evolution rate of floral traits showed positive correlation with the speciation rate. Large proportion of taxa in the insular clade are distributed allopatrically. Several sister pairs showed floral trait divergence with geographic overlap. Main Conclusions: The diversification of Heterotropa appears to have been triggered by geographic and climatic events, and subsequent repeated floral trait evolution with and without geographic isolation. Furthermore, the high species diversity in the insular systems would have been formed by the repeated range fragmentations and contractions. Our study demonstrates the importance of multidimensional studies to understand the diversification process of temperate plants in the Sino-Japanese Floristic Region. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Asarum sect.

As IL-6 serves as an important indicator of disease state, it is of paramount importance to develop low cost, fast and sensitive im-proved methods of detection. Here we present an electrochemical immunosensor platform based on the use of highly porous graphitic carbon electrodes fabricated by direct laser writing of commercial polyimide tapes and chemically modified with capture IL-6 antibodies. The unique porous and 3D morphology, as well as the high density of edge planes of the graphitic carbon electrodes, resulted in a fast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate, k0 = 0.13 cm/s. The resulting im-munosensor showed a linear response to log of concentration in the working range of 10 to 500 pg/mL, and low limit of detection (LOD) of 5.1 pg/mL IL-6 in phosphate buffer saline. The total test time was approximately 90 min, faster than the time required for ELISA testing. Moreover, the assay did not require additional sample pre-concentration or labelling steps. The immunosensor shelf-life was long, with stable results obtained after 6 weeks of storage at 4 °C, and the selectivity was high, as no response was obtained in the presence of another inflammatory cytokine, Interlukin-4. These results show that laser-fabricated graphitic carbon electrodes can be used as selective and sensitive electrochemical immunosensors and offer a viable option for rapid and low-cost biomarker detection for point-of-care analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is unclear how specific socio-economic factors are driving carbon emissions. Based on the multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model, this paper analyzes the impact mechanism of China’s carbon emission data during 2010–2017. The results show that (1) during the study period, China’s carbon emissions have obvious positive correlations in the spatial distribution, and the spatial autocorrelation of carbon emissions on the time scale has a further strengthening trend. (2) Compared with the results of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, the MGWR model is more robust, and the results are more realistic and reliable. The impacts of energy intensity, proportion of green coverage in built-up areas, and industrial structure on provincial carbon emissions are close to the global scale, and their spatial heterogeneity is weak. Other factors have spatially heterogeneous impacts on carbon emissions with different scale effects. (3) Except for proportion of green coverage in built-up areas, the industrial structure and trade openness have insignificant impacts on carbon emissions, but other variables have significant impacts. The total population, urbanization rate, energy intensity, and energy structure have positive impacts on carbon emissions, while the GDP per capita and foreign direct investment have negative impacts on it. This study shows that the main socio-economic factors have different degrees of impacts on carbon emissions with different scale, and we can refer to it to formulate more scientific measures to reduce carbon emissions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; China; Influencing factors; MGWR model; Spatial autocorrelation analysis","autocorrelation; carbon emission; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; industrial structure; nature-society relations; numerical model; regression analysis; socioeconomic impact; trade openness; urbanization; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; human; socioeconomics; spatial regression; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Humans; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103418396

Here we performed a proof-of-concept study using an ab initio valence bond method called the block-localized wave function (BLW) method. The integrated BLW and density function theory (DFT) computations demonstrated that heterobimetallic Ae+/Al(I) (Ae represents alkaline earth metals Mg and Ca) Lewis acid/base combinations without transition metals can facilely capture and activate CO2. There are two remarkable findings in this study. The first concerns the ionic nature of the metal-metal bonds. The experimentally synthesized low valent aluminum compound with a bidentate β-diketiminate (BDI) ligand, or (BDI)Al(I) in brief, is a Lewis base due to the lone pair on the aluminum cation though overall Al(I) is positively charged. Al(I) can form ionic metal-metal bonds with the alkaline earth metals of the positively charged Lewis acids (BDI)Ae+. This type of ionic metal-metal bonds is counterintuitive and antielectrostatic as both metals carry positive charges. The second finding is the CO2 activation mechanism. (BDI)Al(I) can effectively bind and activate CO2 by transferring one electron to CO2, and the resulting complex can be best expressed as [(BDI)Al(I)]+[CO2]-. The participation of (BDI)Ae+ further enhances the capture and activation of CO2 by (BDI)Al(I). © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkaline earth metals; Aluminum arsenide; Aluminum hydroxide; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Electrostatics; Transition metals; Wave functions; Activation of CO2; Density function theory; Heterobimetallics; Localized wave functions; Metal-free catalysts; Metal-metal bonds; Positively charged; Valence-bond method; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113607815

The role of mantle-sourced carbonatite melts and fluids in the formation of the Mo mineralization remains poorly understood. Our integrated study based on field geology, petrography, microthermometry, and LA-ICP-MS analysis of single fluid inclusions, and noble gas isotopes of pyrite permits to reconstruct the source characteristics, the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution of the carbonatitic fluids, and their controls on Mo mineralization. Fluid inclusions hosted in calcite in the carbonatite dikes have the highest concentrations of Mo (9.9–62 ppm), Ce (820–9700 ppm), Pb (1800–19500 ppm), and Zn (570–5800 ppm) and represent the least modified hydrothermal fluid derived from the carbonatite melt. Fluid inclusions hosted in calcite (Cal) and quartz (Qz2 and Qz3) of the stage I carbonatite dikes have different metal concentrations, suggesting that they formed from two distinct end member fluids. The FIA in calcite represent fluid A evolved from carbonatite melt with relatively high-ore metal concentrations, and those in quartz characterize fluid B having a crustal signature due to metasomatic reactions with the wall rocks. The FIA in quartz (Qz1) within the altered wall rock have overlapping elemental concentrations with those of massive quartz (Qz2) and vuggy quartz (Qz3) in carbonatite. This suggests that the volumetrically significant quartz in the Huangshui’an carbonatite has been formed by the introduction of Si by fluid B. The positive correlations between Rb, B, Al, Cl, and Sr in stage II fluid inclusions in late fluorite + quartz + calcite veins indicate that this late mineralization formed from the mixing of primary hydrothermal fluid B with meteoric water. The He–Ar isotope data, in combination with available C–O–Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data, constrain the carbonatite source as an enriched mantle source modified by contributions from crustal material which was probably the fertile lower crust in the region. This distinct source facilitated the enrichment in Mo, REE, and Pb in the primary carbonatite magma. The carbonatite magmatism and Mo mineralization at 209.5–207 Ma occurred in the regional-scale extensional setting at the postcollision stage of the Qinling Orogenic Belt. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fluid inclusion; Huangshui’an Mo-rich carbonatite; LA-ICP-MS; Magmatic-hydrothermal evolution; Qinling Orogenic Belt","argon isotope; carbonatite; fluid inclusion; helium isotope; hydrothermal alteration; inductively coupled plasma method; magmatism; mass spectrometry; mineralization; molybdenum; noble gas; orogenic belt; petrography; pyrite; thermometry; China; Qinling Mountains; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107022728

In particular, aerospace industry, with the more electric aircraft (MEA) revolution, is shifting toward the usage of electrical in place of mechanical energy on board to save fossil fuel and reduce polluting emissions. For this reason, phase-locked loops (PLLs) systems have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources and loads within the aircraft electrical grid. Since one of the proposed solutions for MEA power grids is to operate at variable frequency from 360 to 800 Hz, a third-order model-based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in the literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances, and dc offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this article aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation and experimental tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all the abovementioned sources during variable frequency operation. The execution time of the proposed PLL is only 4.23 μs using a Xilinx Zynq-7000-based platform, where the added RO takes 2.664 μs to execute, and the SSLKF-PLL alone takes 1.566 μs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Fault tolerant control; more electric aircraft; phase-locked loops; power system harmonics; repetitive control","Aerospace industry; Disturbance rejection; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Industrial research; Phase locked loops; Computational burden; Effective suppression; Experimental test; Linear Kalman filters; Mechanical energies; Polluting emission; Transportation electrifications; Variable frequencies; More electric aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105107700

Low carbon transformation of RBCs is an important way to achieve the goal of reaching the carbon emissions peak in 2030. Based on the panel data from 116 RBCs in China from 2003 to 2018, this study takes the opening of high-speed railway (HSR) lines as a quasi-experiment, using a time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) model to empirically evaluate the impact of an HSR line on reducing the carbon intensity of RBCs. The results show that the opening of an HSR line can reduce the carbon intensity of RBCs, and this was still true after considering the possibility of problems with endogenous selection bias and after applying the relevant robustness tests. The opening of an HSR line is found to have a significant reducing effect on the carbon intensity of different types of RBC, and the decline in the carbon intensity of coal-based cities is found to be the greatest. Promoting migration of RBCs with HSR lines is found to be an effective intermediary way of reducing their carbon intensity. © 2021 by the authors.

This research theme has gained prominence due to the realisation that climatic changes will likely compromise human welfare and community stability, with significant implications for governments’ security agendas. The Indo-Pacific region is an important case study for understanding climate security given its ongoing environmental and developmental challenges and the cultural, political and economic tensions existing within and between neighbouring countries. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of academic and “grey” literatures that address climate adaptation, disaster management or regional security in the Indo-Pacific. From this review, we identify four key themes that arise prominently in discussion and analysis prepared by academic scholars, governments and non-government organisations alike. The ubiquity of these themes speaks to the interdependent nature of the adaptation, disaster management and security challenges. The literature is in agreement that maintaining and enhancing climate security in the Indo-Pacific will depend on the region’s capacity to strategically coordinate between the activities of governments, industry and communities; the willingness of governments to meaningfully cooperate with communities and each other despite existing tensions; governments’ ability to manage limited resources efficiently; and their capacity to identify and address climate-maladaptive path dependencies. We highlight the most popular prescriptions for addressing these concurrent challenges at the current time. We argue that these prescriptions warrant further research and will likely have broader applicability for addressing climate security challenges in other regions of the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Climate security; Governance; Indo-Pacific; Resilience","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Climatic changes; Community stability; Disaster management; Path dependency; Regional climate; Regional security; Security challenges; Systematic Review; Climate change; academic performance; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; disaster management; environmental economics; environmental planning; governance approach; government; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; regional climate; regional security; welfare reform; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113179356

Though the government of Pakistan is adopting solar PV technology due to its environmental friendliness nature, studies focusing on consumer’s acceptance of solar PV are limited in the country. This research aims to close this knowledge gap by looking into the various considerations that may influence consumers’ willingness to adopt (WTA) solar PV for household purposes. The study further contributes by expanding the conceptual framework of the theory of planned behavior by including three novel factors (perceived risk, perception of self-efficacy, and openness to technology). The analysis is based on questionnaire data collected from 683 households in Pakistan’s provincial capitals, including Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Gilgit, and Karachi. The proposed hypotheses are investigated using the state-of-the-art structural equation modeling approach. The empirical results reveal that social norms, perception of self-efficacy, and belief about solar PV benefits positively influence consumers’ WTA solar PV. On the contrary, the perceived risk and solar PV cost have negative effects. Notably, the openness to technology has an insignificant effect. This study can help government officials and policymakers explore cost-effective, risk-free technologies to lessen the environmental burden and make the country more sustainable. Based on research results, study limitations, as well as prospective research directions, are also addressed. © 2021 by the authors.

The mechanical properties of the surface layers are crucial to improve contact fatigue and anti-wear performance. In this study, the effect of low-temperature tempering on confined precipitation and mechanical properties across surface layers in a high-alloy carburising steel (18Cr2Ni4W) were investigated. The steel was tempered at 240 °C with different tempering durations. Microstructure changes, including confined precipitation, and local mechanical properties were analysed layer-by-layer. During tempering, the morphology and size of martensite remained unchanged while confined precipitation occurred in martensitic matrix; coherent ε phase precipitates formed after 1.5 h, they then transformed to less coherent η phase within 3 h and subsequently evolved to non-coherent θ phase after 3 h of tempering. After tempering for 1.5 h, the strength and ductility of the surface layers reach a maximum value, and elongation of the surface layers with high carbon content is comparable to that of the core with low carbon content. It is revealed that the coherent ε precipitates are mainly responsible for the increase in strength; whilst ductility of the martensitic matrix increases due to a reduced carbon concentration, avoiding tempering brittleness. The results are valuable to the optimisation of surface properties of carburised steels using lower temperature tempering. © 2021","Carburised steel; Low-temperature tempering; Mechanical properties; Precipitation","Carbon; Chromium alloys; Chromium steel; Ductility; Fracture mechanics; Morphology; Precipitation (chemical); Tempering; Ternary alloys; Thermal fatigue; Carburised steels; Confined precipitations; Contact fatigues; Fatigue wear; Low temperature tempering; Martensitics; matrix; Mechanical; Property; Surface layers; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109188478

Flexible charging of these vehicles aids with grid integration of wind and solar generation but may require drivers to provide information about their travel patterns and allow grid operators to control the charging of their vehicles. Limited acceptance of flexible charging can potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions reductions from electric vehicle deployment. Therefore, here we assess how varying the extent of consumer acceptance of flexible charging affects electric vehicle greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a highly decarbonized California grid (>70% zero-carbon), a region with mandated zero-emission vehicle deployment and electricity decarbonization targets. We quantify the monetary value of flexible charging based on the reduction in stationary storage required to achieve a given zero-carbon penetration as flexible charging is adopted. We find that increased participation in smart charging and vehicle-to-grid increases zero-carbon generation uptake by up to 5.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The value of smart charging only reaches $87 per vehicle-year while that for vehicle-to-grid can reach $2,850 per vehicle-year. Non-monetary incentives may be needed to increase smart charging participation. These results can inform future analyses on the supply and demand for participation in flexible charging programs. © 2021 The Authors","Consumer behavior; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gas emissions; Smart charging","Carbon; Charging (batteries); Consumer behavior; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Plug-in electric vehicles; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; California; Consumer acceptance; Decarbonising; Electric vehicle charging; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions; Plug-ins; Smart charging; Vehicle to grids; Zero carbons; Greenhouse gases; electric vehicle; electricity supply; emission control; energy storage; greenhouse gas; smart grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105275730

However, SF6 is a potent greenhouse gas, so its use and emission are regulated. CF3I has been investigated as a candidate for SF6 alternative gas, whose environmental impact is much less than that of SF6 and other fluorocarbon-based gases. In addition, a flexible gas-insulated transmission line (FGIL) is expected to be used for power transmission from offshore wind farms due to its high flexibility and low capacitance. In this paper, the feasibility of 22 kV class FGIL utilizing atmospheric pressure CF3I gas is evaluated from the viewpoint of withstand voltage with actual lightning impulse tests. The cross-sectional size of FGIL is determined by considering insulation condition, heat transfer condition, sheath electric field condition and spacer stress condition. The impulse tests for FGIL are conducted in straight and bent states, and it is revealed that the 50% breakdown voltage V_{50} of straight state exceeded lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV) for 22 kV class, and that V_{50} of bent state falls below LIWV. © 1994-2012 IEEE.","conceptual design; flexible gas-insulated transmission line (FGIL); lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV); trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I)","Atmospheric pressure; Capacitance; Conceptual design; Electric insulation; Electric lines; Environmental impact; Gas filled cables; Greenhouse gases; Heat transfer; Lightning; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Sulfur hexafluoride; Transmissions; Feasibility studies; Gas insulated transmission lines; Heat transfer conditions; High-voltage equipments; Insulation conditions; Lightning impulse tests; Sheath electric field; Withstand voltage; SF6 insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113715530

The U.S. Gulf Coast is an attractive target for CO2 storage because of the favorable formation properties for injection and containment of CO2. Deltaic formations are one of the primary targeted depositional environments in the Gulf Coast. In this paper, we investigate CO2 storage in deltaic saline aquifers through a combination of geological modeling and flow simulation. The approach presented in this paper based on a combination of invasion percolation and compositional reservoir simulation focuses on buoyancy-dominant flow of CO2 in the long term and its pressure-driven flow in the short term. The results provide insights into how to screen and identify prospective locations for CO2 storage and determine the underlying geological features controlling CO2 migration for a basin-scale study. The geological model in our study is developed based on a laboratory-scale three-dimensional (3D) flume experiment replicating the formation of a delta structure and populated with geologic properties according to Miocene Gulf of Mexico natural analogues. We used invasion percolation simulations to understand the buoyancy-driven flow and the relationship between architecture, stratigraphy, and fluid migration pathways. The results were used to develop an upscaled model for compositional simulation with the key features of the original geological model and to determine injection schemes that maximize the injection capacity and minimize the amount of mobile CO2 in the formation. To achieve this, we used compositional reservoir simulations to study the pressure-driven flow and phase behavior. The results of invasion percolation simulations were used to identify the key stratigraphic units affecting CO2 migration. The realistic geometries and high resolution of the model facilitate the transfer of results from synthetic to subsurface data. The results allow for the analysis of deltaic depositional environments, important stratigraphic surfaces, and their impact on CO2 storage. The reservoir simulation model and phase behavior were validated against available field and laboratory data. The results of reservoir simulations were used to investigate the effects of main mechanisms, such as gas trapping and solubilization, on storage capacity. We compared our simulation results based on invasion percolation (buoyancy driven) and reservoir simulation (pressure driven). The comparison is helpful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and determine best practices to evaluate CO2 migration within similar formations. The unique and extremely well-characterized deltaic model allows for unprecedented representation of the depositional aquifer architecture. This research combines geologic modeling, flow simulation, and application for CO2 storage. The integrated conclusions will constrain predictions of actual subsurface flow performance and CO2 storage capacity in deltaic systems while identifying potential risks and primary stratigraphic migration pathways. This research provides insights on prediction of CO2 storage performance and characterization of prospective saline aquifers.

A novel approach is to construct new ecosystems to improve the functioning of degraded landscapes. However, the development of novel ecosystems is largely driven by the pre-construction hydrogeophysical and ecological conditions of the soil. In Lake Markermeer, a deteriorating freshwater lake in the Netherlands, a large archipelago is currently being constructed to boost the ecological functioning of the lake. Hence, islands – with wetlands and with more elevated and dryer areas – have been created to sustain biodiversity and key biogeochemical functions such as nutrient cycling. The islands are constructed from lake-bottom sediments. To study how two potentially important drivers, water level and bioturbation, affect soil characteristics in a novel wetland ecosystem, we experimentally tested the effects of water level (-30, -10 and 5 cm), and bioturbation by earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) and Tubifex spp. in a microcosm experiment. We demonstrate that a high water level prevents soil subsidence, soil crack formation and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and affects nitrogen cycling. In dryer soils, the presence of earthworms strongly increases CO2 emissions next to reducing soil crack formation, while Tubifex spp. in wetter soils hardly affect soil characteristics. Our findings highlight the important roles of both water level and bioturbation for the functioning of novel soils, which likely affects vegetation development in novel ecosystems. This knowledge can be used to aid the construction and nature development of novel wetlands. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bioturbation; Lumbricus rubellus; Marker Wadden; Nutrients; Soil subsidence; Tubifex","archipelago; bioturbation; carbon dioxide; earthworm; greenhouse gas; landscape change; soil-vegetation interaction; Markermeer; Netherlands; Lumbricus rubellus; Tubifex; Tubifex tubifex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107267220

The two crops consume about 35% of the nitrogen (N) fertilizer used in agriculture and thereby contribute to fertilizer-induced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Thus, estimation of spatially disaggregated N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields on a global scale could be useful for identifying emission and mitigation hotspots. It could also be needed for prioritizing mitigation options consistent with location-specific production and environmental goals. N2O emission from four models (CCAFS-MOT, IPCC Tier-I, IPCC Tier-II and Tropical N2O) using a standard gridded dataset from global maize and wheat fields were compared and their performance evaluated using measured N2O emission data points (777 globally distributed datapoints). The models were used to quantify spatially disaggregated N2O emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields globally and the values were compared. Although the models differed in their performance of capturing the level of measured N2O emissions, they produced similar spatial patterns of annual N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields. Irrespective of the models, predicted N2O emissions per hectare were higher in some countries in East and South Asia, North America, and Western Europe, driven mainly by higher N application rates. The study indicated a substantial N2O abatement potential if application of excess N in the maize and wheat systems is reduced without compromising the yield of the crops through technological and crop management innovations. N2O mitigation potential is higher in those countries and regions where N application rates and current N2O emissions are already high. The estimated mitigation potentials are useful for hotspot countries to target fertilizer and crop management as one of the mitigation options in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). © 2021 The Authors","Global; Maize; Mitigation; N2O emission; Nitrogen fertilization; Wheat","Environmental regulations; Global warming; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Global; Global scale; Maize; Maize fields; Mitigation; N$-2$/O; N2O emission; Nitrogen fertilization; Wheat; Wheat fields; Crops; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; mitigation; nitrous oxide; soil quality; wheat; yield response; Article; Asia; comparative study; controlled study; crop management; crop production; Europe; fertilizer application; food intake; maize; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil property; soil texture; statistical model; wheat; agriculture; China; North America; soil; wheat; Far East; North America; South Asia; Western Europe; Agriculture; Asia; China; Europe; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; North America; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103945603

A systematic sampling method was used to establish twenty-five sample plots of 40 m × 40 m (0.16 ha) each that were used to survey the entire 3,925 ha area of the community forest. Cluster analysis identified two different forest types: dry dipterocarp forest and mixed deciduous forest. It was determined that the above-ground carbon stock did not vary significantly between them. An analysis of carbon sequestration in the community forest indicates that carbon stock increased under CFM from 2007 to 2018 by an estimated 28,928 t C and participation in the carbon market would have yielded approximately US $339,730.43 or US $8.66 /ha/year to the community for that 10-year period. Projections for 2028 reflect that carbon stock will experience continual growth which indicates that maintaining CFM can increase carbon sequestration and reduce CO2 emissions. However, though further growth of carbon stock in the community forest is expected into 2038, that growth would be at a lesser rate than during the preceding decade. This suggests that CFM management should address forest utilization practices with a focus on maintaining long term carbon stock growth. Additional measures to address the impact of drought conditions and to safeguard against forest fires are required to sustain tree species' growth and expansion in order to increase their carbon accumulation potential. Thailand's community forest involvement in REDD+ and participation in its international carbon market could create more economic opportunities for local communities. © 2021 Thammanu et al.

The major applications for fibres are for the reinforcement of sprayed concrete and pre-cast concrete segmental linings, but fibre reinforcement is also increasingly used for other applications such as trackbed/trackslab and minor precast concrete elements such as cable ducts, drip shields, and drainage elements. As the technology has matured, a wide variety of fibre types, made from different materials, has emerged. Standards have been developed for the manufacture, testing and application of all these fibre types. Moreover, design guidelines and codes have been published and new design methods are still being developed. The International Tunnelling Association has published several guidance documents in this field.

The biodiversity and ecology of soil phagotrophic protists are still largely uncharacterized, especially in the Antarctic, which possesses some of the harshest terrestrial environments known and potentially many physiologically unique and scientifically interesting species. Antarctic soil systems are also highly limited in terms of moisture, temperature, and carbon, and the resulting reduced biological complexity can facilitate fine-tuned investigation of the drivers and functioning of microbial communities. To facilitate and encourage future research into protist biodiversity and ecology, especially in context of the broader functioning of Antarctic terrestrial communities, I review the biodiversity, distribution, and ecology of Antarctic soil phagotrophic protists. Biodiversity appears to be highly structured by region and taxonomic group, with the Antarctic Peninsula having the highest taxonomic diversity and ciliates (Ciliophora) being the most diverse taxonomic group. However, richness estimates are likely skewed by disproportionate sampling (over half of the studies are from the peninsula), habitat type bias (predominately moss-associated soils), investigator bias (toward ciliates and the testate amoeba morphogroup), and methodological approach (toward cultivation and morphological identification). To remedy these biases, a standardized methodology using both morphological and molecular identification and increased emphasis on microflagellate and naked amoeba morphogroups is needed. Additionally, future research should transition away from biodiversity survey studies to dedicated ecological studies that emphasize the function, ecophysiology, endemicity, dispersal, and impact of abiotic drivers beyond moisture and temperature. © 2021, The Author(s).","Abiotic drivers of protist communities; Antarctic protozoa; Corythion dubium; Phagotrophic soil protists; Protist diversity","biodiversity; environmental factor; habitat type; protozoan; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy; terrestrial ecosystem; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Ciliophora; Eukaryota; Protista; Protozoa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108232102

This is perhaps unsurprising, given that limited literature on the theory and practice of PES has a dedicated focus on businesses. This article unifies the PES and business literatures in order to address the awareness and management challenges that corporations face in engaging in PES. First, it shows how corporations fit into the economic theory that underpins PES, demonstrating that corporate-financed PES schemes can exhibit a diversity and hybridity of Coasean and Pigouvian characteristics. Second, it shows how PES fits into corporate sustainability theory, demonstrating how PES can help companies achieve synergies across the economic, environmental, and social tenets of the triple bottom line; for example, by helping gain social license to operate from adjacent communities, or by using PES to meet sustainability reporting requirements related to emissions and water management. Third, it shows the different PES options available to firms based on their industrial sector, operating practices, and business strategies. The options with higher potential are maintenance and enhancement of production inputs across the supply chain, and carbon offsetting and insetting to help meet climate change mitigation regulations and avoid fines. Fourth, it identifies lessons learned when transitioning from theory to practice by synthesising the latest empirical research on corporate-financed PES schemes—considering exactly what these ‘should’ or ‘could’ resemble, for example, in terms of their additionality, conditionality, permanence, co-benefits, budgeting, and bargaining. Examples are drawn from corporate-financed schemes in forests and watersheds across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The article concludes that these schemes remain small in number and size, but have significant potential to increase—and this can be aided by future research on corporate motives, understandings, and actions on PES. © 2021 by the author.

We assess existing solar subsidies and also find the optimal subsidy schedule that maximizes net benefits starting in the year 2018. In the base case the national flexible optimal subsidy schedule begins at $585/kW and declines to zero in 14 years. The optimal subsidy starts higher and falls more quickly than the current federal tax credit, due to long-term benefits from early cost reductions and the need to reduce subsidies as a technology becomes cheaper. We also estimate state-by-state flexible subsidies which result in higher net benefits compared to a homogenous national subsidy ($2.8 billion versus $1.0 billion).

Indeed, the origins of neoliberal advocacy for global economic liberalisation can be traced, at least in part, to the resistance of oil multinationals to nationalist governments attempting to assert ownership and control over natural resources. It is therefore striking that calls are now mounting from this quarter for the nationalization of fossil fuel infrastructures, to keep them operating as climate policy, loss of public legitimacy and changing market conditions increasingly make investments in them unprofitable, uninsurable, or uncompetitive. The Canadian government's purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline exemplifies what we term a ‘neoliberal nationalization’. Neoliberal pundits and oil industry figures created the perception of both an immediate economic crisis and a longer-term crisis of investor confidence in Canada; these ‘crises’ were used to justify the nationalization. Critically, the government acquisition of the pipeline was framed as a temporary measure of last resort. The intention of a neoliberal nationalization is to protect corporate actors from the effects of their own irresponsible business practises, maintaining ‘business as usual’ by pre-emptively socializing the foreseeable risks of rapid capital asset devaluation. In the case of hydrocarbon infrastructures like Trans Mountain, state authority is called upon to ensure the continued profitability of private fossil energy extraction, even as global financial markets accelerate disinvestment from the sector in response to evidence that most fossil fuels must remain in the ground to prevent catastrophic climate change. © 2021 The Authors","Canada; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Nationalization; Neoliberalism; Stranded assets","climate change; environmental policy; fossil fuel; national identity; nationalism; neoliberalism; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109076289

To examine how these factors can constrain or catalyze green infrastructure projects, we facilitated the development of two green infrastructure demonstration and education projects in Coos Bay and LaGrande, two small communities in the state of Oregon, USA. Concurrent with the development of these projects, we conducted interviews with local community leaders and natural resource professionals in 12 other small communities to broaden our understanding of catalysts and constraints pertaining to implementation process. This research illustrates that implementing and sustaining green infrastructure projects in small communities can have an unique set of constraints. For example, both unwieldy regulations and a lack of regulations constrain green infrastructure implementation. We found that in small communities that fell under federal regulations, stakeholders felt constrained by the regulations, particularly given the limited capacity of staff, expertise, and funding to comply with these regulations. Conversely, communities that were not under regulatory edicts we able to take a more flexible approach. Catalysts that can help drive and sustain green infrastructure projects include close relationships with staff, landowners, and the public, and a dedicated source of funding. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Catalysts; Constraints; Green infrastructure; Small communities","education; greenspace; infrastructure planning; natural resource; stakeholder; Coos Bay; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106863759

Air voids present between the surfaces of the sample set induce anomalous heat transfer behaviour in the rocks by increasing the thermal contact resistance. The Slab model derived for the Pulse Transient Technique supports data evaluation by introducing two additional parameters in the experiment i.e. the heat capacity of the heat source (C) and the heat transfer coefficient between the heat source and specimen (α) that is related with the specimen planarity, surface roughness and the air gaps at the interfaces. The experiment was performed under two different states of thermal contact at the sample - heat source interfaces to show the influence of the decreased thermal contact resistance by filling the air voids with a thermally conductive paste made of bentonite powder mixed with water. Temperature response during measurement of thermal properties of the samples has clearly shown the effect of poor thermal contact at the untreated interfaces compared to the case when thermal contact at the interface has been improved by application of thermally conductive bentonite paste. Moreover, measurements using the bentonite paste as the heat contact agent exhibited reduced scattering in data calculated using the Slab model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Porosity; Pulse Transient Technique (PTT); Sensitivity coefficients and uncertainty analysis; Slab model (SM); Thermal contact resistance; Thermophysical properties of rocks","Bentonite; Contact resistance; Heat transfer; Interface states; Parameter estimation; Phase interfaces; Specific heat; Surface roughness; Thermal conductivity of solids; Conductive pastes; Measurement of thermal properties; Non-planar surfaces; Temperature response; Thermal contact resistance; Thermal response; Thermo-physical parameters; Transient techniques; Heat resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105531901

This land use has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through their carbon sequestration capacity as well as to produce renewable energy sources through wood biomass for charcoal and wood pellet. Since Gunungkidul is unique in terms of geomorphological characteristics, study on the vegetation structure, biomass estimation, and carbon storage of wono across geomorphological zones are important. Therefore, this study describes the vegetation structure of wono in three geomorphological zones of Gunungkidul District, as well as estimates the aboveground living biomass (AGB) and aboveground living carbon storage (AGC). The quadratic sampling technique was used to collect data for vegetation analysis with the size of the plots were 20 m x 20 m, 10 m x 10 m, 5 m x 5 m, and 2 m x 2 m for trees, poles, saplings, and seedlings, respectively. A total of 32 plots were established, consisting of 18 plots in Nglanggeran Village, 12 plots in Dengok Village, and six plots in Girisekar Village, each village representing geomorphological zones of Batur Agung, Ledok Wonosari, and Pegunungan Sewu, respectively. The AGB was performed non-destructively and estimated using referenced allometric equations. Furthermore, the AGC was calculated using a conversion factor of 0.47 from the obtained AGB. The results showed that the identified species at wono in Batur Agung, Ledok Wonosari, and Pegunungan Sewu zones were 13, 7, and 8, respectively. Swietenia macrophylla had the highest important value index (IVI) of 185.22% in the Batur Agung zone, while Tectona grandis was the most important species in both the Ledok Wonosari and Pegunungan Sewu zones with IVI= 238.27% and 178.60%, respectively. The biodiversity in these three zones was very low in terms of species diversity (H' &lt; 2) and species richness (R1 &lt; 3.4).

Elisabeth Marta Tómmerbakk explores why a transition towards a post-carbon society is so difficult to accomplish by examining how the relationship between petroleum production and climate change is politically framed and negotiated in contested cases. This question is approached through a process-oriented comparative case study of Lofoten, located in the Norwegian Sea above the Arctic Circle, and Yasuní-ITT (Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini) located in the Ecuadorian Amazon: regions that both belong to oil-exporting countries with highly oil-dependent economies. Tómmerbakk draws on rich empirical data that includes qualitative interviews with subjects in both countries and applies an Actor-Network Theory framework to show that oil and climate are intricately entangled in knowledge and policy practices. Overall, Assembling Petroleum Production and Climate Change in Ecuador and Norway provides an in-depth examination of how climate science and petroleum extraction are negotiated, adapted, assembled, and coordinated with other national policies and political aims.

Predicted climate change (precipitation reductions and temperature increases) and anthropogenic activities such as groundwater drawdown jeopardise the functioning of these ecosystems, presenting new challenges for their management. We developed a trait-based analysis to examine the spatiotemporal variability in the ecophysiology of Ziziphus lotus, a long-lived phreatophyte that dominates one of the few terrestrial GDEs of semiarid regions in Europe. We assessed morpho-functional traits and stem water potential along a naturally occurring gradient of depth-to-groundwater (DTGW, 2–25 m) in a coastal aquifer, and throughout the species-growing season. Increasing DTGW and salinity negatively affected photosynthetic and transpiration rates, increasing plant water stress (lower predawn and midday water potential), and positively affected Huber value (sapwood cross-sectional area per leaf area), reducing leaf area and likely, plant hydraulic demand. However, the species showed greater salt-tolerance at shallow depths. Despite groundwater characteristics, higher atmospheric evaporative demand in the study area, which occurred in summer, fostered higher transpiration rates and water stress, and promoted carbon assimilation and water loss more intensively at shallow water tables. This multiple-trait analysis allowed us to identify plant ecophysiological thresholds related to the increase in salinity, but mostly in DTGW (13 m), and in the evaporative demand during the growing season. These findings highlight the existence of tipping points in the functioning of a long-lived phreatophyte in drylands and can contribute to the sustainable management of GDEs in southern Europe, paving the way for further studies on phreatophytic species. © 2021, The Author(s).","Depth-to-groundwater gradient; Ecophysiological threshold; Groundwater salinity; Plant functional traits; Rhamnaceae; Ziziphus lotus","climate change; ecohydrology; ecophysiology; growing season; leaf area; semiarid region; shallow water; shrub; sustainability; transpiration; water stress; Europe; Morpho; Rhamnaceae; Ziziphus lotus; ground water; water; climate change; ecosystem; salinity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Groundwater; Salinity; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111573559

This paper proposes the use of spatial analysis approaches (i.e., ordinary least squares [OLS] and the Hurst exponent) combined with time-series analysis using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data, derived from LANDSAT via the Google Earth Engine, to estimate the trends and sustainability of vegetation dynamics in the Tra Vinh Province in the Mekong River Delta. We also assessed the EVI changes connected to land change issues to examine the influence of land use conversion on vegetation dynamics. Results show that a large portion of the study area was covered by abundant vegetation (over 50% of the total area), and the increased EVI area was about 5.5-times greater than the area of EVI reduction. Additionally, vegetation sustainability was being seriously compromised (e.g., a decrease in the total area of 8,275 ha) due to several land conversion drivers such as shrimp farming, urbanisation, and industrialisation. Furthermore, results obtained from this research provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation coverage and reveal the consistency of future vegetation trends. Moreover, the study also quantitatively assessed the positive impacts of Buddhist doctrines on reducing the negative trend of vegetation change in the study area. These findings can lay the ground to formulate sustainable land and environmental plans that meet the 11th, 13th and 15th Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (i.e., the sustainable cities and communities, the climate actions, and the life on land).

Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7–16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","16S amplicon sequencing; Carbon cycling; Indicator analysis; Labile; Recalcitrant; TeaComposition H2O","Decay (organic); Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Water; Wetlands; 16s amplicon sequencing; Carbon cycling; Coastal wetlands; Freshwater wetlands; Indicator analyse; Labile; Microbiome; Prokaryotics; Recalcitrant; Teacomposition H2O; Carbon; fresh water; carbon; fresh water; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coastal wetland; decomposition analysis; incubation; numerical model; oxygen; abiotic stress; Article; Australia; biotic stress; climate change; controlled study; decomposition; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; herbal tea; leaching; mangrove; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; seagrass; seashore; wetland; ecosystem; microflora; soil; tea; wetland; Aspalathus linearis; Indicator indicator; Prokaryota; Australia; Carbon; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Microbiota; Soil; Tea; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103974321

Shallots production in Indonesia is limited by the quality of planting material and the climate, especially temperature. The flowering of shallots is a significant obstacle to the regulation of tuber development and bulbils. This study aimed to examine the effect of treatment on the initiation of flowering and the formation of bulbils. Methods: The method used was a complete randomized block design with six treatments: without treatment, vernalization at 5°C, Immersion GA3 100 ppm, Immersion IAA 100 ppm, Immersion NAA 100 ppm, injury to the flower stalk and three replications. Result: The treatment of flowering initiation and the formation of bulbils had a significant effect on the flowering day, the number of flower stalks, the percentage of flowering plants, number weight of bulbils and weight of bulbils. GA3 and vernalization can speed up the appearance of flowers and increase the percentage of flowering plants. GA3 and the opening of the flower stalks can encourage the formation of bulbils with a higher weight and diameter of the tubers. The flowering day had a negative correlation with the number of bulbils formed. Bulbils formation requires a higher content of endogenous GA3. GA3 can initiate the flowering and formation of shallot bulbils. © 2021.

Findings indicated that higher monthly per capita incomes (12.1–80.1$) were associated with greater average calorie intakes (2021–2525 kcal d−1). As estimated by the FEEDME model, in total 17.2% of the population was calorie malnourished with a regional disparity of 29.4–18.2% malnourishment. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated only on the basis of crop and livestock production and consumption. Rice accounted for the highest share of total GHG emissions, on average 82.6% on a production basis, which varied from 58.1% to 94.9% in regional basis. Rice contributed the greatest share (~ 65% and 66.2%) in terms of both calories and GHG emissions (CO2 eq y−1), respectively, on a consumption basis. We conclude that extensive rice farming and increasing animal product consumption are dominant factors in the higher carbon footprint in this region and are likely to further increase with increase in per capita income. This study provides useful information to help for better crop planning and for fine-tuning food access policy, to reduce carbon footprint and calorie malnutrition. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Calorie malnutrition; FEEDME; Greenhouse gas; Monthly per capita income; Rice","animal product; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas; household survey; livestock farming; rice; socioeconomic survey; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100057510

The residential and commercial sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2 ) of a building envelope renovation project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones, orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual energy consumption and LCCO2 . With regard to annual energy consumption, the RMSE was 227.09 kW·h (per year) and the R2 was 0.992. For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO2 eq and the R2 was 0.989, which indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early stages of building design and renovation. © 2021 by the authors.

The existing literature emphasises informing people about the scientific consensus on climate change, but the underlying research has been conducted mainly in the US, where prior beliefs in human-made climate change are lower than in many other countries with the highest per-capita emissions. We test consensus messages in an ‘extended gateway belief model’ using a pre-registered survey experiment on a representative quota sample of the German population (N = 1171). Our data show that consensus messages are likely to have no or only minimal effects on perceived scientific agreement, intended behaviour change and policy support. Still, in line with prior research, we find that perceived scientific agreement, belief in climate science, efficacy beliefs, and worry about climate change predict policy support and intended behaviour change. These results demonstrate that effective communication needs tailoring to its local context. © 2021 The Authors","Behaviour change; Consensus messages; Efficacy beliefs; Gateway belief model; Policy support",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111537924

Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of 1-L in DMF under Ar exhibited two reversible redox responses at -1.42 V (1st step) and -2.32 V (2nd step) vs. the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox potential, which could be assigned to 1-L/1− (with release of L) and 1−/12− pairs, respectively. The CV measurement with adding 4.0% water suggests that water replaces the axial L ligand on 1-L, but no longer interacts with 1− and 12− because of requiring no axial ligand. In CV of 1-L in the CO2-saturated DMF solution, a relatively weak reduction wave appeared at -1.70 V of the peak reduction potential (Ep1’) in the 1'st step, which is attributed to the reduction of 1-L with the concerted oxidative coordination of CO2 onto the axial site to form [1-CO2]−. CV of 1-L exhibited the significant catalytic current below the onset potential (Eon) of -1.9 V for CO2 reduction. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction proceeded stably in the presence of 2.0% water as a proton source. The Eon value increased linearly from -1.98 to -1.89 V with the water content increase from 0 to 4.0%. The hypothetical [1-CO2]−/[1-CO2]2− reduction (2'nd step) involved in the catalytic CO2 reduction might be proton-coupled redox process of [1-CO2]−/[1-CO2H]−. The bulk electrolysis by 1-L in the 2.0% water-containing DMF solution at -2.32 V afforded H2 with 3.0% Faraday efficiency (FE) and HCO2H with 68% FE. The selectivity (RHCO2H) for HCO2H production was 96%, defined as the molar fraction of HCO2H in all the products. The overpotential (η) for CO2 reduction to HCO2H was 0.62 V (at -2.07 V vs Fc/Fc+).

However, the cost of capturing high-purity CO2 typically used for geological storage (e.g., 98%) is high. Direct air capture (DAC), a technology that extracts CO2 of relatively low-purity from the ambient atmosphere, has been recently proposed as a means to achieve negative CO2 emissions when the product is sequestered underground. Although the CO2 produced by DAC is of low-purity, the other gaseous components (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) are not hazardous materials like NOx and SOx that must be typically dealt with by conventional projects in coal-burning plants. Here, we evaluate geological storage of the low-purity CO2 captured via advanced membrane-based DAC technology. The ubiquity of ambient air is important in reducing transport costs and ensuring social acceptance as the CO2 product can be both produced and stored at sites in remote areas, such as deserts and offshore platforms. We calculated the density of CO2–N2–O2 mixtures via molecular dynamics simulation and evaluated the cost of the low-purity CO2 storage. Our evaluation suggests that the storage of low-purity CO2 in geological formations is environmentally acceptable and economically viable. © 2021 The Authors.

The analysis was performed as a function of the adopted targets for reducing CO2 emissions by 2020, with a prospect for 2030 and 2050. In all the analysed countries, the energy and heat production sectors were responsible for the highest carbon dioxide emissions.

BPMs exhibit a unique property to accelerate water dissociation and ionic separation that allows for maintaining a steady-state pH gradient in electrochemical devices without a significant loss in process efficiency, thereby allowing a broader catalyst material selection for the respective oxidation and reduction reactions. However, the formation of high-performance BPMs with significantly reduced overpotentials for driving water dissociation and ionic separation at conditions and rates that are relevant to energy technologies is a key challenge. Herein, we perform a detailed assessment of the requirements in base materials and optimal design routes for the BPM layer and interface formation. In particular, the interface in the BPM presents a critical component with its structure and morphology influencing the kinetics of water dissociation reaction governed by both electric field and catalyst driven mechanisms. For this purpose, we present, among others, the advantages and drawbacks in the utilization of a bulk heterojunction formed in 3D structures that recently have been reported to demonstrate a possibility of designing stable and high-performance BPMs. Also, the outer layers of a BPM play a crucial role in kinetics and mass transport, particularly related to water and ion transport at electrolyte-membrane and membrane-catalyst interfaces. This work aims at identifying the gaps in the structure-property of the current monopolar materials to provide prospective facile design routes for BPMs with excellent water dissociation and ionic separation efficiency. It extends to a discussion about material selection and design strategies of advanced BPMs for application in emerging electrochemical energy systems. ©","2D/3D interfaces; bipolar membrane; energy conversion and storage; ion exchange membrane; pH gradient; water dissociation","Catalysts; Dissociation; Electric fields; Electrochemical devices; Electrolytes; Heterojunctions; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Separation; Bulk heterojunction; Catalyst interfaces; Electrochemical energy; Electrolyte membrane; Interface formation; Interface materials; Oxidation and reduction; Structure and morphology; Interfaces (materials)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112441729

However, dynamic acquisitions can be challenging given the long required scan duration of 130 min. The current study assessed the effect of shorter scan protocols for [18F]flortaucipir on its quantitative accuracy. Procedures: Two study cohorts with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and healthy controls (HC) were included. All subjects underwent a 130-min dynamic [18F]flortaucipir PET scan consisting of two parts (0–60/80–130 min) post-injection. Arterial sampling was acquired during scanning of the first cohort only. For the second cohort, a second PET scan was acquired within 1–4 weeks of the first PET scan to assess test-retest repeatability (TRT). Three alternative time intervals were explored for the second part of the scan: 80–120, 80–110 and 80–100 min. Furthermore, the first part of the scan was also varied: 0–50, 0–40 and 0–30 min time intervals were assessed. The gap in the reference TACs was interpolated using four different interpolation methods: population-based input function 2T4k_VB (POP-IP_2T4k_VB), cubic, linear and exponential. Regional binding potential (BPND) and relative tracer delivery (R1) values estimated using simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and/or receptor parametric mapping (RPM). The different scan protocols were compared to the respective values estimated using the original scan acquisition. In addition, TRT of the RPM BPND and R1 values estimated using the optimal shortest scan duration was also assessed. Results: RPM BPND and R1 obtained using 0–30/80–100 min scan and POP-IP_2T4k_VB reference region interpolation had an excellent correlation with the respective parametric values estimated using the original scan duration (r2 &gt; 0.95). The TRT of RPM BPND and R1 using the shortest scan duration was − 1 ± 5 % and − 1 ± 6 % respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that [18F]flortaucipir PET scan can be acquired with sufficient quantitative accuracy using only 50 min of dual-time-window scanning time. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; PET; [18F]Flortaucipir","flortaucipir f 18; Alzheimer disease; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis software; dimensional measurement accuracy; feasibility study; human; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; quantitative analysis; test retest reliability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099974806

Conversely, global wind power installed capacity is continuously growing during the last years. The economic viability and sustainability of centralized wind projects relies heavily on wind resources, efficient technologies, and an attractive and dynamic Feed-in-Tariff (FIT). Therefore, this study assesses the potential effect of global warming on the life-cycle techno-economic viability of future wind power projects in Central Asia, specifically in Kazakhstan. Hence, the Ereymentau Wind Power Plant (WPP) in the Northern region of Kazakhstan was selected as case study. Historic data showed that monthly averaged wind speed and ambient pressure can be treated as statistically stationary, and only the air density drop due to temperature increase of 0.2°C per decade is assumed in the present study. Our results predict a reduction in Net Present Value, Benefit–Cost Ratio, and Internal Rate of Return of 29 million KZT, of 0.0015, and 0.03%, respectively, in the lifetime of Ereymentau WPP. Moreover, an Equity payback increase of 0.4 years and a drop of 987 tCO2e in GHG emission reductions are projected. Consequently, our results indicate that global warming, despite of being a global problem of significance, would have a negligible impact in ongoing plans to develop the wind potential in Northern regions of Eurasian countries sharing similar conditions to those present in Ereymentau-Kazakhstan. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Central Asia; climate change; global warming; life-cycle cost analysis; RETScreen expert; wind power","Earnings; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Wind; Ambient pressures; Economic viability; Efficient technology; Internal rate of return; Potential effects; Temperature increase; Wind power production; Wind power projects; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100839925

In addition, hydrocarbon induced alterations possible hydrocarbon microseepage areas were detected with remote sensing method and hydrocarbon field detection was made by adapting to conceptual microseepage theory model. In this study, where all these methods were evaluated together, it was seen that the Amik Basin and the west of Reyhanlı could be evaluated in terms of hydrocarbon deposits in the study area. This study can be applied for assessment of reservoir distribution and reduction of uncertainty during hydrocarbon field exploration and used to similar hydrocarbon reservoirs. Article Highlights: The hydrocarbon potential of Hatay province was investigated by evaluating the geological, geochemical, hydrogeochemical and remote sensing methods in the study. Combined geochemical, hydrochemical and soil gas methods show a hydrocarbon reservoir under Amik Basin (Hatay), and also a giant microseepage zone was detected by remote sensing methods. In this study, where all these methods were evaluated together, it was seen that the Amik Basin and the west of Reyhanlı could be evaluated in terms of hydrocarbon deposits in the study area. This study can be applied for assessment of reservoir distribution and reduction of uncertainty during hydrocarbon field exploration and can be used to similar hydrocarbon reservoirs explorations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Geochemistry; Hydrocarbon exploration; Hydrocarbon induced alterations; Hydrocarbon microseepage; Hydrogeochemical and remote sensing methods","Deposits; Gasoline; Geology; HTTP; Hydrocarbons; Hydrochemistry; Ion exchange; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Radon; Remote sensing; Depositional environment; Hydrocarbon deposits; Hydrocarbon exploration; Hydrocarbon potential; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Hydrogeochemical methods; Petroleum exploration; Reservoir distribution; Petroleum prospecting; data interpretation; depositional environment; detection method; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon reservoir; hydrogeochemistry; petroleum hydrocarbon; remote sensing; seepage; Hatay; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105546966

It is on recorded that Chile as a country has moved from highly insufficient to insufficient and still working towards conforming to recommend the region of 2°C in quest of controlling climate change through carbon emission reduction. From this development, it is essential to investigate on the country’s strategies in achieving this success and equally make recommendation for other countries to adopt Chile’s strategy as a blue print in controlling carbon emission. To effectively do this and achieve the objective of this study, I adopt nonlinear and asymmetric approaches to have a combined (positive and negative) view of the reactions of the selected variable towards determining the impact of each variable towards curbing emission in Chile. Also, a careful selection of variable which includes economic growth (GDP per capita-Y), institutional quality, foreign direct investment (FDI), fossil fuels, and renewable energy consumption was undertaken in this study. The focus was on the interaction of institutional quality and FDI towards ascertainment of environment performance. Chile’s quarterly data of 1996Q1 to 2018Q4 was utilized, and the following findings were made: positive and negative shocks to the economic growth, institutional quality, and renewable energy impacted favorably and negatively on Chile’s environment through reduction and promotion of emission, respectively. In contrast, positive and negative shocks to FDI and fossil fuels impact both negatively on the Chile’s environment through increase in carbon emission. So institutional quality is vital in controlling the negative impact from FDI and fossil fuels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chile; Economic growth; FDI; Institutional quality; Nonlinear study; Sustainable study","asymmetry; carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental impact assessment; environmental quality; foreign direct investment; institutional reform; mitigation; Chile; carbon dioxide; economic development; international cooperation; investment; renewable energy; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Internationality; Investments; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104233495

In this perspective, we challenge this limited view of NETs. We show how, notwithstanding their merit, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are largely responsible for establishing this opposition to NETs. This is because IAM-based assessments of NETs dominate the policy-facing literature, but as a result of model limitations, we are left with a deceptively shallow understanding of the role NETs could play to support long-term mitigation goals. Therefore, in the second part of this perspective, we provide a non-IAM-based fresh take on NETs. We explore NETs via a bottom-up analysis and introduce a decision-making framework to determine the circumstances under which NETs could provide value as a mitigation option at jurisdictional scales. We apply this framework to case studies in California and New Mexico, highlighting how NETs could overcome socio-technical obstacles and unlock a variety of environmental and social co-benefits as part of helping to achieve time-bound mitigation goals. Overall, this perspective aims to cut through what we see as a noisy discourse on NETs, which is wrapped-up in concerns that are dependent on scenario modeling and offer a plain evaluation of NETs as a potential climate change mitigation option. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","bioenergy; CCUS; climate mitigation; integrated assessment models; negative emissions; socio-technical","Decision making; Backstop technology; Bottom-up analysis; Climate change mitigation; Decision-making frameworks; Emission technology; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation options; Scenario Modeling; Climate change; bioenergy; carbon emission; decision making; integrated approach; lithium; seismic data; seismic noise; California; New Mexico; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111499085

Coalitions of national, subnational, and/or non-state actors have the potential to address the global challenge of climate change beyond the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. While initially such “clubs” spurred hope that they could be an option to achieve climate action more effectively than the UNFCCC, more recently, their role has been seen as preparing and orchestrating climate policy. In spite of its conceptual proliferation, literature on climate clubs stops short in examining practical evidence and conducting analyses beyond categorization and labelling of climate clubs. This article aims at contributing to filling this gap with a comparative perspective on three specific governance initiatives that act on different governance levels: the G20, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), and the Under2 Coalition. What contribution do these club-like initiatives make to global climate governance and how does it relate to existing structures such as the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC process? Our paper applies central aspects of clubs research, namely, membership, public goods, and the provision of additional benefits as an analytical framework to examine the three cases. We find that these club initiatives, though highly diverse in their origin and membership, make a similar contribution to international climate governance. Their largest contribution lies in preparing emissions reductions through raising awareness, orchestrating different actors and actions, and establishing a large cooperation network. They complement the UNFCCC and especially the Paris Agreement. © 2021, The Author(s).","Case study; Climate clubs; Climate governance; International climate policy; Minilateral policy approaches","Environmental regulations; Cooperation networks; Emissions reduction; Existing structure; Global challenges; Global climates; Non state actors; Playing fields; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Global warming; analytical framework; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; governance approach; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112730397

Leaf area index (LAI), canopy height (CH) and root depth (RD) are key parameters that regulate exchanges of heat and moisture between land and atmosphere. This study performs a meta-analysis combining unique data from 34 observational studies and 14 countries to estimate monthly variability in LAI, CH, and RD of three main bioenergy crops: miscanthus (MSC), switchgrass (SWG), and reed canary grass (RCG). Using the Community Land Model v.5.0 and the results from the meta-analysis, we also tested the effects that variability in parameterization of LAI and CH have on key components of the surface energy budget, relative to prescribed values. Results from the meta-analysis show a strong seasonality of LAI and CH, with mean (± one standard error) LAI values at the peak summer month of 6.05 ± 0.84, 5.56 ± 0.75, and 5.39 ± 1.15 m2/m2, and maximum CH of 246 ± 23, 147 ± 16, and 156 ± 10 cm, for MSC, SWG, and RCG, respectively. These values are typically larger than the default parameterizations in CLM. Information on RD was limited and average values are 172 ± 56, 165 ±46, and 193 ± 11 cm, for MSC, SWG, and RCG, respectively. The seasonal cycles of latent heat, sensible heat and surface albedo are primarily affected by the range of LAI values, and less sensitive to variability in CH. Relative to the default values, higher LAI values increase latent heat and decrease sensible heat, with the highest absolute changes in summer. They also decrease surface albedo in winter months due to a larger snow masking effect. Our results offer a basis to compare experimental work and modelling studies, improve parameterization in land surface models, and identify the importance of vegetation structure parameters to evaluate key climate processes in response to bioenergy crops. © 2021 The Authors","Biofuel crops; Climate models; Land surface models; Vegetation parameters","albedo; bioenergy; climate change; ecological modeling; grass; heat island; land surface; leaf area index; meta-analysis; seasonal variation; seasonality; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Phalaris arundinacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105868053

Recent efforts to redirect cities into a less energy-intensive model have been mostly approached from a sectoral perspective, with specific energy policies and plans being issued without deeply considering their ties with other urban aspects. In this sense, well-established urban planning procedures have not been part of those, with the consequence of barriers in the implementation phase of those energy plans. The Cities4ZERO methodology was developed to guide effective integration between urban planning and energy policies, plans, and practices. It provides a holistic approach to strategic municipal processes for urban decarbonisation in the mid-long term, which includes key local stakeholders’ engagement into integrated energy planning processes, as well as tools for effective energy decarbonisation modelling. This paper analyses the application of the Cities4ZERO decarbonisation methodology on its strategic stage in the development of Vitoria-Gasteiz’s Action Plan for an Integrated Energy Transition 2030 (APIET 2030). It suggests that in order to accelerate urban decarbonisation, it is critical to: (a) foster interdepartmental collaboration; (b) allow for flexibility on the land-use planning regulations; (c) back decisions with detailed urban-energy models; and (d) truly engage key local stakeholders in the planning and implementation processes. © 2021 by the authors.

Still, its cultivation emits substantial greenhouse gases (GHGs). The Indica and Japonica sub-species of Oryza sativa L. are mainly grown, with Indica holding the largest market share. The awareness, economics, and acceptability of Japonica rice in a food-insecure Indica rice-consuming population were surveyed. The impact of parboiling on Japonica rice was studied and the factors which most impacted stickiness were investigated through sensory and statistical analyses. A comparison of the growing climate and greenhouse gas emissions of Japonica and Indica rice was carried out by reviewing previous studies. Survey results indicated that non-adhesiveness and pleasant aroma were the most preferred properties. Parboiling treatment altered Japonica rice’s physical and chemical properties, introducing gelatinization of starch and reducing adhesiveness while retaining micronutrient concentrations. Regions with high food insecurity and high consumption of Indica rice were found to have suitable climatic conditions for growing Japonica rice. Adopting the higher-yielding, nutritious Japonica rice whose cultivation emits less GHG in these regions could help strengthen food security while reducing GHGs in global rice cultivation. © 2021 by the au-thors.

Exposure to PM2.5 can cause premature death and harmful and chronic health effects such as heart attack, diabetes, and stroke. The Environmental Protection Agency sets annual PM2.5 standards to reduce these negative health effects. Currently above an annual average level of 12.0 µg/m is considered unhealthy. Methods. We examined the association of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and CVD in a cohort of 44, 610 individuals who resided in 12 states recruited into the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). The SCCS was designed to recruit Black and White participants who received care from Federally Qualified Health Centers; hence, they represent vulnerable individuals from low-income families across this vast region. This study tests whether SCCS participants who lived in locations exposed to elevated ambient levels of PM2.5 concentrations were more likely to report a history of CVD at enrollment (2002-2009). Remotely sensed satellite data integrated with ground monitoring data provide an assessment of the average annual PM2.5 in urban and rural locations where the SCCS participants resided. We used multilevel logistic regression to estimate the associations between self-reported CVD and exposure to elevated ambient levels of PM2.5. Results. We found a 13.4 percent increase in the odds of reported CVD with exposure to unhealthy levels of PM2.5 exposure at enrollment. The SCCS participants with medical histories of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking had, overall, 385 percent higher odds of reported CVD than those without these clinical risk factors. Additionally, Black participants were more likely to live in locations with higher ambient PM2.5 concentrations and report high levels of clinical risk factors, thus, they may be at a greater future risk of CVD. Conclusions: In the SCCS participants, we found a strong relation between exposures to high ambient levels of PM2.5 and self-reported CVD at enrollment. © 2021 by the authors.

These carbonate reservoirs present exceptional reservoir quality with a challenging depositional and diagenetic history that produced complex and heterogeneous pore systems. As one of the most effective tools for in-situ porosity and permeability evaluation, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well log plays an essential role in the Pre-salt petrophysical evaluation and its signal interpretation must be performed carefully. This work proposes a new approach to detect and improve the interpretation of zones with unreal NMR logging tool readings in areas heavily affected by drilling mud invasion in caverns/vugs, which causes a T2 distribution shift towards lower relaxation times. This work analyses well log data from 28 wells in the Sapinhoá Field, supported by special core analyses (SCAL) and routine core analyses (RCAL), as well as plugs, sidewall cores and thin sections data. The proposed approach generates synthetic NMR Free Fluid and T2 distributions with minimum error and replaces the faulty data, consisting in five main steps, (1) computing new curves to be used as inputs; (2) detecting the zones affected by the invasion; (3) water saturation calculation by the saturation height modeling method; (4) calculating a synthetic NMR free fluid curve based on a relationship between a NMR-derived water saturation and the saturation height model; and (5) using the Random Forests algorithm to estimate a synthetic T2 distribution. The proposed method has a minimized error and resulted an increase of up to 10% thickness in the pay zone and a reduction of up to 9% in water saturation average, which may represent enormous amounts of oil depending on the reservoir area. This study provides a new method, which can be used in the improvement of petrophysical interpretations in highly heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs and thus reducing the exploratory and development risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); Petrophysics; Pre-salt; Well logging","Carbonates; Carbonation; Decision trees; Infill drilling; Learning systems; Nuclear magnetic logging; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Petrophysics; Carbonate reservoir; Case-studies; Free fluids; Log interpretation; Machine-learning; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance logs; Petrophysics; Pre salts; Water saturations; Nuclear magnetic resonance; data interpretation; drilling; hydrocarbon reservoir; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance; oil field; well logging; Atlantic Ocean; Santos Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103402023

The goals of the programme, which started in 2004, are to create jobs, sequester carbon, restore biodiversity, reduce erosion, improve soil water holding capacity and catalyse private sector investment for upscaling of restoration. Here we report on a region-wide experiment to identify factors that can improve project success. Measures of success were survivorship and annual aboveground biomass carbon sequestration (ABCsr) of spekboom truncheons some 33-57 months after planting-starting in March 2008-into 173 fenced plots (0.25 ha) located throughout the global extent of spekboom thicket vegetation. We also collected data for 18 explanatory variables under the control of managers, and an additional 39 variables reflecting soil physical and chemical characteristics and rainfall patterns post restoration, all beyond the influence of managers. Since the latter covariates were available for only 83 plots, we analysed the two data sets separately. We used a prediction rule ensemble to determine the most important predictors of restoration success. There was great variation in percentage survivorship (median = 24, range = 0-100%) and ABCsr (median = 0.009, range = 0-0.38 t C ha-1 yr-1). The model using management variables explained less variance (53%) in survivorship than the model incorporating additional soil and rainfall covariates (62%). ABCsr models were better fits (78 and 88% variance explained, respectively). All model configurations identified browse intensity as a highly influential predictor of restoration success. Predicted success was highest for plots located in target habitat; however, only 45% were thus located, suggesting the need for expert input and habitat modelling for improving target habitat identification. Frost exposure was another important predictor influencing all models but was likely a consequence of locating sites off target habitat. Sites planted on equatorward slopes during the warm season showed reduced carbon sequestration, possibly due to elevated soil moisture stress associated with high radiation loads. Physiographic factors associated with improved restoration success were location on sloping ground (reduced frost exposure), increasing longitude (more warm-season rainfall) and increasing latitude (less frost coastwards). Few trends were evident among post-restoration climatic factors beyond the control of managers. Higher rainfall during the year post restoration had a negative impact on carbon sequestration while higher rain during the early months post restoration had a positive effect on both carbon sequestration and survivorship. Soil factors showed little importance for the survivorship model, whereas silt content, % K and Mg CEC emerged as predictors of carbon sequestration. Our results have direct relevance for improving the success of landscape-scale restoration projects envisioned for the ca. 8,930 km2 of degraded spekboom thicket. © 2021 van der Vyver et al.","Biome-scale; Ecological restoration; Herbivory; Portulacaria afra; Restoration planting; Spekboom; Subtropical thicket; Target habitat","allometry; Article; biodiversity; biomass; biome; cancer risk; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; elephant; germination; habitat; herbivore; herbivory; human; latitude; longitude; medicinal plant; moisture; nonhuman; photosynthesis; physiological stress; Portulacaria afra; prediction; pregnancy; radiation exposure; soil acidity; soil moisture; South Africa; species distribution; succulent; survivorship; water holding capacity; water pollution; Wnt signaling; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112268075

Improvements in subway air quality may be possible by examining the potential to reduce these emissions. To this end, PM2.5 was measured on the trains and station platforms of the Toronto subway system. A comparison with previously published data for this system reveals significant changes in below ground platform PM2.5. A reduction of nearly one-third (ratio (95% CI): 0.69 (0.63, 0.75)) in PM2.5 from 2011 to 2018 appears to have resulted from a complete modernization of the rolling stock on one subway line. In contrast, below ground platform PM2.5 for another line increased by a factor of 1.48 (95% CI; 1.42, 1.56). This increase may be related to an increase in emergency brake applications, the resolution of which coincided with a large decrease in PM2.5 concentrations on that line. Finally, platform PM2.5 in two newly opened stations attained, within one year of operation, typical concentrations of the neighboring platforms installed in 1963. Combined, these findings suggest that the production of platform PM2.5 is localized and hence largely freshly emitted. Further, PM2.5 changed across this subway system due to changes in its operation and rolling stock. Thus, similar interventions applied intentionally may prove to be equally effective in reducing PM2.5. Moreover, establishing a network of platform PM2.5 monitors is recommended to monitor ongoing improvements and identify impacts of future system changes on subway air quality. This would result in a better understanding of the relationship between the operations and air quality of subways. © 2021 The Authors.

However, it is still unknown how species in hedgerows respond to temperature changes, and whether effects differ compared with those in nearby forests. We aimed to elucidate how ongoing changes in the climate system will affect the efficiency of hedgerows in supporting forest plant persistence and migration in agricultural landscapes. Methods: Here we report results from the first warming experiment in hedgerows. We combined reciprocal transplantation of plants along an 860-km latitudinal transect with experimental warming to assess the effects of temperature on vegetative growth and reproduction of two common forest herbs (Anemone nemorosa and Geum urbanum) in hedgerows versus forests. Key Results: Both species grew taller and produced more biomass in forests than in hedgerows, most likely due to higher competition with ruderals and graminoids in hedgerows. Adult plant performance of both species generally benefitted from experimental warming, despite lower survival of A. nemorosa in heated plots. Transplantation affected the species differently: A. nemorosa plants grew taller, produced more biomass and showed higher survival when transplanted at their home site, indicating local adaptation, while individuals of G. urbanum showed greater height, biomass, reproductive output and survival when transplanted northwards, likely owing to the higher light availability associated with increasing photoperiod during the growing season. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that some forest herbs can show phenotypic plasticity to warming temperatures, potentially increasing their ability to benefit from hedgerows as ecological corridors. Our study thus provides novel insights into the impacts of climate change on understorey plant community dynamics in hedgerows, and how rising temperature can influence the efficiency of these corridors to assist forest species' persistence and colonization within and beyond their current distribution range. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.","Anemone nemorosa; Climate change; Forest understorey plants; Geum urbanum; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape connectivity; Microclimate; Open-top chambers; Plant performance; Transplant experiment; Wooded corridors","climate change; colonization; community dynamics; hedgerow; light availability; phenotypic plasticity; photoperiod; plant community; temperature effect; understory; Anemone nemorosa; Geum urbanum; biomass; climate change; ecosystem; forest; plant; temperature; Biomass; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Plants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114624038

Energy-optimal algorithms are proposed to reduce the transportation sector’s fuel consumption and emissions. These algorithms optimize vehicles’ speed to lower energy consumption and emissions. However, recent studies argued that these algorithms could negatively impact traffic flow, create traffic congestions, and increase fuel consumption on the network-level. To over-come this problem, we propose a collective-energy-optimal adaptive cruise control (collective-ACC). Collective-ACC reduces fuel consumption and emissions by directly optimizing vehicles’ trajectories and indirectly by improving traffic flow. Collective-ACC is a bi-objective non-linear integer optimization. This optimization was solved by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Collective-ACC was compared with manual driving and self-centered adaptive cruise control (i.e., conventional energy-optimal adaptive cruise controls (self-centered-ACC)) in a traffic simulation. We found that collective-ACC reduced fuel consumption by up to 49% and 42% compared with manual driving and self-centered-ACC, respectively. Collective-ACC also lowered CO2, CO, NOX, and PMX by up to 54%, 70%, 58%, and 64% from manual driving, respectively. Game theory analyses were conducted to investigate how adopting collective-ACC could impact au-tomakers, consumers, and government agencies. We propose policy and business recommenda-tions to accelerate adopting collective-ACC and maximize its environmental benefits. © 2021 by the authors.

Drawing upon two strains of climate governance and collaborative governance literature, respectively, this article adopts a polycentric approach to the analysis of Oslo's urban climate governance. It unpacks the relationships between urban leadership, climate goal-setting and institutional design, and reveals how these variables condition the employment of a combination of integrative and interactive governing instruments that foster both self-governance and co-creation in climate responses. The article argues that broad and long-term political support facilitates the adoption of ambitious climate goals, utilization of regulatory powers, and the design and operations of innovative hybrid mixes of integrative and interactive governing instruments. The hybrid combination of instruments is what provides the basis for synergistic, predictable and dynamic forms of self-governance and co-created linkages among public and private ‘units’ within the wider urban climate governance ecosystem. Trans-local and transnational networks play an important role in building such capacities for urban climate governance. Local processes of co-creation and networked experimentations are ‘scaling up’ to change policies at city, national and international levels. The empirical observations from Oslo have implication for theories of polycentric urban climate governance and for the promise and limitations of co-creation in the climate arena.

OBJECTIVE: Here we comprehensively assess the effects of climate change on the environmental performance and productivity of three typical US dairy farms, and evaluate the potential benefits of adaptation strategies and implementation of Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) for mitigating these effects and the potential increases in environmental impact. METHODS: Using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM), we predicted the productivity and environmental impact of these baseline farms under current emission scenarios and climate projections of 6 general circulation models (GCM), for high and low emission scenarios. We simulated farm-specific BMPs for current and future climate conditions for both unadapted and ‘adapted’ field cultivation plans, based on experiences from other climate locations. Finally, the IFSM predictions were compared to those of two other process-based models to test result robustness. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We find that the environmental impact of the three northern US dairy farms (New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) generally increases by mid-century, if no mitigation measures are taken. Overall, feed production is maintained, as decreased corn grain yields are compensated by increased forage yields. Adoption of farm-specific Beneficial Management Practices can substantially reduce the GHG emissions and nutrient losses from dairy farms under current climate conditions and stabilize the environmental impact in future climate conditions, while maintaining farm productivity (milk and feed production). A comparison of three models corroborates the estimated reductions in methane and ammonia emissions associated with BMPs, as well as the relative trend in P-loss reduction. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a holistic assessment of the impacts of climate change on dairy production systems focusing on both feed production and environmental impacts. It demonstrates the interest of BMPs to both reduce GHG emissions and contribute to more resilient farming systems in a changing climate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beneficial management practices (BMP); Climate change; Dairy farm; Environmental impact; Feed production","assessment method; best management practice; climate change; climate conditions; dairy farming; environmental impact; farming system; management practice; milk production; New York [United States]; Pennsylvania; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106910500

In such cases, the presence of green roofs (GRs) and green walls (GWs) has several environmental benefits, including the capture of pollutants. Choosing appropriate designs of GWs and GRs to improve urban air quality is challenging because their performances depend on their constituent species and environmental characteristics of the particular locality. Capture of PM2.5 by different plant species of GRs and GWs has been measured only on monocultures. The impact of planting different species together (polycultures) on capturing PM2.5 remains unexplored. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of biodiverse GRs and GWs on PM2.5 capture. Seven species were analyzed as polycultures: Sedum album, Lampranthus spectabillis, Sedum spurium P, Lavandula angustifolia, Erigeron karvinskianus, Aptenia cordifolia, and Sedum palmeri. PM2.5 capture was measured by two methods: gravimetric determination and decay curve. Gravimetric results suggest that higher the biodiversity of plants in GRs and GWs, higher the PM2.5 capture, particularly for species with relatively low capture when used as monocultures. The ability to capture PM2.5 is dependent on the plant species, relative position of plants within the polyculture, and horizontal (GRs) or vertical (GWs) layout. Decay method results suggest that polycultures could be more effective in long-term reduction of high PM2.5 concentrations. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Air quality; Dry deposition; Green façades; Living walls; Polycultures; Vegetation species","biodiversity; greenspace; particulate matter; plant community; polyculture; roof; wall; Aptenia cordifolia; Erigeron karvinskianus; Lampranthus; Lavandula angustifolia; Phedimus spurius; Sedum album; Sedum palmeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109116836

Urban and peri-urban food production can be among nature-based strategies planned for improving urban food security, reducing emissions, and climate adaptation. Co-operative governance, strategic planning, and accountable institutions are needed to support urban agriculture (UA), in the face of climate risks, unplanned urban development, the gendered nature of food provision, and the inability of urban farmers to self-organize toward optimal market and land access outcomes. Using a case study approach guided by qualitative content analysis with information derived from web analysis, we apply the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to analyze underlying governance factors for UA in three selected Sub-Saharan African cities. Our three case cities of Kampala, Tamale and Cape Town reveal that UA is beginning to receive policy attention toward food security, and recognition for generating environmental, ecological, health, and human well-being benefits. Literature from specific cities however does not yet signal a local awareness and policy thrust regarding the associated and pertinent climate adaptation benefits of urban agriculture. We therefore recommend trans-disciplinary, locally-led, planning-based, and multi-sectoral approaches, involving a range of stakeholders toward recognizing and achieving the climate adaptation, environmental (ecologically restorative) and food security benefits of pursuing urban agriculture. This signals a larger role for the practice in sustainability discourse and SDGs 2 and 11, scaling out and up across large, medium and small towns, and cities of Sub-Saharan Africa. © Copyright © 2021 Vidal Merino, Gajjar, Subedi, Polgar and Van Den Hoof.","climate change adaptation; collaborative governance; food security; land use planning; Sub-Saharan Africa; urban agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113270865

Plant physiology is controlled by many environmental factors, and a number of complex feedbacks are involved, but soil moisture control on root water uptake is primary, particularly in sub-tropical to temperate ecosystems. Land surface models represent plant water stress in different ways, but most implement a water stress factor, β, which ranges linearly (more recently also curvilinearly) between β = 1 for unstressed vegetation and β = 0 at the wilting point, expressed in terms of volumetric water content ((Formula presented.)). (Formula presented.) is most commonly used to either limit A or gs, and hence carbon and water fluxes, and a pertinent research question is whether these treatments are in fact interchangeable. Following Egea et al. (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 2011, 151 (10), 1,370–1,384) and Verhoef et al. (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 2014, 191, 22–32), we have implemented new β treatments, reflecting higher levels of biophysical complexity in a state-of-the-art LSM, Joint UK Land Environment Simulator, by allowing root zone soil moisture to limit plant function non-linearly and via individual routes (carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance, or mesophyll conductance) as well as any (non-linear) combinations thereof. The treatment of β does matter to the prediction of water and carbon fluxes: this study demonstrates that it represents a key structural uncertainty in contemporary LSMs, in terms of predictions of gross primary productivity, energy fluxes and soil moisture evolution, both in terms of climate means and response to a number of European droughts, including the 2003 heat wave. Treatments allowing ß to act on vegetation fluxes via stomatal and mesophyll routes are able to simulate the spatiotemporal variability in water use efficiency with higher fidelity during the growing season; they also support a broader range of ecosystem responses, e.g., those observed in regions that are radiation limited or water limited. We conclude that current practice in weather and climate modelling is inconsistent, as well as too simplistic, failing to credibly simulate vegetation response to soil water stress across the typical range of variability that is encountered for current European weather and climate conditions, including extremes of land surface temperature and soil moisture drought. A generalized approach performs better in current climate conditions and promises to be, based on responses to recently observed extremes, more trustworthy for predicting the impacts of climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Vidale, Egea, McGuire, Todt, Peters, Müller, Balan-Sarojini and Verhoef.","heatwave 2003; internal CO2 concentration; photosyhthesis; soil moisture; stomatal conductance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114621877

The need to meet the growing food demands has also led to unsustainable farming practices with the intensive application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Biochar, a multifunctional carbon material, is being actively explored globally for simultaneously addressing the concerns related to improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change. Reviews on biochar, however, mainly confined to lab-scale studies analyze biochar production and its characteristics, its effects on soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The present review addresses this gap by focusing on biochar field trials to enhance the current understanding of its actual impact on the field, w.r.t. agriculture and climate change. The review presents an overview of the effects of biochar application as observed in field studies on soil health (soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties), crop productivity, and its potential role in carbon sequestration. General trends from this review indicate that biochar application provides higher benefits in soil properties and crop yield in degraded tropical soils vis-a-vis the temperate regions. The results also reveal diverse observations in soil health properties and crop yields with biochar amendment as different studies consider different crops, biochar feedstocks, and local climatic and soil conditions. Furthermore, it has been observed that the effects of biochar application in lab-scale studies with controlled environments are not always distinctly witnessed in corresponding field-based studies and the effects are not always synchronous across different regions. Hence, there is a need for more data, especially from well-designed long-term field trials, to converge and validate the results on the effectiveness of biochar on diverse soil types and agro-climatic zones to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Vijay, Shreedhar, Adlak, Payyanad, Sreedharan, Gopi, Sophia van der Voort, Malarvizhi, Yi, Gebert and Aravind.","biochar; carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; crop yield; soil amendment; soil properties; soil quality and health; sustainable agriculture","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Chemical contamination; Crops; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health; Population statistics; Productivity; Soils; Biochar amendments; Biological properties; Carbon sequestration; Chemical fertilizers; Controlled environment; Crop productivity; Farming practices; Rapid urbanizations; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114878701

Since the region is characterized by summer water shortages and recurrent drought conditions, a summer irrigation water demand forecast system has been developed, operating both at regional and Land Reclamation and Irrigation Board levels. Remote sensing crop detection is used in combination with a soil water balance model as a monitoring tool in support to water management and to optimize the use of available water resources. These instruments are also integrated with operational calibrated probabilistic seasonal forecast products currently based on Copernicus Climate Services, in order to evaluate summer irrigation water needs in advance in support to decision-making by water managers. Results obtained using this prediction system are characterized by a significant forecast skill. The sources of the predictability of this system are specifically evaluated, showing that the correct representation of crop geographical distribution is crucial for the ability of the system to capture spatial variability in irrigation demand. Furthermore, the system forecast skill is mostly due to the use of an empirical model to assess the hypodermic water table depth initialized by means of the observed meteorological data of the months before the beginning of the summer season. Finally, calibrated probabilistic seasonal predictions also contribute to a minor extent to the good performance of the system as a whole. © 2021 The Authors.

The safe transport of carbon dioxide via pipelines is an important aspect for developing large-scale Carbon Capture and Storage projects. Dispersion modeling for heavy gas such as carbon dioxide is considerably different from natural gas. The set up for modeling simulations is more challenging than conventional natural gas pipeline for several reasons, such as the differences in thermodynamics that must be considered. Moreover, when the carbon dioxide is transported in dense or liquid phase, the rapid phase changing, and possible consequent formation of solids should be considered. Finally, the equation of state required for accurate prediction of parameters is generally different than the ones applicable for natural gas. The main scope of this comprehensive review is to identify the most important parameters, critical events, suitable models, and identification of dispersion modeling issues.

Serbia is about to introduce the strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, a national decision-support system for implementation of the climate change law and strategy is yet to be developed. This study contributes to the implementation of adaptation policies at subnational levels by development of a decision-support model for local-level management of the climate change adaptation process. The study explores the potential for synergetic application of multicriteria decision making analysis and probabilistic reasoning methods by focusing on Bayesian networks, analytical hierarchy processes, and geographic information systems for selection of priority adaptation measures. The study was based on the formation of causal chains, which enable linking management decisions and socioeconomic or biophysical consequences into articulated sequences of conditional relationships. A model was tested in the forestry sector, and it clearly pointed out development of an early warning system and planning of water intake basins as priority adaptation measures. Since the results are shown as a probability distribution for each alternative solutions, the model can assist decision makers with prompt evaluation of various scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bayesian networks; Climate change adaptation; Multicriteria decision-making; Serbia; Wildfire risk","adaptive management; Bayesian analysis; climate change; decision support system; integrated approach; mitigation; multicriteria analysis; wildlife management; Balkans; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106730509

Alaska has 1/3 of United States federal lands, the bulk of the United States’ intact and wild lands, and over half of the country’s total terrestrial ecosystem carbon on federal lands. Managing Alaska’s public lands for climate and biodiversity conservation purposes over the next 30–50 years would provide meaningful and irreplaceable climate benefits for the United States and globe. Doing so via a co-management approach with Alaska’s 229 federally recognized tribes is likely not only to be more effective but also more socially just. This paper lays out the scientific case for managing Alaska’s public lands for climate stabilization and resilience and addresses three primary questions: Why is Alaska globally meaningful for biodiversity and climate stabilization? Why should Alaska be considered as a key element of a climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation strategy for the United States? What do we need to know to better understand the role of Alaska given future scenarios? We summarize evidence for the role Alaska’s lands play in climate stabilization, as well as what is known about the role of land management in influencing carbon storage and sequestration. Finally, we summarize priority research that is needed to improve understanding of how policy and management prescriptions are likely to influence the role Alaska plays in global climate stabilization and adaptation. © Copyright © 2021 Vynne, Dovichin, Fresco, Dawson, Joshi, Law, Lertzman, Rupp, Schmiegelow and Trammell.","adaptation; Alaska; biodiversity; carbon storage; climate change mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114898795

These are capable of contributing to the realization of sustainable development goals through averting food and nutritional insecurity, increasing and sustaining yields that translate into increased incomes and later reduced poverty. This is because CSAPs enable farmers to adapt and mitigate climate change effects. However, due to inappropriate communication of CSAPs to the farmers, to date, some farmers still see no escape route from the frightening effects of climate change and they are currently adopting a rather fatalistic attitude. This study investigated the information dissemination pathways used by different categories of smallholder potato farmers for and practice of CSAPs. It found a difference between information sources and practice of CSAPs at a 5% level of significance (χ2 = 100.12139, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 1.0), and a difference in the use of the three information dissemination pathways between men and women at a 5% level of significance (χ2 = 6.05949, df = 2, p < 0.05, Cramer's V = 0.17406). The three information dissemination pathways included media, neighbors and friends, and extension officers. Generally, farmers were aware and practiced the CSAPs investigated in this study except for irrigation with high awareness yet with low uptake percentage and potato seedlings and minitubers both with low awareness and practice respectively. This study recommended mainstreaming of CSAPs information. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adoption; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Gender; Information dissemination pathways; Kenya; Potato production; Smallholder farmers; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120910942

The empirical results demonstrate that high technology exports help to reduce overall energy demand with −0.154% and energy intensity with −0.254% in GCC countries. Notably, we observe that effects on technology exports on carbon intensity are significantly lower in magnitude with −0.010%. Notably, the long empirics are in consistent with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) of GCC countries (cleaner and affordable energy, environmental awareness, climate change action, etc.).

More importantly, there exists the untapped potential to harness its ability, as a diazotroph, to fix atmospheric N2 as an alternative nitrogen resource to synthetic fertilizers. While mechanisms for plant growth promotion remain controversial, especially in cereal crops, one irrefutable fact is these microorganisms rely heavily on plant-borne carbon as their main energy source in support of their own growth and biological functions. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), a microbial function that is reliant on nitrogenase enzyme activity, is extremely sensitive to the localized nitrogen environment of the microorganism. However, whether internal root colonization can serve to shield the microorganisms and de-sensitize nitrogenase activity to changes in the soil nitrogen status remains unanswered. We used RAM10, a GFP-reporting strain of H. seropedicae, and administered radioactive11CO2 tracer to intact 3-week-old maize leaves and followed11C-photosynthates to sites within intact roots where actively fluorescing microbial colonies assimilated the tracer. We examined the influence of administering either 1 mM or 10 mM nitrate during plant growth on microbial demands for plant-borne11C. Nitrogenase activity was also examined under the same growth conditions using the acetylene reduction assay. We found that plant growth under low nitrate resulted in higher nitrogenase activity as well as higher microbial demands for plant-borne carbon than plant growth under high nitrate. However, carbon availability was significantly diminished under low nitrate growth due to reduced host CO2 fixation and reduced allocation of carbon resources to the roots. This response of the host caused significant inhibition of microbial growth. In summary, internal root colonization did little to shield these endophytic microorganisms from the nitrogen environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Air quality information services in China mainly focus on the coming days to weeks. However, users may benefit from air quality information on climate time-scales—from months to decades; hereafter air quality climate services. We focused on key decision-makers and stakeholders that are users of air quality climate services and conducted five workshops with these identified users to ascertain their priorities for air quality climate services, and the reasoning behind these priorities. We also conducted a choice-based conjoint experiment via an online survey distributed amongst regional and local Climate Centres and Environmental Monitoring Centres to assess quantitatively the decision-makers’ needs. The results from the workshops and the survey showed that the needs for air quality climate services by users in China mainly relate to seasonal forecasting of winter haze events (PM2.5 levels and/or the meteorological conditions conducive to the dispersion of the air pollution); there is also some interest in long-term projections of haze under climate change and a growing interest in ozone pollution in summer. Spatial relevance is perceived to be important to regional and city-level stakeholders who prefer information on the city-level, whilst national-wide information is important for national government agencies. A high level of reliability of forecasts was needed for uptake. The findings on the needs for air quality climate services by potential users can support researchers and policy-makers in developing the scientific capacity and providing tailored and effective air quality climate services in China. © 2021","Air pollution governance; China; Climate service; Decision-maker needs; Mixed-methods","Air quality; Climate change; Information services; Surveys; Air pollution governance; China; Climate service; Decision makers; Decision-maker need; Decisions makings; Mixed method; Quality information; Quality services; Time-scales; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107686542

Economics is essentially the study of incentives. However, whether these incentives can replace attitudes and norms that deserve our protection is still unclear especially in the field of environment. And to answer this question, residents’ demand response (DR) for energy conservation and emission reduction trials have been taken. Large-scale, hybrid frequency historical data for electricity usage and microcosmic behavior data have been integrated and analyzed. Empirical results show that monetary incentives have a significant effect on residents’ electricity saving behavior, which saved 0.116 kgwatt-hours (kWh), accounting for 12% of the total demand in peak-hour consumption. Moral suasion has a significant effect only for residents from high-income communities with a reduction in usage by 8.9%. Through matching survey data analysis, we found that families participating in DR save electricity through adjusting other major and small appliances rather than reducing the usage of air conditioners. Families with large number of major and small appliances response 0.51 kWh and 0.38 kWh more, respectively. Monetary incentive is indispensable in China's current stage of encouraging families’ reducing peak-hour electricity usage. © 2021","Behavioral economics; Large scale trials; Monetary incentives; Moral suasion; Peak load reduction behavior","Air conditioning; Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Behavioral economics; Demand response; Economic principle; Electricity usage; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Large scale trial; Large-scales; Monetary incentive; Moral suasion; Peak load reduction behavior; Electric power utilization; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use; incentive; monetary policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105278752

To prevent catastrophic effects of climate change, urgent reductions in GHG emissions are needed. Unnecessary preoperative testing and clinic visits contribute to excessive utilization of healthcare resources and patient travel, and addressing them may help reduce emissions. A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of GHG emissions associated with pre- and post- implementation of a novel telehealth preoperative evaluation process was performed on 298 American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I-III patients undergoing elective spine surgery at Yale New Haven Hospital. Electronic health records were evaluated to determine patient health status and necessary or unnecessary preoperative tests and clinic visits. Life cycle assessment and U.S. EPA GHG calculator were used to estimate carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from preoperative testing, clinic visits, and patient commuting. GHG emissions were reduced by 8.09 kg CO2e (9.6%) per patient, from 84.52 kg CO2e pre-intervention to 76.43 kg CO2e post-intervention (p = 0.019). The largest reduction, 14.71 kg CO2e, stemmed from fewer in-person clinic evaluations. An additional reduction of 18.07 kg CO2e per patient would have been possible if clinic performance were optimized (only necessary testing performed), resulting in a total reduction of 26.16 kg CO2e (31%).

However, most organic luminescence materials are restricted by Kasha's rule and only show a single-wavelength emission band in the lowest excited state. To develop anti-Kasha emissive materials, various design strategies, such as ESIPT, excimers, self-assembly, isomerization, and polymerization, were proposed case by case. In this review, recent progress of the anti-Kasha emitters has been summarized in depth according to their relative mechanisms: isomerization balancing, excited state balancing and emissive building block combination. In addition, their precise molecular design strategies, photophysical properties, and applications have also been reported. We hope that this brief introduction will inspire more researchers to focus on this promising field and promote the development of anti-Kasha emissive materials. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cryptography; Isomerization; Isomers; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Anti-counterfeiting; Building blockes; Design strategies; Emissive materials; Luminescence material; Photophysical characteristics; Photophysical properties; Single wavelength; Excited states",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113398170

Nitrate was difficult to be removed in conventional rapid-filtration rain garden, and sometimes even with net nitrogen release, resulting in the potential nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. This study aimed to compare the conventional rapid-filtration rain garden (CON) and modified rain garden with internal water storage (IWS) in terms of the nitrogen removal, N2O emission, and the bacterial community composition. Two lab-scale rain gardens (CON and IWS) were designed and studied in simulated rainfall experiments. The IWS design showed an advantage over CON in nitrogen removal, with the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 91.3%–91.4% compared to 18.0%–53.7% in CON. For N2O emission, IWS exhibited a lower emission potential of 0.2%–0.3% of TN removed (with emission rate of 0.41–0.74 mg N2O-N/m2/h) compared to 0.2%–0.7% of TN removed in CON (with emission rate of 0.24–0.29 mg N2O-N/m2/h). Phyla of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria dominating in both IWS and CON. A significant difference of microbial composition was found at the genus level, especially the potential denitrifiers including Candidatus Solibacter, Haliangium, Hyphomicrobium, Lentimicrobium and Terrimonas. The different abundance of these functional denitrifiers in IWS and CON may contribute to their different nitrogen removal efficiency and N2O emission potential.

Based on the 2015 industrial CO2 emissions of 282 cities in China combined with economic and social data and a geographically weighted regression model, we analysed the characteristics of the spatial distribution of industrial CO2 emissions and the spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors. The results show that China's urban industrial CO2 emissions present a significant spatial agglomeration state that includes Shandong, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and the core of the coastal areas forms a high–high concentration; a low–low aggregation is formed in less developed areas such as Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and Guangxi. The industrial scale, share of industry in gross domestic product, share of service industry in gross domestic product and level of economic development are factors that promote industrial CO2 emissions. The technological innovation, population density and government intervention are important factors that inhibit industrial CO2 emissions. Among them, the share of service industry in gross domestic product is the most significant factor in the increase of industrial CO2 emissions and the government intervention is the most significant factor in the reduction in industrial CO2 emissions. The effects of FDI, fixed asset investment and financial development are not significant. More importantly, the effects of influencing factors vary across cities, showing obvious spatial heterogeneity.

In this study, we synthesize the local climate, mainly temperature and precipitation, and large-scale atmospheric anomalies, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-connected dynamics, on a vegetative surface in a subtropical mountainous island, the northwest Pacific of Taiwan. We used two decadal photosynthetically active vegetation cover (PV) data (2001–2020) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data to portray vegetation dynamics at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Results show that PV is positively related to both temperature and precipitation at a monthly timescale across various land cover types, and the log-linear with one-month lagged of precipitation reveals the accumulation of seasonal rainfall having a significant effect on vegetation growth. Using TIMESAT, three annual phenological metrics, SOS (start of growing season), EOS (end of growing season), and LOS (length of growing season), have been derived from PV time series and been related to seasonal rainfall. The delayed SOS was manifestly influenced by a spring drought, <40 mm during February–March. The later SOS led to a ramification on following late EOS, shorter LOS, and reduction of annual NPP. Nevertheless, the summer rainfall (August–October) and EOS had no significant effects on vegetation growth owing to abundant rainfall. Therefore, the SOS associated with spring rainfall, instead of EOS, played an advantageous role in regulating vegetation development in this subtropical island. The PCA (principal component analysis) was applied for PV time series and explored the spatiotemporal patterns connected to local climate and climatic fluctuations for entire Taiwan, North Taiwan, and South Taiwan. The first two components, PC1 and PC2, explained most of data variance (94–95%) linked to temporal dynamics of land cover (r > 0.90) which was also regulated by local climate. While the subtle signals of PC3 and PC4 explained 0.1–0.4% of the data variance, related to regional drought (r = 0.35–0.40) especially in central and southwest Taiwan and ENSO-associated rainfall variation (r = −0.40–−0.37). Through synthesizing the relationships between vegetation dynamics and climate based on multiple timescales, there will be a comprehensive picture of vegetation growth and its cascading effects on ecosystem productivity. © 2021 by the authors.

With the deepening of internationalization, the import and export trade can have a significant influence on CE. In this study, the panel data of 282 cities in China from 2003 to 2016 were employed, and linear regression analysis with fixed effects, feasible generalized least squares and Driscoll–Kraay estimators were performed to assess the separate impacts of import and export trade on CE. The results show that there is a positive correlation between imports and CE, while the relationship is contrary for exports. The panel threshold regression method was further used for regression, and it found that there was one threshold value for gross domestic product (GDP) and two threshold values for gross industrial output (GIO) in the model. According to the division of threshold value, the impact of import trade on CE will turn from positive to negative, while the impact of export trade on reducing CE will be further enhanced. The structure of China’s import and export trade are used to illustrate the underlying mechanism of the different effects. For controlling CE in international trade, China should import more high-tech products to upgrade high-emission industries, and reduce the proportion of labor-intensive products exported. © 2021 by the authors.

However, unraveling the factors that really govern the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is still very challenging since the surface state of electrocatalysts is dynamic and difficult to predict under working conditions. Moreover, theoretical predictions from the viewpoint of thermodynamics alone often fail to specify the actual configuration of a catalyst for the dynamic CO2RR process. Herein, we re-survey recent studies with the emphasis on revealing the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites under CO2RR conditions extracted by in situ/operando characterizations, and further validate a critical link between the chemical state of Cu and the product profile of CO2RR.

In this paper, the impacts of the continuous variable valve lift (CVVL) system and Miller cycle strategy on the performance behavior of the natural gas spark ignition (SI) engine were comprehensively investigated. The results indicated that pumping loss was decreased, and volumetric efficiency slightly increased with using CVVL. In addition, the intake air mass flow at the intake ports became more smooth, and turbulence flow and its intensity were strengthened with using CVVL, which were beneficial to accelerate combustion rate and improve combustion efficiency. Under the partial load of the 1200 rpm 5 bar, the ratio of the pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) in indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was reduced by 2.74%. Furthermore, an extra 5.43% improvement of indicated thermal efficiency was obtained. On the other hand, peak in-cylinder pressure and peak combustion temperature of the natural gas SI engine operated on Miller cycle were decreased with late intake valve close (LIVC), particularly the pressure and temperature at the end of the compression stroke, which resulted in reducing NOx emissions formation and mitigating knocking combustion. However, the intake mass flow at the intake ports became fluctuation and the volumetric efficiency was decreased with using LIVC. In addition, brake specific fuel consumption was increased and indicated thermal efficiency decreased with employing LIVC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous variable valve lift; Lean-burn; Miller cycle; Natural gas engine; NOx emissions","Air intakes; Combustion; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Intake valves; Mass transfer; Natural gas; Continuous variable valve lift; Continuous variables; Lean burn; Lift system; Miller cycle; Natural-gas-engine; NOx emissions; Spark-ignition engine; System cycle; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103774754

Oceanic carbon sequestration mitigates global warming; on the other hand, oceanic CO2 uptake would reduce seawater pH, which is termed ocean acidification. We perform Earth system model simulations to assess oceanic CO2 uptake, surface temperature, and acidification for Zhejiang offshore, one of the most vulnerable areas to marine disasters. In the last 40 years, atmospheric CO2 concentration increased by 71 ppm, and sea surface temperature (SST) in Zhejiang offshore increased at a rate of 0.16°C/10a. Cumulative oceanic CO2 uptake in Zhejiang offshore is 0.3 Pg C, resulting in an increase of 20% in sea surface hydrogen ion concentration, and the acidification rate becomes faster in the last decade. During 2020–2040, under four RCP scenarios, SST in Zhejiang offshore increases by 0.3–0.5°C, whereas cumulative ocean carbon sequestration is 0.150–0.165 Pg C. Relative to RCP2.6, the decrease of surface pH in Zhejiang offshore is doubled under RCP8.5. Furthermore, simulated results show that the relationship between CO2 scenario and oceanic carbon cycle is nonlinear, which hints that deeper reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emission may be needed if we aim to mitigate ocean acidification in Zhejiang offshore under a higher CO2 concentration scenario. Our study quantifies the variation characteristics of oceanic climate and carbon cycle fields in Zhejiang offshore, and provides new insight into the responses of oceanic carbon cycle and the climate system to oceanic carbon sequestration. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Zhang, Fan, Li, Yu and Liu.","climate change; ocean acidification; oceanic carbon sequestration; UVic model; Zhejiang province",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114828256

This work assessed the impact of soil biochar aging on its physicochemical properties, microbiota community in the biochar, and soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Various characterizations (e.g., SEM-EDS, XRD, and FTIR) of fresh and aged biochar indicated that soil minerals accumulated on the biochar during the field aging process, forming organo-mineral complexes and blocking the cracks and channels on the biochar. The measured hardness and compressive strength of aged biochar were significantly higher than those of fresh biochar, consistent with the presence of soil minerals on the aged biochar. The soil CO2 and N2O emissions were significantly decreased after the addition of aged biochar particles, as compared to fresh biochar particles. This was probably because that the improved mechanical properties could inhibit the fragmentation of biochar particles, reducing the release of labile fractions from the biochar and the subsequent CO2 and N2O emissions. Moreover, the presence of CO2-fixing bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi) and inhibited nitrification and ammonia oxidation in aged biochar particles might also reduce CO2 and N2O emissions. These findings suggest aged biochar particles with improved physical stability to the soil could enhance soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission reduction. © 2021","Biochar; Field aging; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mechanical strength; Soil minerals","Ammonia; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Compressive strength; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Minerals; Physicochemical properties; Bio chars; Field aging; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Mechanical strength; N$-2$/O; Property; Soil CO; Soil minerals; Soils; ammonia; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; mineral; nitrous oxide; unclassified drug; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; aging; biochar; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; mechanical property; microbial community; mineral; nitrous oxide; physicochemical property; soil emission; aging; analytic method; Article; Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; Chloroflexi; comparative study; compressive strength; elemental analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; fragmentation reaction; hardness; mechanics; microbial community; microflora; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation; physical chemistry; priority journal; rigidity; scanning electron microscopy; soil analysis; soil property; surface area; surface property; X ray diffraction; soil; Chloroflexi; Microbiota; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Fertilizers; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104156621

Understanding the nexus amongst water, power and CO2 emissions is essential for sustainable water and energy resource management. Although a number of related studies on the nexus have been conducted, integrating virtual water and CO2 emission footprints for the power sector requires further attention. The current study analyses the virtual water and CO2 emissions embodied in the power supply, demand and regional trade. A network model is developed to track the virtual water and CO2 emissions of the inter-regional power trade for the case of EU-27 countries in 2017. The total virtual CO2 emissions and the embodied virtual water in the EU inter-regional power trade are estimated as 7.0 × 104 t CO2 and 5.6 × 108 m3, with a hydropower contribution of 37.8%. The largest virtual water and CO2 emissions exporters are identified by France (8.8 × 107 m3) and Germany (2 × 104 t), whilst the largest virtual CO2 importer is Austria (1 × 104 t).

Emission control strategies are typically formulated sector by sector, spatial variability in emissions reductions and health impacts of air pollutants may not be taken into account, affecting the overall effectiveness of control strategies. This study proposes an adjoint-based optimization framework to facilitate health-oriented O3 control over PRD. The location-specific adjoint sensitivity coefficients, which reflect the spatiotemporal influences from emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NOx) on O3 health impacts, are combined with metaheuristic algorithms to minimize the O3-related premature mortalities over receptor regions. Using the proposed optimization methodology, the regional O3 health benefits under current emission reduction policy can be increased by 16–27%. The results show that relatively larger NOx emissions reductions occurred at highly developed and populated areas. Particularly, significant reductions in NOx emissions are observed at Shenzhen and urban Guangzhou. Furthermore, implementing regional NOx emissions abatement has advantages to achieve an overall O3 health benefits for all cities. The interregional influences of NOx emissions abatement between cities indicate a promising strategy of health-oriented O3 control in PRD. © 2021","Adjoint sensitivity; Emission optimization; Metaheuristic algorithms; Ozone control strategy; Ozone health benefits","Air quality; Emission control; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Adjoint sensitivities; Adjoint-based optimization; Control strategies; Emission optimization; Emission reduction; Metaheuristic algorithms; NO$-x$/ emission; Ozone control strategy; Ozone health benefit; Pearl River Delta region; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107295625

This study investigated the key drivers of the decline in UK's production- and consumption-based coal consumptions from a global perspective, by combining the multi-regional input-output analysis and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index methods. From a global view, both consumption- and production-based coal consumptions of UK declined during 1995–2009, except consumption-based coal consumption increased from 1995 to 2007. As a net importer, UK's coal consumption flows have been mainly embodied in exports for developed countries and embodied in imports from developing countries. On a national level, the offset effects of UK's coal consumption were from the energy transformations that reduced the proportions of coal consumption and general developments in the energy efficiency. It is found that its decline of coal consumption was only the superficial success, as the decrease actually was partly due to the transfers to other countries. But there are also lessons to be learned from that, because UK had also ultimately achieved the goal of using less energy consumption to generate higher gross domestic production, by technological improvements to promote an improvement in energy intensity. Therefore, coal consumption declined in the UK was the result of the combined effects of energy transition and outsourcing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied coal consumption; Logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI); Multi-regional input-output analysis (MRIO); UK","Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Coal consumption; Divisia index; Embodied coal consumption; Index analysis; Input-output; Logarithmic mean; Logarithmic mean divisia index; Multi-regional input-output analyse; Production and consumption; United kingdom; Coal; coal; energy efficiency; export; fuel consumption; import; industrial production; input-output analysis; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105336821

This research aims to empirically investigate the impact, impact mechanism, and heterogeneity characteristics of the NEVPP on urban green innovation and emission reduction based on panel data from 281 cities in China from 2004 to 2017, using difference-in-differences (DID) methods and fixed effect (FE) models. The results show that the NEVPP significantly reduces the carbon dioxide emissions of the pilot cities but significantly inhibits the green innovation, and the results are robust to the placebo test, propensity score matching DID (PSM-DID) test, instrumental variable (IV) estimation, emissions trading system (ETS), and Carbon-ETS interference test, and change of the dependent variable. In addition, further studies have shown that the NEVPP’s emission reduction effects are mainly achieved by reducing energy consumption, promoting technological innovation, and adjusting industrial structure. Moreover, we found that the NEVPP performed better in the regions where the level of economic development is high, the local government has a good relationship with the market, and the level of non-state economic development is high.

However, the environmental benefits of electric heating are restrained by regional resources endowment and regional electrical energy structure. In the context of the active promotion of electric heating in Beijing—Tianjin–Hebei, the paper studied the development potential and limits of wind power electric heating under the constraints of environmental effects to provide reference for the orderly development of electric heating. A model to predict the capacity of the installed wind power improved by the fruit fly optimized ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm and an electric heating environment effect calculation model are constructed. The optimal value and critical value of the newly added heating area in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei are obtained through calculation under four scenarios of wind abandonment rate. As the wind abandonment rate increases from 4–10% (with interval of 2%), the optimal value of the newly added electric heating area in Beijing—Tianjin–Hebei will be 19.15, 29.47, 36.26, and 47.90 million m2 by the year 2030. Additionally, as the utilization rate of thermal power exceeds 41.16%, electric heating will produce more carbon emissions compared to coal-fired heating. Therefore, if we want to develop electric heating on a large scale, we need to control the proportion of thermal power in the power supply structure and increase the proportion of new energy.

Seven combined models of single circular hole and double cracks with different angles are established, and the fracture angle varies from 0◦ to 90◦ with an interval of 15◦ . First, uniaxial compression experiments and numerical simulations are carried out in the 0◦ defect combination model, and the microscopic parameters of PFC 2D are determined. Then, the numerical simulations of seven defect models under uniaxial compression are carried out, and the crack development law and acoustic emission characteristics of different defect combination models are studied. The failure modes, mechanical behavior, and stress states are studied. The displacement vector distributions of different defect combination models are analyzed; it is found that there are three main types of macro cracks in the defect combination samples. The results show that the combined defects reduce the strength of the model. Meanwhile, the distributions of the stress and displacement are changed by the cracks with different angles in the defective models. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper aims to evaluate the policy effects of collaborative governance for APP in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, analyze the collaborative mechanism from the perspective of institutional collective action (ICA) theory, and discuss its implications for improving the policy effects and regional collaboration. First, the causal relationship between collaborative environmental governance and air pollutant reduction is confirmed using the regression discontinuity design (RDD). However, it is also established that regional APP policies initiated by the Regional Cooperation Office of Yangtze River Delta (RCOYRD) did not have a long-term effect on reducing air pollutants. Second, initiative heterogeneity and administrative hierarchy heterogeneity of policy effects between cities are analyzed. It demonstrates that the mechanism formulated by RCOYRD has very limited impact on the reduction of transaction costs and collaborative risks of collaborative environmental governance. Third, clear division of responsibilities, balanced cost-benefit sharing, and coordinated enforcement between local governments are needed to improve the policy effects of collaborative governance for APP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative governance; Institutional collective action (ICA); Regression discontinuity design (RDD); Urban air pollution prevention","air pollutant; article; China; city; cost benefit analysis; government; responsibility; river; theoretical study; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; particulate matter; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105552137

To better understand the contributing factors to a flattening of the OMI NO2 trends, we investigate the role of soil and lightning NOx emissions on this apparent disagreement. We improve soil NO x emissions estimates using a new observation-based temperature response, which increases the linear correlation coefficient between GEOS-Chem simulated and OMI NO2 VCDs by 0.05-0.2 over the Central US. Multivariate trend analysis reveals that soil and lightning NO x combined emissions trends change from -3.95% a-1 during 2005-2009 to 0.60% a-1 from 2009 to 2019, thereby rendering the abrupt slowdown of total NO x emissions reduction. Non-linear inter-annual variations explain 6.6% of the variance of total NO x emissions. As background emissions become relatively larger with uncertain inter-annual variations, the NO2 VCDs alone at the national scale, especially in the regions with vast rural areas, will be insufficient to discern the trend of anthropogenic emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Local farmers are willing to adopted rotary tillage (RT; harrowing to 10–15 cm depth) for easy management. However, the effects of these tillage management methods on agronomic productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and economic return have not been quantified systematically, and their effectiveness remains in question. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the effects of these methods using 665 paired measurements from 144 peer-reviewed studies. The results indicated that DT significantly increased crop yields by 7.5% relative to RT, and even greater increases were observed in regions with low temperatures and with a wheat cropping system. In contrast, NT resulted in a yield reduction of 3.7% relative to RT, however, controlling for the appropriate temperature and long extension duration (&gt;15 yr) could reduce yield losses and even increase the yield. Both DT and NT significantly enhanced SOC sequestration relative to RT. Adoption of DT would lead to both higher total GHG emissions (N2O and CH4 ) and increased energy costs, while NT reduced GHG emissions. DT management exhibited a positive net profit for all cropping systems; NT decreased the net profit for rice and wheat but increased the profit for maize. Our study highlighted the agronomic, environmental, and economic benefits and trade-offs for the different tillage methods and should enable investors and policymakers to ensure the best tillage management decisions are made depending on the location-specific conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Soil C, N, and P cycles are linked by drivers operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales: landscape-level variation in macroclimate and soil geochemistry, stand-scale heterogeneity in forest composition, and microbial community dynamics at the soil pore scale. Yet in many biomes, we do not know at which scales most of the biogeochemical variation emerges, nor which processes drive cross-scale feedbacks. Here, we examined the drivers and spatial/temporal scales of variation in soil biogeochemistry across four tropical dry forests spanning steep environmental gradients. To do so, we quantified soil C, N, and P pools, extracellular enzyme activities, and microbial community structure across wet and dry seasons in 16 plots located in Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Soil biogeochemistry exhibited marked heterogeneity across the 16 plots, with total organic C, N, and P pools varying fourfold, and inorganic nutrient pools by an order of magnitude. Most soil characteristics changed more across space (i.e., among sites and plots) than over time (between dry and wet season samplings). We observed stoichiometric decoupling among C, N, and P cycles, which may reflect their divergent biogeochemical drivers. Organic C and N pool sizes were positively correlated with the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal trees and legumes. By contrast, the distribution of soil P pools was driven by soil geochemistry, with larger inorganic P pools in soils with P-rich parent material. Most earth system models assume that soils within a texture class operate similarly, and ignore subgrid cell variation in soil properties. Here we reveal that soil nutrient pools and fluxes exhibit as much variation among four Neotropical dry forests as is observed across terrestrial ecosystems at the global scale. Soil biogeochemical patterns are driven not only by regional differences in soil parent material and climate, but also by local-scale variation in plant and microbial communities. Thus, the biogeochemical patterns we observed across the Neotropical dry forest biome challenge representation of soil processes in ecosystem models. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; seasonality; spatial scale; stoichiometry; tropical dry forest","biogeochemistry; community dynamics; dry forest; ecosystem response; forest soil; microbial community; nutrient availability; terrestrial ecosystem; tropical forest; Colombia; Costa Rica; Mexico [North America]; Puerto Rico; Fabaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107379268

We argue that this raises serious, if underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly addressed in adaptation policy making.

Here we show that the decarbonization of both the electricity and transport sectors will curtail fossil fuel production while paradoxically increasing resource extraction associated with metal production by more than a factor of 7 by 2050 relative to 2015 levels. Importantly, approximately 32–40% of this increase in resource extraction is expected to occur in countries with weak, poor, and failing resource governance, indicating that the impending mining boom may result in severe environmental degradation and unequal economic benefits in local communities. A suite of circular economy strategies, including lifetime extension, servitization, and recycling, can mitigate such risks, but they may not fully offset the growth in resource extraction. Our findings underscore the importance of institutional instruments that enhance the resource governance of entire low-carbon technology supply chains, along with circular economy practices. In the absence of such actions, the decarbonization of electricity and transport sectors may pose an ethical conundrum in which global carbon emissions are reduced at the expense of an increase in socio-environmental risks at local mining sites. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon neutral; Climate change; Mining; Net zero; Responsible sourcing","Climate change; Decarbonization; Developing countries; Extraction; Fossil fuels; Mining; Supply chains; Carbon neutrals; Circular economy; Decarbonisation; Electricity sector; Energy transitions; Net zero; Resource extraction; Responsible sourcing; Sustainable energy; Transport sectors; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107388993

Climate warming may result in the release of CO2 from both the thawing of permafrost and accelerated autotrophic respiration, but it may also increase the fixation of CO2 by plants, which could relieve or even offset the CO2 losses. The Tibetan Plateau contains the largest area of alpine permafrost on Earth. However, the current status of the net CO2 balance and feedbacks to warming remain unclear, given that the region has recently experienced an atmospheric warming rate of over 0.3 °C decade−1. We examined 32 eddy covariance sites and found an unexpected net CO2 sink during 2002 to 2020 (26 of the sites yielded a net CO2 sink) that was four times the amount previously estimated. The CO2 sink peaked at an altitude of roughly 4,000 m, with the sink at lower and higher altitudes limited by a low carbon use efficiency and a cold, dry climate, respectively. The fixation of CO2 in summer is more dependent on temperature than the loss of CO2 than it is in the winter months, especially at higher altitudes. Consistently, 16 manipulative experiments and 18 model simulations showed that the fixation of CO2 by plants will outpace the loss of CO2 under a wetting–warming climate until the 2090s (178 to 318 Tg C y−1). We therefore suggest that there is a plant-dominated negative feedback to climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Residential greenness is benefits health by promoting physical activity, reducing air pollution, and improving mental health, but it remains unclear whether it is related to androgen and progesterone levels among humans. Aims: This study aimed to explore the individual and interactive effects of PM and residential greenness on serum testosterone and progesterone levels among rural Chinese adults. Methods: A total of 6017 subjects were recruited from the baseline of the Henan Rural Cohort Study in 2016. Serum testosterone and progesterone were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Particulate matters (PM) (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) were assessed by machine learning algorithms. Residential greenness was assessed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within 500-m, 1000-m, and 3000-m buffers around participants’ residences. The effects of air pollutants and residential greenness and their interaction on serum testosterone and progesterone levels were assessed using linear mixed-effects models with township as a random intercept. Results: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, a 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with a 0.037 or 0.030 ng/ml increase in serum testosterone, respectively, in females and with a 0.111 or 0.182 ng/ml decrease in serum progesterone, respectively, in males. A 1 μg/m3 increase in PM1, PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with a 0.222, 0.306, or 0.295 ng/ml decrease in serum progesterone, respectively, among females. Moreover, a 0.1-unit increase in NDVI was associated with a 0.310 ng/ml increase in serum testosterone and a 0.170 ng/ml increased in serum progesterone in males, as well as with a 0.143 ng/ml increase in serum progesterone in females. Interaction effects of PM and residential greenness on serum testosterone and progesterone levels were observed, indicating that the effects of residential greenness on serum testosterone and progesterone were modified by high levels of PM. In addition, physical activity significantly mediated 2.92% of the estimated association between greenness and testosterone levels. Conclusions: Our study suggested that long-term exposure to PM was positively associated with serum testosterone in males but negatively associated with progesterone levels in both genderssin. In addition, positive associations of residential greenness with serum testosterone and progesterone levels were observed, but they were modified by high levels of PM. Furthermore, the estimated effects of residential greenness on testosterone levels were partly mediated by physical activity. © 2021 The Authors","Androgen; Particulate matter; Progesterone; Residential greenness","Air pollution; Body fluids; Learning algorithms; Liquid chromatography; Machine learning; Mass spectrometry; Particles (particulate matter); Rural areas; $+10$/Be; Androgen; Long term exposure; Normalized difference vegetation index; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter 10; Physical activity; Progesteron; Residential greenness; Serum testosterone; Housing; androgen; buffer; progesterone; testosterone; androgen; progesterone; adult; particulate matter; physical activity; rural area; serum; testosterone; adult; aged; air pollutant; algorithm; androgen blood level; Article; Chinese; cohort analysis; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; machine learning; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; particulate matter 1; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; physical activity; progesterone blood level; randomization; residential home; rural population; sex hormone determination; testosterone blood level; air pollutant; air pollution; China; particulate matter; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Androgens; China; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter; Progesterone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105276042

Current measurement techniques cannot produce precise CO2 emission data, and this uncertainty makes previous approaches problematic for analyzing energy and environmental efficiency. This study combines stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA-2) with data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency of Chinese transportation sectors in the presence of uncertain CO2 emission data. The improved SMAA-DEA approach effectively handles CO2 data uncertainty and also considers all possible input and output weights, thus providing meaningful information (such as maximum efficiency, average efficiency, and rank acceptability index) to guide the development of effective policies to improve efficiency.

A quantitative analysis of the carbon implications of expanding the transmission infrastructure would shed light on the trade-offs among three connected dimensions of sustainable development, namely, climate change mitigation, energy access and infrastructure development. By collecting a high-resolution inventory, we developed an assessment framework of, and analysed, the GHG emissions caused by China’s power transmission infrastructure construction during 1990–2017. We show that cumulative embodied GHG emissions have dramatically increased by more than 7.3 times those in 1990, reaching 0.89 GtCO2-equivalent in 2017. Over the same period, the gaps between the well-developed eastern and less-developed western regions in China have gradually narrowed. Voltage class, transmission-line length and terrain were important factors that influenced embodied GHG emissions. We discuss measures for the mitigation of GHG emissions from power transmission development that can inform global low-carbon infrastructure transitions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Light transmission; Power transmission; Transmissions; Climate change mitigation; Energy access; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High resolution inventories; Infrastructure construction; Infrastructure development; Western region; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103678933

Hyperthermophilic composting (HTC) can influence CH4-related microbial communities at temperatures up to 80 °C, and thus impact the CH4 emissions during composting. This work investigated CH4 emissions in sludge-derived HTC, and explored microbial community succession with quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Results demonstrated that HTC decreased CH4 emissions by 52.5% compared with TC. In HTC, the CH4 production potential and CH4 oxidation potential were nearly 40% and 64.1% lower than that of TC, respectively. There was a reduction in the quantity of mcrA (3.7 × 108 to 0 g−1 TS) in HTC, which was more significant than the reduction in pmoA (2.0 × 105 to 2.1 × 104 g−1 TS), and thus lead to reduce CH4 emissions. It was found that the abundance of most methanogens and methanotrophs was inhibited in the hyperthermal environment, with a decline in Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanobrevibacter potentially being responsible for reducing the CH4 emissions in HTC.

Plant macrofossil collections were investigated to assess the paleoclimate and paleoecology of the forest. An ensemble approach to climate analysis using leaf physiognomic and nearest living relative methods indicates that the forest grew under warm and wet temperate conditions, with mild frost-free winters, and did not experience a significant drying season—although some precipitation seasonality is indicated. Reconstructed leaf mass per area suggests that the woody broadleaf dicot flora had an entirely deciduous habit, despite temperature and precipitation conditions that were suitable for evergreen taxa. The reconstructed climate of the Ravenscrag Butte flora is similar to modern coastal climates with proximity to an inland sea (e.g., Croatia and Slovenia on the Adriatic Sea and Georgia on the Black Sea), suggesting that the Ravenscrag Butte flora was influenced by its proximity to the western margin of the early Paleocene Cannonball Seaway. The leaf physiognomy of the Ravenscrag Butte flora is most similar to contemporaneous fossil macrofloras from throughout western and northern North America, which suggests physiognomic homogeneity over broad latitudes during the early Paleocene, a potential consequence of vegetation reorganization after the K-Pg event. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Canada; Paleobotany; Paleocene; Paleoclimate; Paleoecology; Ravenscrag; Saskatchewan","Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; Danian; deciduous forest; homogeneity; inland sea; paleoclimate; paleoecology; seasonality; Adriatic Sea; Black Sea; Canada; Croatia; Georgia; Mediterranean Sea; North America; Saskatchewan; Slovenia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107391412

One particularly controversial case that has received significant public and scientific attention involves possible contamination of groundwater in the Trinity Aquifer in Parker County, Texas. Despite extensive work, the origin of natural gas in the Trinity Aquifer within this study area is an ongoing debate. Here, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset collected across three sampling campaigns along with integration of previously published data. Data include major and trace ions, molecular gas compositions, compound-specific stable isotopes of hydrocarbons (δ13C-CH4, δ13C-C2H6, δ2H-CH4), dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13C-DIC), nitrogen (δ15N-N2), water (δ18O, δ2H, 3H), and noble gases (He, Ne, Ar), boron (δ11B) and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopic compositions of water samples from 20 drinking-water wells from the Trinity Aquifer. The compendium of data confirms mixing between a deep, naturally occurring salt- (Cl &gt;250 mg/L) and hydrocarbon-rich groundwater with a low-salinity, shallower, and younger groundwater. Hydrocarbon gases display strong evidence for sulfate reduction-paired oxidation, in some cases followed by secondary methanogenesis. A subset of drinking-water wells contains elevated levels of hydrocarbons and depleted atmospherically-derived gas tracers, which is consistent with the introduction of fugitive thermogenic gas. We suggest that gas originating from the intermediate-depth Strawn Group (“Strawn”) is flowing along the annulus of a Barnett Shale gas well, and is subsequently entering the shallow aquifer system. This interpretation is supported by the expansion in the number of affected drinking-water wells during our study period and the persistence of hydrocarbon levels over time. Our data suggest post-genetic secondary water quality changes occur following fugitive gas contamination, including sulfate reduction paired with hydrocarbon oxidation and secondary methanogenesis. Importantly, no evidence for upward migration of brine or natural gas associated with the Barnett Shale was identified. © 2021","Groundwater; Hydraulic fracturing; Methane; Methane oxidation; Stray-gas contamination; Sulfate reduction","Aquifers; Contamination; Fracture; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Horizontal wells; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrochemistry; Isotopes; Methane; Potable water; Shale gas; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; Water wells; $+13$/C; CH$-4$; Drinking water wells; Fugitive gas; Gas contamination; Methane oxidation; Methanogenesis; Quality change; Stray-gas contamination; Sulfate reduction; Oxidation; argon; boron; drinking water; ground water; helium; hydrocarbon; methane; nitrogen; sodium chloride; strontium; water; ground water; methane; natural gas; well water; aquifer; drinking water; groundwater; hydraulic fracturing; isotopic composition; methane; oxidation; water quality; Article; chemical composition; fugitive gas; gas; geochemical analysis; methanogenesis; molecular stability; oxidation; plume; pollution transport; Texas; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; environmental monitoring; oil and gas field; water pollutant; water quality; Parker County; Texas; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Methane; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Texas; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103082412

At the same time, communities in those landscapes face declining crop yields and ecosystem degradation as a result of both climate and non-climate factors. We assessed local perceptions on climate stressors, adaptation and vulnerability using focus group discussions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. We found that the main perceived climatic stressors were extreme and unpredictable seasons, fires, and saltwater intrusion, affecting ecosystem services and agricultural production. Land clearing and forest loss were mentioned as exacerbating non-climatic stressors. Respondents indicated willingness to adapt to these changes by investing in long-term measures, such as tree-planting. To adapt to yield declines, respondents indicated that many farmers shifted from rubber to oil palm. Such adaptation actions benefit households in the short term but may be at odds with long-term adaptation objectives at the landscape level. Finally, we found that perceptions about vulnerability differed between landscapes, and between communities at the landscape level and stakeholders at the district level. This stresses the importance of participatory and inclusive planning and multi-stakeholder processes towards context-based climate action planning to accommodate the differences in contexts and scale, and to reconcile the differences in perceptions. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, the effect of ferrate(VI) (or Fe(VI)) oxidation on the degradation of BPA (50 μg L-1) in a typical ROC matrix was investigated. The influence of process variables including the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratios (7-50), initial pH (5.0-8.0) and reaction temperature (15-25 °C) was studied. Fe(VI) was found to be highly effective in degrading BPA in the complex ROC matrix with various operating conditions. At 25 °C, over 90% degradation of BPA was achieved at the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and an initial pH of the ROC at 8.0 after 90 min of reaction. Under such conditions, the reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was found to be 34% accompanied by a 95% reduction in UV254 absorbance (initial value 0.750 cm-1) with 96.4% SUVA reduction. Additionally, the residual concentration of Fe(III) at pH 8.0 was the lowest compared to other pH conditions at a fixed [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50. Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analyses revealed that Fe(VI) preferentially react with fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like compounds, and aromatic protein II in the ROC. This indicated Fe(VI) effectively breaking down electron-rich moieties groups including phenols and other organics in ROC. The apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) for BPA degradation was determined to be 2.27 × 102 M-1 s-1 at pH 8.0 at a [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and the value of reaction rate constant increased proportionally with increasing molar ratio at the range studied. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) in the degradation of BPA in the ROC demonstrates the potential of using Fe(VI) as an efficient oxidant to remediate the micropollutants present in water and wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Bisphenol A; Ferrate(VI); Kinetic study; Oxidation; Reverse osmosis concentrate; Wastewater remediation","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Health risks; Iron compounds; Molar ratio; Organic acids; Organic carbon; Oxidation; Rate constants; Reverse osmosis; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; % reductions; Bisphenol A; Bisphenols-A; Ferrate; Ferrate(variable including the [fe); Kinetic study; matrix; Municipal wastewaters; Reverse osmosis concentrates; Wastewater remediation; Phenols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105596645

To capture Argentina's sub-national EWL dynamics in the context of global change, we couple the Global Change Analysis Model with a suite of consistent, gridded sectoral downscaling models to explore multiple stakeholder-engaged scenarios. Across scenarios, Argentina has the economic opportunity to use its vast land resources to satisfy growing domestic and international demand for crops, such as oil (e.g., soy) and biomass. The human (rather than earth) system produces the most dominant changes in mid-century EWL resource use. A Reference scenario characterized by modest socioeconomic growth projects a 40% increase in Argentina's agricultural production by 2050 (relative to 2020) by using 50,000 km2 of additional cropland and 40% more water. A Climate Policy scenario designed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions globally shortly after mid-century projects that Argentina could use 100,000 km2 of additional land (and 65% more water) to grow biomass and other crops. The burden of navigating these national opportunities and challenges could fall disproportionately on a subset of Argentina's river basins. The Colorado and Negro basins could experience moderate-to-severe water scarcity as they simultaneously navigate substantial irrigated crop demand growth and climate-induced declines in natural water availability. Argentina serves as a generalizable testbed to demonstrate that multi-scale EWL planning challenges can be identified and managed more effectively via integrated analysis of coupled human-earth systems. © 2021.

Disentangling how these factors act in isolation is challenging, especially along large climatic gradients that can mask soil effects. As anthropogenic pressure increasingly alters local climate and soil resource supply unevenly across landscapes, our ability to predict concurrent changes in plant community processes requires clearer understandings of independent and interactive effects of climate and soil. To address this, we developed a multispecies phytometer (i.e., standardized plant community) for separating key drivers underlying plant productivity across gradients. Phytometers were composed of three globally cosmopolitan herbaceous perennials, Dactylis glomerata, Plantago lanceolata, and Trifolium pratense. In 2017, we grew phytometer communities in 18 sites across a pan-European aridity gradient in local site soils and a standardized substrate and compared biomass production. Standard substrate phytometers succeeded in providing a standardized climate biomass response independent of local soil effects. This allowed us to factor out climate effects in local soil phytometers, establishing that nitrogen availability did not predict biomass production, while phosphorus availability exerted a strong, positive effect independent of climate. Additionally, we identified a negative relationship between biomass production and potassium and magnesium availability. Species-specific biomass responses to the environment in the climate-corrected biomass were asynchronous, demonstrating the importance of species interactions in vegetation responses to global change. Biomass production was co-limited by climatic and soil drivers, with each species experiencing its own unique set of co-limitations. Our study demonstrates the potential of phytometers for disentangling effects of climate and soil on plant biomass production and suggests an increasing role of P limitation in the temperate regions of Europe. © 2021 The Authors.","aridity; climate gradient; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus; phytometer; plant productivity; resource limitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113462936

To inform policy and technical decisions, detailed mathematical models are required which can explore numerous building retrofit solutions and their energy and emissions performance. This paper describes the adaptation of a hybrid statistical and engineering-based model for residential building stock in Canada to analyze community-scale energy retrofits. The modelling domain includes both envelope and mechanical retrofits, as well as district renewable energy systems. This model is then applied to a case study of converting a community of fifty 1980's vintage single-detached homes to achieve net-zero energy. The case study demonstrated that deep envelope retrofits and fuel switching from natural gas to electric heat pump systems reduce community energy demand by 69%. Saturating available roof area with photovoltaics was able to achieve net-zero balance. By considering net-zero at the community-scale, individual buildings that did not achieve net-zero were offset by net-exporting neighbours. Annual community emissions of the retrofit reduced emissions by 95%. The analysis also highlights the significant impact on electrical infrastructure due to solar generation and energy demand mismatch. © 2021","00–01; 99-00; Airtightness; Building retrofit; Building stock modelling; Distributed generation; District energy; Infiltration; Net-zero; Occupant comfort 2020 MSC","Buildings; Energy management; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Solar power generation; 00–01; 99-00; Airtightness; Building retrofits; Building stock modeling; Case-studies; District energy; Net-zero; Occupant comfort 2020 MSC; Zero energies; Distributed power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102121274

The complexity of Earth’s climate system makes it difficult to predict precisely how lower-order climate dynamics will interact over time to drive higher-order dynamics. The same issues arise for complex models built to simulate climate behavior like the Community Earth Systems Model (CESM). I argue that as a result of system complexity, climate modelers use general circulation models to perform model dynamic exploration (MDE) and climate dynamic exploration (CDE).

Sustainable stormwater management, using Green Infrastructure units (GI) integrated with an urban area, has proved to be effective in flooding control and to offer extra benefits encompassing groundwater recharge, stormwater treatment, mitigation of air pollution, and an urban micro-climate. Moreover, GI brings cultural benefits for the urban population. However, the “grey” solutions are still popular and widely accepted. This paper presents three conceptions of the revitalisation of a part of campus of the Gdansk University of Technology with different approaches to stormwater management. The first approach (“blue-grey”) is purely based on an architect’s vision, and has some negative aspects from the environmental point of view. The second approach (“blue-grey-green”) is a modification of the previous one, in an attempt to introduce green elements and to obtain more ecosystem services. The third conception (“blue-green”) is fundamentally different, as it relies on GI elements and attempts to respond to the needs reported by the local community of students and university employees accordingly to opinion polls that were conducted. The three solutions are discussed in terms of water sensibility, aesthetics, functionality, usability, and public perception. © 2021,International Journal of Conservation Science.All Rights Reserved","Ecosystem services; Green Infrastructure; Rain gardens; Retention; Sustainable stormwater management; Urban stream syndrome",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113849670

In order to analyze the IDP state of each country, this study proposes a hybrid evaluation approach to assess IDP of global climate governance by integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and cloud model. Firstly, the evaluation index system of IDP of global climate governance was constructed from three aspects namely, discourse subject, discourse production, and discourse dissemination. Secondly, the cloud model is introduced to express the uncertainty and to transform the qualitative evaluation information. Additionally, the AHP is incorporated into the cloud model to calculate the weights of index. Finally, six typical countries of global climate governance are selected to illustrate the application of the proposed evaluation approach. The results indicated that the priority of IDP is EU, the USA, China, Russia, India, and Haiti. Moreover, it is found that China’s IDP has the highest priority in developing countries. However, compared to developed countries, China’s IDP has a relatively low priority. The study suggests to enhance the political influence, expand the international impact of public media, and form a community of interests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Benchmarking comparison; Cloud model; Global climate governance; International discourse power","analytical hierarchy process; climate change; comparative study; global climate; governance approach; media industry; numerical model; China; Haiti; Hispaniola; India; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098621625

Ho Chi Minh City has experienced increased intensity and frequency of climate change-induced urban floods, causing socio-economic damage that disturbs their livelihoods while urban populations continue to grow. This study aims to establish a citywide flood risk map to inform risk management in the city and address climate justice locally. This study applied a flood risk assessment framework integrating a coupled nature-human approach and examined the spatial distribution of urban flood hazard and urban flood vulnerability. A flood hazard map was generated using selected morphological and hydro-meteorological indicators. A flood vulnerability map was generated based on a literature review and a social survey weighed by experts’ priorities using the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytic Network Process. Vulnerability indicators including demographic characteristics, infrastructure, and land use patterns were used to generate a flood vulnerability map. The results illustrate that almost the entire central and northeastern parts of the city are at high flood risk, whereas the western part is at low flood risk. The findings have implications in urban planning via identifying risk hot spots in order to prioritize resources for mitigating hazards and enhancing community resilience to urban floods. © 2021 by the authors.

Efforts have been made to improve the spatial representation of emission inventory, by incorporating comprehensive point source database (e.g. power plants, industrial facilities) in emission estimates. Satellite-based observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with unprecedented pixel sizes (3.5 × 7 km2) and signal-to-noise ratios offer the opportunity to evaluate the spatial accuracy of such highly resolved emissions from space. Here, we compare the city-level NO x emissions from a proxy-based emission inventory named the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) with a highly resolved emission inventory named the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China - High Resolution (MEIC-HR) that has nearly 100 000 industrial facilities, and evaluate them through NO x emissions derived from the TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs). We find that the discrepancies in city-level NO x emissions between MEIC and MEIC-HR are influenced by the proportions of emissions from point sources and NO x emissions per industrial gross domestic product (IGDP). The use of IGDP as a spatial proxy to disaggregate industrial emissions tends to overestimate NO x emissions in cities with lower industrial emission intensities or less industrial facilities in the MEIC. The NO x emissions of 70 cities are derived from one year TROPOMI NO2 TVCDs using the exponentially modified Gaussian function. Compared to the satellite-derived emissions, the cities with higher industrial point source emission proportions in MEIC-HR agree better with space-constrained results, indicating that integrating more point sources in the inventory would improve the spatial accuracy of emissions on city scale. In the future, we should devote more efforts to incorporating accurate locations of emitting facilities to reduce uncertainties in fine-scale emission estimates and guide future policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

China's carbon reduction experiences can potentially provide a model for a more sustainable path forward, but increased efforts are needed to understand the factors driving the amount and spatial distribution of carbon emissions and how these drivers are changing through time. This paper develops an understanding of how carbon emissions in three industrial land spaces (agriculture, production and living, and transportation spaces) in China varied across space and through time. A set of complementary models including gravity center and hotspot analysis, alongside an analysis of the relationship between land use and carbon emissions, were implemented to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions from 1997 to 2016. Results showed that increasing the extent of land dedicated to different land-uses increased carbon emissions in many areas, but this finding was not universal for all provinces and spaces. Various factors including income, population, energy intensity, energy structure, and economic structure helped explain the variation of emissions across the three types of industrial land spaces. The findings offer implications for China's land use and carbon reduction strategy. © 2021","Carbon emissions; China; Driving factors; Industrial land space; Land use; Spatiotemporal change","Carbon; Economics; Industrial emissions; Spatial distribution; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; China; Driving factors; Energy; Industrial land; Industrial land space; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatio-temporal variation; Variation factor; Land use; carbon emission; emission control; industrial emission; land use; spatial distribution; spatial variation; temporal distribution; temporal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105545154

Joinpoint regression analysis was applied in the analysis of temporal trends in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden over the 30 years. Results: Globally, PM2.5 pollution contributed to 292.5 thousand deaths and 13 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019. APMP ranked third among all risk factors, causing an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden from 1990, whereas the impact of HAP significantly fell during the same period. Both APMP and HAP contributed the most to deaths and DALYs of type 2 diabetes mellitus among older people. However, the age-standardized death and DALY rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus attributable to APMP were greater among males and people in the middle socio-demographic index countries, especially in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa. For HAP, type 2 diabetes mellitus burden was modestly higher in females and was highest in Oceania, which was the only region with an increase from 1990. Conclusions: PM2.5 pollution resulted in substantial and increasing type 2 diabetes mellitus burden worldwide. Hence, governments and health systems should take steps to reduce air pollution to mitigate this increasing burden. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Fu, Lei, Deng, Lou, Wang, Zheng, Deng, Yang, Wang, Zhai, Zhu, Xiang, Hu, Dai and Gao.","ambient particulate matter pollution; Global Burden of Disease; household air pollution; PM2.5 pollution; type 2 diabetes mellitus","air pollution; Article; economic development; fertility; geographic distribution; global disease burden; human; information retrieval; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; particulate matter; pollution; risk factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114236260

We propose a hybrid model that includes a spatial lag model (SLM) and a fixed regional panel model using data from the 17 provinces in the central and western regions of China from 2000 to 2018. The results show that the slowly increasing CP has significant spatial spillover effects, with High–High (H–H) and Low–Low (L–L) spatial distributions in the central and western regions of China. In addition, industrial development and urbanization in the study area play different roles in CP, while economic urbanization and industrial fixed investment negatively affect CP, and population urbanization affects CP along a U-shape curve. Importantly, the results show that the patterns of industrial development and urbanization that influence CP are homogenous and mutually imitated in the 17 studied provinces. Furthermore, disparities in CP between regions are due to industrial workforce allocation (TL), but TL has been inefficient; industrial structure upgrades are slowly improving conditions. Therefore, the findings suggest that, in the short term, policymakers in China should implement industrial development policies that reduce carbon emissions in the western and central regions by focusing on improving industrial workforce allocation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, little is known about if and how the structure and function of BF are abnormal in Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: Here, we employed the structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 19 WD individuals and 24 healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis were applied to investigate the structural and functional degeneration changes of BF in WD. Moreover, the linear regression analyses were performed in the patient group to depict the correlations between the aberrant gray volume and functional connectivity of the BF and clinical performances, such as the prospective memory (PM) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Results: VBM analysis showed that compared with HC, the volume of overlapping cell groups of BF termed CH1–3 and CH4 was significantly reduced in WD. Additionally, the decreased functional connectivity of the CH4 was distributed in the bilateral temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), right thalamus, orbitofrontal gyrus (ORB), and left middle cingulate cortex (MCC). The performances of the time-based prospective memory (TBPM) and event-based prospective memory (EBPM) were related to reduced functional connectivity between CH4 and right ORB. Besides, the functional connectivity of left TPJ was also significantly correlated with EBPM in WD. Conclusion: These findings indicated that the degenerative changes of BF may affect PM through the innervation brain function and may help to understand the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in WD. © 2021 The Authors.

The directed design of CO2RR electrocatalysts has centered on strategies to understand and optimize the differences in CO adsorption enthalpy across surfaces. This approach has largely ignored the role of competitive electrolyte adsorption in defining the CO surface population relevant for catalysis. Using in situ infrared spectroelectrochemistry and voltammetry, we uncover the contrasting influence of electrolyte competition on reversible CO binding to Au and Cu catalysts. Although reversible CO binding to Au surfaces is primarily driven by the adsorption processes associated with interfacial water, CO binding to Cu surfaces requires the reductive displacement of adsorbed carbonate anions. The divergent role of electrolyte competition for CO adsorption on Au versus Cu leads to a ∼600 mV difference in the potential region where CO accumulates on the two surfaces. The contrasting CO adsorption stoichiometry on Au and Cu also explains their disparate reactivity: interfacial water adsorption contributes to CO liberation from Au surfaces, impeding further reduction, whereas carbonate desorption contributes to CO accumulation on Cu surfaces, allowing for further reduction to hydrocarbons. These studies provide direct insights into how electrolyte constituents fine-tune CO surface populations and, thereby, CO2-to-fuel reactivity. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Gold; Spectroelectrochemistry; Adsorption process; Carbonate anion; Carbonate desorptions; Competition control; Electrocatalytic reduction; Fuel reactivity; Interfacial water; Potential region; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112554700

This study assesses the dispersion of cooking-related PM2.5 throughout a naturally-ventilated apartment in the US, examines the dynamic process of cooking-related emissions, and demonstrates the impact of different indoor PM2.5 mitigating strategies. We conducted experiments with a standardized pan-frying cooking procedure under seven scenarios, involving opening kitchen windows, using a range hood, and utilizing a portable air cleaner (PAC) in various indoor locations. Real-time PM2.5 concentrations were measured in the open kitchen, living room, bedroom (door closed), and outdoor environments. Decay-related parameters were estimated, and time-resolved PM2.5 emission rates for each experiment were determined using a dynamic model. Results show that the 1-min mean PM2.5 concentrations in the kitchen and living room peaked 1–7 min after cooking at levels of 200–1400 μg/m3, which were more than 9 times higher than the peak bedroom levels. Mean (standard deviation) kt for the kitchen, ranging from 0.58 (0.02) to 6.62 (0.34) h−1, was generally comparable to that of the living room (relative difference &lt; 20%), but was 1–5 times larger than that of the bedroom. The range of PM2.5 full-decay time was between 1 and 10 h for the kitchen and living room, and from 0 to &gt;6 h for the bedroom. The PM2.5 emission rates during and 5 min after cooking were 2.3 (3.4) and 5.1 (3.9) mg/min, respectively. Intervention strategies, including opening kitchen windows and using PACs either in the kitchen or living room, can substantially reduce indoor PM2.5 levels and the related full-decay time. For scenarios involving a PAC, placing it in the kitchen (closer to the source) resulted in better efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cooking; Emission rate; PM2.5; Portable air cleaner; Range hood; Window opening","building; concentration (composition); emission; particulate matter; spatial variation; temporal variation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107116298

Microalgae-based nitrate-rich wastewater treatment could realize nitrate recovery along with CO2 sequestration for sustainable biomass production, but the low tolerance of the microalgal strains to high-strength nitrate restricted the treatment process. The present study comprehensively evaluated a euryhaline marine microalga Tetraselmis subcordiformis for photosynthetic nitrate removal and biomass production in synthetic wastewater with a broad range of nitrate strength (0.24–7.0 g NO3−-N/L). This alga could acclimate to high nitrate strength up to 3.5 g NO3−-N/L (HN) without compromising biomass production. Nitrate could be completely removed within four days when low nitrate (0.24 g NO3−-N/L, LN) was loaded. The maximum nitrate removal rate of 331 mg N/L/day and specific nitrate removal rate of 360 mg N/day/g cell was obtained under medium nitrate condition (1.8 g NO3−-N/L, MN). High-nitrate stress under 7.0 g NO3−-N/L (SHN) caused an increased light energy dissipation while decreased the density of photosystem II active reaction center, which partially protect the cells from photodamage and contributed to their acclimation to SHN. The algae also enhanced amino acid/fatty acid proportions essential for maintaining intracellular redox states to cope with the stress caused by LN or SHN. HN and SHN was in favor of protein accumulation and maintenance with enhanced proportion of essential amino acids, which entitled the algal biomass to be of high quality for animal feed applied in livestock graziery and aquaculture. LN facilitated productive starch and lipid accumulation with good quality for biofuels production. The nitrate removal rate and biomass productivity exceeded most of the microalgae reported in literature under similar conditions, which highlighted Tetraselmis subcordiformis as a potent strain for flexible nitrate-rich wastewater remediation coupled with fast CO2 bio-mitigation and high-quality biomass production for sustainable algal biorefinery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Amino acid; Fatty acid; High-nitrate tolerance; Photosynthetic performance; Starch; Wastewater treatment","Agriculture; Algae; Amino acids; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Energy dissipation; Microorganisms; Nitrates; Starch; Wastewater treatment; Amino-acids; Biomass productions; Condition; High quality; High-nitrate tolerance; Micro-algae; Microalga; Nitrates removal; Photosynthetic performance; Removal rate; Fatty acids; amino acid; biofuel; carbon dioxide; fatty acid; nitrate; starch; nitric acid derivative; acclimation; amino acid; biomass power; fatty acid; microalga; nitrate; photosynthesis; strength; wastewater treatment; acclimatization; aquaculture; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; concentration (parameter); ecosystem restoration; lipid storage; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; photosystem II; priority journal; Tetraselmis; Tetraselmis subcordiformis; waste component removal; wastewater; acclimatization; animal; biomass; green alga; microalga; Tetraselmis subcordiformis; Acclimatization; Animals; Biofuels; Biomass; Chlorophyta; Microalgae; Nitrates; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104954220

Electrochemical de-alloying of mixed-metal nanoparticles is a promising strategy to modify catalysts' surface chemistry and/or induce lattice strain to alter their electronic structure. Perfect design of the electrochemical de-alloying strategy to modify the catalyst's d-band center position can yield significant improvement on the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, carbon supported PtCu catalysts are prepared by a simple polyol method followed by an electrochemical de-alloying treatment to form PtCu/C catalysts with a Pt-enriched porous shell with improved catalytic activity. Although the pristine PtCu/C catalyst exhibits a mass activity of 0.64 A mg-1Pt, the dissolution of Cu atoms from the catalyst surface after electrochemical de-alloying cycling leads to a significant enhancement in mass activity (1.19 A mg-1Pt), which is 400% better than that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C (0.24 A mg-1Pt). Furthermore, the de-alloyed PtCu/C-10 catalyst with a Pt-enriched shell delivers prolonged stability (loss of only 28.6% after 30 000 cycles), which is much better than that of Pt/C with a loss of 45.8%.

Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single-crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%) in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1 mA cm−2, leading to a remarkably high full-cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high-rate formate production and high-efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Bi rhombic dodecahedrons; electrochemical CO 2 reduction; high energy efficiency; surface states; topological crystalline insulators","Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Electrocatalysts; Energy efficiency; Surface states; Topology; Crystalline insulators; Crystalline symmetry; Energy efficient; Faradic efficiency; Partial currents; Renewable electricity; Rhombic dodecahedron; Single-crystalline; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108780196

Herein, we design two groups of AIEgens based on a triphenylacrylonitrile (TPAN) skeleton with through-space conjugation (TSC) property, demonstrate controlled regulation of photophysical emission efficiency/color and photochemical photochromic and photoactivatable fluorescence behaviours of these compounds, and further validate design principles to achieve highly efficient and emission-tuning AIEgens and to accomplish photo-dependent color switches and fluorescence changes. It is surprisingly found that the introduction of heavy halogens like bromine into a TPAN skeleton dramatically enhances the emission efficiency, and such an abnormal phenomenon against the heavy-atom effect is attributed to the specific through-space conjugation nature of the AIE-active skeleton, effective intermolecular halogen-bond-induced restriction of intramolecular motions, and heavy atom-induced vibration reduction. The incorporation of two electron-donating amino groups into the TPAN skeleton cause the luminogens to undergo a bathochromic shifted emission due to the formation of a D-A pattern. Apart from the regulation of photophysical processes in the solid state, the construction of the D-A pattern in luminogens also results in extremely different photochemical reactions accompanying reversible/irreversible photochromism and photoactivatable fluorescence phenomena in a dispersed state. It is revealed that photo-triggered cyclization and decyclization reactions dominantly contribute to reversible photochromism of the TPAN family, and the photo-induced cyclization-dehydrogenation reaction is responsible for the irreversible color changes and photoactivatable fluorescence behaviours of the NTPAN family. The demonstrations of multiple-mode signaling in photoswitchable patterning and information encryption highlight the importance of controlled regulation of photophysics and photochemistry of fused chromic and AIE-active luminogens in distinct states.

Water, methanol, and a mixture of the two were added at the pre-intercooler position to keep the same charge and cooling of the original rich mixture, reduce BSFC and increase ITE, and promote combustion. The methanol/water mixing volume ratios of different fuel injection strategies were compared to find the best balance between fuel consumption, performance, and emission trends. By simulating the combustion mechanism of methanol, water, and diesel mixed through the Chemkin system, the ignition delay, temperature change, and the generation rate of the hydroxyl group (−OH) in the reaction process were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance and emission of the engine were analyzed in combination with the actual experiment process. This paper studied the application of different concentration ratios of the water–methanol–diesel mixture in engines. Five concentration ratios of water–methanol blending were injected into the engine at different injection ratios at the pre-intercooler position, such as 100% methanol, 90% methanol/10% water, 60% methanol/40% water, 30% methanol/70% water, 100% water was used. With different volume ratios of premixes, the combustion rate and combustion efficiency were affected by droplet extinguishment, flashing, or explosion, resulting in changes in combustion temperature and affecting engine performance and emissions. In this article, the injection carryout at the pre-intercooler position of the intake port indicated thermal efficiency increase and a brake specific fuel consumption rate decrease with the increase of water–methanol concentration, and reduce CO, UHC, and nitrogen oxide emissions. In particular, when 60% methanol and 40% water were added, it was found that the ignition delay was the shortest and the cylinder pressure was the largest, but the heat release rate was indeed the lowest. © 2021 by the authors.","Diesel engine; Emissions; Injection position; Methanol; MSR","Air quality; Blending; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Emission control; Fuels; Ignition; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Urban transportation; Brake specific fuel consumption; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion temperatures; Fuel injection strategies; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Indicated thermal efficiency; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Performance and emissions; Methanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112650329

Taking China as an example, this paper constructs a dynamic energy computable general equilibrium (DECGE) model with knowledge capital to explain the effect of consumption preference on energy environment under the environmental regulation. We set three different consumption preference scenarios to conduct policy simulation. The results show that there are great differences in CO2 emission trends and energy consumption structure between different scenarios. China's current consumption preference cannot guarantee achievement of 2030 energy target. Environmental regulation policy would be helpful to the control of emissions. However, the policy effectiveness of environmental regulation will be affected by consumption preference. Moreover, consumption preference is the decisive factor affecting the industrial structure. And the adjustment of industrial structure will lead to the change of industrial energy consumption structure in China. Under the dual influence of environmental regulation and consumption scale effects, the knowledge capital and energy efficiency of energy intensive industry will be further improved. Our results reveal that the consumption preference and energy environment have synergistic effect. Although optimizing consumption structure cannot guarantee the realization of all energy targets, it will reduce the difficulty for the region to achieve these goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Consumption preference; Dynamic computable general equilibrium model; Energy consumption; Environmental regulation","Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; CO$-2$/ emission; Computable general equilibrium model; Consumption preference; Dynamic computable general equilibrium models; Dynamic energy; Energy; Energy consumption structure; Energy-consumption; Industrial structures; Knowledge capitals; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107682000

The paper adds to the existing literature on emission forecast by considering consumption preference, knowledge capital and technological innovation mechanism with in a non-linear multi-agent intertemporal optimization model (NL-MIOM) which can further improve the accuracy of CO2 emission prediction. The historical fitting test shows that the MAPE value of NL-MIOM model is 1.81%, which is lower than the GM, NGM, ARIMA, OGM, SVR and BR-AGM models. By using this model, we forecast the CO2 emissions and energy consumption structure in China under different scenarios from 2018 to 2035. We find that China's CO2 emissions will peak around 2032, 2029 or 2027 with 12.34, 11.59 or 11.17 billion tons CO2 emissions under the benchmark scenario, Preference A (American consumption preference) scenario and Preference B (Japanese consumption preference) scenario. Based on the methodology of LMDI decomposition, we identify the main factors affecting China's CO2 emissions.

Separating the effects of air pressure and climate along elevational gradients is challenging due to the covariation of elevation, pressure and climate. However, recently developed models based on optimality theory offer an independent way to predict leaf traits and thus to separate the contributions of different controls. We apply optimality theory to predict variation in leaf traits across 18 sites in the Gongga Mountain region. We show that the models explain 59% of trait variability on average, without site- or region-specific calibration. Temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture and growing season length are all necessary to explain the observed patterns. The direct effect of air pressure is shown to have a relatively minor impact. These findings contribute to a growing body of research indicating that leaf-level traits vary with the physical environment in predictable ways, suggesting a promising direction for the improvement of terrestrial ecosystem models. © The Author(s) 2021.

In this study, an optimal source-sink matching model and a techno-economic assessment model were developed to evaluate the contributions of CCS-EWR to carbon emission reduction and the increase of the water supply by considering various uncertain factors, as well as the corresponding costs. In addition, the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China was selected as the research region because, while there are abundant coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the YRB, the water resources are scarce. The results revealed the following. (1) The maximum CO2 capture capacity of the 236 CFPPs in the YRB is about 738.77 Mt/a, and nearly 13.14 Gt of fresh water could be provided until the 236 CFPPs in the YRB retire, which can partially relieve the pressure on the supply of water resources. (2) With the consideration of the CCS-EWR benefits, the average cost of the 236 CFPPs in the YRB in their residual lifetime to reduce their CO2 emissions by 90% will be no more than 180 CNY/t. (3) The incentive effect of the increase of the industrial water price on the profits of CCS-EWR projects is not significant. CCS-EWR technology has better application prospects in China under the dual constraints of carbon-neutral targets and water shortages, and more policy support is required for its deployment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); CO2 enhanced water recovery (EWR); Emission reduction cost; Source-sink matching; Yellow river basin (YRB)","carbon; carbon dioxide; fresh water; natural gas; salt water; carbon dioxide; coal; water; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental economics; socioeconomic impact; water resource; Article; climate change; controlled study; cost control; crystallization; desalination; economic development; electric power plant; environmental impact; environmental policy; fluid intake; government; gross national product; hydrostatic pressure; power supply; river basin; salinity; surface property; water supply; China; electric power plant; river; technology; China; Yellow River Basin; Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Power Plants; Rivers; Technology; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105973706

In order to fully study the heat transfer process of the Z-type PCHE, a numerical model of traditional Z-type PCHE was established and the accuracy of the model was verified. On this basis, a new type of spiral PCHE (S-ZPCHE) is proposed in this paper. The segmental design method was used to compare the pressure changes under 5 different spiral angles, and it was found that increasing the spiral angle θ of the spiral structure will reduce the pressure drop of the fluid. The effects of different spiral angles on the thermal-hydraulic performance of S-ZPCHE were compared. The results show that the pressure loss of fluid is greatly reduced, while the heat transfer performance is slightly reduced, and it was concluded that the spiral angle of 20◦ is optimal. The local fluid flow states of the original structure and the optimal structure were compared to analyze the reason for the pressure drop reduction effect of the optimal structure. Finally, the performance of the optimal structure was analyzed under variable working conditions. The results show that the effect of reducing pressure loss of the new S-ZPCHE is more obvious in the low Reynolds number region. © 2021 by the authors.

It is well known that the electricity consumption is a direct reflection of human activity. During the lockdown of Wuhan, most of human activities were forbidden. The reduction in human activity would inevitably lead to a reduction in electricity consumption. At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants would also be reduced with the reduction of human activity. In this study, the correlation between electricity consumption and air pollutants during lockdown was discussed in detail. The result showed that the drop in pollutants concentrations in January should be attributed to the washout effect of rainfall rather than the lockdown. The decrease of electricity consumption in the secondary industry might play a significant role on the decrease of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations in Wuhan in February 2020. The decrease in NO2 concentration in March should be attributed to the reduction of pollutants emissions from the tertiary industry, which means that more attention should be paid to the control of NO2 emission in the tertiary industry. Due to reduced emissions from local sources, the role of long-range transport sources might be more significant during the lockdown of Wuhan. By PSCF analysis, southeast of Wuhan could be the major potential emission sources of PM2.5, especially in the northern part of Jiangxi province. It was suggested that stricter regulation of pollutants emissions should be implemented in this area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Electricity consumption; PM2.5; PSCF; Three major industries","Electric power utilization; Nitrogen oxides; Anthropogenic emissions; Electricity-consumption; Emission sources; Environmental implications; Jiangxi Province; Long range transport; Pollutants emissions; Tertiary industries; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104740566

We compared air pollution between the lockdown period and the period before the lockdown using a difference-in-differences (DID) model and estimated the mortality burden caused by the number of deaths related to air pollution changes. The NO2 and CO concentrations during the lockdown period (17 days) declined by 8.94 µg/m3 (relative change: 16.94%; 95% CI: 3.71, 14.16) and 0.20 mg/m3 (relative change: 16.95%; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.35) on an average day, respectively, and O3 increased by 8.41 µg/m3 (relative change: 32.80%; 95% CI: 4.39, 12.43); no meaningful impacts of the lockdown policy on the PM2.5, PM10, SO2, or the AQI values were observed. Based on the three clearly changed air pollutants, the lockdown policy prevented 8.22 (95% CI: 3.97, 12.49) all-cause deaths. Our findings suggest that the overall excess deaths caused by air pollution during the lockdown period declined. It is beneficial for human health when strict control measures, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation, are taken to reduce emissions, especially in cities with serious air pollution in China, such as Shijiazhuang. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the theory of adaptive management, this paper selects Yuanping City from Shanxi Province, Qingyuan County from Liaoning Province, and Kulun Banner from Inner Mongolia as representative cases in agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas, respectively, to carry out field research, and it uses 1970–2017 meteorological station data to apply vulnerability assessment and climate element change trend analysis, combined with the meteorological hazards data, and explore the adaptive management measures for agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas in China. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the vulnerability of precipitation in Yuanping is high, the increase in temperature and drought and floods are the most important factors affecting crop yields in agricultural areas, and the key to climate change adaptive management lies in the awareness of farmers of climate change risks and the institutional guarantee of the government; (2) Qingyuan has high temperature vulnerability, and the forest areas have relatively strong adaptive capacity to climate change, but climate change will significantly affect the forest’s carbon sequestration function, and the focus of climate change adaptive management in the forestry sector is on engineering and technology field practices; (3) Kulun has the highest vulnerability to climate change, the frequent meteorological disasters seriously impact livestock development, and climate change adaptive management in pastoral areas relies on the participation of pastoralists’ local knowledge and also needs the support of the government and society. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, an emission rights futures trading (ERFT) model was established by combining futures trading with emission rights. It consists of four sub-models, which are sequentially the market classification model, the buyer's and the seller's cooperative optimization models, and the cooperation benefits allocation model. The reduction of pollutants and the trading amount of emission rights futures for different roles (i.e., buyers and sellers) can be firstly optimized by utilizing the former three sub-models, so as to obtain the total cooperation benefits. Then, aiming at encouraging the cooperation between different partners, the cooperation benefits are distributed through the fourth model. To further demonstrate the validity of the ERFT model, it was applied to reduce SO2 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as a case study. Results showed that it had two significant advantages over the non-cooperative reduction strategy (NCRS): the ERFT model would save about 57,012 more lives (a 0.822% increase compared to the NCRS) and reduce costs by US$ 4.778 × 109 (0.825% reduction compared to the NCRS). A sensitivity analysis showed that the ERFT model were relatively insensitive to changes in the values of the main parameters. Therefore, the ERFT model can effectively solve the problems of low efficiency, high cost and great adverse health effects of the NCRS. Whereas, a flexible and diversified ERFT market and corresponding policies should be proposed so that the ERFT can be fully implemented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adverse health effects; Air pollution; Emission rights trading; Futures; Shapley value method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107117004

The heterogeneity of marginal abatement cost (MAC) is prerequisite for trading, and the knowledge about the evolutionary characteristics of MAC is particularly necessary. However, the β convergence theory has been proved to be suitable yet rarely applied to the study of MAC of CO2. To fill this gap, this paper connects them creatively, and the convergence of MAC during 2001–2015 and the influential factors are explored by spatial panel data models. Results show that China’s MAC converges during the study period whether the spatial effect is considered or not. When evaluating the convergence of MAC, the spatial effect should not be ignored, because it will improve the explanatory power of models and promote the convergence. The size of labor force, emission level, coal consumption, foreign direct investment, and industrial structure significantly affect the growth rate of MAC. Low-carbon policies could be formulated fully considering the factors and their spillover effects. Those findings are certainly significant in imposing carbon reduction targets and adopting policy instruments. In addition, a national ETS is more applicable to China’s reality at this stage and suggested to introduce carbon tax in due course in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emissions; Convergence speed; Marginal abatement cost; Spatial effect; Spatial panel data model; β Convergence","abatement cost; carbon dioxide; convergence; environmental economics; panel data; pollution tax; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; greenhouse gas; industry; policy; Carbon Dioxide; China; Greenhouse Gases; Industry; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103166535

Many studies have been conducted to optimize the design and operation of heat pump water heaters from the perspective of climate change mitigation. Air-source heat pump water heaters, which absorb heat from the outdoor air and emit cold exhaust, can also be expected to alleviate the urban heat island effect; however, this has not been studied extensively. To estimate the impact of cold exhaust on building-scale climate, we conducted a multipoint measurement of the outdoor thermal environment around a low-rise apartment building equipped with air-source heat pump water heaters, in both summer and winter. Observations showed a substantial cooling effect that decreased air temperatures by 1 °C within the site boundary on summer nights when multiple heat pump water heaters operated concurrently. The analysis revealed that the sensitivity of the ambient temperatures to cold exhaust depends strongly on local atmospheric conditions. The most influential factor was the wind direction: the sensitivity increased significantly when the exhaust outlet location was at the lee side of the building. Naturally, the wind speed also affected the sensitivity, which tended to be higher when the wind speed was lower. The convective stability near the ground surface, however, showed no significant influence over the sensitivity. © 2021, The Author(s).","Air-source heat pump water heater; Building-scale climate; Cold exhaust; Observation; Urban heat island","boundary layer; building; cooling; heat island; summer; wind direction; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107471863

Revealing the dynamic mechanism and controlling factors of the urban outdoor thermal environment is the necessary theoretical preparation for regulating and improving the urban climate environment. Taking Hangzhou as an example and based on the local climate zones classification system, we investigated the effects of land cover composition and structure on temperature variability at the local scale. The measurement campaign was conducted within four local climate zones (LCZ 2, 4, 5, and LCZ 9) during 7 days in the summer of 2018. The results showed that the temperature difference within the respective LCZ was always below 1.1 °C and the mean temperature difference between LCZs caused by different surface physical properties was as high as 1.6 °C at night. Among four LCZs, LCZ 2 was always the hottest, and LCZ 9 was the coolest at night. In particular, the percentage of pervious surface was the most important land cover feature in explaining the air temperature difference. For both daytime and nighttime, increasing the percentage of pervious surface as well as decreasing the percentage of impervious surface and the percentage of building surface could lower the local temperature, with the strongest influence radius range from 120 m to 150 m. Besides, the temperature increased with the SVF increased at day and opposite at night. © 2021 by the authors.

In the United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) cap-and-trade program is used to reduce emissions. In this paper, I use detailed state-level data to estimate the impact of RGGI on coal and natural gas consumption in the electric-power industry. I find the program directly caused coal and natural gas phase-outs within regulated states. Specifically, the program decreased coal and natural gas consumption for electricity generation by 73% and 30%, respectively, within regulated states. However, in nearby, un-regulated states, I find an increase in natural-gas consumption of 237% and a decrease in coal consumption of 7%. As a result, the program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 million tons annually in regulated states, but increased carbon dioxide emissions by 3.5 million tons in unregulated states. I also find the program decreased the efficiency of coal-fired and gas-fired plants, which reduces the program's effectiveness for lowering emissions. However, overall, the program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 1.3 million tons per year. © 2021 The Author","Cap-and-trade; Efficiency; Emissions; Fossil fuel consumption; Leakage","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Commerce; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Cap and trade; Cap-and-trade program; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Emission; Fossil fuel consumption; Greenhouses gas; Leakage; Natural gas consumption; Efficiency; carbon emission; economic impact; emission control; emissions trading; energy efficiency; environmental policy; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; leakage; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107141304

Its versatility comes with the disadvantage of high energy consumption. We previously used empirical arguments to introduce dynamic process intensification (DPI) as a strategy for improving the energy efficiency of binary distillation. In this article, we focus on ternary distillation; we begin by providing a rigorous basis for DPI, then formulate the problem of identifying the operating states for DPI as a nonlinear optimization problem. Via an extensive case study considering a hydrocarbon mixture, we demonstrate that reboiler energy use can be reduced by more than 2.3% relative to an equivalent column operating at steady state. We prove that this result is due to the fact that DPI aims to satisfy product flow and quality constraints on average in time, affording broader opportunities for optimizing column economics than steady-state operation, where constraints are met strictly at all times. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","dynamic intensification; energy efficiency; process intensification; ternary distillation","Distillation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mixtures; Nonlinear programming; Binary distillation; Equivalent column; High energy consumption; Hydrocarbon mixture; Non-linear optimization problems; Quality constraints; Steady-state operation; Ternary distillation; Distilleries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104062785

Meanwhile, less intensified thermal conditioning of unoccupied surrounding environments can achieve heating/cooling energy efficiency. The concept was originated from task/ambient conditioning, which was developed for personal comfort systems. Most of the localized heating/cooling devices are workstation based or chair based. Task conditioning would become more closely to targets (human bodies) by using special clothing materials or thermoelectric elements. From thermal physiological viewpoints, thermal stimulus to thermally sensitive body parts may generate better results for not only local thermal comfort but also for whole body thermal comfort. Thermal stimulus to the extremities (feet) has demonstrated good thermal comfort effects.

They have the habit of changing heavy shoes to sandals when entering offices, which give the opportunity to enhance localized heating effects of footwarmers by reducing shoes’ thermal resistance.

Ocean warming is a major threat to calcareous algae, but it remains unclear exactly how these algae will respond to it. In this study, the potential physiological impacts of ocean warming on the calcareous alga Amphiroa fragilissima were evaluated in laboratory experiments. Increasing temperature from 26 to 28°C had positive effects on algal growth rate and chlorophyll a content, but these parameters decreased significantly at 32°C, which is 5°C above the annual mean temperature in the study region. Algal bleaching occurred at 34°C. There were no significant differences in CaCO3 content of thalli among different temperatures; however, calcification rate was inhibited significantly at 32 and 34°C. Transcriptome analyses using the Illumina RNA-seq platform showed that differentially expressed genes were annotated mainly in the categories of steroid biosynthesis, gap junction, ribosome, and mTOR signaling pathway. The expression levels of PsbA and PsbP were suppressed at 32°C, implying that inactivation of photosystem II could be a main reason for the decreased photosynthetic rate. Down-regulation of the genes encoding carbonic anhydrase and nitrate reductase was observed at 32°C, which could inhibit growth rate. Additionally, several genes that might be related to calcification were identified, including CAMK, CDPK, and CAM and genes encoding alpha-catenin and carbonic anhydrase.

CO2 emissions from high-energy-intensive industries account for more than three-quarters of the total industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, it is important to enhance our understanding of the main factors affecting carbon dioxide emissions in high-energy-intensive industries. In this paper, we firstly explore the main factors affecting CO2 emissions in high-energy-intensive industries, including industrial structure, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population, technological progress and foreign direct investment. To achieve this, we rely on exploratory regression combined with the threshold criteria. Secondly, a geographically weighted regression model is employed to explore local-spatial heterogeneity, capturing the spatial variations of the regression parameters across the Chinese provinces. The results show that the growth of per capita GDP and population increases CO2 emissions; by contrast, the growth of the services sector’s share in China’s gross domestic product could cause a decrease in CO2 emissions. Effects of technological progress on CO2 emissions in high-energy-intensive industries are negative in 2007 and 2013, whereas the coefficient is positive in 2018. Throughout the study period, regression coefficients of foreign direct investment are positive.

The total contribution of cities located along transport pathway (the “2 + 26” cities) accounts for most of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across this region both on average and during haze episodes. Regional joint prevention and control strategies are crucial to both routine and emergency environmental governance. Compared to primary PM2.5, secondary compounds may be transported across greater distances and impose notable effects in downstream areas. In regard to the secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) in Beijing during haze episodes, regional transport plays a more important role than do local emissions. The contribution of the transport of particle-phase secondary pollutants is comparable to that of the transport of gas-phase precursors during haze episodes. Control measurements of gas-phase precursors in upstream areas are also important, and they benefit the reduction in the total PM2.5 level. © 2021","Air quality model; PM2.5; Source apportionment","Atmospheric movements; Gases; Air quality modelling; Gas-phases; Line sources; Megacities; North China; PM$-2.5$; Regional transport; Source apportionment; Source-receptor relationships; Transport pathways; Air quality; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric transport; haze; megacity; particle size; pollutant transport; source apportionment; three-dimensional modeling; urban atmosphere; winter; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103288090

As China's capital, Beijing has very strict vehicles quota-limit policies. This study contributes to the literature for its innovations on the evaluation of quota-limit executive policy for big cities which few studies have studied, and its improved method with integrated analysis model which distinguish itself for including future co-benefit estimation and enterprise-level data analysis. This study estimates the energy consumption and health environmental co-benefit up to 2030, results show that the ambitious policy will significantly reduce both CO2 and key atmospheric pollutants emissions. Besides, the health economic loss from different illnesses attributed to NOX, CO, PM2.5 and HC will be 65 %, 61 %, 19 % and 57 % lower than reference scenario in 2030. During the energy transition, gasoline will still occupy the biggest proportion of the passenger sector fuel use in Beijing. However, the quota-limit policy will have significant integrated impact on both emission mitigation and avoiding public health damage.

However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far inferior to that of the near-infrared, red, and green counterparts. Here, the fabrication of pure-blue PeLEDs with an emission peak at 475 nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 10.1%, and a maximum luminance of 14 000 cd m−2 is demonstrated by tailoring the compositions of perovskites. The pure-blue electroluminescence is achieved by simultaneous addition of rubidium and chlorine ions into CsPbBr3 and incorporation of phenylethylammonium chloride forms quasi-2D hybrid perovskites. The combination of these composition engineering results in blueshifted emissions without reducing the quantum yield. The judicious alloying is shown to be critical to result in the better morphology with suppressed current leakage and enhanced light outcoupling. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","light-emitting devices; mixed halides; perovskites; rubidium-alloying","Bromine compounds; Cesium compounds; Chlorine compounds; Efficiency; Infrared devices; Lead compounds; Light; Light emitting diodes; Metal halides; Perovskite; Rubidium alloys; Current leakage; Emission peaks; External quantum efficiency; Halide perovskites; High conversion efficiency; Light outcoupling; Maximum luminance; Solid state lighting; Quantum efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110030075

This paper evaluates the impact of emission trading schemes on low-carbon innovation. Particularly, we focus on the seven emission trading pilots in China. They employed diversified scheme designs, and reaping heterogeneous low-carbon innovation effects. The empirical results show that 1) low-carbon innovation in the three pilots of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong responds more to the national demand for green technological changes, rather than to local policy shocks; 2) the Hubei pilot is the only successful one in raising low-carbon innovation motivations. Its success may be related to distinctive features of the market, including active transaction of carbon allowances, ambitious utilization of the auction mechanism in initial allowance allocation, and focus of regulation capacities on the most influential emitting entities. These features should be deliberately utilized in design the national carbon market, which has been pronounced at the end of 2017.

Faisalabad, Sheikhupura, Toba Tek Singh and Khanewal of Central Punjab, Pakistan. Effects of climate catastrophe have been seriously recognized as important inhibitory factors for birds’ sustainable existence and conservation. Among the four habitats, present within 120 kilometre radius from Faisalabad district, observations were conducted weekly on active and passive foraging, and the roost exits and returns throughout the day. Weather changes viz. temperature, precipitation and relative humidity were critically recorded. Impacts of temperature were significant and resulted in decline of the active foraging for the four designated birds (β=-2.36,-1.93,-2.15 and-1.64) whereas, precipitation due to its lowered frequency, exerted negative influence on the house sparrow and brown shrike, but was non-significant for rosy starling and tree swallows. Overall, temperature and relative humidity (RH) were the foremost climate factors and largely reduced the foraging and roosting movements of the four passerine birds’. Nonetheless, effects of lowered rainfall for the four habitats throughout this study were non-significant. © 2021, University of Agriculture.

However, there are few field measurements of atmospheric H2O2 to assess its role in O3 formation, especially for the seriously polluted region of the North China Plain. In this study, H2O2 concentrations were measured at the foot of Mt. Tai from May to July 2018 and the summit of Mt. Tai from May to June 2019, with average values of 0.93 ± 1.01 and 2.05 ± 1.20 ppb, respectively. H2O2 exhibited a pronounced diurnal variation with a noon-peak at the foot of Mt. Tai, which could be well reproduced by a gas-phase box model with H2O2 dry deposition velocity of 3 cm s−1 included, indicating H2O2 was mainly photochemically produced. Modeling analysis showed H2O2 production at the foot was most sensitive to alkenes and aromatics, while the source and sink for H2O2 were dominated by HO2 recombination and dry deposition, respectively. Compared with the summer-measurement in 2007, the remarkable elevation of H2O2 at the summit might be ascribed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase and SO2 decline. Both H2O2-O3 correlation and H2O2/NOz ratio suggested O3 formation at the foot of Mt. Tai was mainly VOC-sensitive in the early morning and shifted to NOx-sensitive thereafter. Therefore, reduction of VOCs emission especially for the reactive species of alkenes and aromatics in the morning as well as NOx emission around noontime will be effective for mitigating the serious O3 (as well as H2O2) pollution in Tai'an city. © 2021.

To this end, a new energy management control strategy based on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for vehicle speed prediction was proposed to dynamically adjust the engine and motor power output according to the traffic conditions. This study is based on intelligent network connectivity technology to obtain forward traffic state data and use a deep learning algorithm to model vehicle speed prediction using the traffic state data. The energy economy function was modeled using the MATLAB/Sinumlink platform and validated with a plug-in hybrid vehicle model simulation. The results indicate that the proposed strategy improves the vehicle energy economy by 13.02% and reduces CO2 emissions by 16.04% under real vehicle driving conditions, compared with the conventional logic threshold-based control strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the struggle to achieve food security should be carried out keeping in mind the soil where the crops are grown and the environment in which the living things survive, especially under rainfed agricultural system. Rainfed agricultural ecosystem is extremely fragile, improving soil fertility and reducing greenhouse gas emission are key factors for developing sustainable agriculture. Moreover, society increasingly expects agriculture to be more sustainable, by decreasing irrigation and mineral fertilizer inputs. Increasing food production sustainably through efficient use of resources will strongly contribute to food security, sustainable agriculture development, and increased climate change resilience. This paper addresses the effects of carbon smart technologies on greenhouse gas emission, soil quality and crop productivity in rainfed agro ecological environment. This paper hypothesized that application of carbon smart technologies could improve soil physical and chemical properties to enhance GHG mitigation and crop production. Carbon smart technologies highlighted in this paper include minimum tillage, crop residue retention, agroforestry, biofuels, integrated nutrient management and land use management systems. This paper review and discusses the work done on carbon smart technologies in different agro-ecological regions so as to understand its impact from the perspectives of the soil, the crop and the environment. The impact of conservation agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions and the underlying mechanism in different agroecological environments have been discussed. A detailed case study and tremendous advancements on the strength of integration of trees and shrub as carbon smart technologies in improving soil and crop productivity is highlighted immensely. The paper concludes with recommendations for encouraging and improving adoption by smallholder farmers to ensure more efficient and sustainable food system.

Soil application of biochar and straw alone or their combinations with nitrogen (N) fertilizer are becoming increasingly common, but little is known about their agronomic and environmental performance in semiarid environments. This study was conducted to investigate the effect(s) of these amendments on soil properties, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions and grain and biomass yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and to produce background dataset that may be used to inform nutrient management guidelines for semiarid environments. Methods. The experiment involved the application of biochar, straw or urea (46% nitrogen [N]) alone or their combinations. The treatments were: CN0 -control (zero- amendment), CN50 -50 kg ha-1 N, CN100 -100 kg ha-1 N, BN0 -15 t ha-1 biochar, BN50 -15 t ha-1 biochar + 50 kg ha-1 N, BN100 -15 t ha-1 biochar + 100 kg ha-1 N, SN0 -4.5 t ha-1 straw, SN50 -4.5 t ha-1 straw + 50 kg ha-1 Nand SN100 -4.5 t ha-1 straw + 100 kg ha-1 N. Fluxes of N2O, CH4 and grain yield were monitored over three consecutive cropping seasons between 2014 and 2016 using the static chamber-gas chromatography method. Results. On average, BN100 reported the highest grain yield (2054 kg ha-1), which was between 25.04% and 38.34% higher than all other treatments. In addition, biomass yield was much higher under biochar treated plots relative to the other treatments. These findings are supported by the increased in soil organic C by 17.14% and 21.65% in biochar amended soils (at 0-10 cm) compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon respectively. The BN100 treatment also improved bulk density and hydraulic properties (P <0:05), which supported the above results. The greatest N2O emissions and CH4 sink were recorded under the highest rate of N fertilization (100 kg N ha-1). Cumulative N2O emissions were 39.02% and 48.23% lower in BN100 compared with CN0 andCN100, respectively. There was also a-37.53% reduction inCH4 uptake under BN100 compared with CN0-control and CN50. The mean cumulative N2O emission from biochar treated soils had a significant decrease of 10.93% and 38.61% compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon treatment, respectively. However, differences between mean cumulative N2O emission between straw treated soils and soils without carbon were not significant. These results indicate the dependency of crop yield, N2O and CH4 emissions on soil quality and imply that crop productivity could be increased without compromising on environmental quality when biochar is applied in combination with N-fertilizer. The practice of applying biochar with N fertilizer at 100 kg ha-1 N resulted in increases in crop productivity and reduced N2O and CH4 soil emissions under dryland cropping systems. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

We conducted lidar measurements at Wuhan (30.53°N, 114.37°E) from October 2010 to June 2020 and analyzed the massive dataset with an automatic lidar processing algorithm, to investigate the long-term variations of aerosols. Lidar-derived total aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 532 nm shows an interannual decrease of −0.049 since 2010. Compared with AODs in other megacities worldwide, the AOD for Wuhan shows the largest decrease rate. After separating AOD contributions from boundary layer (BL) and free troposphere (FT), different evolution patterns are revealed with AOD decrease rates of −0.009 and −0.044 per year for FT and BL, respectively, which indicates more than 80% of AOD decrease are associated with reductions of local emissions. In addition, BL AOD was always larger than FT AOD before COVID-19 lockdown. However, this relation was conversed thereafter, with the lowest value of 0.125 for BL AOD since 2010, which is only the half of FT AOD within the same period. This feature corroborates strong influences of COVID-19 lockdown on human activities and local emissions.

In Ghana, studies have identified climate change as one constraining player that trigger sustainable livelihood. In the Wa West District of Ghana, studies have paid much efforts on climate change and its perceived effects on livelihood with little attention on climate variability which is a yearly phenomenon. The study aimed to investigate climate variability and rural livelihood sustainability using communities along the Black Volta River in the Wa West District in the Upper West Region as units of analysis. The study employed cross-sectional survey using a mixed method approach to investigate the phenomenon. Purposive and simple random sampling methods were used to select the communities and household heads for the study respectively. Questionnaires and interviews were used as data collections tools and questionnaires were administered to 163 household heads. Descriptive and thematic analytical approaches were employed. The result of the study revealed that respondents of the four communities were engaged in primary (crop farming, animal rearing, shea butter processing and Pito brewing) and secondary livelihood activities (dry season gardening, weaving of birds/fishing nets and hair dressing). Evidently, the study found that short, unstable, drought spelt, warm/extreme weather have affected respondents livelihood especially the primary livelihood strategies. In addition, respondents observed drought, flood, poverty/famine, pest and disease, poor crop yield and bush fires as major climate variability-induced shocks and stresses they experienced over the last one decade. Importantly, the study found that respondents have employed cultivation of short duration crop varieties, shifting of planting dates when bad season is suspected and addition of alternative livelihood as response strategies to climate variability.

The current mechanism of electrocatalysis of methanol oxidation on platinum and non-platinum-containing alloys is summarized for the systematic improvement of the rate of electro-oxidation of methanol are discussed. Policy realignment under the five-year plan is discussed in length to demonstrate how policy, markets, and engineering designs contribute towards the development of model direct methanol fuel cells operational enhancement, and factors that affect critical performance parameters for commercial exploitation are summarized for catalytic formulations and cell design within the context of why this investment in technology, education, and finances is required within the global context of sustainable energy and energy independence as exposed by thirteenth the five-year plan. The prolog focuses on the way, whereas the section on methanol fuel cells on the how and the post log on what is expected post-COVID-19 era in science and technology as China pivots to a post-fossil fuel economy. China's industrial growth has been through internal market reforms and supplies side economics from the Chinese markets for fossil fuels except for petroleum. The latest renewable portfolio standards adopted have common elements as adopted from North American and the United Kingdom in terms of adaptation of obligation in terms of renewable portfolio standards as well as a realization that the necessity for renewables standards for the thirteen five year plan (from 2016 to 2020) need to less rigorously implemented due to performance targets that were met during the eleventh (06–10) and twelfth five-year plans (11–15) in terms of utilization of small coal-ire power plants, development of newer standards, led to an improvement of energy efficiency of 15 %, reduction of SOx/NOx by an average of 90 % and PM2.5 by 96 % over the last two five-year plans. The current phase of the plan has a focus on energy generation from coal and a slowing down of renewables or Renewable energy curtailment of approximately 400 T Wh renewables including 300 T Wh of non-hydro power, principally from Guangdong, and Jiangsu for transfer of hydropower and Zhejiang, Tianjin, Henan for non-hydro power transfer with Beijing and Shanghai playing important roles in renewables energy curtailment and realignment using an integrated approach to optimize each provinces energy portfolio. The realignment of the renewable energy portfolio indicates that the newly installed capacity in Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang will account for less than 20 % of the current renewable energy portfolio but with the NOx SOx and PM2.5 savings already accrued. The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol (70 / 110 million metric tons from all sources in 2019 for China/world) is one technological approach to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and suggests that catalytic methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation may be a plausible approach, even if it is more expensive economically than methanol synthesis by the syngas approach. This is because the CO2 emissions of the synthesis are lower than other synthesis methodologies. The Chinese government has placed a premium on cleaner air and water and may view such an approach as solving the dual issues of fuel substitution and reduction of CO2. Thus, the coupling of hydrogen generation from sustainable energies sources (Solar 175 / 509 GW) or wind (211/591.5 GW in 2019) may be an attractive approach, as this requires slightly less water than coal gasification. Due to the thermodynamic requirement of lower operating pressure and higher operating pressure, currently, there is no single operational approach, although some practice approaches (220 °C at 48 atm using copper) and zinc oxide/alumina are suggested for optimal performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","bi-metallic catalysis; CO2 reduction; Energy saving; Heterogeneous catalysis; Lower emissions; Methanol hydrogenation","Air cleaners; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Coal; Coal industry; Commerce; Copper compounds; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Engineering education; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuel economy; Gas fuel purification; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogen production; II-VI semiconductors; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Platinum alloys; PROLOG (programming language); Small power plants; Synthesis gas manufacture; Zinc oxide; Carbon dioxide emissions; Commercial exploitation; Critical performance parameters; Investment in technology; Operational enhancements; Renewable portfolio standard; Science and Technology; Synthesis methodology; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096183686

Such regionally differentiated climate policies inevitably cause carbon leakage phenomenon, that is, reduced carbon emissions in abating areas may be offset to some extent by increased carbon emissions in non-abating areas. The occurrence of carbon leakage could undermine the environmental effectiveness of implemented climate policies and cause extra emission reduction costs. Studying carbon leakage is vital not only to the effective formulation, implementation, and evaluation of climate policy, but also to the fair sharing of international emission reduction responsibilities. To understand how this important issue has been discussed, this paper systematically reviewed the research shedding light on carbon leakage. Taking the questions of how carbon leakage happens, what are the key influencing factors, how to evaluate it and where does the heterogeneity of results come from as the story line, we investigated the main mechanism of carbon leakage and the factors influencing it, the distribution of carbon leakage across countries, measurement methods and results through the bibliometric analysis and meta-analysis. On the basis of this, three aspects of improvements worthy of further study were proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Border carbon adjustment; Carbon leakage; Differentiated climate policies; Emissions accounting principles; Measurement methods; Mechanism of carbon leakage","Climate change; Emission control; Border carbon adjustment; Carbon emissions; Carbon leakage; Climate policy; Differentiated climate policy; Emission accounting principle; Emission reduction; Global climate changes; Measurement methods; Mechanism of carbon leakage; Carbon; carbon; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; measurement method; meta-analysis; policy implementation; air and air related phenomena; air pollution control; bibliometrics; carbon footprint; carbon leakage; climate change; climate policy; computable general equilibrium model; econometric model; environmental policy; mathematical model; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103958983

It is crucial to provide a complete explanation for the mechanism behind the changes in PM2.5 pollution and explore how to decouple economic growth from PM2.5 pollution. Compared with the traditional decomposition analysis methods, the Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM) integrates multiple influencing factors and provides a fuller understanding of the influence mechanism of PM2.5 pollution. In addition, the decomposition of the monitored PM2.5 concentration in previous studies leads to ambiguous economic meanings of some relative impact indicators. In this paper, GDIM decomposition is applied to study the driving factors of energy-related PM2.5 emissions changes in China. Then, based on the GDIM decomposition results, this paper constructs a novel decoupling indicator to study the decoupling relationship between PM2.5 emissions and economic growth, and the contributions of the technical and non-technical factors to the decoupling indicator are quantified. The main results are summarized as follows. (1) The output scale effect and energy use effect are the main reasons for the increase of PM2.5 emissions, while the emission intensity effect and emission coefficient effect make major contributions to decreasing PM2.5 emissions. The effects of population, per capita emissions, per capita output, and energy intensity are relatively minor. (2) China and its three economic regions move from strong decoupling in 1998–2000 to weak decoupling during 2000–2010, and then into strong decoupling over the period of 2010–2014. (3) Technical effect plays an important role in promoting the decoupling between PM2.5 emissions and economic growth, but its contribution shows a downward trend over time. In contrast, non-technical effect hinders the decoupling process, and its contribution is decreasing from 2000 to 2014. This paper is supportive for formulating emissions reduction policies and improving China's air quality. © 2021","China; Decoupling indicator; Energy-related PM2.5 emissions; Factor decomposition; Generalized Divisia Index Method; Technical and non-technical effects","Air quality; Emission control; China; Decoupling indicator; Decouplings; Divisia index method; Economic growths; Energy-related PM2.5 emission; Factor decompositions; Generalized divisia index method; PM$-2.5$; Technical and non-technical effect; Economics; air quality; decomposition analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105863765

We then develop an empirical strategy and combine state-level data in the US to test the induced CO2 emissions by government highway spending. We find that there are positive and significant total effects of government highway spending on passenger and freight vehicle emissions. The magnitude of these effects, however, significantly differs from one another as the elasticity of freight vehicle emissions with respect to government highway spending is four times larger than that in the passenger sector. The difference can be plausibly explained by the rebound effect and the interaction effect. We argue that policies regarding government spending on highway projects, especially those relying on cost-benefit analysis, should account for the potential difference in induced environmental impacts between passenger and freight vehicles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Freight; Highway spending; Passenger; Transportation externalities; Vehicle emissions","Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Freight cars; Highway engineering; Freight vehicle; Government spending; Highway projects; Interaction effect; Local government; Potential difference; Theoretical framework; Vehicle emission; Road vehicles; carbon dioxide; demand analysis; empirical analysis; freight transport; road pricing; state role; theoretical study; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107088873

Distinguishing these effects enables quantification of the effectiveness of emission mitigation actions by excluding meteorological effects. Here, we develop reduced-form models in both direct (RFDMs) and inverse (RFIMs) modes to estimate ambient BC concentrations. The models were developed based on outputs from multiyear simulations under three conditional scenarios with realistic or fixed emissions and meteorological conditions. We established a set of probabilistic functions (PFs) to quantify the meteorological influences. A significant two-way linear relationship between multiyear annual emissions and mean ambient BC concentrations was revealed at the grid cell scale. The correlation between them was more significant at grid cells with high emission densities. The concentrations and emissions at a given grid cell are also significantly correlated with emissions and concentrations of the surrounding areas, respectively, although to a lesser extent. These dependences are anisotropic depending on the prevailing winds and source regions. The meteorologically induced variation at the monthly scale was significantly higher than that at the annual scale. Of the major meteorological parameters, wind vectors, temperature, and relative humidity were found to most significantly affect variation in ambient BC concentrations. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","black carbon; China; emission; meteorology; multiple linear regression; probabilistic functions","Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Atmospheric concentration; Emission mitigation; Linear relationships; Meteorological condition; Meteorological effects; Meteorological influence; Meteorological parameters; Probabilistic functions; Atmospheric humidity; black carbon; black carbon; concentration (composition); correlation; quantitative analysis; reciprocity; relative humidity; ambient air; Article; atmosphere; calculation; environmental temperature; grid cell; humidity; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; wind; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; soot; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Soot; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112369265

Herein, a facile wet chemical approach was proposed for the preparation of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) crystals with different sizes, i.e. approximately 5 nm, 100 nm and 1 μm in lateral size, which were confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of Cu2O crystals on the combustion behavior of RPUF was evaluated by cone calorimetry and steady state tube furnace tests. Significant reduction in peak carbon monoxide (CO) production rate (by 41.2%, 67.6% and 27.9%) and total smoke production (21.6%, 16.1% and 12.2%) were realized by the incorporation of 2 wt% Cu2O into the RPUF matrix in addition to a slight reduction in peak heat release rate. Notably, nano-sized Cu2O with high specific surface area is beneficial for the complete combustion of RPUF and the conversion of CO to carbon dioxide (CO2), involving the reduction of Cu2+-Cu+-Cu0 by degraded gases and the oxidation of Cu0-Cu+-Cu2+ by oxygen.

Higher GEM concentrations in spring were associated with more abundant anthropogenic emissions and biomass burning before spring plowing. GEM concentrations in the three seasons decreased significantly compared to 2013–2014 levels (22.2%–49.2%), which may to some extent reflect the effectiveness of air quality control measures for coordinated control of atmospheric Hg. The Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis show that areas to the north are major contributors of GEM to Hefei in winter because of the effect of the East Asian winter monsoon. In spring and autumn, the major contributors are primarily concentrated in regions to the south. The relative contributions of three categories of anthropogenic GEM sources to their regional transports in each season was further quantified in this study. The results showed similar patterns. Industrial sources accounted for the highest contribution (56%–59.6%), followed by intentional use and product waste associated sectors (24.5%–27.1%), and stationary combustion sources (15.6%–16.9%), implying that control of industrial Hg emissions should be prioritized in future measures. This study compared the simulated results of GEM by the GEOS-Chem model with the field observations. It is found that the GEOS-Chem model significantly overestimated GEM by 75% in general, suggesting that timely update of mercury emission inventory data is needed to improve the accuracy of atmospheric mercury simulations under the background of implementing “Minamata Convention” and a series of air pollution control policies in the future. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","GEOS-Chem; Mercury; Regional transport; Seasonal characteristics; Source contributions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110585649

China consumes about 25% of global electricity demand, and 69% of this is used in industries. The high electricity demand in industry is responsible for 45% of CO2, 25% of SO2, 34% of NOx and 14% of PM emissions in China. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap on the potential for electricity savings in China’s industries, thereby providing important implications for the potential of reducing emissions in electricity-intensive industrial subsectors in general. Available studies are reviewed and compared to identify electricity-saving potentials. The findings show that China’s industrial energy system is shifting to higher electricity and relatively lower fossil fuel use due to accelerated end-use electrification. China’s industry can reduce electricity use by 7–24% in 2040, compared to baseline levels, and generate emission reductions of 192–1118 Mt-CO2, 385–2241 kt-SO2, 406–2362 kt-NOx and 92–534 kt-PM2.5. The iron &amp; steel subsector has the largest contribution to the industrial electricity savings, followed by non-ferrous metals, chemicals, cement and pulp &amp; paper. Policies that combine environmental targets, demand-side efficiency and supply-side retrofits in the power sector should be adopted. Given the different performance of policies in terms of energy savings and emission reduction, sector- and region-specific policies would be preferred. © 2021, The Author(s).","Air pollutants; Carbon emissions; China; Electricity saving; Energy efficiency; Industry","Carbon dioxide; Demand side management; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Industrial chemicals; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Electricity demands; Electricity saving potentials; Emission reduction; Environmental benefits; Environmental targets; Global electricity demands; Industrial energy system; Reducing emissions; Fossil fuels; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; consumption behavior; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; emission control; emission inventory; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental economics; fossil fuel; industrial performance; Carbon Dioxide; Demand; Electricity; Energy Conservation; Fossil Fuels; Nitrogen Oxides; Sides; Sulfur Dioxide; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111382489

However, land 4D seismic acquisition is often associated with high cost and disruptions to industrial operation or agricultural activities in the area of acquisition. An alternative technique for time-lapse monitoring of the subsurface is 3D VSP, which becomes particularly attractive when used with distributed acoustic fiber optic sensors (DAS) installed in wells. The advantages of 3D DAS VSP include its relatively low cost, minimal footprint on the local area during acquisition, and superior spatial resolution compared to the resolution of geophones. The potential of this technique is explored by processing and analysing multi-well 3D DAS VSP data acquired at the CO2CRC Otway Project site in Victoria, Australia. The DAS data were recorded using an engineered fiber with enhanced backscattering cemented behind the casing of five wells. The data from each well are processed individually using the same processing flow and then migrated using a 3D migration code tailored to DAS data. Having DAS along the full extent of multiple wells ensures adequate seismic coverage of the area of CO2 injection. The migrated images provide detailed information about subsurface up to 700 m away from a well and up to 2 km depth. The images are consistent with previously acquired geophone VSP and surface seismic data. The quality of the 3D DAS VSP imaging is comparable or superior to the quality of conventional imaging using geophone data. Therefore, 3D DAS VSP is demonstrably an optimal solution for reservoir monitoring. © 2021 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Fiber-optic sensors; Imaging; Sequestration; Timelapse; Vertical seismic profile (VSP)","Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Fiber optic sensors; Seismology; Agricultural activities; Conventional imaging; Enhanced backscatterings; Industrial operations; Reservoir monitoring; Reservoir surveillance; Time-lapse monitoring; Victoria , Australia; Seismic prospecting; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fiber optics; hydrocarbon reservoir; imaging method; seismic data; sensor; vertical profile; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113712049

In all cases, two emission bands are observed. One is an exciton emission band and the second an intense and broad visible emission band. As the growth time increases, the intensity of the exciton emission decreases while that of the visible emission increases. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements at the UV emission peak show a bi-exponential decay behavior. As the growth time increases, the fast and slow decay lifetimes increase together with a decrease of the amplitude ratio (AR) of the slow decay component to the rapid one due to the reduction of the non-radiative pathways when the oxygen deposition time is short. Moreover, slower rise time of the TRPL signal is observed when the growth time increases, proving the increase of the trap states density in the ZnO band gap. These results suggest that the amount of oxygen deposited as reactive gas in DC reactive sputtering technique must be optimized to improve the performance of UV light-emitting applications. © 2021","Defects; Optical properties; Sputtering; Thin films; X-ray diffraction","Energy gap; Excitons; II-VI semiconductors; Metallic films; Optical films; Optoelectronic devices; Oxide minerals; Oxygen; Photoluminescence; Thin films; Zinc oxide; Amplitude ratios; DC reactive sputtering; Exciton emission; Exponential decays; Oxygen deposition; Time-resolved photoluminescence; UV light-emitting; Visible emissions; Reactive sputtering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109130849

While SCs as alternative housing has been extensively explored, few studies have focused on the structural and thermal performance of SCs in a tropical monsoon climate. This paper aims to contribute to a better knowledge of SC building construction by (1) investigating the SCs structural performance when subjected to a variety of loads, including gravity, earthquake, and very strong typhoon, and (2) assessing the thermal performance in a hot and humid climate. The case of Leyte, Philippines, a hot, humid, and typhoon-frequented region, is considered in this study. To meet the objectives, two SCs were combined to build a single-family house. First, the structural strength of the SCs, including the effect of cuts and openings, were investigated using finite element analysis. Second, the thermal condition of the SC was compared using four models with different insulation materials: no insulation, PE foam insulation (R-12), slightly higher insulation (R-13 fiberglass batt), and very high insulation (R-49 fiberglass batt) through building energy simulation. The paper concludes that SCs have inherently high strength and can withstand strong wind and earthquake. Stresses due to cuts and openings were minimized when the cuts/openings were placed far from the corner posts. On the other hand, increasing insulation R-value did not improve the indoor thermal condition of the SCs. More work needs to be done on making SCs thermally comfortable in hot and humid climates. © 2021 by the authors.

Extensive research has been devoted to solving these issues, including research in the field of concrete science. Still, the issue of developing concrete compositions with increased corrosion resistance remains much less studied. At the same time, reactive aggregates from industrial waste can have positive effect on durability of concrete, and the best result can be achieved by means of modification of a concrete mixture with highly effective additives. The article presents the research data in two lines—the study of applicability of reactive aggregates from waste products of nonmetallic and ceramic industries, mineral wool production and concrete scrap for production of corrosion-resistant concretes, as well as the assessment of possibility of Portland cement quantity reduction in a concrete mixture on local raw materials due to the introduction of additives based on polycarboxylates. The article presents the research evidence of the effect of dust and clay particles content on the quality of concrete with a polycarboxylate additive. The article describes the studies of corrosion resistance of concrete samples based on production wastes in sulfate environments and under the influence of carbon dioxide. The developed concrete compositions with waste use can be recommended for widespread application, rational use of resources, and production of durable high-quality concretes. The application of additives based on polycarboxylates makes it possible to produce concretes with the reduction of cement consumption in the mixture by 10–20% and decrease in the mode of thermo-wet treatment by two times. © 2021 by the authors.

Several questions including How climate and tectonics control topographic growth and decay and what is the thermal and geological record of growth and decay? remain unclear and are subject of extensive research. Here we use geological data from the Antioquia Altiplano Province (AAP) in the Northern Andes to develop a 3D thermo-kinematic model that constrains past relief and exhumation rates. Results suggest that Late Cretaceous to Paleocene collision between the Caribbean Plateau and the continental margin caused high exhumation and formed a topography higher than present-day elevations. Between the late Paleocene and Oligocene, the reduction of tectonic activity caused thermal relaxation that drove regional bedrock cooling, while climatically-driven erosion significantly reduced relief, forming low-relief surfaces. During the Miocene, deformation and limited erosion resulted in a phase of Miocene topographic growth and low exhumation that preserved and deformed the previously formed low-relief surfaces. Our results demonstrate how mountain belts grow but also decay in response to the interactions and feedbacks between climate and tectonics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3D thermo-kinematic modeling; Collision of the Caribbean Plateau; Northern Andes; Paleo-topography; Paleosurfaces; Tectonics and climate","Belts; Erosion; Kinematics; Topography; Continental margin; Drainage networks; Exhumation rates; Geological data; Regional climate; Tectonic activity; Tectonic evolution; Thermal relaxation; Tectonics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108869748

Heating is among the largest consumers of energy in buildings. This study examined the influence of the income of inhabitants on the consumption of energy for heating and the CO2 emissions in city buildings. The study was carried out using equivalized disposable income as the basis for the analysis and considered the economies of scale of households. The results are shown per inhabitant and household, by independently considering each city. Furthermore, to more clearly identify the influence of the population income, the study was also carried out without considering the influence of the climate. The method was implemented in the case of Spain. For this purpose, Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants were analyzed. The results show that, both per inhabitant and per household, the higher the income of the inhabitants, the greater the consumption of energy for heating and the greater the emissions in the city. This research aimed to help energy utilities and policy makers make appropriate decisions, namely, planning for the development of facilities that do not produce greenhouse gases, and enacting laws to achieve sustainable economies, respectively. The overall aim is to achieve the objective of mitigating the impact of emissions and the scarcity of energy resources. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, more than 40% of greenhouse gas emissions are produced in buildings in the residential and tertiary sectors. Therefore, cities, and in particular their buildings, have a great influence on these emissions. In fact, they are reflected in several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Any measure taken to reach these goals has a significant impact from the point of view of reducing greenhouse gases. An understanding of these goals is the basis of greenhouse gas mitigation. This work analyzed the CO2 emissions from the buildings in cities as a function of the economic income of their inhabitants. For this, databases published by official sources were used. The origins of the CO2 are usually emitted by buildings were analyzed—electrical and thermal, in the form of natural gas. Another variable that influences these emissions is climate. To study only the income variable, the influence of climate has been eliminated. Also, to facilitate analysis, an index has been introduced. As an example of application of the proposed methodology, Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants were studied. The analysis was carried out by household and by inhabitant. The results showed the following: the higher the income of the citizens, the higher the total and thermal emissions; thermal consumption is elastic, while electrical consumption is inelastic; emissions of electrical origin are almost constant; emissions from electrical energy are greater than those from thermal energy; as income increases, the ratio between emissions of electrical and thermal origin decreases. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Air pollution; Buildings; Cities; Climate; Energy consumption; Income; Spain","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; CO2 emissions; Electrical consumption; Electrical energy; Greenhouse gas mitigation; In-buildings; Thermal emissions; Thermal origins; United Nations; Gas emissions; atmospheric pollution; building; consumption behavior; energy use; greenhouse gas; Sustainable Development Goal; temperature anomaly; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114743932

The consequences of land abandonment are however difficult to assess as both agriculture and land abandonment are linked to socio-environmental public goods, but the relationship between public good provision and land use, as well as their societal value, are unclear and debated. Policy such as the Common Agricultural Policy affects land abandonment and public good provision in different ways, by providing income support and targeting the provision of environmental public goods.The objective of the paper is to assess the land use, public good levels and welfare deriving from agricultural production and from the provision of three selected PGs, in three alternative scenarios. In a reference scenario land use allocation is driven by the maximization of agricultural income; we then compare these results with a scenario where land use decisions maximize the societal welfare, hence including the value generated by the three, and with a scenario that simulates Measure 13 of the Rural Development Programme (payment for Areas Facing natural or other specific Constraints). The method used is a land allocation model calibrated for the hill and mountain area of the province of Bologna (Italy), in which the public goods societal values are the results of a choice experiments taken in the Emilia-Romagna region. The main results is that the societal optimum is reached through a substantial change in land allocation (e.g. a strong reduction in land abandonment and an increase in forest areas) and in the composition of the welfare (from private agricultural income toward public good benefits) with respect to the private optimum.

This article applies components of the framework developed by Moser and Ekström (2010) onto empirical qualitative data to diagnose institutional barriers to climate change adaptation in the Municipality of Beirut, Lebanon. Our approach reveals the presence of two vicious cycles influencing each other. In the first cycle, the root cause barrier is major political interference generating competing priorities and poor individual interest in climate change. A second vicious cycle is derived from feedbacks caused by the first and leading to the absence of a dedicated department where sector specific climate risk information is gathered and shared with other departments, limited knowledge and scientific understanding, as well as a distorted framing or vision, where climate change is considered unrelated to other issues and is to be dealt with at higher levels of government. The article also highlights the need to analyze interlinkages between barriers in order to suggest how to overcome them. The most common way to overcome barriers according to interviewees is through national and international support followed by the creation of a data bank. These opportunities could be explored by national and international policy-makers to break the deadlock in Beirut. © 2021, The Author(s).","Barriers; Beirut; Climate change adaptation planning; Lebanon; Opportunities","adaptive management; climate change; indigenous knowledge; institutional framework; knowledge; planning process; policy making; Beyrouth; Lebanon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111527308

At the same time, the intensity of environmental regulation would affect the emission reduction effect of FDI in the host country. This study aims to reveal the internal mechanisms of this effect. Specifically, this paper studies the impact of FDI on technological innovation in China’s industrial sectors from the perspective of technology transactions from 2001 to 2019, and then analyzes whether the intensity of environmental regulation can promote the relationship. Results indicate that FDI promotes technological innovation through technology transactions. In addition, it finds that the intensity of environmental regulation significantly positively moderates the relationship between FDI and technological innovation, which is achieved by positively moderating the FDI-technology transaction relationship. Regional heterogeneity analysis is further conducted, and results show that in the eastern and western regions of China, FDI can stimulate technological innovation within regional industrial sectors through technology trading. Moreover, environmental regulation has a significant positive regulatory effect on the above relationship, but these effects are not supported by evidence in the central region of China. © 2021 by the authors.","Environmental regulation; FDI; Heterogeneity analysis; Innovation; Technology transactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111637823

Herein, an A-D-A′ type TADF emitter of TRZ-SBA-NAI was firstly developed by simultaneously integrating 2-phenyl-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione and 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine acceptors into a spirobiacridine donor core. Due to the coexistence of double charge-transfer excited states, TRZ-SBA-NAI displayed dual emission containing a dominant orange-red emission and an anti-Kasha's rule sky-blue emission shoulder in solution. As doped into the host matrix, TRZ-SBA-NAI only exhibited an orange-red emission, together with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 87%. The linear molecular shape imparted TRZ-SBA-NAI with a high horizontal dipole ratio of 88%. As a result, the TRZ-SBA-NAI based devices achieved a record-high external quantum efficiency of 31.7% with an electroluminescence peak at 593 nm. This finding not only enriches the diversity in TADF molecular design, but also unlocks the huge potential of A-D-A′ type TADF emitters for excellent device performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Charge transfer; Citrus fruits; Efficiency; Electroluminescence; Fluorescence; Steel beams and girders; Charge-transfer excited state; Device performance; External quantum efficiency; Horizontal dipoles; Molecular design; Molecular shapes; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Quantum efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112670757

The tunnel will collect both rainwater and groundwater from approximately 500 sq. km and transfer the captured flow to the sea. The Design Builder JV selected COWI as Designer of the entire Project and IC Consultant as Design Checker for the Tunnels. The Project includes approximately 10.3 km of 10-meter-inside diameter tunnel in rock, three construction shafts and one drop shaft. The main tunnel will convey stormwater and groundwater flows from the EXPO 2020 area near the intersection of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road and Jebal Ali Lehbab Road to the sea close to the EGA facility. The tunnel will follow beneath the road easement along Jebal Ali Lehbab Road and along Sheikh Zayed Road and continue to the pumping station. The tunnel traversed through the Barzaman and Fars formation with an overburden of 33 m with maximum water pressure of 4.4 bar and was excavated by EPB TBMs. This project is characterized by its dimensions with an internal diameter of 10 m and 350 mm of segment thickness, and by the use of steel fibre reinforced concrete in the precast segmental lining. The use of fibres aims to reduce the CO2 footprint obtaining an optimized design from the environmental point of view. These facts are associated to a complex design of precast segments, in order to ensure their structural competence and their integrity according to the durability requirements, under large thrust forces (temporary loads) and permanent load. Hence, considering such complexities, the structural design has been carried out producing a 3D structural model by means of a sophisticated FEM structural software. Results of the model allow to identify areas of the segment where spalling and bursting stresses are generated along circumferential joints and maximum value of those stresses in the temporary load cases. Moreover, a structural design verification of the segment has been undertaken considering the contribution of steel fibres class 4c, as it is set up in the FIB model code, aiming to ensure that the precast segments are structurally competent and fulfil the durability requirements of the Project. The article details the design approach and the independent checker design verification approach. The experience gained during construction is also reported, describing challenging aspects of the Tunnel execution and an analysis of the lining damages. © 2021 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.

In order to explore the dominant contributions of SOA formation from VOCs in central China, 53 VOC species were observed with proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and canister grab samples in Xinxiang, a mid-sized city located in Henan Province, from November 5th to December 3rd, 2018. The result showed that anthropogenic emissions were intensive compared with many studies in the world. Among the observed VOCs, benzene and toluene had the largest SOA formation potential (SOAFP), and their contributions in SOA formation kept stable with the aggravation of pollution. Among VOCs, formaldehyde was the strongest radical contributor, and the contribution of acetaldehyde was also found significant in this study, especially in polluted periods. Based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, benzenoids (mainly single-ring aromatics) were majorly emitted from chemical process, solvent evaporation, and residential heating, with a total fraction of 75%, and these sources were estimated to have largest SOAFP. However, thermal power generation, chemical process, and solvent evaporation had highest radical contribution rates. According to the backward trajectory analysis, the VOC concentrations were dominated by local emissions. Emissions in the surrounding provinces occupied fractions of 33%–42% in the five sources. Therefore, regional collaborative emission reduction is also important. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Photochemistry; Photolysis; SOA; Source apportionment; VOC","Emission control; Evaporation; Factorization; Mass spectrometry; Photolysis; Proton transfer; Chemical process; Chinese cities; Dual role; Formation potential; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Organic aerosol formation; Secondary organic aerosol; Solvent evaporation; Source apportionment; Volatile organics; Volatile organic compounds; acetaldehyde; aromatic compound; volatile organic compound; aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; autumn; emission control; evaporation; organic compound; photochemistry; photolysis; source apportionment; volatile organic compound; Article; autumn; chemical reaction; China; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); heating; oxidation; priority journal; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; secondary organic aerosol; China; Henan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103938758

However, little is known about the long-term performance of plants in a Dwa climate (in the Köppen climate classification). This study follows the performance of 10 Crassulacean species (four species of Phedimus and six of Sedum) grown at four substrate depths (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) over eight years on an unirrigated roof in Beijing, China. We found that the climate in Beijing, particularly the specific distribution of precipitation, had a substantial influence on plant growth and the community dynamics on extensive green roofs, and the dry and cold winters were the main factors that affected the plant survival on unirrigated green roofs. In such a climate, species with rootstocks or thickened fibrous roots performed better than species with entirely fibrous roots. Although deeper levels of substrate promoted better plant survival and performance, the species richness at all four depths continued to decrease. By the end of this research, only Phedimus aizoon and Phedimus floriferus ‘Weihenstephaner Gold’ still survived, and Phedimus aizoon was the only species that was alive at all of the four substrate depths. This research emphasized the importance of long-term research. The results of this study also revealed that the substrate moisture content was a more important factor than the substrate depth on the survival of plants over winter. To increase the rate of survival of plants on extensive green roofs over winter in Beijing, we advise the provision of supplementary irrigation before winter in years when the plants have experienced a dry autumn. © 2021","Dwa climate; Irrigation; Long-term research; Phedimus; Precipitation pattern; Sedum","community dynamics; greenspace; growth; long-term change; moisture content; plant community; succession; Beijing [China]; China; Phedimus; Phedimus aizoon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107034900

However, due to their complex structure, it is difficult to explore their fluorescence emission mechanism and application mechanism. In this work, GQDs with simple structure were prepared using citric acid as a single precursor. The fluorescence properties and structure of GQDs were characterized, and the results confirmed that their luminescence originated from the n → π* electronic transition produced by the oxygen-containing functional groups in the edge state. Significantly, GQDs can be used as excellent probes to detect Hg2+ and ClO− in aqueous solution. Hg2+ combines with the carboxyl groups of the edge states of GQDs to form a complex, and then reduces the fluorescence emission through non-radiative electron transfer. ClO− can oxidize the hydroxyl groups in the edge states of GQDs to make them positively charged, which prevents electron transfer related to the luminescent center and reduces fluorescence emission. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Citric acid; Edge state; Electron transfer; Fluorescence mechanism; Graphene quantum dots; Ion detection","Citric acid; Electron transitions; Graphene; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Carbon material; Complexes structure; Detection mechanism; Edge state; Electron transfer; Emission mechanism; Fluorescence emission; Fluorescence mechanism; Ion detection; Simple structures; Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106486005

The objectives were to compare fertilizer P and K rate recommendations, to look for opportunities to rationalize similar recommendations across state lines, and to examine challenges to the development of a cooperative regional approach to P and K recommendations. Mehlich-3 (eight states), Mehlich-1 (five states), or Lancaster (one state) extractions were the basis of plant available soil P (STP) and K (STK) assessment. Fertilizer recommendation philosophies (sufficiency, build and maintain, and/or hybrid) variation among the states might be the main reason behind such discrepancies. Although a few similarities in P and K rate recommendations were found, the different philosophies, numerical presentations, and extraction procedures drove important recommendation differences. Widespread adoption of the Mehlich-3 extraction procedure has not reduced variation in fertilizer P and K rate recommendations among the states. Instead, for states using Mehlich 3, soil test critical concentrations ranged from 30 to 75 mg P kg–1 and 60 to 175 mg K kg–1 for corn (Zea mays L.) grain and warm-season grass hay production. The adoption of uniform soil testing terminology, sample collection guidelines, extraction methods, and interpretations across common physiographic regions, soils, and state lines remains a challenge. Differences arise because of the different soil orders and properties, climate conditions, and resulting crop responses to added P and K fertilizers. Such differences in soil-test-based fertilizer P and K recommendations are state specific and highlight needs to examine the soil testing and recommendation process, make soil test results end-user friendly, and, when appropriate, standardize fundamental information used in the soil testing guidelines. © 2021 The Authors.

We have since realized that we made errors when calculating the ILCR values of PAHs due to the inappropriate parameter and unit conversion. Hereby, with sincere apologies, we have made the following corrections: On page 3, in Section 2.5, below the Eq. 3, “where CS is the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) of PAHs in soils” has been revised to “where CS is the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ, mg/kg) of PAHs in soils”; “and the value of CSFingestion, CSFdermal and CSFinhalation are 1.0 (mg/kg/d)−1, 25.0 (mg/kg/d)−1, and 3.85 (mg/kg/d)−1, respectively” has been corrected to “and the value of CSFingestion, CSFdermal and CSFinhalation are 7.3 kg/mg/d, 25.0 kg/mg/d, 3.85 kg/mg/d, respectively”. On page 6, in Section 3.5, these sentences “As shown in Fig. 6, the total ILCR levels ranged from 3.52 × 10−4 to 2.00 × 10−2, and from 3.27 × 10−4 to 2.43 × 10−3 for children and adults, respectively, both of which were much higher than 10−4 at all sampling sites. This suggested that PAH exposure caused a rather high risk for residents, and children were more vulnerable to the exposure risk of PAHs” have been corrected to “As shown in Fig. 6, the total ILCR levels ranged from 7.05 × 10−8 to 4.00 × 10−6, and from 5.69 × 10−8 to 3.22 × 10−6 for children and adults, respectively. Of all sampling sites, 17.0% and 6.4% bore the potential risk (ILCRs &gt; 10−6) but not high risk (ILCRs &lt; 10−4) for children and adults, respectively, and children were more vulnerable to the exposure risk of PAHs”; “In addition, ILCRsDermal were much higher than ILCRsIngestion and ILCRsInhalation, indicating that the dermal absorption was the most important route of exposure to residents in this area” has been corrected to “In addition, ILCRDermal and ILCRIngestion were much higher than ILCRInhalation, indicating the dermal absorption and ingestion were the main routes of exposure to residents in this area”; “Although there were only four sites with results over the level of heavily contaminated (S23, S33, S34 and S35), the potentially high carcinogenic risk was found at every sampling site, mainly due to the relatively high concentration of carcinogenic PAHs. These results suggested that the high carcinogenic possibility in this area requires much more attention” has been corrected to “Though sites S33, S34, and S35 had the highest total PAH concentration (Fig. 2 A), S23 suffered the highest risk due to its high concentration of carcinogenic PAHs. These results suggested that soil PAHs in this area posed a carcinogenic risk from negligible to potential”. The original Fig. 6 and Table S4 have been corrected as below. With the correction of the risk assessment, the statements in Abstract and Conclusions have been corrected correspondingly. On the first page, in Abstract, these sentences “The estimated values of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for children and adults were higher than 10−4 at all sampling sites, suggesting high carcinogenic risks for local residents, and the most important exposure route for PAHs was dermal absorption. These findings are valuable for assessing the health risk of PAHs in soils around typical coal mine and coal-fired power plants and highlight the urgency of taking actions to control and reduce the carcinogenic risks for local residents” have been corrected to “Considering all sampling site, 17.0% and 6.4% had estimated values of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) exceeding 10−6 for children and adults, respectively, and the main exposure routes were dermal absorption and ingestion. These findings are valuable for assessing the health risk of PAHs in soils around typical coal mine and coal-fired power plants”. On page 8, in Conclusions, these sentences “Although only 8.5% of sampling sites were heavily contaminated (&gt; 1000 ng/g), due to the relatively high concentration of carcinogenic PAHs, the total values of ILCRs at all sites were over 10−4. This suggested that the local residents are threatened by the highly carcinogenic risk of PAHs, mainly through dermal contact. Overall, this work highlights the concern of carcinogenic risk by PAHs in soils around coal mine and coal-fired power plants, and immediate actions should be taken to reduce the risk of human exposure to harmful PAHs. For example, improve the coal mining technology and equipment to reduce pollution emissions. Meanwhile, efficient and environmentally friendly materials are urgently required to remediate the PAH pollution in soil” have been corrected to “Of all sampling sites, 8.5% was heavily contaminated (&gt; 1000 ng/g), and 17.0% and 6.4% had the total values of ILCRs over 10−6 for children and adults, respectively. This suggests that the local residents are threatened by the potential risk of PAHs, mainly through dermal contact and ingestion.

Spatiotemporally continuous satellite-derived SM information is urgently needed for large-scale meteorological and hydrological applications. This study proposes the application of a spatial gap-filling method using an artificial neural network (ANN) to reconstruct missing records of daily surface SM from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI) in the growing seasons of 1982–2015 across China. Ten environmental variables were taken into consideration, including meteorological forcing, geographic and topographic features, vegetation conditions, and soil texture. The ANN-reconstructed SM and RF-reconstructed SM were validated using the ground-based observations and three global reanalysis SM datasets. The gap-filling results by the ANN model were compared to that by the original kriging (OK) model under three simulation scenarios: SM images with removed swaths, varying vegetation densities, and different percentages of data gaps. The results showed that the ANN-reconstructed SM was in good agreement with in-situ SM observations, with the CC more than 0.607 and the RMSE less than 0.074 m3/m3 over the northwestern and eastern parts of China. Compared with the original ESA CCI SM, the ANN model performed better than the OK model in reconstructing SM with absent swaths and in densely and sparsely vegetated regions. Specifically, the ANN-reconstructed SM provided a higher estimation accuracy in regions with low-density vegetation than in those with high-density vegetation. The weaker performance may due to the complex interactions between surface SM and various environmental variables underneath the dense vegetation. In addition, the ANN model significantly outperformed the OK model by accurately estimating SM when the percentage of data gaps succeeded 40%. Our study is valuable for providing an alternative reference to reconstruct satellite-derived SM and highlights the potential of using the ANN model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; ESA CCI; Original kriging; Reconstruction; Soil moisture","Application programs; Climate change; Image reconstruction; Interpolation; Neural networks; Satellites; Textures; Vegetation; %moisture; Artificial neural network models; Environmental variables; ESA CCI; Gap filling; Kriging model; Neural-networks; Original kriging; Reconstruction; Surface soil moisture; Soil moisture; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; environmental conditions; kriging; reconstruction; satellite data; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; article; artificial neural network; China; climate change; growing season; kriging; simulation; soil moisture; soil texture; surface soil; vegetation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103971549

However, most previous driving cycles, which were developed at the city scale or even national scale, cannot resolve the emission variations affected by road types and thus might introduce large uncertainties in the emission estimation. In this study, we proposed a new approach based on road type-based (RT-based) driving cycles to improve the estimation of vehicle emissions. As a case study, RT-based driving cycles for passenger cars were developed using more than 600,000 s of GPS data collected through on-road tests in Guangzhou. Results showed that driving cycles varied across road types (urban arterial road, highway, and other urban road), which featured varied velocities, acceleration, deceleration, and driving mode percentages. The urban arterial road had the lowest velocity (18.7 km/h), but the largest creeping mode proportion (61%). The other urban road had the largest acceleration and deceleration, while the highway had the highest average velocity (43.2 km/h) but the lowest acceleration and deceleration. Evaluations revealed that RT-based driving cycles could accurately depict separate driving patterns and emission factors on different road types. In comparison, city-level driving cycles and standard driving cycles typically overestimated emission factors of highways but underestimated those of other road types in Guangzhou. Consequently, emissions of light-duty gasoline passenger cars could be underestimated by 33% in the downtown and overestimated by approximately 25% in and around the highways. This study highlights the development of RT-based driving cycles to accurately estimate vehicle emissions and characterize their spatial variations. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Driving cycle; Emission inventory; Micro-trip method; Passenger car",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110749028

The temperature fluctuation associated with climate change is often considered as a primary driving force of electricity consumption. To better explore the impact of temperature on electricity consumption, this paper aims to analyze the question from the perspective of income growth, i.e., the moderating effect of income growth on the response of urban residential electricity to temperature changes. Using the unbalanced panel data of 23 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration from 2004 to 2015, we construct the response model of residential electricity consumption to income growth, heating degree days, cooling degree days and their interactions. The results show that heating demand, cooling demand and income growth significantly increase residential energy consumption. However, urban residential disposable income growth weakens the positive effect of heating demand and cooling demand on residential electricity consumption. Because, urban residents have obvious demand for improving indoor heating comfort and cooling comfort, the moderating effect of income is shown as the crowding-out effect. Residents may adjust the structure of heating energy consumption (from electricity to natural gas) and upgrade their electrical equipment to high energy efficiency equipment, thereby reducing residential electricity consumption. This study also indicates that urban residential energy consumption is very sensitive to changes in permanent populations.

Based on the work of Zhang, a regional CO2 flux inversion system capable of assimilating the column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) retrieved from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations had been developed. To evaluate the system, under the constraints of the initial state and boundary conditions extracted from the CarbonTracker 2017 product (CT2017), the annual CO2 flux over the contiguous United States in 2016 was inverted (1.08 Pg C yr−1 ) and compared with the corresponding posterior CO2 fluxes extracted from OCO-2 model intercom-parison project (OCO-2 MIP) (mean: 0.76 Pg C yr−1, standard deviation: 0.29 Pg C yr−1, 9 models in total) and CT2017 (1.19 Pg C yr−1 ). The uncertainty of the inverted CO2 flux was reduced by 14.71% compared to the prior flux. The annual mean XCO2 estimated by the inversion system was 403.67 ppm, which was 0.11 ppm smaller than the result (403.78 ppm) simulated by a parallel experiment without assimilating the OCO-2 retrievals and closer to the result of CT2017 (403.29 ppm). Independent CO2 flux and concentration measurements from towers, aircraft, and Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) were used to evaluate the results. Mean bias error (MBE) between the inverted CO2 flux and flux measurements was 0.73 g C m−2 d−1, was reduced by 22.34% and 28.43% compared to those of the prior flux and CT2017, respectively. MBEs between the CO2 concentrations estimated by the inversion system and concentration measurements from TCCON, towers, and aircraft were reduced by 52.78%, 96.45%, and 75%, respectively, compared to those of the parallel experiment. The experiment proved that CO2 emission hotspots indicated by the inverted annual CO2 flux with a relatively high spatial resolution of 50 km consisted well with the locations of most major metropolitan/urban areas in the contiguous United States, which demonstrated the potential of combing satellite observations with high spatial resolution CO2 flux inversion system in supporting the global stocktake. © 2021 by the authors.

Evidence from these formations suggests that glauconite is commonly diagenetically converted to carbonate minerals such as siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite. This process represents a natural CO2 sink that may provide an effective mechanism for the engineered mineralization of anthropogenic CO2. To evaluate glauconite carbonation reactions and improve our understanding of glauconite diagenesis, we performed a detailed evaluation of the mechanisms through which carbonate minerals naturally replace glauconite during diagenesis of glauconitic sandstones from the Lower Cretaceous Upper Mannville Group in western Alberta, Canada. Using a combination of optical microscopy and scanning electron imaging, electron microprobe and bulk geochemical analyses, and X-ray fluorescence mapping, we show glauconite carbonation in the Mannville group is an reduction-facilitated, coupled glauconite recrystallization and siderite precipitation reaction. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopic mapping and spot analyses demonstrate that this reaction is accompanied by a significant shift in the oxidation state of Fe, from dominantly oxidized in glauconite to reduced in carbonate reaction products. Together, these results suggest that geochemical conditions - most importantly, temperature, partial pressure of CO2, and fluid redox state - were thermodynamically favorable for glauconite carbonation during burial diagenesis of Mannville Group sandstones. Results of thermodynamic models illustrate that, although K-feldspar is favored to precipitate during reductive glauconite dissolution and accompanying Fe-carbonate precipitation, its precipitation is likely kinetically limited, and that an Fe-impoverished glauconite is expected to recrystallize instead. Our findings show that glauconite carbonation is likely a common phenomenon in the subsurface, and thus that glauconite is potentially a significant cation source for mineralizing anthropogenic CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage; Diagenesis; Glauconite; Iron redox states; Mineral carbonation; Siderite; Thermodynamic modelling; XANES","carbon sequestration; Cretaceous; diagenesis; geochemistry; glauconite; iron; mineralization; redox conditions; siderite; thermodynamics; XANES spectroscopy; Alberta; Canada; Alberta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107578754

In this study we provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art on GHG emission characterizations of China's urban water infrastructure with the aim of shedding light on global implications for sustainable development. We started by synthesizing a framework on GHG emissions associated with water and wastewater infrastructure. Then we analyzed the different sources of GHG emissions in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. In drinking water services, electricity consumption is the largest source of GHG emissions. A particular concern in China is the common use of secondary pumping for high-rise buildings. Optimized pressure management with an efficient pumping system should be prioritized. In wastewater services, non-CO2 emissions such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are substantial, but vary greatly depending on regional and technological differences. Further research directions may include GHG inventory development for urban water systems at the plant level, quantifications of GHG emissions from sewer systems, emission reduction measures via water reclamation, renewable energy recovery, energy efficiency improvement, cost–benefit analyses, and characterizations of Scope 3 emissions.

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast-matching method has been employed to quantify the possible gas confinement in macro-/meso-/micropores on high-rank anthracite with the forms of powder and thin sections. Model-free and data-fitting methods were used to estimate the hierarchical scattering contrast, the absolute difference between the scattering length densities (SLDs) of the solid matrix and fluid in pores, under different pressure and gas injection conditions. The scattering contrast generally reduces in macro-/mesopores but increases in micropores as the pressure increases during CD4 injection, suggesting a high degree of densification of methane in micropores. However, the cases for CO2 injection are complex, which could be because of multiple factors, including matrix compression and sorption-induced swelling, pore accessibility, the structure of the confined fluid, and the local structure of the matrix. This study uniquely differentiates the gas confinement in macro-/meso-/micropores of high-rank coal based on the model-free method considering pore accessibility effect and data-fitting method with and without considering effects of polydispersity and background. Care should be made to estimate scattering background, which influences estimating the scattering contrast in micropores based on the data-fitting method. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Coal; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Data handling; Digital storage; Gas adsorption; Matrix algebra; Microporosity; Partial discharges; Underground gas storage; Absolute difference; Data fitting method; Degree of densification; Different pressures; Injection conditions; Scattering background; Scattering contrast; Scattering length density; Neutron scattering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112720369

However, most of the relevant studies have focused on the impact of single meteorological factors, the influencing mechanism of comprehensive meteorological factors, i.e., climate, on PM filtration by plants remains unclear. Coupled with the i-Tree model, we established a multi-cycle PM removal (PMR) model with the focus on the impact of wind and precipitations on the PM filtration function of plants, so as to inform the suitability of different climates for green space creation. Interactions between relevant parameters were analyzed through simulation. It was found that the PM capture threshold of plants and the time required to reach this threshold both decreased with wind speed (V). The PMR performance of plants increased and then decreased with V, and the optimal V decreased with increasing precipitation interval (T). The performance of different climates in PMR could be ranked as: short T & high V > short T & low V > long T & low V > long T & high V. Within areas characterized by a long T, it is suitable to create green spaces in the places where V is relatively low and with the pattern of large patches and high-density to reduce plants’ exposure V. Additionally, the relative magnitudes of the PMR of different plant species may change with V or T; species selection should match the regional climate. This study can help to clarify the influencing mechanism of climate factors on the PMR performance of plants and provides guidance for creating green spaces for PM control under different climate regimes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green space creation; i-Tree model; Plant species selection; Precipitation interval; Wind speed","Climate change; Climate models; Forestry; Particles (particulate matter); Airborne particulate matters; Climate factors; Green space creation; Green spaces; I-tree model; Particulate Matter; Plant species selection; PM removal; Precipitation interval; Wind speed; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106360917

As an emerging mode of urban low-carbon transportation in China, shared bicycles have been used by more and more citizens on a daily basis, with advantages of green and low-carbon emissions to environment, flexibility for short trips, and convenience for covering the distance between the normal low-carbon transportation and destinations. However, the imbalanced distribution of shared bicycles along subway lines, especially during the morning peak hours, has directly restricted their performance in urban traffic. In this paper, an integer linear program model (ILPM) is proposed to obtain an optimal low-carbon distribution plan of shared bicycles connecting with the subway line (SBCSL) during the morning peak hours. First, an objective function is built to improve the carbon emission reduction of SBCSL. Second, constraint functions are extracted considering the quantity of bicycles to be distributed to the subway line as well as the distribution limits of each subway station. At last, a case study is conducted on the distribution of shared bicycles in Beijing Subway Line 13 of China during the morning peak hours. The results show that the ILPM is of significance to provide optimal distribution scheme of shared bicycles in subway line with different station types including office-oriented, residential-oriented, and hybrid-oriented stations. © 2021 by the authors.

For selective hydrogenation of formate esters to methanol, it is crucial to understand how the interaction between metal catalyst and support affects catalytic performance. In this paper, ZrO2 was employed as the support to promote the Cu catalysts’ activity and selectivity in liquid-phase hydrogenation of ethyl formate. To maximize the production yield of methanol, various catalyst properties and reaction condition were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, i.e., 160 °C and 400 psi H2, ∼ 53 % of methanol were yielded from the hydrogenation of ethyl formate in anhydrous ethanol solvent over the 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. The calcination temperature in the catalyst synthesis had profound effects on the Cu valence states, the structure of the ZrO2 support, and the interactions between Cu and ZrO2. A variety of characterization tools, including XRD, XPS, and HRTEM, were used to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. These findings will facilitate the next-generation catalyst design and elucidate the synergistic interaction between Cu and ZrO2 that promotes ester hydrogenation reactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Copper; Ethyl formate; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Zirconia","Catalyst selectivity; Copper metallography; Esters; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Organic solvents; Zirconia; Calcination temperature; Catalytic performance; Characterization tools; Liquid-phase hydrogenation; Optimized conditions; Selective hydrogenation; Structure activity relationships; Synergistic interaction; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100683475

It is found that the climate change driven by orbital cycle controls the fluctuations of sea level at different scales, obliquity forcing climate changes drive thermohaline circulation (THC) of the ocean, and THC-induced bottom currents transport nutrient-laden water from high latitude regions to the surface water of low-latitude area. Hence, THC is the main dynamic mechanism of organic-carbon supply. The marine productivity indexes of Ba/Al and Ni/Al indicate that volcanic activities had limited effect on marine productivity but had great influences on organic carbon preservation efficiency in late Hirnantian (E4). Paleo-ocean redox environmental indicators Th/U, V/Cr and V/(V+Ni) show that there is a significant correlation between volcanism and oxygen content in Paleo-ocean, so it is inferred that volcanisms controlled the organic carbon preservation efficiency by regulating oxygen content in Paleo-ocean, and the difference in volcanism intensity in different areas is an important factor for the differential preservation efficiency of organic carbon. The organic carbon input driven by orbital cycle and the preservation efficiency affected by volcanisms worked together to control the enrichment of organic carbon in the Middle–Upper Yangtze region. © 2021 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina","cyclostratigraphy; geochemical weathering index; Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation; organic carbon accumulation; thermohaline circulation; Upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation; volcanic activity","chemical weathering; cyclostratigraphy; depositional environment; geochemical method; Ordovician-Silurian boundary; organic carbon; outcrop; sediment transport; thermohaline circulation; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112840913

By the end of November 2020, 82.84% of all buses in Beijing had switched to electric vehicles. A solution to the problem of charging a huge number of battery electric buses (BEBs) in urban areas, especially in crowded cities with large populations, has to be found. In the present paper, a calculation model based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is established for comparison and analysis of the BEB charging. The calculation results show that the hybrid charging mode is economically feasible. Moreover, from the perspectives of optimizing operation shifts and responding to emergency situations, hybrid charging mode is applicable to the current electric bus system. The calculation results also show that the use of BEBs as the main ground public transportation in Beijing can substantially reduce CO2 emissions and save huge fuel costs. Its application is a very wise choice. The analogy calculation on Tongzhou District, the sub center of Beijing which is under construction, shows that the use of BEBs in Tongzhou can reduce CO2 emissions by about 34.6% on average compared with fuel buses. The population is the main influencing factor of analogy calculation. © 2021 The Authors","Battery electric bus; Beijing city; Carbon dioxide emission; Charging system; Energy consumption; Tongzhou district","Battery electric vehicles; Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Energy utilization; Global warming; Secondary batteries; Calculation models; Calculation results; Carbon dioxide emissions; Charging systems; Comparison and analysis; Emergency situation; Levelized cost of electricities; Public transportation; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108894420

This paper analyzes the embodied CO2 transfer across sectors of 13 cities in Jing-Jin-Ji region (Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei in China) combining multi-regional input–output analysis with complex network analysis. The results show that (1) most embodied CO2 transfers are concentrated in a few sectors and emission reduction effects on these sectors can be quickly extended to the entire embodied CO2 transfer network (ECTN). (2) The electricity and hot water production and supply sector in Beijing have the most embodied CO2 export partners and the strongest control over embodied CO2 transfer. The construction sector in Beijing has the most embodied CO2 import partners and greatest influence on the ECTN. (3) At city level, 90% of embodied CO2 transfers occur within the city, and the general direction of embodied CO2 transfer across cities is from resource-rich cities, Tangshan and Handan, to developed cities, Beijing and Tianjin. At sector level, the largest embodied CO2 transfer path is electricity and hot water production and supply → metallurgy → construction sector.

This paper employs ARDL-ECM and Toda-Yamamoto causality to investigate the relationship between renewable energy, non-renewable energy, carbon emissions, economic growth, gross fixed capital formation, and urban population spanning the period 1960–2019 in China. The examined results of ARDL-ECM indicate that renewable energy both have positive impact on GDP in the short term and long term but non-renewable energy only have positive impact on GDP in the short term. Additionally, based on Toda-Yamamoto causality, this paper finds a unidirectional Granger causality running from economic growth to energy consumption and from energy consumption to carbon emissions. And there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to non-renewable energy consumption. It is worth noting that renewable energy consumption and economic growth have positive bidirectional influence on each other. The study findings suggest that stricter energy conservation and pollution emission reduction policy should be implemented and renewable energy should be applied on a larger scale in order to achieve the goal of sustainable economic development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ARDL; Carbon emissions; Economic growth; Non-renewable energy consumption; Renewable energy consumption; Toda-Yamamoto causality","carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; energy conservation; energy efficiency; Gross Domestic Product; spatiotemporal analysis; urban population; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; renewable energy; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103220942

The impacts of domestic shipping can affect different populations, and domestic and international shipping emissions are governed under different regulatory systems. Thus, a consistent global analysis comparing the health impacts from domestic and international shipping could inform policy making in attempts to coordinate policies across multiple scales to address the health burden of shipping emissions. In this study, we create bottom-up global ship emission inventories based on ship activity records from the automatic identification system, and then apply the GEOS-Chem atmospheric model and global exposure mortality model to quanitfy shipping-related PM2.5-concentrations and associated mortalities. We also quantify the public health benefits under different control scenarios including the 2020 0.5% sulphur cap, a post-2020 0.1% sulphur cap, and a post-2020 Tier III NO x standard. We find that 94 200 (95% confidence interval: 84 800-103 000) premature deaths were associated with PM2.5 exposure due to maritime shipping in 2015, of which 83% were associated with international shipping activities and 17% with domestic shipping. Although the global health burdens of ship emissions are dominated by international shipping, the fraction varies by region: 44% of shipping-related premature deaths in China come from domestic shipping activities. We estimate about 30 200 (27 200-33 000) avoided premature deaths per year under a scenario consistent with a 2020 0.5% sulphur cap. We find that a post-2020 Tier III NO x standard would have greater benefits than a post-2020 0.1% sulphur cap, with the two policies reducing annual shipping-attributable PM2.5-related premature deaths by 33 300 (30 100-36 400) and 5070 (4560-5540), respectively. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite attempts to restrict the utilization of fossil energy and advancing technology for cleaner production, there has been little discussion on the determinants of change in carbon emissions for future scenarios and planning energy systems according to the analysis of low carbon development. In this study, a comprehensive energy optimization planning framework under a low-carbon mode is established. A framework based on the gray model (GM) and logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method are constructed to predict the emission mitigation potential and decompose the carbon emission driving factors. The decomposition results are key input prerequisites for the following energy optimization model: An interval parameter multiple-objective programming (IPMOP) optimization model, which is developed to support regional energy system administration by seeking the trade-offs among economic development, energy utilization, and environmental protection under multiple uncertainties. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applied to a case study in Guangdong, China. The results reveal that (a) the clean production effect (GDP per unit of atmospheric pollutants emission) would become the primary positive force for carbon emission increase, and the pollutant reduction effect (total atmospheric pollutants emission) would play the primary negative role; (b) the coal-dominated energy structure in Guangdong is expected to be transformed to a petroleum-dominated energy structure; (c) the GDP in Guangdong would steadily increase over time, but the pace of economic growth will decelerate, and the annual average growth rate of GDP for the coming fifteen years will be [3.67%, 4.26%]. This study provides a new pathway for policymakers to identify the determinants of carbon emission increase and to generate optimal solutions on a regional scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Driving factors; Energy optimization model; LMDI; Multiple-objective programming; Uncertainties","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Growth rate; Multiobjective optimization; Carbon emissions; Case-studies; Driving factors; Energy; Energy optimization; Energy optimization model; Energy systems; Logarithmic mean divisia index; Multiple objective programming; Uncertainty; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105796878

The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fast-growing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016–2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016–2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016–2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Downscaling; Forest disturbance; Landsat and Sentinel-2; Small-scale clearing","Deep learning; Forestry; Image enhancement; Vegetation; Deep learning; Down-scaling; Fine resolution; Forest disturbances; LANDSAT; Landsat and sentinel-2; Ratio images; Small scale; Small-scale clearing; Tropical forest; Tropics; carbon cycle; forest ecosystem; forest management; Landsat; NDVI; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; tracking; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105065462

However, related biophysical feedback to climate is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the biophysical impact of changes in forest age on surface temperature and illustrate the mechanisms underlying such temperature differences. To this end, we use data from five paired evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) eddy covariance towers in North America. Results show that older ENF is 1.7 K cooler than younger ENF at annual scale. The latent and sensible heat fluxes of older forests dominate an average cooling effect of −1.9 K, which counteracts albedo-driven warming (+2.3 K). Additional warming effect is further offset by emissivity (−1.1 K) and incoming radiation (−0.5 K). Our results confirm that considering forest age may facilitate improved forest management to local climate mitigation and adaptation in future climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biophysical effect; Energy balance; Forest age; Forest management; Surface temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Biophysics; Climate change; Energy balance; Forestry; Biophysical effect; Climate impacts; Different ages; Energy; Forest age; Forest age structures; High Latitudes; Midlatitudes; Natural disturbance; Surface temperatures; Surface properties; anthropogenic effect; biophysics; climate effect; forest ecosystem; latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; temperature gradient; Energy Balance; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests; Impact; North America; Surface Properties; Temperature; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105475279

In order to monitor the transient voltage process occurring in UHV GIL during operation, this paper constructs a transient voltage ultra-wideband (UWB) online monitoring system based on capacitive voltage division. This system has been applied in an 1100 kilovolt (kV) GIL utility tunnel project. It can be used to analyze the characteristics of the recorded transient voltage waveforms for distinguishing different types of insulation failure. In this paper, through the case studies in time domain and time–frequency domain, the case of SF6 gap breakdown and that of post insulator flashover have differentiated characteristics in instantaneous frequency. Additionally, a case of secondary discharge is successfully estimated through the time–frequency distribution of the transient voltage.

A material handling system is an essential component of a modern manufacturing system, and its energy consumption (EC) is a non-negligible part when evaluating the total production EC. As typical transport equipment, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been widely applied in various types of manufacturing workshops. Correspondingly, AGV path planning is usually a multi-objective optimization problem, and closely related to the workshop logistics efficiency and the smoothness of the whole manufacturing process. However, the optimization objectives that current AGV path planning research mostly focuses on are transport distance, time, and cost, while EC or EC-related environmental impact indicators are seldom touched on. To address this, an investigation into the energy-saving oriented path planning is executed for a single-load AGV in a discrete manufacturing workshop environment. Based on the analysis of AGV EC characteristics from the perspective of motion state and vehicle structure, transport distance and EC are selected as two optimization objectives, and an energy-efficient AGV path planning (EAPP) model is formulated. Further, two solution methods, i.e., the two-stage solution method and the particle swarm optimization-based method, are put forward to solve the established model. Moreover, the experimental study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution methods and indicates that transport task execution order has a significant impact on AGV transport EC. © 2021","Energy consumption; Multi-objective optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Path planning; Single-load automated guided vehicle","Automatic guided vehicles; Automation; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Manufacture; Materials handling; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sustainable development; Automated guided vehicles; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Single-load automated guided vehicle; Solution methods; Swarm optimization; Vehicle path planning; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111859372

According to a rough estimate in this paper, carbon emissions caused by express parcel transportation in China account for 1/7 of the transportation sector’s carbon emissions. However, considering the possibility of a scale effect, it is unclear whether the express delivery industry’s development will inevitably lead to more carbon emissions. Therefore, this paper uses the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2008 to 2017 to explore the complex relationship between the express delivery industry’s development and the transportation sector’s carbon emissions, and also conducts regional heterogeneity analysis. The main findings are as follows: (1) There is a significant U-shaped relationship between per capita express delivery amounts and the transportation sector’s CO2 emissions, especially in the Central region. (2) At the national level, the number of per capita postal outlets significantly promotes the transportation sector’s CO2 emissions. (3) The impact caused by the number of per capita postal workers varies regionally. Increasing postal worker numbers in the Western region can significantly reduce carbon emissions, while the result in the Central region is the opposite. (4) The Express Comprehensive Development Index (ECDI) has a significant U-shaped effect on the transportation sector’s carbon emissions at the national and sub-regional level. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the major stumbling blocks such as poor product selectivity, low yield of the multi-carbon products, and serious recombination of electron-hole pairs hinder practical application of photocatalysts. Herein, a high-performance Bi@Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst, Bi nanoparticles grown on the surface of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies, was fabricated via a simple solvothermal approach. Benefiting from the abundant active sites and effective separation of photogenerated carriers of Bi2MoO6 nanosheets, and the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi nanoparticles, the Bi@Bi2MoO6 sample exhibited great photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Furthermore, adding NaHCO3 into the system not only significantly increased the C2H5OH generation rate but also enhanced the product selectivity. In the photocatalytic measurement (0.17 mol L−1 CO2-saturated NaHCO3 solution), the highest formation rates of CO, CH3OH, and C2H5OH were reached at 0.85, 0.59, and 17.93 μmol g−1 h−1 (≈92 % selectivity), respectively. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","bicarbonate; catalysis; nanoparticles; photocatalytic CO2 reduction; synergistic effect","Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Greenhouse effect; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Photocatalytic activity; Plasmons; Sodium bicarbonate; Surface plasmon resonance; Carbon products; Electron hole pairs; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photogenerated carriers; Product selectivities; Selective production; Solvothermal approach; Stumbling blocks; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109362513

Forests play increasing significant roles in regulating global carbon balance and mitigating climate change. Therefore, to understand the response mechanisms of the carbon budget of global forest ecosystems to future climate change, an improved version of the FORest ecosystem Carbon budget model for CHiNa (FORCCHN) and future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were applied in this study. The results demonstrated that the global forest ecosystems will play a major role in the carbon sink under the future two climate change scenarios. In particular, the average carbon budget of global forest ecosystems under RCP4.5 scenario was estimated to be 0.017 kg(C)·m−2·yr−1 from 2007 to 2100. The future carbon sink areas of global forest ecosystems will increase significantly. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, the carbon sink areas of global forest ecosystems during 2026–2100 would be significantly been expanded than those in 2007–2025, with increases of 83.16–87.26% and 23.53–29.70%, respectively. The impacts of future climate change on carbon budget of global forest ecosystems will significantly vary between different regions. The carbon budget of forests will be enhanced in the northern hemisphere and significantly weakened in the southern hemisphere under the future two climate change scenarios. The carbon sink regions of global forests will be mainly distributed in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. In particular, the forests' carbon budget in northeastern and central Asia, northern Europe and western North America will increase by 40% ~ 80%. However, the carbon budget of forests will decrease by 20% ~ 40% in the most regions of the southern hemisphere. In northern South America and central Africa, the forests' carbon budget will be reduced by more than 40%. In the future, in some areas of southern hemisphere, where the forests' carbon budget was predicted to be reduced, some measures for improving forest carbon sink, such as strengthening forest tending, enforcing prohibiting deforestation laws and scientific forest management, and so on, should be implemented to ensure immediate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon budget; Future climate change; Global forest ecosystems; Model; Remote sensing; Response","Budget control; Carbon; Climate models; Deforestation; Global warming; Remote sensing; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change scenarios; Ecological environments; Forest carbon sinks; Impact assessments; Northern Hemispheres; Response mechanisms; Southern Hemisphere; Ecosystems; carbon balance; carbon budget; climate change; climate effect; deforestation; environmental impact assessment; forest ecosystem; future prospect; global warming; law enforcement; mitigation; numerical model; remote sensing; Southern Hemisphere; Central Asia; North America; Northern Europe; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107771767

From the perspective of industrialization, the “Belt and Road” can be regarded as a “spillover” effect of the industrialization process in China. With the spatial shift of Chinese industries along the “Belt and Road” and their clustering in Silk Road cities, the development and change of industrial land in Silk Road cities has become a new area of concern for governments and scholars. In this paper, the driving mechanism of industrial land change in 129 cities along the Silk Road in China is empirically studied by the GeoDetector method. The findings include: first, the development and changes of industrial land in Silk Road cities are significantly spatially heterogeneous, and the “Belt and Road” reshapes the town system and economic geography along the route by virtue of the differentiated configuration and changes of industrial land, changing the social, political, landscape and spatial relations in cities on the line. Second, the driving forces of industrial land change in Silk Road cities under the influence of the “Belt and Road Initiative” are increasingly diversified and differentiated, with significant two-factor enhancement and non-linear enhancement interaction between two driving factors, and growing complexity of the driving mechanisms, requiring policy makers to design policies based on key factors, comprehensive factors and their interaction. Third, the environmental effect of industrial land change is highly complex. The industrial land quantity has a direct impact on the ecological state parameter and plays a decisive role in the quality of the ecological environment and its changes in Silk Road cities. However, changes in the industrial land affect the ecological state change indirectly, mainly interacting with it through the coupling of pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions, energy use, ecological planning and landscape design and policy interventions. Finally, this study provides a new framework and method for Silk Road scholars to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of land use and coverage in cities along the “Belt and Road” and their influence mechanisms, and provides a basis for the government to make decisions on industrial land supply and layout planning and spatial governance policy design, which is of great theoretical significance and practical value. © 2021 by the authors.

Thereinto, the role of hydrophobic microenvironment is significant importance in promoting the process and effects of ESIPT, which can be regulated by the solvents, the existence of metal ions and proteins rich with α-helix structures or the advanced DNA structures. Considering that plenty of biological macromolecules offer cellular hydrophobic microenvironment, enhancing the ESIPT effects and resulting in dual emission, 3HF could be a promising scaffold for the development of fluorescent imaging in cells. Furthermore, as the widespread occurance of compounds with biological activity in plants, 3HF derivatives are much more secure to be cellular diagnosis and treatment integrated fluorescent probes. In this review, multiple regulatory strategies for the fluorescence emission of 3HF derivatives have been collectively and comprehensively analyzed, including the solvent effects, metal chelation, interaction with proteins or DNAs, which would be beneficial for ESIPT-promoting or ESIPT-blocking processes and then enhance or control the fluorescence emission of 3HF effectively.

Among them, the home energy management system (HEMS) as a hub connecting users and power companies to realize energy visualization has been widely studied. The research object of this study is a two-story detached residence integrated with HEMS in the “Jono Zero Carbon Smart Community” in Japan. To predict the energy consumed on the next day based on historical data, a short-term household load forecasting model based on the particle swarm optimization regression vector machine algorithm was developed. Then a dynamic pricing model was developed to guide the users’ electricity consumption behavior and adjust the grid load. According to the prediction results obtained by the load forecasting model, the annual electricity charges of users under the three pricing schemes of multistep electricity pricing (MEP), time-of-use pricing (TOU), and real-time pricing (RTP) were calculated and compared. The result indicated that the annual electricity cost generated by RTP was less than those generated by MTP and TOU. In addition, after adjusting the users’ peak load and combining it with the fluctuating future electricity prices, RTP presented evident economic advantage over MTP and TOU in terms of the annual electricity cost of the users.

Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate how biophysical and socioeconomic factors affect PM2.5 concentration. However, most of these studies have typically focused on biophysical and socioeconomic factors separately rather than taking an integrated social-ecological perspective. Cities are widely recognized social-ecological systems, and such an integrative perspective is crucially important for understanding the generation and mitigation of PM2.5 pollutants. In this study, by considering socioeconomic, biophysical, and meteorological factors simultaneously, we took a comprehensive social-ecological perspective to assess the impacts of these factors on PM2.5 concentrations. Correlation analysis and variance partitioning were used to quantify the impacts and relative importance of the factors. The analysis was conducted across mainland China focusing on 88 major cities based on socio-economic data, monitoring data of air quality and meteorological conditions, and land cover data. The statistical analysis results revealed that: (1) The biophysical structure and socio-economic factors significantly affect urban PM2.5 levels year round, but the impacts of meteorological factors are significant only in winter. The biophysical structure factors and the socio-economic ones contribute equally to the variations in PM2.5 concentration. (2) The effects of the factors vary by region. In northern China, the socio-economic factors together with meteorological factors contribute the most to the variation of PM2.5 concentration. In southern China, however, the unique effect of meteorological factors is dominant in affecting the level of PM2.5.

This study aims to explore how China addresses such challenges in the attainment of this more stringent warming-limit goal through sustainable transition. By using multi-model analysis, the robustness of findings is enhanced, while providing appropriate options based on model comparisons. The 1.5 °C limit means further reduction of emissions—up to 22%—and a ten-year earlier peak. From 2 °C to 1.5 °C, primary energy consumption will decrease by 22% to 28%, while policy costs will further increase by up to 37%. Greater technological progress facilitates larger contributions to CO2 emission reductions, given the shift from 2 °C to 1.5 °C. With diminishing marginal policy costs, the energy system can be reconstructed by initiating early actions on low-carbon and negative-emission technology development, and in the long term by coordinating state-of-the-art alternative technologies. This study provides reliable assessments of goal-strengthened achievements for China, including emission reductions, technology development, structural improvement, and economic performance for China.

Among these conflicts, the wastewater emission management as one of the significant ways to alleviate water scarcity has been paid increasing attention across the developing countries, such as China. It is thus essential to comprehensively investigate the enviro-economic effects induced by wastewater-related policies. In this study, a factorial emission-focused general equilibrium model (FEGE) is first developed to facilitate examine the composite enviro-economic effects of multiple policy scenarios with regards to wastewater-related environmental taxes and the related subsides. A special case study for the Municipality of Chongqing, China, is conducted to illustrate the potential benefits of its use in the formulation of wastewater-related policies. It is found that the impacts of various wastewater-related policies (i.e., environmental taxes and the related subside) on GDP are different. In detail, green tax policies on GDP are negative, while wastewater emission intensity (WEI) improvement policies on GDP are positive. When green tax reaches 14 yuan/tonne, which is the maximum proposed by the Chinese government, the GDP will drop by 0.37%, which would be deemed acceptable for the Municipality of Chongqing. In addition, the impacts on rural households’ consumption are greater than those on urban households’ consumption whichever the application of wastewater-related policies; it is because the rural households in the Municipality of Chongqing have a relatively unitary income source. It is thus recommended that the rural household in Chongqing should be paid more attention. For example, some extra allowances could be considered to the rural household to help them cope with the negative economic impacts induced by a new environmental policy. It is expected that the outputs would provide bases for formulating desired wastewater-related policies. © 2021","Emission-focused; Factorial analysis; Green tax; Municipality; Wastewater emission","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Chongqing; Emission-focused; Environmental policy; Environmental taxes; Factorial analysis; General equilibrium models; Green taxes; Municipality; Rural households; Wastewater emissions; Taxation; carbon emission; economic development; economic impact; emission; environmental economics; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Article; China; economic development; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; factor analysis; factorial design; factorial emission focused general equilibrium model; fiscal policy; government; gross national product; household; income; market; mathematical model; rural area; tax; urban area; urban rural difference; waste water management; wastewater; water supply; city; family size; tax; China; Chongqing; China; Cities; Environmental Policy; Family Characteristics; Taxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108411799

The existing two methods for estimating combustion emissions based on burned area and fire radiative power mainly use a medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites. However, the low temporal resolution of MODIS and insensitivity to small fires lead to deviation in the estimation of fire emissions. In order to solve this problem, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with better performance is adopted in this paper, combined with the fire diurnal cycle information obtained by geostationary satellite Himawari-8, to explore the spatio-temporal model of biomass combustion emissions. Using this, a high-spatial-and-temporal-resolution fire emission inventory was generated for southeastern Australia from November 2019 to January 2020, which aims to fully consider the highly dynamic nature of fires and small fires (low FRP) that are much lower than the MODIS burned area or active fire detection limit, with emphasis on dry matter burned (DMB). We found that during the study period, the fire gradually moved from north to south, and the diurnal cycle of the fire in the study area changed greatly. The peak time of the fire gradually delayed as the fire moved south. Our inventory shows that the DMB in southeast Australia during the study period was about 146 Tg, with major burned regions distributed along the Great Dividing Range, with December 2019 being the main burning period. The total DMB we calculated is 0.5–3.1 times that reported by the GFAS (Global Fire Assimilation System) and 1.5 to 4 times lower than that obtained using the traditional “Burned Area Based Method (FINN)”. We believe that the GFAS may underestimate the results by ignoring a large number of small fires, and that the excessive combustion rate used in the FINN may be a source of overestimation. Therefore, we conclude that the combination of high-temporal-resolution and high-spatial-resolution satellites can improve FRE estimation and may also allow further verification of biomass combustion estimates from different inventories, which are far better approaches for fire emission estimation. © 2021 by the authors.

Results indicate that, from a global perspective, as the degree of participation in GVCs rises, the CTT would also increase, and a series of tests showed that the robustness of this argument was not interfered with by endogenous issues. The growth of the CTT from the continuous deepening of participation in GVCs could be partially counterbalanced by reductions in emissions through relevant policies such as the increase of energy intensity, the optimization of industrial structure, and the improvement of residents’ awareness of emission reduction. Thus, we should discuss emissions reduction obligation assignments from the perspective of participation in GVCs, and relevant measures on emission reduction should also be placed on optimizing the division of participation in GVCs for each country, so as to lessen local economic dependence on energy intensive products.

The role of the market is to determine the direction of consumption. Unfortunately, existing research only considers the role of government regulation and ignores the welfare effects of market reforms. Therefore, using China's provincial-level data, this study investigates the impact of market reform (MR) on energy efficiency (EE). The super epsilon-based measure model was utilized to measure the EE, and panel quantile regression technology was employed to explore the heterogeneity effect of the EE at different quantiles. The empirical results show that: (i) the level of China's manufacturing EE is relatively low, showing a inverted U-shaped trend during the sample period, and there remain distinct provincial differences. (ii) MR significantly improves EE and shows an inverted U-shaped trend. Moreover, this study finds that environmental regulations, energy structure, and financial development have significantly improved EE. To make the results robust, this study uses five MR substitute indicators for robustness test.

The transport structure changes due to the introduction of more inland and coastal waterway transport since the 12th Five Year Period pose new challenges for the carbon-reduction management of China's WTS. This paper investigates the effect of transport structure change on CO2 emissions from the China's WTS by an index decomposition model, which incorporates the transport structure change factor and three other important factors related to transport production. An empirical study conducted on 17 major waterway transport regions in China from 2010 to 2016 shows that the waterway transport structure change performed as a negative driver for reducing CO2 emissions. However, a scenario analysis confirmed that effective transport structure changes would facilitate reductions in CO2 emissions from the WTS. Industrial development was the greatest driver for CO2 emission increase, while energy intensity change was an important driver for mitigating CO2 emissions. Regional disparities on the effect of waterway transport structure change and industrial development indicated the necessity of collaboration among 17 provincial regions on waterway transport management to mitigate CO2 emissions. © 2021","CO2 emissions; Driving factors; IDA model; Waterway transport sector","Industrial emissions; CO$-2$/ emission; Coastal waterways; Driving factors; Efficient managements; IDA model; Industrial development; Structure change; Transport sectors; Transport structure; Waterway transport sector; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; mitigation; structural change; transportation infrastructure; waterway transport; Article; carbon footprint; China; coastal waters; decomposition; energy consumption; energy intensity change; environmental parameters; environmental policy; industrialization; reduction (chemistry); transport structure change; turnover rate; water transport; waterway transport sector; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105830359

However, knowledge regarding the characteristics of indoor bioaerosols in areas affected by serious ambient air pollution is still limited. In this study, indoor bioaerosols were characterized in winter Beijing via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and amplicon sequencing, and compared to outdoor bioaerosols. Concentrations of indoor bioaerosol were significantly lower than those of the adjacent outdoor bioaerosol, and were not significantly affected by outdoor air pollution. Community structures of indoor bioaerosol were distinct from those of outdoor environment, and were differentially affected by ambient air pollution. Specifically, significant change was observed in indoor fungal community impacted by hazy air pollution, while not in bacteria and archaea.

Based on data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2018, this study applies the space and threshold models to empirically examine the digital economy’s influence on haze pollution and its spatial spillover. Furthermore, it investigates the spatial diffusion effect of regional digital economic development and haze pollution by constructing a spatial weight matrix. Subsequently, an instrumental variable robustness test is performed. Results indicate the following: (1) Haze pollution has spatial spillover effects and high emission aggregation characteristics, with haze pollution in neighbouring provinces significantly aggravating pollution levels in the focal province. (2) China’s digital economy has positively impacted haze pollution, with digital economic development having a significant effect (i.e., most prominent in eastern China) on reducing haze pollution. (3) Changing the energy structure and supporting innovation can restrain haze pollution, and the digital economy can reduce the path mechanism of haze pollution through the mediating effect of an advanced industrial structure. It shows a non-linear characteristic that the influence of haze reduction continues to weaken. Thus, policymakers should include the digital economy as a mechanism for ecologically sustainable development in haze pollution control. © 2021 by the authors.

Exploring novel and effective approaches for reducing ruminant greenhouse gas emissions is essential for cleaner livestock production and alleviating global warming. To investigate the effectiveness of a new feed source, Neolamarckia cadamba leaves (NCL), in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants as well as the underlying mechanism, 0%, 10%, 30%, and 50% NCL were ensiled with corn stalk in two trials. The results indicated that NCL inclusion increased the crude protein content (P &lt; 0.01) and lowered the ammonia-N and fiber contents of the silage (P &lt; 0.01 for both). The silage samples were fermented anaerobically in vitro in buffered rumen fluids at 39 °C. NCL did not affect ruminal fermentation characteristics; however, dry matter degradability was increased (P &lt; 0.05), whereas CH4 (32.7 vs 27.8 mL/g digestible dry matter [DM]) and CO2 (132 vs 114 mL/g digestible DM) production were decreased. The microbial composition of the fermentation fluid was analyzed by qPCR and next-generation sequencing. The results showed that NCL inclusion reduced the bacterial and archaeal count (P &lt; 0.05) in the ruminal fluid, increased the relative abundance of Prevotella and Succiniclasticum (P &lt; 0.05), and decreased that of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Christensenellaceae_R-7 (P &lt; 0.05). Our results indicated that NCL inclusion can be used to restrict proteolysis and increase the nutritive value and digestibility of corn stalk silage. Furthermore, mixing NCL in the feed may represent a dietary manipulation strategy to reduce CH4 and CO2 production by ruminants without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation. Consequently, NCL can be recommended for widespread use to achieve a sustainable and cleaner animal production, and for the mitigation of global warming. © 2021","Corn stalk; Greenhouse gases; Microbial community; Neolamarckia cadamba; Silage quality","Agriculture; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Fermentation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mammals; Methane; Polymerase chain reaction; CH$-4$; Corn stalk; Dry matters; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Livestock production; Microbial communities; Neolamarckia cadamba; Ruminal fermentation; Silage quality; Global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106940860

Wildfires produce high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Recent studies reported that short-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We acquired and linked publicly available daily data on PM2.5, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and other confounders for 92 western U.S. counties that were affected by the 2020 wildfires. We estimated the association between short-term exposure to PM2.5 during the wildfires and the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We adjusted for several time-varying confounding factors (e.g., weather, seasonality, long-term trends, mobility, and population size). We found strong evidence that wildfires amplified the effect of short-term exposure to PM2.5 on COVID-19 cases and deaths, although with substantial heterogeneity across counties.

It has great exploratory potentials for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in crops. Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO), a redox-active gaseous signalling molecule, though present uniformly through the eukaryotes, maintain its specificity in plants with respect to its formation, signalling, and functions. Its cellular concentrations are decisive for its function, as a signalling molecule at lower concentrations, but triggers nitro-oxidative stress and cellular damage when produced at higher concentrations. Besides, it also acts as a potent stress alleviator. Discovered in animals as neurotransmitter, NO has come a long way to being a stress radical and growth regulator in plants. As a key redox molecule, it exhibits several key cellular and molecular interactions including with reactive chemical species, hydrogen sulphide, and calcium. Apart from being a signalling molecule, it is emerging as a key player involved in regulations of plant growth, development and plant-environment interactions. It is involved in crosstalk with stress regulators and is thus pivotal in these stress regulatory mechanisms. NO is getting an unprecedented attention from research community, being investigated and explored for its multifaceted roles in plant abiotic stress tolerance. Through this review, we intend to present the current knowledge and updates on NO biosynthesis and signalling, crosstalk with stress regulators, and how biotechnological manipulations of NO pathway are leading towards developing transgenic crop plants that can withstand environmental stresses and climate change. The targets of various stress responsive miRNA signalling have also been discussed besides giving an account of current approaches used to characterise and detect the NO. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Abiotic stress; Crosstalk; Genetic engineering; miRNA; Nitric oxide; Signalling molecule; Transcription factors","microRNA; nitric oxide; phytohormone; plant RNA; biotechnology; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; plant physiology; procedures; transgenic plant; Biotechnology; MicroRNAs; Nitric Oxide; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Plant; Stress, Physiological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105884875

Ever-increasing environmental pressures – from emission reduction to pollution prevention – underline the need to balance economic progress with the concern for the environment. Finding new ways of facilitating economic growth within environmental constraints is central to urban sustainable development. In this study, we develop a robust-optimization-based urban agriculture planning (ROB-UAP) model to help decision makers make decisions that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The model enables consideration of more stringent pollution controls in response to the inherent uncertainty in the complex system. Shenzhen City, as the economic engine of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, also faces challenges of urban sustainability transitions. The proposed model is applied to the planning problem of Shenzhen City's urban agriculture system to support environment-oriented agricultural restructuring. We produce six risk-based scenarios to help evaluate the trade-offs between economic returns and environmental impacts. The results show that under expected economic conditions the overall output of the system could be increased by at least 8%, indicating that agricultural restructuring could indeed contribute to the economic growth of the city. In addition, the total amount of the major pollutants could be more or less reduced in the risk-averse and risk-tolerant scenarios; thereby delivering robust decision-making is essential for enabling environmentally low-impact outcomes in planning practices. © 2021 The Author(s)","Decision-making under uncertainty; Pollution control; Resilient cities; Robust optimization; Shenzhen city; Urban agriculture planning","Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Planning; Risk perception; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Agriculture systems; Case-studies; Decision making under uncertainty; Economic growths; Resilient city; Robust optimization; Shenzhen city; Stringents; Urban agriculture planning; Urban agricultures; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106641618

However, anthropogenic aerosol emissions reduce direct radiation (Rdir) reaching the surface, resulting in the losses of potential CSP electricity production in China. In this study, we applied various models to estimate daily Rdir, and the results showed that the gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost) model was superior to other models, and coefficient of determination (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.96, 1.99 MJ m−2 day−1 and 1.92 MJ m−2 day−1, respectively. We used Rdir data set at 839 stations across China derived by CatBoost model to calculate losses of the potential CSP electricity production from aerosol emissions. The results showed that the potential CSP electricity production decreased by 12.9% (136 kWh) on average at provincial level during 1961–2015. It is plausible that air quality will continue to improve from now due to the success of previous air pollution control measurements and the commitment to the United Nations of “Carbon Neutrality”. It was found that returning to direct radiation levels in 1960s could yield a 15.8% increase in potential CSP electricity production, equal to 28.4–79 TWh with the expected 2050 CSP installation capacities. The corresponding economic benefits could reach 17.1–56.9 billion RMB in 2050.

Therefore, assessing the impact of land-use changes on carbon storage is instructive to reduce global carbon emissions. Taking an arid region in northwest China as an example, this paper analyzed the land-use changes in arid region from 1980 to 2015. It used the CA-Markov model to predict the land-use pattern from 2020 to 2050, the carbon storage and sequestration module in Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (Invest) mode to assess and predict ecosystem carbon storage over the past 35 years and in the next 30 years and discusses the impact of land-use changes on the carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems. The results showed that: (1) The high-value areas of carbon storage in arid region were primarily concentrated in grassland, forests and farmland, and the low-value areas of carbon storage were mainly in desert areas. (2) The carbon storage in arid region showed a downward trend. From 1980 to 2015, the carbon reserves of terrestrial ecosystems in arid region decreased by 90.95 Tg, and the net loss of carbon reserves from 2020 to 2050 was 14.72 Tg. Grassland degradation was the main reason for the reduction of carbon storage in arid region. (3) The carbon storage of farmland had increased significantly, but the expansion of farmland dominated by high carbon density grassland, wetland and forest, had reduced the overall carbon storage of the arid region. © 2021 The Authors","Arid region; CA-Markov model; Carbon storage; Invest model; Land-use change","Arid regions; Climate change; Ecosystems; Farms; Forestry; Land use; Arid region in northwests; CA-Markov; CA-markov model; Carbon storage; Global carbon emission; Global climate changes; Integrated valuation of ecosystem service and tradeoff model; Landuse change; NorthWest China; Terrestrial ecosystems; Markov processes; arid region; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; global climate; grassland; land use; land use change; terrestrial ecosystem; wetland; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105545527

Based on this prediction method, the air quality index in Dezhou was predicted 1-5 days in advance by using 28 multi-point pollution monitoring sensor data from January 1, 2018 solstice to August 31. The prediction results show that the model not only improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the prediction, but also reveals the relationship between land use patterns and air quality index (AQI), which provides important information for land use planning, air pollution mitigation and urban intelligent governance. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, how the KC dynamics have varied over glacial-interglacial cycles is still under debate. The dynamic transfer and accumulation of submarine hydrothermal source materials by deep-reaching KC offer us a unique opportunity to examine the variations in dynamics of the KC. Here, we used novel proxies of sedimentary mercury (Hg) and antimony (Sb) in core MD01-2404 retrieved from the middle Okinawa Trough (OT) to reconstruct the evolution of the KC hydrodynamics over the last 92,000 years. We infer the enrichments of sedimentary Hg and Sb to signify hydrothermal input, which is delivered laterally to the study site by deep circulation in association with the KC, thus indicating the dynamics of KC. Overall, both the sedimentary Hg and Sb in core MD01-2404 indicate a persistent influence on the KC dynamics within the OT over the last glacial-interglacial cycles. Furthermore, our Hg and Sb proxies suggest a significantly weakened influence during the last deglaciation and last glacial period while a strengthened influence during the Holocene and late Marine Isotope Stage 5. Our studies imply that the orbital-scale dynamics of KC are controlled by tropical atmosphere-ocean interactions induced by sea surface temperature changes and regulated by the extratropical climate conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Glacial-interglacial cycles; Kuroshio current dynamics; Okinawa trough; Sedimentary Hg and Sb","Antimony; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Ocean currents; Orbits; Sedimentology; Surface waters; Climate system; Current dynamics; Earth's climate; Glacial-interglacial cycles; Integral part; Kuroshio current; Kuroshio current dynamic; Okinawa Trough; Orbitals; Sedimentary hg and sb; Dynamics; antimony; atmosphere-ocean system; deglaciation; Holocene; hydrodynamics; last deglaciation; sea surface temperature; East China Sea; Kuroshio Current; Okinawa Trough; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109116533

However, current evidence indicates great controversies in the direction and magnitude of elevational range shifts across species and regions. Here, using historical and recent occurrence records of 83 plant species in a subtropical mountain, Mt. Gongga (Sichuan, China), we evaluated changes in species elevation centroids and limits (upper and lower) along elevational gradients, and explored the determinants of elevational changes. We found that 63.9% of the species shifted their elevation centroids upward, while 22.9% shifted downward. The changes in centroid elevations and range size were more strongly correlated with changes in lower than upper limits of species elevational ranges. The magnitude of centroid elevation shifts was larger than predicted by climate warming and precipitation changes. Our results show complex changes in species elevational distributions and range sizes in Mt. Gongga, and that climate change, species traits and climate adaptation of species all influenced their elevational movement. As Mt. Gongga is one of the global biodiversity hotspots, and contains many threatened plant species, these findings provide support to future conservation planning. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Conservation planning; Elevational gradients; Gongga Mountain; Range shifts; Species redistribution","Biodiversity; Climate change; Landforms; Tropics; 'current; Conservation planning; Elevational gradients; Gongga mountain; Mountain biodiversities; Plant species; RANGE shifts; Shift-and; Sichuan; Species redistribution; Conservation; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; elevation; geographical distribution; montane forest; range expansion; subtropical region; article; biodiversity; China; climate warming; plant response; precipitation; altitude; climate change; ecosystem; plant; China; Gongga Mountain; Sichuan; Altitude; Biodiversity; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104115126
