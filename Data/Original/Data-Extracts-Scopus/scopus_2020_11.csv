The components that determine the pollution of the railway parking area have been regulated, and the gross emissions have been quantitatively established. The practical implementation of the protection of the air environment of the city of Voronezh is proposed, which implies the removal of stopping points of railway rolling stock, realizing the transit of oil and oil products, outside the residential zone of an industrial city with a million population. This applies to the points of technical stopping of railway tank cars with oil products, both short-term and long-term deployment.

Yet the quantification of their carbon stock still has a large uncertainty due to lacking observational data and well-tested peatland biogeochemistry models. Here, a process-based peatland model was calibrated using long-term peat carbon accumulation data at multiple sites in North America. The model was then applied to quantify the peat carbon accumulation rates and stocks within North America over the last 12,000 years. We estimated that 85–174 Pg carbon was accumulated in North American peatlands over the study period including 0.37–0.76 Pg carbon in subtropical peatlands. During the period from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, the warmer and wetter conditions might have played an important role in stimulating peat carbon accumulation by enhancing plant photosynthesis. Enhanced peat decomposition due to warming slowed the carbon accumulation through the rest of the Holocene. While recent modeling studies indicate that the northern peatlands will continue to act as a carbon sink in this century, our studies suggest that future enhanced peat decomposition accompanied by peatland areal changes induced by permafrost degradation and other disturbances shall confound the sink and source analysis. ©2020.

With limited space and costly labor, the chemical enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) process associated with sludge incineration was developed in Hong Kong for sewage and sludge treatment, respectively. However, the potential impacts of direct discharge of CEPT effluent in the receiving waterbody, i.e., the possible GHGs emissions after the expected increase of total wastewater loads, have never been addressed. Using Hong Kong as a research platform, this study developed nine scenarios with different wastewater and sludge treatment processes to study the energy profiles and direct/indirect carbon emissions. The impacts from different emission sources to global warming were evaluated. Two of the scenarios represent the ongoing Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works (SCISTW) and Shatin Sewage Treatment Works (STSTW), of which CEPT and activated sludge process (ASP) were in operation, respectively. The results showed that the energy efficiency of the SCISTW (0.065 kW h·m−3 wastewater treated) was 71% lower than that of the STSTW (0.224 kW h·m−3), but the GHG emission was higher in the CEPT plant (0.625 kg CO2-e·m−3) than the ASP plant (0.408 kg CO2-e·m−3). The addition of biological process and sludge digester in SCISTW would increase the energy consumption to 0.080 kW h, but reduce the GHG emissions by 70% (to 0.185 kg CO2-e·m−3). Sending the sludge cake to incineration would eliminate 64% of the GHG emissions from STSTW. Applying CEPT in the system may further reduce GHG emissions due to changed sludge combination, which may also be beneficial to energy recovery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Chemical enhanced primary treatment; Greenhouse gas emission; Sludge incineration; Wastewater treatment","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Chemical analysis; Effluents; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Wastewater treatment; Biological process; Chemical enhanced primary treatment; Footprint analysis; Potential impacts; Research platforms; Sewage management; Sewage treatment works; Stonecutters island sewage treatment works; Activated sludge process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087983996

The high-temperature flue gas generator generated a flow of flue gas at a high temperature (720°C) with low oxygen content (10%), which flowed into the main combustion zone and acted as the carrier gas for pulverized bituminous coal (0–0.355 mm) in the combustion chamber. In the combustion chamber, the coal particles reached a higher combustion temperature (&gt;1,100°C) in a short time, and the temperature difference was within 230°C, which showed that the local oxidation zone had been avoided. Furthermore, air-staging combustion technology was also adopted in combination with this technology. NO was the main nitrogen-containing compound, and the concentrations of other nitrogen-containing compounds (N2O, NH3, and HCN) were extremely low. The NO concentrations were reduced to 0 ppm twice when the volatiles released rapidly in the initial stage, and the volatiles burned violently in the intermediate stage, which are the main reasons for the significant reduction in NOx emissions. The original emissions of NOx were 187.2 mg/m3 (@6% O2), and the conversion ratio of fuel-nitrogen to NOx was 16.6%.

However, much research has focused on ecosystem-level responses, and we know substantially less about community-level responses to global change stressors. Here we conducted a 6-yr field experiment in a high-altitude (4600 m asl) alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau to explore the effects of nitrogen (N) addition and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration on plant communities. Our results showed that N and CO2 enrichment had synergistic effects on alpine grassland communities. Adding nitrogen or CO2 alone did not alter total community biomass, species diversity or community composition, whereas adding both resources together increased community biomass, reduced species diversity and altered community composition. The observed decline in species diversity under simultaneous N and CO2 enrichment was associated with greater community biomass and lower soil water content, and driven by the loss of species characterised simultaneously by tall stature and small specific leaf area.

Novel promising combustion modes, which are basically dominated by chemical reaction kinetics show a major difficulty in combustion control. The challenge in precise combustion control is hard to overcome by the traditional engine map-based control method because it cannot monitor the combustion state of each cycle, hence, real-time cycle-resolved in-cylinder combustion diagnosis and control are required. In the past, cylinder pressure and ion current sensors, as the two most commonly used sensors for in-cylinder combustion diagnosis and control, have enjoyed a seemingly competitive relationship, so all related researches only use one of the sensors. However, these two sensors have their own unique features. In this study, the idea is to combine the information obtained from both sensors. At first, two kinds of ion current detection system are comprehensively introduced and compared at the hardware level and signal level. The most promising variant (the DC-Power ion current detection system) is selected for the subsequent experiments. Then, the concept of ion current/cylinder pressure cooperative combustion diagnosis and control system is illustrated and implemented on the engine prototyping control unit. One application case of employing this system for homogenous charge compression ignition abnormal combustion control and its stability improvement is introduced. The results show that a combination of ion current and cylinder pressure signals can provide richer and also necessary information for combustion control. Finally, ion current and cylinder pressure signals are employed as inputs of artificial neural network (ANN) models for combustion prediction. The results show that the combustion prediction performance is better when the inputs are a combination of both signals, instead of using only one of them. This offline analysis proves the feasibility of using an ANN-based model whose inputs are a combination of ion current and pressure signals for better prediction accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus far, contributions from triplets to lasing have not yet been experimentally demonstrated owing to the limited knowledge about the excited-state processes. Herein, we experimentally achieve reverse intersystem crossing (RISC)-boosted lasing in organic microspheres with uniformly dispersed TADF emitters. In these materials, triplets are continuously converted to radiative singlets through RISC, giving rise to reduced losses in stimulated emission. The involvement of regenerated singlets in population inversion results in a thermally activated lasing; that is, the lasing intensity increases with increasing temperature, accompanied by accelerated depletion of the excited-state population. Benefiting from the suppression of triplet accumulations by RISC processes, a high-repetition-rate microlaser was achieved. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","organic lasers; reverse intersystem crossing; temperature-dependent lasing; thermally activated delayed fluorescence; triplet-harvesting","Organic lasers; Excited-state process; High repetition rate; Increasing temperatures; Inter-system crossings; Population inversions; Reduced loss; State population; Thermally activated; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091308156

However, the freshly exuded PDC can be diluted by the ancient soil-derived carbon (SDC) at a short distance from root apices. Thus, the rhizosphere C pools are normally dominated by SDC rather than PDC. Yet, how PDC and SDC interact to regulate root-associated bacterial community is largely unknown. In this study, a grass species and a legume species were planted in two contrasting matrixes, quartz sand and soil, to assess the role of PDC and SDC in regulating root-associated bacterial community, and to explore whether SDC affects the influence of PDC on bacterial community in soil. Our results indicated that the legume plant showed significantly positive priming effect on soil organic matter decomposition but the grass plant did not. PDC significantly shaped bacterial community in sand culture as indicated by PCR-DGGE and high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Intriguingly, we found that dissimilarity of bacterial communities associated with two plant species and the percentage of specific OTUs in quartz sand were significantly higher than those in soil. Moreover, several biomarkers enriched by plants in quartz sand turned to be general taxa in soil, which indicated that SDC attenuated the regulation of bacterial community by PDC. Taken together, these results suggest that SDC interacted with PDC and the root-associated microbial community, thus acted as soil buffering component of biological process contributing to soil resilience. The importance of PDC in structuring rhizosphere bacterial community needs to be reconsidered in the context of wider contribution of other C pool, such as SDC. © Copyright © 2020 Zhou, Yao and Zhu.","culture matrix; plant species; plant-derived C; root-associated bacterial community; soil-derived C","aquaporin; biological marker; carbon; fertilizer; plant derived carbon; RNA 16S; silicon dioxide; soil derived carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alicyclobacillus; Alphaproteobacteria; amplicon; Article; bacterial microbiome; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; Chlorobi; Chloroflexi; controlled study; cyanobacterium; decomposition; DNA extraction; environmental resilience; Firmicutes; gene amplification; high throughput sequencing; Lactobacillus; microbial community; nonhuman; Paspalum notatum; Planctomycetes; plant growth; plant immunity; plant pathogen interaction; plant root; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; rhizosphere; soil microflora; Stylosanthes guianensis; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096525173

The traditional way of reducing noise is to design low noise wind turbine airfoils and blades. A wind turbine operating under wind shear and in yaw produces periodic changes of blade loading, which intensifies the amplitude modulation (AM) of the generated noise, and thus can give more annoyance to the people living nearby. In this paper, the noise emission from a wind turbine under wind shear and yaw is modelled with an advanced fluid-structure-acoustics framework, and then controlled with a pitch control strategy. The numerical tool used in this study is the coupled Navier–Stokes/Actuator Line model ElliSys3D/AL, structure model FLEX5, and noise prediction model (Brooks, Pope and Marcolini: BPM) framework. All simulations and tests were made on the NM80 wind turbine equipped with three blades made by LM Wind Power. The coupled code was first validated against field load measurements under wind shear and yaw, and a fairly good agreement was obtained. The coupled code was then used to study the noise source control of the turbine under wind shear and yaw. Results show that in the case of a moderate wind shear with a shear exponent of 0.3, the pitch control strategy can reduce the mean noise emission about 0.4 dB and reduce slightly the modulation depth that mainly occurs in the low-frequency region. © 2020 by the authors.

We depict the correlations between these two datasets by a quasi-Lorenz curve which enables us to discern the individual contributions of densely and sparsely populated regions to the national CO2 emissions. We observe pronounced country-specific characteristics and quantify them using an indicator resembling the Gini-index. As demonstrated by a robustness test, the Gini-index for each country arise from a compound distribution between the population and emissions which differs among countries. Relating these indices with the degree of socio-economic development measured by per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at purchase power parity, we find a strong negative correlation between the two quantities with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.71. More specifically, this implies that in developing countries locations with large population tend to emit relatively more CO2, and in developed countries the opposite tends to be the case. Based on the relation to urban scaling, we discuss the implications for CO2 emissions from cities. Our results show that general statements with regard to the (in)efficiency of large cities should be avoided as it is subject to the socio-economic development of respective countries. Concerning the political relevance, our results suggest a differentiated spatial prioritization in deploying climate change mitigation measures in cities for developed and developing countries. © 2020 Zhou et al.

However, while bringing us convenience in life, with the increasing number of vehicles, the corresponding energy consumption and exhaust emission problems have also caused a lot of social wealth loss. Therefore, how to effectively improve the energy efficiency of vehicles to achieve the goal of energy-saving and emission reduction is one of the focuses of current academic and industrial circles. Different from the industrial sector, which mainly achieves energy saving and emission reduction by improving the mechanical performance of vehicles [such as increasing the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICEs)] or introducing new energy vehicles (such as electric vehicles), we have more choices in the academic world. Among them, through effective traffic signal control, the energy consumption of the vehicle can be improved by achieving a uniform speed of the vehicle as much as possible. We believe that the advantage of this method is that it can improve the energy efficiency of the vehicle within the system without updating the vehicle.

We show that dry deposition observation of oxidized nitrogen decreased at the rate of 2.4% yr−1 for a moderate reduction in NOx emissions by 27% in the past decade, while reduced nitrogen presented an increase at the rate of 2.3% yr−1 despite no regulated interventions for NH3 emissions, which is likely related to changes in atmospheric gas-particle partitioning of NH3 as reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. These results coincide with the trends in ground-level concentrations of oxidized and reduced nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere during 2008–2017. The changes in annual deposition fluxes of total oxidized and reduced nitrogen are not statistically significant trends and largely related with the inter-annual variability in their corresponding wet depositions, which reflects combined effects of variability in precipitation amount, and changes in atmospheric nitrogen compounds which dominates wet deposition of the oxidized and reduced forms. The meteorological conditions can mask 34% and 25% decrease in total oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition on the decadal timescale, respectively. We conclude that meteorology-driven variability probably have masked the full response of oxidized nitrogen deposition to NOx emissions reduction. Our results also imply that persistent and integrated emission control strategies on NOx and NH3 are needed to effectively reduce total nitrogen deposition fluxes towards the critical limit in the PRD region. © 2020 Elsevier LtdMeteorological variations can offset a 34% decrease in oxidized N deposition, and have masked the benefits from local NOx emission reduction on the decadal timescale. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Emission control; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Chemical transport models; Gas-particle partitioning; Ground level concentrations; Meteorological condition; Meteorological variability; Satellite based observations; Total nitrogen deposition; Oxidation; amide; nitrate; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; atmospheric deposition; concentration (composition); dry deposition; emission control; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; trend analysis; wet deposition; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric deposition; China; concentration (parameter); dry deposition; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; oxidation reduction reaction; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; meteorology; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087747630

In the proposed novel AHU, the heating coil is completely removed, and therefore, no heating coil energy demand is needed. The novel AHU used primary energy recovery as well as secondary one to utilize the return air energy and exergy. Through the first energy recovery unit, the return air exergy was recovered, while in the secondary heat exchanger, return air energy was recycled. Results showed that using the novel AHU leads to a reduction in energy consumption as well as the exergy losses. Three climate zones of A, B, and C were selected to assess the novel AHU performance. From the first law viewpoint, at zone B, using novel AHU has priority over other zones, while in the second law analysis, utilizing the novel AHU at zones B and C is more beneficial. Based on the first law analysis, owing to using novel AHU, energy consumption reduced up to 55.2% at Penang climate zone. Second law analysis revealed that utilizing the novel AHU decreased the irreversibility up to 51.4% in the Vancouver climate region. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Combination of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and a fluorinated ether of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (FEPE) is designed to formulate nonflammable electrolytes. The reformulated electrolytes of 1 mol/L LiPF6/TMP + FEPE (9:1, 8:2 and 7:3, w/w) are totally nonflammable. The FEPE solvent has higher oxidative stability and the FEPE-containing electrolytes have better separator wettability than the pure TMP electrolyte (1 mol/L LiPF6/TMP). The improved oxidative stability and separator wettability can enhance electrochemical stability of electrolyte on high-voltage cathode LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. In Li4Ti5O12/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells, the FEPE-containing electrolyte exhibits the better cycling stability than the pure TMP electrolyte, and the solvent composed of TMP + FEPE (8:2) is the optimal ratio. The Li4Ti5O12/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cell with the optimal electrolyte exhibits better rate capability because of the reduced polarization and improved oxidation stability.

Both the oxidation of methane and reduction of H2O/CO2 can take place efficiently in the dark while the pivotal step to govern syngas selectivity is photo-excitation of the reaction intermediates Rh2VO2,3CH2− to specific electronically excited states that can selectively produce CO and H2. Electronic excitation over Rh2VO2,3CH2− to control the syngas selectivity is further confirmed from the comparison with the thermal excitation of Rh2VO2,3CH2−, which leads to diversity of products.

In this paper, we use the latest calculation of the SDGs in China to construct provincial panel data and investigate the relationship between air pollution and Chinese SDGs. We find that reducing air pollution will not only improve the SDGs directly associated with the environment, such as SDG3 (good health and well-being) and SDG15 (life on land), but also has a close relationship with the SDGs of other dimensions, such as SDG4 (quality education), SDG9 (industrial, innovation and infrastructure), SDG12(responsible consumption and production), SDG16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG17(global partnerships). Based on the actual reduction in industrial SO2 emissions and evolution of the SDGs in China, we estimate that the former contributes approximately 3.5%–12.3% of the actual change in these SDGs from 2005 to 2015.

China, as one of the largest developing countries, faces very much serious air pollution and requires much attention. While the influences of air pollution on human or nature have been extensively investigated, few scholars considered the two effects of air pollution on human health and nature simultaneously based on the same framework. Indeed, human and nature coexist in the same biosphere on which they depend for their development and the impacts of air pollution on human health and nature occur at the same time with different and synergic effects. Only by considering both impacts we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of air pollution impacts, in particular including SO2, NO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5. Impacts can be looked at from the point of view of damage provided and damage repair (health recovery, replacement cost). Therefore, considering the different pollutants and sectors, the influences of air pollution on human health and nature are accounted for in this study by applying the Emergy Accounting and Life Cycle Assessment Eco-indicator 99 methods under a unified framework in 31 provinces of China taken as case study. While LCA provides an accurate assessment of the direct consequences of pollution on human and natural capital (human health and biodiversity losses), the Emergy Accounting approach quantifies the biosphere work associated to repair or replace such losses over time. Furthermore, the spatial agglomeration characteristics of emissions, human and natural capital losses analyzed by means of Moran's I index. Results show that: (1) Concerning human capital losses, the amount of emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 only account for 10% of total impacts, compared to SO2, NO2, and CO emissions, but in some provinces cause more than 70% of human capital losses. And more than 80% of PM2.5 and PM10 that cause human capital losses come from the industrial and civil sectors. (2) As far as natural capital losses are concerned, compared with SO2, the losses caused by NO2 account for 80% in most provinces. And the power, industrial and transportation sectors are the three major sources of NO2 causing natural capital losses. (3) The spatial agglomeration characteristics, such as high-high cluster, high-low cluster, low-low cluster and low–high cluster, are different for air pollution emissions, human and natural capital losses. A comprehensive and detailed understanding of the impacts of air pollution is crucial for policy makers to take informed decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-indicator 99; Emergy accounting; Human and natural capital losses; Life cycle assessment; Spatial autocorrelation","Agglomeration; Air quality; Biodiversity; Biospherics; Developing countries; Health; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Personnel; Repair; Air pollution impact; Biodiversity loss; Emergy accountings; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pollution emissions; Replacement costs; Transportation sector; Unified framework; Depreciation; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; exhaust emission; human capital; industrial emission; natural capital; particulate matter; public health; spatial distribution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088891570

Here we investigate soil C response in an experiment with 5-year CO2 enrichment and nitrogen (N) fertilization in a Tibetan meadow (4585 m above the sea level). We found that despite non-significant increase in bulk soil C pool, elevated CO2 dramatically altered the allocation of C in different soil fractions and soil mineralization potentials. By changing soil microbial composition and enhancing enzyme activities, elevated CO2 significantly accelerated soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization rates and stimulated the microbial utilization of 'old C' relative to that of 'new C'. Furthermore, N fertilization under elevated CO2 altered the decomposition process, increased the fungi to bacteria ratio, and decreased the coarse particulate organic matter pool and enzyme activities, indicating that N fertilization counters the CO2 fertilization effect. Overall, our findings suggest a growing threat of elevated CO2 in reducing SOM stability, and highlight the key role of N availability in driving soil C turnover under elevated CO2. © 2020 The Author(s).

The principal water-soluble ions were measured by ion chromatography. PH value (4.34–8.72) was recorded and 14% of all samples were acidic, and was negatively correlated with rainfall amount. The frequency of acid rain decreased year by year, and the acidity was still dominated by SO42−. SO42−, Ca2+, NH4+ and NO3− were the most abundant ions, accounting for 85% of the total concentration, with a significantly decrease rate of 61% during 8 years due to a series of emission reduction measures. The average ratio of neutralizing potential to acidifying potential was 1.37 and experienced an evident increasing trend. This was primarily ascribed to reduced input of SO42− in precipitation. The precipitation acidity was predominantly neutralized by crustal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. The ionic wet deposition flux was positively correlated to the rainfall amount. Based on Correlation analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization results, four pollution sources of coal combustion and vehicle mixing source (56%), dust (23%), agriculture and industry mixing source (16%) and biomass burning (5%) were identified. Back trajectory showed the air quality of Taiyuan was most significantly affected by the short-distance air mass from the southwest (40%). In order to achieve the SO2 (47%) and NOX (57%) emission reduction targets, we provided a specific energy reform plan in major cities affecting the air quality of Taiyuan before 2030. © 2020","Chemical characteristics; Emission reduction measures; Long-term; North China; Precipitation; Source apportionment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089291039

This paper calculates GHG emissions based on China’s energy consumption, divides the industrial structure in detail, and uses the extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model that is realized by PLS method and Tapio decoupling model to study the relationship of GHG emissions to industrial structure and economic growth. The results show that (1) China’s total GHG emissions showed a year-on-year growth trend from 2000 to 2017. For CO2, CH4, and N2O, only N2O emission showed a significant downward trend, while CO2 and CH4 emissions showed a slow growth trend. (2) The proportions of added value of industry and construction are positively correlated with GHG emissions, while those of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery; wholesale and retail trade; transport; and accommodation and catering are negatively correlated with GHG emissions. (3) China’s GHG emissions and overall economic growth are in a decoupling state, but in the energy field, N2O emission reduction control has the best effect. Additionally, the overall economic growth of China’s industrial sector and GHG emissions have experienced the process of decoupling-link-negative decoupling-link-decoupling.

To recover the excess exhaust steam heat of the CHP plant with the high back-pressure turbine (CHP-HBP), this paper proposed a novel heating system integrated with the steam jet pump (SJP). The EBSILON software was applied for modeling the proposed thermal system and analyzing the thermal performance of the CHP-HBP heating system under different operating conditions. On this basis, the coupled component-system design solution was proposed by combining the 1-D mathematical design model of the SJP with the heating system performance. Compared with the conventional system, under the design condition, the exhaust steam recovery rate and the heating capacity of the novel system had a significant increment of 8.66% and 31.8 MW with the same power output. Meanwhile, the total exergy loss and standard coal consumption rate for electricity generation of the novel system reduced by 5.74 MW and 6.77 g/kWh, respectively, with about 2.32% improvement in electricity generation efficiency. The critical parametric influence analysis on the overall performance showed that the novel system has better adaptability with some fluctuations of turbine back-pressure, supply/return water temperatures, and heating load. Under off-designed conditions, the recovery rate of the exhaust steam of the novel system was 5–20% higher than that of the conventional system, and the coal consumption rate and electricity generation efficiency both performed better. In all, the proposed system provided a promising method for the effective utilization of waste heat in the field of clean heating and the energy system optimization and integration for the coal-fired CHP plants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Combined heat and power; High back-pressure; Steam jet pump; Thermodynamic analysis; Waste heat utilization","Coal; Coal industry; Cogeneration plants; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Heating; Heating equipment; Jet pumps; Metal recovery; Steam; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Coal consumption rate; Combined heat and power; Conventional systems; Different operating conditions; Electricity generation; Electricity generation efficiencies; Energy system optimizations; Energy utilization efficiency; Steam power plants; combined heat and power; efficiency measurement; electricity generation; exergy; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; recovery; software; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089910379

In this study, an improved algorithm is developed for the retrieval of atmospheric columnar aerosol components from optical remote sensing data. This is achieved by using the complex refractive index (CRI) of a multicomponent liquid system in the forward model and minimizing the differences with the observations. The aerosol components in this algorithm comprise five species, combining eight subcomponents including black carbon (BC), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) and water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM), ammonium nitrate (AN), sodium chloride (SC), dust-like content (DU), and aerosol water content in the fine and coarse modes (AWf and AWc). The calculation of the CRI in the multicomponent liquid system allows for the separation of the water-soluble components (AN, WSOM and AWf) in the fine mode and SC and AWc in the coarse mode. The uncertainty in the retrieval results is analyzed based on the simulation of typical models, showing that the complex refractive index obtained from instantaneous optical-physical inversion compares well with that obtained from chemical estimation. The algorithm was used to retrieve the columnar aerosol components over China using the ground-based remote sensing measurements from the Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) in the period from 2010 to 2016. The results were used to analyze the regional distribution and interannual variation. The analysis shows that the atmospheric columnar DU component is dominant in the northern region of China, whereas the AW is higher in the southern coastal region. The SC component retrieved over the desert in northwest China originates from a paleomarine source. The AN significantly decreased from 2011 to 2016, by 21.9mgm-2, which is inseparable from China's environmental control policies. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Despite hydrological causes and the effects of global climate change, groundwater governance has an essential role to play in causing or preventing such overexploitation. This paper presented a case of groundwater governance in Lijiang, renowned for its natural beauty and exotic cultures, located in northwest Yunnan, China. Since being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in the 1990s, Lijiang has experienced dramatic tourism development, which eventually escalated its groundwater crisis. This paper applied the diagnostic approach of social-ecological systems to analyse the institutionalised governance process in the case of Lijiang and substantiated the effectiveness of the Social-Ecological Systems (SES) approach in explaining groundwater management issues. Two significant findings were drawn in the case of Lijiang. First, institutional arrangements may play an essential role in resource management, but their analysis is lacking between macro modelling of planetary boundaries of the Earth and micro surveys of individual and community behaviour. The SES framework offered a useful tool to fill this gap. Second, the designation of Lijiang’s Outstanding Universal Values as a world heritage site ironically damaged its local cultural intimacy, which nurtured generations of collective action for Naxi people, escalating the tragedy of its groundwater commons. © 2020 by the authors.

Pasteurisation prior to digestion in a biogas plant is a common hygienisation method for organic materials which contain or have been in contact with animal by-products. Tests were carried out on food waste, slaughterhouse waste, animal blood, cattle slurry, potato waste, card packaging and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW); pasteurisation at 70 °C for 1 h was applied. Pasteurisation had increased the methane yields of blood (+15%) and potato waste (+12%) only, which both had a low content of structural carbohydrates (hemi-cellulose and cellulose) but a particularly high content of either non-structural carbohydrates such as starch (potato waste) or proteins (blood). With food waste, card packaging and cattle slurry, pasteurisation had no observable impact on the methane yield. Slaughterhouse waste and OFMSW yielded less methane after pasteurisation in the experiments (but statistical significance of the difference between pasteurised and unpasteurised slaughterhouse waste or OFMSW was not confirmed in this work). It is concluded that pasteurisation can positively impact the methane yield of some specific substrates, such as potato waste, where heat-treatment may induce gelatinisation with release of the starch molecules. For most substrates, however, pasteurisation at 70 °C is unlikely to increase the methane yield. It is unlikely to improve biodegradability of lignified materials, and it may reduce the methane yield from substrates which contain high contents of volatile components. Furthermore, in this experimental study, the obtained methane yield was unaffected by whether the substrates were pasteurised individually and then co-digested or co-pasteurised as a mixture before batch digestion. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Mean hourly concentration of NR-PM1 was 13.55 ± 8.83 μg m−3 during the study period, decreasing from 18.83 μg m−3 before-BRICS to 13.02 μg m−3 in BRCIS I and 8.42 μg m−3 in BRICS II. Positive matrix factor analyses resolved four organic aerosols (OA): a hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, 14.78%), a cooking-related OA (COA, 28.21%), a biomass burning OA (BBOA, 18.00%), and an oxygenated OA (OOA, 39.22%). The contributions of local pollutants like nitrate and HOA reduced, while the proportions of sulfate and OOA increased during the control episodes. The diurnal patterns of NR-PM1 species and OA components in each episode were characterized. The results showed that BC, nitrate, COA, and HOA had peaks in the morning and evening, which became less obvious under the emission control. Moreover, the diurnal variations of all species in Ep 3 with emission control were much flatter due to the effect of transport.

Although North China experiences poor air quality and high PM2.5 concentrations, their spatial heterogeneity and relationship with the relative spatial risks of air pollution have not been explored. Therefore, in this study, the temporal variation trends (slope values) of the PM2.5 concentrations in North China from 2000 to 2017 were first quantified using the unitary linear regression model, and the Bayesian space-time hierarchy model was introduced to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The spatial lag model was then used to examine the determinant power of urbanization and other socioeconomic factors. Additionally, the correlation between the spatial relative risks (probability of a region becoming more/less polluted relative to the average PM2.5 concentrations of the study area), and the temporal variation trends of the PM2.5 concentrations were quantified using the bivariate local indicators of spatial association model. The results showed that the PM2.5 concentrations increased during 2000–2017, and peaked in 2007 and 2013. Spatially, the cities at high risk of PM2.5 pollution were mainly clustered in southeastern Hebei, northern Henan, and western Shandong where the slope values were low, as demonstrated by the value of Moran's I (−0.56). Moreover, urbanization and road density were both positively correlated with PM2.5 pollution, while the proportion of tertiary industry was negatively correlated. Furthermore, a notable increasing trend was observed in some cities, such as Tianjin, Zaozhuang, Qingdao, and Xinyang. These findings can contribute to the development of effective policies from the perspective of rapid urbanization to relieve and reduce PM2.5 pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian space-time hierarchy model; PM2.5 concentrations; Spatiotemporal heterogeneity; Temporal variation trends; Urbanization","Air quality; Regression analysis; Risks; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Linear regression models; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic factor; Spatial associations; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities; Tertiary industries; Economic and social effects; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental risk; heterogeneity; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; article; China; city; linear regression analysis; probability; quantitative analysis; risk factor; socioeconomics; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088017779

BART is constructed under a probabilistic framework that also allows for model-based prediction uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the application of BART in predicting daily concentrations of four fine particulate matter (PM2.5) components (elemental carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, and sulfate) in California during the period 2005 to 2014. We demonstrate in this paper how BART can be tuned to optimize prediction performance and how to evaluate variable importance. Our BART models included, as predictors, a large suite of land-use variables, meteorological conditions, satellite-derived aerosol optical depth parameters, and simulations from a chemical transport model. In cross-validation experiments, BART demonstrated good out-of-sample prediction performance at monitoring locations (R2 from 0.62 to 0.73). More importantly, prediction intervals associated with concentration estimates from BART showed good coverage probability at locations with and without monitoring data. In our case study, major PM2.5 components could be estimated with good accuracy, especially when collocated PM2.5 total mass observations were available. In conclusion, BART is an attractive approach for modeling ambient air pollution levels, especially for its ability to provide uncertainty in estimates that may be useful for subsequent health impact and health effect analyses. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition, precipitation may impact diurnal variation of riverine CO2 flux but the processes controlling those impacts are unknown. Here, we examine the diurnal characteristics of some physicochemical parameters, meteorological parameters, water level, δ13CDIC values, and the CO2 emission flux at two transects (DM and PY) of a typical karst river (Lijiang River, LJR), southwest China, during May 13–16, 2017. Our results show significant correlations between CO2 flux, DO, pCO2, and δ13CDIC and reflect control of CO2 flux diel pattern (decreasing during daytime and increasing at night) by metabolic processes of aquatic plants. The amplitude of CO2 flux diel pattern is weakened at DM. In contrast, diurnal pattern are interrupted at PY by the precipitation, and afterwards controlled by water level due to the significant positive correlation between water level and CO2 flux. Certainly, this amplitude will return to prestorm values as the water level recovered. We suggest that effects of precipitation on regional CO2 efflux estimate require scaling water level and CO2 flux with a linear relationship, and converting hourly flux to daily flux (α values) to improve the estimate of CO2 flux diel cycle. These methods will optimize sampling monitoring strategies and provide more reliable estimates of regional riverine CO2 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 flux; Diel pattern; Karst river; Precipitation; Water level","Delta modulation; Process control; Rivers; Water levels; Diurnal variation; Linear relationships; Metabolic process; Meteorological parameters; Monitoring strategy; Physicochemical parameters; Positive correlations; Reliable estimates; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; degassing; karst hydrology; physicochemical property; precipitation (chemistry); rainfall; river water; Li River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091067782

To understand the implementation barriers of the residential building sector towards achieving INDC, this study proposes an analytical framework for supporting robust decision making at the subnational level, in which a multi-objective optimisation model under uncertainty (MOOU) is developed for establishing decarbonisation pathways of the residential building sector. The proposed model has three key features: (1) systematic and robust decision-making with multi-objective optimisation of economic goals in the presence of uncertainties; (2) synergistic mitigation policies with gradual ramping-up adoption; and (3) quantitative evaluation of the finance provision and implementation rates of mitigation policies. The proposed model is then applied to provide in-depth insights into implementation barriers of 13 types of mitigation policies towards achieving INDCs targets in nine provinces in China, with parallel urban and rural analyses. Results show that the CO2 emissions of residential buildings in Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Beijing will have peaked by 2030. In particular, the CO2 emissions from cooling energy consumption of total building stocks will continually increase. Furthermore, improvements of building thermal efficiency and energy mix dominate the mitigation potential in northern China, while the southern China largely depends on the improvement of the efficiency of home appliances. The differences in measures’ mitigation effectiveness cause that southern China provinces have higher risks for achieving the subnational INDCs targets compared to northern China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonisation pathways; INDC; Multi-objective optimisation; Provincial; Residential building; Uncertainty","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Domestic appliances; Energy utilization; Housing; Multiobjective optimization; Risk assessment; Cooling energy consumption; Implementation barriers; Mitigation policies; Quantitative evaluation; Regional information; Residential building; Residential building energies; Thermal efficiency; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088900192

Here we conduct a state-of-the-art estimate of the spatial-temporal variability of GHG emissions intensities for wheat, maize, and rice in China from 1949 to 2012 using an improved agricultural ecosystem model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model-Agriculture Version 2.0) and meta-analysis covering 172 field-GHG emissions experiments. The results show that the GHG emissions intensities of these croplands from 1949 to 2012, on average, were 0.10–1.31 kg CO2-eq/kg, with a significant increase rate of 1.84–3.58 × 10–3 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1. Nitrogen fertilizer was the dominant factor contributing to the increase in GHG emissions intensity in northern China and increased its impact in southern China in the 2000s. Increasing GHG emissions intensity implies that excessive fertilizer failed to markedly stimulate crop yield increase in China but still exacerbated soil GHG emissions. This study found that overfertilization of more than 60% was mainly located in the winter wheat–summer maize rotation systems in the North China Plain, the winter wheat–rice rotation systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southwest China, and most of the double rice systems in the South. Our simulations suggest that roughly a one-third reduction in the current N fertilizer application level over these “overfertilization” regions would not significantly influence crop yield but decrease soil GHG emissions by 29.60%–32.50% and GHG emissions intensity by 0.13–0.25 kg CO2-eq/kg.

However, identifying a PEC system capable of driving efficient and durable CO2 conversion remains a critical challenge. Herein, the fabrication of a sandwich-like organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based photocathode with carbon encapsulation for PEC CO2 reduction is reported. The carbon encapsulation not only affords protection to the perovskite, but also allows for efficient conductance of photogenerated electrons. When decorated with a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst, the photocathode shows an onset potential at 0.58 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high photocurrent density of −15.5 mA cm−2 at −0.11 V versus RHE in CO2-saturated 0.5 m KHCO3 under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which represents state-of-the-art performance in this field. Moreover, the photocathode remains stable during a continuous reaction that lasted for 25 h. Unbiased PEC CO2 reduction is further realized by integrating the photocathode with an amorphous Si photoanode in tandem, delivering a solar-to-CO energy conversion efficiency of 3.34% and a total solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency of 3.85%. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon dioxide reduction; organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite; photo-electrochemical; photocathodes; solar fuels","Amorphous silicon; Carbon dioxide; Organic carbon; Perovskite; Photocathodes; Photoelectrochemical cells; Pollution control; Potassium compounds; Reduction; Solar energy; Anthropogenic carbon; Attractive strategies; Carbon dioxide reduction; Cobalt phthalocyanine; Continuous reactions; Photogenerated electrons; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; State-of-the-art performance; Conversion efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092355863

From a historical perspective, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the coal power sector in China, to understand the cause of the transition and where its future lies. Through the interactions among landscape, regime and niches, China's coal-fired power industry has developed cleaner and more efficient, which positively mitigated the local pollution. Yet the decarbonization in the power sector is unsatisfactory. Due to its dominating role and nature of high-carbon emitting, the coal power sector has always been a big challenge during China's climate actions. Although the goal of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 demonstrates China's ambitions, expanding coal-fired power generation capacity hinders climate change mitigation and low-carbon transition. In this regard, we discuss the guidelines for the future high-quality coal-fired power development to provide recommendations for policy-makers and industry stakeholders.

It is an urgent issue that the significant amount of residue MSWI ashes need to be better handled and reused as a renewable source. MSWI ashes have great potential to be utilized as a cementitious replacement material in concrete mixing, which is beneficial for both promoting MSWI ash reuse and reducing cement consumption. However, there are major challenges associated with MSWI ash reuse, including the presence of lack of efficient approach to restore the reactivity of MSWI ashes as a binding agent, because such ashes are usually low in reactivity or even inert. This study aims to develop an effective and reliable activation method to enable the pozzolanic and hydraulic properties of MSWI ashes. A novel activation methodology by means of physiochemical treatments, including particle size reduction and high pH activator was proposed to increase the reactivity of such bottom ashes. A rapid test method, namely solution test, was developed to test the potential reactivity after the activation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ion chromatography (IC) were employed to evaluate the degree of reactivity. The results showed that the physicochemical treatment can indeed increase the reactivity of MSWI ashes. Compared to the existing test protocols using normal activator the new solution test can more effectively examine the latent pozzolanic activities of MSWI ashes. The successful application of the proposed activation methodology together with the developed solution test could turn those “inert or low reactivity” to-be-landfilled ashes into an active binding agent as a cement replacement material, which would contribute greatly to recycle and reuse of waste materials and reduce CO2 emission. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Few studies have focused on the potential impact of PM2.5 pollution on respondents’ self-rated health, physical health, and mental health. Using an instrumental variable model and constructing instrumental variables of ventilation coefficients, this study analyzes 2011, 2013, and 2015 data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative sample of adults over 45 years of age. By matching the health data with the PM2.5 data in 272 prefecture-level cities, this study examines the impact of PM2.5 pollution on public health and measures the marginal cost (MC) of PM2.5 reduction. Empirical results show that PM2.5 can significantly lower self-rated health and increase the probability of chronic diseases and mental depression. Using the marginal rate of transformation between income and PM2.5, the results show residents, on average, are willing to pay 869 Yuan for reduced PM2.5. Moreover, respondents’ gender, age, education level, and locality significantly affect PM2.5 pollution-related health and the MC for clean air. Specifically, MC levels in males are higher than those in females; people aged over 60 show the highest MC levels; the respondents who are less educated are willing to pay more for pollution mitigation; and residents living in Eastern China have a greater MC for PM2.5 pollution control.

Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is being promoted among farmers as a way of adapting to the effect of climate change on agricultural systems. This study used primary data from 300 farmers in the Zabzugu and South Tongu districts of Ghana. We fitted an Endogenous-Switching Poisson regression model to determine the drivers of farmers' participation in climate change capacity building programmes and the concomitant effect of participation on adoption intensity of Climate Smart Agricultural Practices (CSAPs). The study found that participation in climate change capacity building training is endogenous and is positively influenced by farmers' access to agricultural extension services and membership of farmer-based organisations (FBOs). Consequently, participation in capacity building training, family labour, and agricultural insurance significantly influenced farmers' CSAPs adoption intensity. We recommend, based on these findings, that climate change and agricultural projects incorporate farmer training on CSAPs in their programming, in order to guide the adoption of multiple practices. Here, extension agents and FBOs should be targeted to disseminate information to farmers. An important finding from this study relates to the significant effect of agricultural insurance on adoption intensity of CSAPs. We argue that farm insurance reduces the risk of investing in climate mitigation practices for smallholder farmers and for that matter, national agricultural policies should facilitate farmers’ subscription to crop insurance as a mechanism to increase resilience to climate risks and shocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Agricultural insurance; Climate-smart agricultural practices; Endogenous-switching Poisson; Participation in farmer training","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Crops; Information dissemination; Insurance; Regression analysis; Agricultural extension services; Agricultural policies; Agricultural practices; Climate mitigations; Concomitant effects; Endogenous switching; Poisson regression models; Smallholder farmers; Climate change; agricultural practice; climate change; farmers attitude; insurance system; participatory approach; regression analysis; smallholder; training; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089475995

The LCS features integrate machine learning based calibration models and virtual sensors. LCS performances are analyzed and some LCS variables with low performance are improved through intelligent field-calibrations. Meteorological variables are calibrated using linear dynamic models.While, due to the non-linear relationship to reference instruments, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are calibrated using non-linear machine learning models. However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematicalmodels are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy. Our proposed methodology enables scaling-up accurate air pollution mapping appropriate for smart cities. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Air quality; calibration; low-cost sensors; machine learning; virtual sensors","Air quality; Calibration; Costs; Machine learning; Air pollutant concentrations; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Intelligent fields; Meteorological variables; Non-linear relationships; Pollution mapping; Reference instruments; Reference stations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093067506

Our results showed that: (1) electricity production for the same period in 2018, 2019, and 2020 shrunk at an offset of 9.20%, which resulted in a modest reduction (−1.79%) of atmospheric CO2 to the 2017–2018 CO2 level; (2) a non-seasonal, abrupt, and brief atmospheric CO2 decrease by 0.85% in mid-February 2020 could be due to Phase 1 restrictions in China. The results indicate that electricity production reduction is significant to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO2. It also highlights China’s significant contribution to atmospheric CO2, which suggests that, without the national restriction of activities, CO2 concentration is set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%. Due to the lockdown, it quickly decreased and sustained for two months. The results underscore atmospheric CO2 reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved if electricity production from combustible sources was slashed. The result could be useful for cost-benefit analyses on the decrease in electricity production of combustible sources and the impact of this reduction on atmospheric CO2. © 2020 by the authors.

To prevent the spread of infection in many countries, including the Russian Federation, public life was restricted. To assess the impact of the taken actions on air quality in the Moscow region, in June 2020, mosses Pleurosium shreberi were collected at 19 sites considered as polluted in the territory of the region based on the results of the previous moss surveys. The content of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb in the moss samples was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. The obtained values were compared with the data from the moss survey performed in June 2019 at the same sampling sites. Compared to 2019 data, the Cd content in moss samples decreased by 2–46%, while the iron content increased by 3–127%. The content of Cu, Ni, and Pb in mosses decreased at most sampling sites, except for the eastern part of the Moscow region, where a considerable number of engineering and metal processing plants operate. The stay-at-home order issued in the Moscow region resulted in a reduction of vehicle emissions affecting air quality, while the negative impact of the industrial sector remained at the level of 2019 or even increased. © 2020 by the authors.

Using the input-output (IO) table for 2007–2012 and the latest IO table for 2012–2017, an IO model of China's industrial SO2 emissions is established and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is applied to examine the changes in industrial SO2 emissions resulting from this economic transition. Five influencing factors (emission intensity, production technology, final demand expenditure, final demand structure and economic scale) are taken into consideration. The analysis shows that emission intensity and economic scale are the most influential factors on SO2 emissions. Emission intensity reduced SO2 emissions by 16,560,886 t in 2012–2017 whilst economic scale increased SO2 emissions by 473,490 t. Compared with the period 2007–2012, the contribution rate of emission intensity increased from −82.3% to −189.2%, while that of economic scale decreased from 131.8% to 54.1%. The total contributions of 5 factors to SO2 reduction increased from −5,249,417 t to −12,783,248 t, and the contribution rate increased from −24.8% to −146%. China's energy conservation and emission reduction has achieved remarkable results between 2007 and 2017.

We provide a physical framework to understand the relationship between the ICAS and African dust activity: positive ICAS anomalies push the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) northward and decrease surface wind speed over African dust source regions, which reduces dust emission and transport. It provides a unified framework for and is consistent with relationships in the literature. We find strong observational and proxy-record support for the ICAS-ITCZ-dust relationship during the past 160 and 17,000 years.

However, the integration of EV charging loads into power grid brings negative effects such as overload and voltage deviation. In order to solve these problems, an EV demand response (DR) strategy in traffic-grid coupling networks based on the charging state forecasting model is proposed. Firstly, the charging state forecasting model was established considering the traffic condition, which can capture the distribution characteristics of the aggregate EV charging loads. Then a DR strategy considering the power flow constraints was proposed. The DR potential of each coupling node are evaluated and the charging loads are rationally dispatched in the strategy. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the voltage deviation in the regional power grid. © 2020 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Demand response; electric vehicle; load forecasting; voltage deviation","Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric machinery; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Vehicle-to-grid; Coupling network; Distribution characteristics; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental concerns; Regional power grids; Traffic conditions; Voltage deviations; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099301036

One promising solution is to implement large-scale heat pumps into the existing heat supply system. This paper aims to investigate whether the integration of large-scale heat pumps can be the first feasible step for cities towards clean heating transition. As opposed to the traditional way of conducting independent energy planning within a single city/region, this paper presents a novel approach of employing integrated planning for the multiple neighboring regions to explore the advantages of interregional energy collaboration. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration is taken as a case study, which is the most polluted region in China caused by the coal-based heating system. By implementing a series of simulations for the heating and power systems in the EnergyPLAN tool for six predesigned future scenarios which consider different planning strategies and analysis focuses, this paper analyzes to what extent heat pumps can help to achieve energy and environmental improvement for the whole BTH region by 2030 while ensuring economic feasibility. This is done by creating three independent models for respective Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, and one integrated model for the whole BTH region. The results suggest that when guaranteeing economic feasibility, the integration of large-scale heat pumps can potentially result in at least 9.5% energy saving and 9.28% reduced CO2 emission compared to the baseline. The integrated planning strategy can furthermore be more efficient in the urban agglomeration, which reduces 1.92% and 2.27% more energy and emissions in 2030 compared to the independent planning results. Based on cost analysis, the maximum economic feasible potential of heat pump penetration is identified as well. This paper can provide references for policymakers in the BTH region and the rest of Northern China, as well as present a principle of energy planning for cities on a general level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Clean heating transition; Energy systems analysis; EnergyPLAN; Large-scale heat pumps; Urban agglomeration","Agglomeration; Energy conservation; Heat pump systems; Heating; Pumps; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Economic feasibilities; Energy and emissions; Environmental improvements; Integrated modeling; Integrated planning; Planning strategies; Urban agglomerations; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089417533

It is regarded as one of the major strategies to reduce the usage of private cars and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road traffic. For a customized bus system, a dynamic bus line planning system based on the demand can largely improve the performance and promote the public acceptance of customized bus service. This paper introduces a method to generate planning suggestions for bus lines and stops based on massive demand data. A link network is generated from the input to represent the sharing route of the demand. With community detection, the link network is segmented into communities with similar travel routes. By examining the core-peripheral structure and matching the core part of communities with the road network, the customized bus lines are generated. Boarding and alighting hotspots are identified as the suggestion for customized bus stops. The methodology is tested by using mobile phone data in Tokyo. With the input of one-day sample, the algorithm can generate the result in approximately 1 min and extract 29 bus lines. According to the shape and spatial location of the bus lines, three types of bus lines serving different travel patterns are classified: radiation type lines, ring-type lines, and suburban lines. Analyzing the emission reduction potential of the extracted bus lines manifestes that bus line planning of the proposed method has the potential to relieve emission pressure on urban expressways and to reduce approximately 13% of road traffic emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Customized bus system; Dynamic bus line planning; Emission reduction potentials; GPS data","Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Cellular telephones; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Community detection; Emission reduction potentials; Mobile phone datum; Mobile phone GPS; Public acceptance; Public transportation; Road traffic emissions; Urban expressway; Buses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088100881

In this study, DNA of sand dunes restored for a period of 12 and 30 years, and an unrestored sand dune (control), was extracted and sequenced using Illumina Miseq. The results indicated that revegetation of C. microphylla significantly altered soil microbial communities as reflected by the significantly different bacterial and fungal composition and fungal diversity between the restored dunes and the control; however, there was no significant difference in soil microbial composition between the dunes restored for different years. Specifically, microbial consortia that involved in a wide range of ecological function, including recalcitrant organic carbon decomposition, plant-microbe symbiosis and nitrogen fixation, were enriched on restored dunes particularly on the 30-year restored dune. The changes in soil microbial communities were significantly correlated with the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the proportions of labile and recalcitrant organic carbon in SOC, which may indicate a mutual-regulated ecological improvement between soil abiotic and biotic processes along sand dune restoration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological restoration; Endophytic fungi; High-throughput sequencing; N-fixing bacteria; Soil microbial assemblage; Soil organic carbon","Bacteria (microorganisms); Caragana microphylla; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088633161

The extreme weather impacts are directly related to the temperature and precipitation variations leading to more frequent and devastating events as floods, droughts and cyclones. Even though Mozambique has committed to international policies and has adopted mitigation measures, still it is lacking of sufficient capacity on various levels to lower the country’s vulnerability level. A consortium of eight partner countries, along with Mozambique, commenced a Climate Change Induced Disaster Management in Africa (CIDMA) project which aims at building education capacity through implementing geospatial information technology for improved disaster management in Mozambique. The core of the project is in developing three 10 ECTS courses that will implement state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies for dealing with climate change induced hazards. The courses are intended from one hand to university students and staff, but on the other to local authorities, organisations and companies occupied with disaster management, and local communities. As one of course, “Public Participatory GIS and Spatial Data Infrastructure in Disaster Management” is designed to prepare students to be able to produce thematic maps through GIS and crowdsourced data, as well as various EO data. With the presented course it is expected for the students to gain valuable theoretical and practical knowledge of GIS, VGI and SDI for exploiting, managing and processing geospatial data for risk mitigation and hazard mapping. Moreover, they will be skilled in using free and open-source GIS software, desktop and mobile mapping techniques, and free web-based dissemination and processing services. In addition, it is expected for the students to develop critical judgement for analysing data with the correct tools in case of climate induced disasters.

We find that a coalition of economic, labor, and governmental organizations resists a low carbon transition in both countries. However, we also find several possible avenues of incremental change through changes in the network structures and the beliefs held by actors in the networks.

Previously, an empirical equation was constructed using an experimental setup of an intake port model of an ICE, in order to be implemented into an engine control unit and numerical simulation software for heat transfer calculations. The empirical equation was based on the conventional Colburn analogy with the addition of Graetz and Strouhal numbers. Introduced dimensionless numbers were used to characterize the entrance region, and intermittent flow effects, respectively. In this study, further improvement of the model was done by characterizing the effect of backflow gas on intake air temperature by the introduction of the Euler number. 1-D engine simulations were done to analyze the valve-overlap and displacement backflow gas phases' effect on the intake air temperature. Additionally, engine test-bench experiments were conducted to validate the in-house built model and its applicability into engine control unit algorithm. The outlet temperature of the intake manifold was measured and results were compared to the various correlations. The in-house built equation showed the best accuracy when compared with the conventional approach, Colburn analogy. Maximum and average errors between the measured and estimated outlet temperatures were found to be 2.7% and 0.8%, respectively. The coefficient of variation for the in-house built equation was found to be 6.2%, which is considered to be a strong correlation. The average calculation time for the model is found to be 32 microseconds which satisfies the requirement for the current engine control unit technology. © 2020 SAE International.

We developed a remote-sensing-driven permafrost carbon model at intermediate scale (km) to investigate how environmental factors affect the magnitude and seasonality of soil heterotrophic respiration in Alaska. The permafrost carbon model simulates snow and soil thermal dynamics and accounts for vertical soil carbon transport and decomposition at depths up to 3 m below the surface. Model outputs include soil temperature profiles and carbon fluxes at 1 km resolution spanning the recent satellite era (2001-2017) across Alaska. Comparisons with eddy covariance tower measurements show that the model captures the seasonality of carbon fluxes, with favorable accuracy in simulating net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for both tundra (R 0.8, root mean square error (RMSE - 0.34 g C m-2d-1), and boreal forest (R 0.73; RMSE - 0.51 g C m-2d-1). Benchmark assessments using two regional in situ data sets indicate that the model captures the complex influence of snow insulation on soil temperature and the temperature sensitivity of cold-season soil heterotrophic respiration. Across Alaska, we find that seasonal snow cover imposes strong controls on the contribution from different soil depths to total soil heterotrophic respiration. Earlier snowmelt in spring promotes deeper soil warming and enhances the contribution of deeper soils to total soil heterotrophic respiration during the later growing season, thereby reducing net ecosystem carbon uptake. Early cold-season soil heterotrophic respiration is closely linked to the number of snow-free days after the land surface freezes (http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML 0.48 0.1), i.e., the delay in snow onset relative to surface freeze onset. Recent trends toward earlier autumn snow onset in northern Alaska promote a longer zero-curtain period and enhanced cold-season respiration. In contrast, southwestern Alaska shows a strong reduction in the number of snow-free days after land surface freeze onset, leading to earlier soil freezing and a large reduction in cold-season soil heterotrophic respiration. Our results also show nonnegligible influences of subgrid variability in surface conditions on the model-simulated CO2 seasonal cycle, especially during the early cold season at 10 km scale. Our results demonstrate the critical role of snow cover affecting the seasonality of 5862 soil temperature and respiration and highlight the challenges of incorporating these complex processes into future projections of the boreal-Arctic carbon cycle. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

A quantitative estimation of paleolake salinity enables a better understanding of the regional hydrological cycle and contemporaneous climate change. Here, we present a quantitative record of paleolake salinity in the Qaidam Basin between ~42 and 29 Ma using detailed mineralogical investigations and clay boron content data. This paleolake salinity record generally covers a tectonically less active period in the Asian interior characterized by continuous global cooling, the abrupt Eocene–Oligocene climate transition and the Paratethys transgression/regression cycles, thus offering an opportunity to explore the roles of global cooling and the Paratethys retreat in regulating the regional hydrological cycle. The results of two boron-derived paleosalimeters, equivalent boron and Couch's salinity, collectively indicate a two-stage paleolake salinity evolution, from an oligohaline–mesohaline environment in the middle–late Eocene (~42–~34 Ma) to a mesosaline environment in the early Oligocene (~34–~29 Ma). This transition is also supported by qualitative chloride-based and ostracod-based paleosalinity estimates in the Qaidam Basin. Our quantitative paleolake reconstruction between ~42 and 29 Ma in the Qaidam Basin yields a generally good match with the hydroclimate change in the neighboring Xining Basin, thus indicating a comparable regional drying trend. The synchronous changes in quantitative paleolake salinity and silicate weathering processes derived from the illite weathering index and chlorite content in the studied section suggest climate control of silicate weathering. Global cooling is speculated to have been the first-order driving factor in regulating long-term climatic evolution and weathering responses in the Asian interior between ~42 and 29 Ma. Superimposed on this trend, the Paratethys transgression/regression cycles served as an important factor regulating wet/dry fluctuations in the Asian interior between ~42 and ~34 Ma. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clay minerals; Global cooling; Paleosalinity; Paratethys retreat; Qaidam Basin","Boron; Chlorine compounds; Silicates; Weathering; Climate transition; Climatic evolution; Hydrological cycles; Ne tibetan plateaux; Quantitative estimation; Silicate weathering; Tibetan Plateau; Weathering indices; Climate change; clay mineral; climate change; cooling; mineralogy; paleoenvironment; paleosalinity; transgression-regression cycle; China; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Ostracoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095776192

Therefore, evaluating their performance for sustainable design is critical. While building standards are updated frequently to improve building efficiency, the climate is changing and classical (deterministic) approaches to quantifying building energy use may not be accurate. Significant uncertainties exist in current models of future building performance. Probabilistic approaches to evaluate whole building performance and account for climate uncertainties require large input data of climate projections with detailed spatial and temporal resolution and considerable computational resources. This paper offers a four-step process to propagate climate uncertainties from future climate projections into building energy performance. The climate uncertainty propagation method consists of a combination of regression, distribution fitting and random sampling. It has the potential to capture climate uncertainties in building simulation tools and is applicable to cases where limited future weather files can be produced. In addition, we include the use of updated design day files in future building performance analysis. Design days drive equipment modernization impacting whole building energy use under climate change. The Department of Energy office reference buildings for Philadelphia climate conditions are used as the case study. The aim of this research is to generate a probabilistic model that captures future building energy performance trends where can be applicable to regions that have limited future hourly weather files to be incorporated into building simulation tools. The results of this paper are intended to promote a probabilistic approach to account for climate uncertainties and to provide guidance in analyzing buildings projected energy consumption under climate change. © 2020","Building energy performance; Climate change; Climate uncertainty propagation; Design conditions","Air navigation; Architectural design; Building codes; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Structural design; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Building energy performance; Building performance analysis; Computational resources; Equipment modernization; Future climate projections; Probabilistic approaches; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Uncertainty propagation; Climate change; building; climate change; climate conditions; energy use; future prospect; performance assessment; uncertainty analysis; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089554461

We applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to assess the associations between daily PM2.5 exposure and YLL from respiratory diseases in 96 Chinese cities during 2013–2016. We further estimated the avoidable YLL, potential gains in life expectancy, and the attributable fraction by assuming daily PM2.5 concentration decrease to the air quality standards of China and World Health Organization. Regional and national results were generated by random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 861,494 total respiratory diseases and 586,962 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused death from 96 Chinese cities were recorded during study period. Each 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 in 3-day moving average (lag02) was associated with 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.24) years increment in life expectancy from total respiratory diseases. The highest effect was observed in Southwest region with 0.42 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.62) years increase in life expectancy. By attaining the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines, we estimated that an average of 782.09 (95% CI: 438.29, 1125.89) YLLs caused by total respiratory death in each city could be avoided, which corresponded to 1.15% (95% CI: 0.67%, 1.64%) of the overall YLLs, and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.17) years increment in life expectancy. The results of COPD were generally consistent with total respiratory diseases.

Finding a rapid and accurate method for estimating carbon emissions is the prerequisite for making real-time emission reduction measures. In this paper, an estimation method for quick inversion of provincial-level carbon emissions in China is proposed by using night-time light data. This method was based on the corrected night-time light image and combined with the statistical data of the built-up area to extract the total night light value (TDN) in the built-up areas of 30 provinces (Municipalities directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions were collectively referred to as provinces; Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were not involved here) in Chinese mainland from 1997 to 2017. The regression equation was established by using the TDN of the built-up areas in each province from 1997 to 2014 and the provincial-level carbon emission data released by CEADs (China emission accounts and datasets) in the same period, and then the TDN values from 2015 to 2017 were used as the independent variable to estimate the carbon emission of each province according to the established regression equation. Finally, we used the entropy method and carbon emission allocation model to distribute China's national-level carbon emission data released by the international authoritative databases to each province and compared them with the provincial-level carbon emissions estimated by the above regression equations from 2015 to 2017. The results show that: (1) There was a significant linear relationship between the established carbon emission estimation models in all provinces, with R2 values greater than 0.8 except Beijing, Hainan and Shanxi. (2) Comparing the difference between the estimated carbon emissions and the carbon emissions allocated to provinces by the database, except for Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi provinces, the errors of the other provinces were relatively small, RMSE and MAE were less than 260mt, and the MAPE of most provinces were less than 50%, indicating that the estimation models have high goodness-of-fit and accuracy. (3)The provincial-level carbon emissions allocated by the four international databases from 2015 to 2017 and the carbon emissions estimated by the model were plotted separately, and it is found that the corresponding scatter points of most provinces were distributed near the 1:1 line, which once again showed that the carbon emissions inverted based on night-time light data were close to the carbon emissions allocated to the provinces by each database, especially the provincial-level carbon emissions from CEADs database. The above results demonstrate that this method can provide a faster and more accurate estimation of provincial-level carbon emissions for China. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Distributed database systems; Emission control; Global warming; Planning; Sustainable development; Accurate estimation; Carbon emission allocations; Central government; Emission reduction; Independent variables; International database; Linear relationships; Regression equation; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097648808

Local authorities may be competed for both of environmental and economic performance. However, there is possibly trade-offs between the two performances in the short term. This paper focus on the incentives among China's local governments. Our empirical research finds that local governments compete for setting ambitious goals of pollution emission reduction according to their goals release date, and the increase in emission reduction goal leads to a decline in real economic growth. One of the transmit channels is that high goals result in more efforts on emission reduction and then crowding out the economic growth. Local governments are inclined to set more ambitious emission reduction goals, even when doing so comes at some cost of reduced economic growth. The results are robust to regression methods, emission types, and the variable choices of economic growth in different years. It implicates that if the superior governments strengthen the local authorities' competition for environment protection and reduce that for economic growth, it would improve the environment performance effectively. Such competition mechanism may include but not be limited to official promotion based on environment performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Economic growth; Emission reduction goal; Incentive; Regional competition; Trade-off","Competition; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Regression analysis; Competition mechanism; Emission reduction; Empirical research; Environment protection; Environmental and economic performance; Pollution emissions; Regression method; Transmit channels; Emission control; competition (economics); economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; environmental protection; incentive; local government; article; China; competition; crowding (area); economic development; empirical research; government; sensitivity analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088646682

To illustrate the effectiveness of the model, we take the energy Internet in Yanqing district of Beijing as an example for simulation. The results show that the total CO2 emission reduction of this energy Internet will reach 5056.82 tons in 2019, and the emission reduction will continue to increase in the following years, the total amount of CO2 emission reduction peaked at 13384.80 tons in 2030. We conclude: (1) The CO2 emission reduction dynamic assessment model established in this paper has a strong versatility and can be applied to any built or planned energy Internet. (2) Energy Internet has a good long term effect in emission reduction. (3) The emission reduction of the supply side is the most obvious; the user side has the greatest potential for emission reduction, while the contribution of the transmission side to emissions reduction is the most stable. The innovation points of this paper mainly include: (1) we put forward and solve the dynamic assessment of carbon emission reduction on the energy Internet for the first time. (2) We establish a dynamic assessment model of CO2 emission reduction in the energy Internet based on system dynamics. (3) We quantitatively analyze the emission reduction contribution of the supply side, transmission side and user side of the energy Internet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic assessment; Emissions reduction; Energy internet; System dynamics","Carbon dioxide; System theory; Transmissions; Carbon emission reductions; CO2 emission reduction; Dynamic assessment; Dynamic assessment models; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Long-term effects; System Dynamics; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088904067

Understanding the factors affecting residents’ green travel behavior is vital to its implementation. This study aims to identify factors that can encourage residents to implement green travel behavior from the perspective of the consciousness-behavior gap. We divided green travel behavior into self-practice green travel behavior (SPGTB) and interpersonal promotion green travel behavior (IPGTB) and examined the consciousness-context-behavior theoretical framework by using a survey (N = 1475), which was sent to urban residents in the east region of China. The findings were as follows. (1) Urban residents adopt more SPGTB than IPGTB, but their green travel behavior implementation levels are lower than their green travel consciousness levels. (2) Both the consciousness and behavior factors have obvious differences on the individual characteristic factors, but their variation trends are the exact opposite. (3) Green travel consciousness had an immediate main effect on green travel behavior, but it varied in the two types of green travel behavior, and there were interaction effects among the part consciousness factors. (4) Internal and external situational factors had significant regulating effects on part consciousness-behavior paths. (5) The Chinese cultural context (“face” culture) displayed significant contextual effects on the relationships between the consciousness factors, situational factors and green travel behaviors. The first three results indicate the existence of consciousness-behavior gap, and the last two explain why the gap exists. Finally, some relevant suggestions are put forward to promote urban residents’ green travel behavior and a high level of consistency in the consciousness and behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consciousness; Face culture; Green travel behavior; Interaction effect; Regulating effect","Emission control; Contextual effects; Cultural context; Energy saving and emission reductions; Individual characteristics; Interaction effect; Level of consistencies; Situational factors; Theoretical framework; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088371909

Methods: It first constructs a theoretical model to explain the effect of air pollution on wage distortions theoretically. Then, based on the measurement of wage distortions of 289 cities from 1998 to 2016, it further uses the Spatial Durbin Model to examine the influences and influencing mechanisms empirically. Results: The results show that labor wages are negatively distorted during the sample period, with the real wages being lower than the marginal product labor (MPL). Besides, local air pollution significantly exacerbates wage distortions through the production input effect that increases MPL, with a 1% increase in air pollution leading to a 0.0842% and 0.1038% increase in wage distortions and MPL, respectively. The spatial spillover effects suggest that air pollution from neighborhoods significantly reduces local wage distortions through the human capital effect that decreases MPL, and the elastic coefficients of neighboring air pollution on wage distortions and MPL are −0.6078 and − 0.8870, respectively. Besides, the heterogeneity test indicates the magnitude and the significance of the impacts vary in the eastern, central, and western regions.

We measured total organic carbon (TOC) and total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS) in sulfate-rich wetland sediments at middle and low elevation saltmarshs along the Yancheng coast, China. Results show that the average TOC concentrations (5.01 ± 2.31 kg C/m3) associated with Spartina sediments in mid elevation sites is much higher than that seen in low elevation mudflats (0.65 ± 0.25 kg C/m3). TRIS concentrations in Spartina sediments ranged from 21.7 ± 11.2 μmol·cm−3 to 3.0 ± 2.0 μmol·cm−3. Within the TRIS pool, elemental sulfur (ES) constituted the lowest fraction (3.6% to 31.4%) and chromium reduced sulfur (CRS) and acid volatile sulfur (AVS) fractions were higher particularly at coasts characterized by siltation, ranging from 29.9% to 62.2% and from 28% to 59%, respectively. AVS or CRS contents correlated positively with dissolved iron/SO42− and pH, while no clear relationship was present between the TRIS fractions and the abundance of sulfate reduction genes or between the TRIS fractions and TOC. Massive pyrite was the dominant authigenic pyrite present at all sites. Our results suggest that with sea level rise, prolonged inundation and rapid siltation would increase TRIS (especially AVS) and TOC accumulation concurrently while coastal erosion and strong waves would reduce both TOC and TRIS accumulation but increase the ES proportion due to exposure to aerobic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Functional gene fragment; Pyrite morphology; Reduced inorganic sulfur; Saltmarsh; Sulfate reduction","Pyrites; Sea level; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Tropics; Wetlands; Acid-volatile sulfurs; Aerobic condition; Coastal wetlands; Elemental sulfur; Sulfate reduction; TOC concentrations; Total Organic Carbon; Wetland sediments; Organic carbon; authigenesis; coastal erosion; coastal wetland; concentration (composition); marine sediment; saltmarsh; sediment analysis; sediment chemistry; siltation; subtropical region; sulfate; total organic carbon; wetland; China; Jiangsu; Yancheng; Spartina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088902668

However, diffusion through the membrane is inevitably affected by the resistance from the polymer matrix, where the carrier is absent. Herein, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based separating layer combining the merits of fixed-site transport agents and inorganic nanofillers was developed to reduce the transport resistance. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different degrees of oxidation were prepared and incorporated into the sulfonic acid (-SO3H)-modified PVA matrix. The resultant composite membrane consisting of a microporous polytetrafluoroethylene substrate and a thin PVA-based separating layer (∼700 nm thick) was subject to pervaporation desalination of sodium chloride solution (35,000 ppm) at 30 °C. The effect of -SO3H as a fixed transport agent in the PVA matrix was first investigated experimentally, showing an increase of water flux by 21.8% compared with a control membrane without the transport agent. Subsequently, the CNT-incorporated FTM exhibited good stability (50 h) and improvement in water transport, which was ∼161% of the control FTM (PVA with -SO3H) without loss of selectivity. Such high and stable performance achieved in the CNT-incorporated FTM originated from the construction of low-resistance transport pathways by CNTs between -SO3H groups as well as their uniform dispersion in the polymer matrix. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

The uniformly distributed Cu nanoparticles are responsible for the high faradaic efficiency of HCOOH of 78% at −1.0 V (RHE) and yield of 82.8 μmol h−1 cm−2 at −1.2 V (RHE). Moreover, the detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that the high activity and selectivity for HCOOH production was attributed to the synergy effects of exposed Cu (111) facets and carbon substrate.

Based on the data of provincial manufacturing patent applications in China from 2004 to 2017, the primary objective of the proposed approach of social network analysis (SNA) is to empirically investigate the structural characteristics of the spatial correlation network and influencing factors. The process for the method is as follows. (1) The spatial metric (specifically, the European distance) is used to measure the similarity between provinces, and SNA is used to construct the spatial correlation network. The minimum spanning tree (MST) method is applied to verify the effectiveness of the construction method, and (2) the characteristics of the spatial correlation network and influencing factors are analyzed by the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP). The results show the following: (1) China's low-carbon innovation exhibits a network structure of spatial correlation, and the spatial correlation network density among thirty provinces in China is as high as 0.3483; (2) spatial spillover effects decrease gradually from China's eastern provinces to the western provinces, and the western and central undeveloped manufacturing provinces mainly receive spillovers from the eastern and central manufacturing provinces; (3) the significant value of the degree of openness is 0.001, indicating that it is the primary influencing factor of the spatial correlation network of China's low-carbon innovation (the correlation degree of the obtained spatial network significantly increases as the differences in the degree of openness decrease), and the difference of foreign capital utilization and the difference in the degree of openness show a positive correlation. The major focus/achievement described in the paper is that China's manufacturing exhibit significant characteristics of regional agglomeration and central developed manufacturing provinces, and several eastern provinces exert the primary spatial spillover effect, showing disequilibrium between the eastern and western regions overall. The degree of openness is the main factor that affects the correlation network. This study provides an opportunity for the construction of a cross-regional collaborative mechanism and green innovative development of the spatial correlation network. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Influencing factors; Low-carbon innovation; Quadratic assignment procedure; Social network analysis; Spatial correlation","Carbon; Manufacture; Regional planning; Minimum spanning trees; Positive correlations; Quadratic assignment; Regional collaboration; Regional collaborative; Spatial correlation analysis; Spatial correlations; Structural characteristics; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088152866

The dearth of available land poses considerable challenges for economic development and environmental protection. In order to realize maximum benefits through the optimization of land use structure, land use structure efficiency (LUSE) becomes an important planning guideline for the sustainable development of a region. This paper conducts a case study in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) and investigates the LUSE of the region considering the effect of carbon emissions from 1995 to 2018 by using the slack-based measure with undesirable output (SBM-Undesirable) model and Markov transition probability matrix with spatial effect. The results show that: (1) the average LUSE in the study area is 0.652 when the carbon emissions are not considered, compared with that of 0.569 when the carbon emissions are factored in. The comparative result indicates that carbon emissions have a great impact on the LUSE; (2) the LUSE has a rising trend during the study period (except for 2010) starting with a value of 0.463 in 1995 and ending with a value of 0.671 in 2018. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of the LUSE in the study area has been through a drastic change, with the high-value areas clustered at a single center in 1995 evolving to a multiple-center pattern in 2018; (3) High LUSE areas have a positive spillover effect on its neighboring areas, while low LUSE areas have negative spillover effects. The results can provide insights into the optimization of land use structure and the efficient utilization of land resources. This study also suggests that policy makers should optimize the industrial structure and propose policy initiatives oriented towards goals of energy-saving and emission reduction to facilitate regional planning and sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Land use structure efficiency; Markov transition probability; SBM-Undesirable model; The middle reaches of the yangtze river","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Planning; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Energy saving and emission reductions; Industrial structures; Land-use structures; Markov transition probability matrix; Planning guidelines; Positive spillovers; Slack-based measures; Yangtze river , China; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088217970

These highly biodiverse and carbon-dense ecosystems have multi-faceted value, providing critical goods and services to millions living in coastal communities and making significant contributions to global climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and storage. Despite their many values, mangrove loss continues to be widespread in many regions due primarily to anthropogenic activities. Accessible, intuitive tools that enable coastal managers to map and monitor mangrove cover are needed to stem this loss. Remotely sensed data have a proven record for successfully mapping and monitoring mangroves, but conventional methods are limited by imagery availability, computing resources and accessibility. In addition, the variable tidal levels in mangroves presents a unique mapping challenge, particularly over geographically large extents. Here we present a new tool—the Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology (GEEMMM)—an intuitive, accessible and replicable approach which caters to a wide audience of non-specialist coastal managers and decision makers. The GEEMMM was developed based on a thorough review and incorporation of relevant mangrove remote sensing literature and harnesses the power of cloud computing including a simplified image-based tidal calibration approach. We demonstrate the tool for all of coastal Myanmar (Burma)—a global mangrove loss hotspot—including an assessment of multi-date mapping and dynamics outputs and a comparison of GEEMMM results to existing studies. Results—including both quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessments and comparisons to existing studies—indicate that the GEEMMM provides an accessible approach to map and monitor mangrove ecosystems anywhere within their global distribution. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the impact of machine-induced compaction on the methane (CH4) uptake in the absence of the growing crop is not known. Emission of CH4 from soil to the atmosphere through anthropogenic activities plays a significant role in global climate change. Thus, a NT compaction experiment was established at the Waterman Farm of the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, in 1997, to study the long-term impact of the growing season traffic on non-growing season methane emission under NT farming. The levels of traffic included: control (no passages with additional axle loads; VT-0), two (VT-2) and four (VT-4) additional passages of 2.5 Mg water wagon axle load to cover the entire plot. To study the CH4 uptake capacity of soil under NT in relation to natural soils, three locations were also selected from the adjoining woodlot (WL). The CH4 emissions of soil were monitored between November 16, 2016 and May 30, 2017. CH4 emissions ranged from −8.54 to 5.06 mg m−2 day−1 with mean of −0.97, −0.45, −1.31 and −4.46 mg CH4 m−2 day−1 for VT-0, VT-2, VT-4 and WL, respectively. The CH4 uptake was higher in soil under WL -4.85, and −3.07 mg CH4 m−2 day−1 during winter and spring seasons, respectively than under other treatments. The VT-2 treatment recorded the highest CH4 emission (0.55 mg CH4 m−2 day−1) during winter and the lowest soil CH4 uptake (−1.19 mg CH4 m−2 day−1) during the spring season. At end of the study, the cumulative uptake of CH4 was reduced under VT-2 by 911% and 122% as compared to that in soil of WL (5.36 CH4 kg ha−1) and VT-0 (1.18 CH4 kg ha−1), respectively. The radiative forcing (RF) i.e. greatest net CH4 emissions were observed under VT-4. The study concluded that long-term (&gt;20 years) use of 2 or 4 additional passages of traffic 2.5 Mg axle load under NT farming reduced the oxidation and uptake rate of CH4 in comparison to that of soil under NT and WL, which may consequently reduce the CH4 mitigation potential of NT soils. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Mechanized conservation agriculture; Methane uptake; No-till; Radiative forcing; Soil compaction; Woodlot soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089478924

Although volatiles involved in defense and pollinator attraction are primarily emitted from leaves and flowers, respectively, they will co-evolve if their underlying genetic basis is intrinsically linked, due either to pleiotropy or to genetic linkage. However, direct evidence of co-evolving defense and floral traits is scarce. We characterized intraspecific variation of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), the key components of indirect defense against herbivores, and floral volatiles in wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. We found that variation of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene contributed to the correlated changes in HIPVs and floral volatiles among N. attenuata natural accessions. Intraspecific variations of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene emissions resulted from allelic variation of two genetically co-localized terpene synthase genes, NaTPS25 and NaTPS38, respectively. Analyzing haplotypes of NaTPS25 and NaTPS38 revealed that allelic variations of NaTPS25 and NaTPS38 resulted in correlated changes of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene emission in HIPVs and floral volatiles in N. attenuata. Together, these results provide evidence that pleiotropy and genetic linkage result in correlated changes in defenses and floral signals in natural populations, and the evolution of plant volatiles is probably under diffuse selection. © 2020 The Authors.

A series of public administration studies take the field of environmental policy as an important background for understanding collaborative governance, yet the theoretical and empirical study of environmental collaborative governance is relatively under-developed. This article begins to fill the research lacuna through the investigation of air pollution collaborative governance practice in Jing-Jin-Ji and surrounding areas. Based on the panel data of 58 regional cities from January 2016 to March 2019, a difference in difference quasi-natural experiment design is employed to explore the effect of environmental collaboration under Chinese authoritarian regime. The analysis shows that environmental collaboration has a positive impact on air quality and exhibits different effects on primary and secondary pollutants. Specifically, it has a greater influence on the emission reduction of NO2 compared to SO2 and CO, the positive effects of environmental collaboration on PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants are significant, and there is no statistically positive impact on O3 control. The time trend effect of environmental collaboration varies among pollutants, it presents positive effects on air quality improvement and secondary pollutant control (e.g., PM2.5, PM10) after the fourth month, the mitigation effect of environmental collaboration on primary pollutants represented by NO2 is more significant and constant in the sixth month. However, the time trend effect of environmental collaboration has gradually weakened.

With a focus on carbon emission reduction, a bi-level multi-objective optimization model for co-combustion of municipal solid waste and coal under an uncertain environment is used. The model considers not only the relationship between the authority as the leader and the coal-fired power plants as the followers, but also the trade-off between social welfare and allocation satisfaction. Fuzzy theory is applied to deal the imprecise activities and observations during co-combustion. A practical case in Sichuan Province, China is given to verify the efficiency and practicality of the proposed optimization method. The ε-constraint method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are employed to optimize the global equilibrium. Various scenarios are then analyzed and discussed, from which it is found that the decision makers can develop better strategy in accordance with the attitudes towards dioxin emissions and allocation satisfaction. This method was found to be capable of reducing carbon emissions by 6.96 ×105 tonnes and disposing of 1.28×106 tonnes of MSW compared with coal combustion alone. It also indicates that additional allocations would be given to coal-fired power plants with cleaner production. Management recommendations for both decision makers are given to provide support in achieving better MSW management strategies and realizing sustainable development. Given the complexity of co-combustion, this model cannot fully capture all parameters; therefore, a more comprehensive model that includes other toxic emissions such as trace metals is to be developed in future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level multi-objective model; Carbon emission reduction; Co-combustion; Coal; Municipal solid waste","Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Multiobjective optimization; Municipal solid waste; Planning; Sustainable development; Trace elements; Waste incineration; Bi-level multi-objective programming; Carbon emission reductions; Coal-fired power generation; Coal-fired power plant; Epsilon-constraint method; Karush Kuhn tucker condition; Multi-objective optimization models; Uncertain environments; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087962455

Understanding the age dynamics of forest RUEs and their drivers is vital for assessing the trade-offs between forest functions and resource consumption, making rational management policy, and projecting ecosystem carbon dynamics. Here we used the FLUXNET2015 and AmeriFlux datasets and published literature to explore the age-dependent variability of forest light use efficiency (LUE) and inherent water use efficiency as well as their main regulatory variables in temperate regions. Our results showed that evergreen forest RUEs initially increased before reaching the mature stage (i.e., around 90 years old), and then gradually declined; in contrast, RUEs continuously increased with age for mature deciduous forests. Changing canopy photosynthetic capacity (Amax) was the primary cause of age-related changes in RUEs across temperate forest sites. More importantly, soil nitrogen (N) increased in mature deciduous forests through time but decreased in older evergreen forests. The age-dependent changes in soil N were closely linked with the age dynamics of Amax for mature temperate forests.

Previous studies focused on the relationship between urbanization and air pollutants in China. However, the relationship between urbanization and industrial or domestic pollutants remains unclear. In this paper, we used the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model to examine whether an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) relationship exists between urbanization and pollutant emissions, including industrial wastewater, industrial SO2, industrial soot (dust), and domestic garbage based on panel data for 277 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2015. We found that industrial soot (dust) emissions and domestic garbage increased by 83.0% and 43.5%, respectively, whereas industrial wastewater discharge and SO2 emissions decreased by 7.4% and 10.5%, respectively. The identified inverted U-shaped relationship between the urbanization ratio (i.e., percentage of the population living in urban areas) and industrial pollutants supports the EKC hypothesis. However, the domestic garbage volume increased with increasing urbanization ratio. In the future, more attention should be paid to the prevention and control of domestic pollution. In addition, small and medium-sized cities should reduce pollutant emissions and determine effective ways to achieve sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","EKC; Pollutant emissions; STIRPAT; Urban sustainability; Urbanization","atmospheric pollution; emission; emission control; environmental economics; Kuznets curve; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urbanization; article; attention; China; city; soot; stochastic model; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; waste water; air pollutant; China; pollutant; urbanization; China; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Environmental Pollutants; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088841340

These scenarios—at 123, 65, 60.5, 56, 20, and 0.5 kyr BP—showed that the SCS functioned as an oceanographic interface between the Pacific and Indian oceans during the LGC. A Late Pleistocene paleo-river delta (Hainan delta) offshore west of Hainan Island (China) was an important sediment routing system on the NW shelf of the SCS. To understand the origin of the Hainan delta better, paleo-reliefs of DEM56kyrBP and DEM65kyrBP were reconstructed, using seismic stratigraphy, sedimentology, and back-stripping methods. Geostatistical and geometric models of clinoforms and delta geometry, as well as the courses of the reconstructed paleo-distributary channels and paleo-river valleys, supported the interpretation that most delta sediment could be regarded as erosional products from Hainan Island. We hypothesized that an intensification of sediment supply outpaced SL rise during the Marine Isotopic Stages 4/3 transition, resulting in a normal regression during the formation of the Hainan delta. Morphodynamic modeling and meteorological data reanalysis further supported our interpretation that shifts in the Asian Monsoon system—combined with local meteorological effects on Hainan Island and with global SL changes—were the main drivers for the sediment source-to-sink systems at the NW SCS continental margin, during the LGC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","East-Asian monsoon system; Hainan delta; Northwestern Shelf of the South China Sea; Paleo-geographic scenarios; Sea-level dynamics","carbon sink; continental margin; Last Glacial; Milankovitch cycle; modeling; monsoon; paleogeography; sea level change; sediment transport; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091993578

This paper aimed to analyze the effectiveness of provincial environmental regulation (both formal and informal) on the industrial solid waste emission reduction. The results show that both the effect of formal and informal environmental regulations on industrial solid waste emission intensity present an inverted “U” shape. The threshold value of per capita GDP as an indicator variable is CNY 16,299 and CNY 15,572 respectively. The effect on pollution emission reduction will appear when the value is higher than the threshold, and the two-way transmission mechanism between formal and informal environmental regulations does exist. When GDP per capita exceeds CNY 27,961, there is a phenomenon of “rebound” in the effect of informal environmental regulation on pollution reduction. Based on the findings, it was suggested that both formal and informal environmental regulation should be promoted to achieve the goal of industrial solid waste emission reduction. The coordination between formal and informal environmental regulation should be considered when the government makes policies. Different environmental regulation policies should be implemented in different regions. Informal regulation should be enriched and further promoted. Environmental law should play an important role in maintaining the public’s participation in environmental regulation to prevent the failure of informal environmental regulation. © 2020 by the authors.

The underpinning knowledge of key phenomena of fuel-air mixture formation, ignition, combustion, and pollutant formation, however, is lacking at present. This work investigated the ignition and combustion interaction processes between two consecutive jets of iso-octane (gasoline surrogate) and n-heptane (diesel surrogate) inside a quiescent steady environment with an ambient density of 22.8 kg/m3, an O2 concentration of 21 vol % but with ambient temperatures of 950 and 780 K, respectively. Three injection schedules were tested, consisting of a double injection that follows a pilot-main injection duration (2.6 ms/6.5 ms) with dwell times of 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 ms, in addition to single injections with long (9.1 ms) and short (2.6 ms) injection durations as reference cases. Combined high-speed schlieren imaging, pressure trace measurements, combustion luminosity detection using photodiode and closed-homogeneous reactor simulations revealed that under the 950 K condition for iso-octane and 780 K condition for n-heptane, pilot-injection-induced local temperature and flame intermediate changes can considerably affect the preignition reactions of the main injections that followed. It is also found that the interaction effects are dependent on the ignition and combustion characteristics of the fuels involved as well as the temporal separation between the injections. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Diesel engines; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Heptane; Polyols; Reaction intermediates; Combustion characteristics; Compression ignition; Injection durations; Interaction effect; Interaction process; Pollutant formation; Reactor simulation; Temporal separation; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096811299

A conventional HVAC system – water chiller + gas boiler (WB) system was also simulated. The results showed that the hybrid system would provide a better indoor comfort and remains at the thermal comfort class I, and the hybrid system would incur a 14.5% lower cost but would provide 43.2% more energy saving. The hybrid GSHP system could reduce 20.23 tons of CO2 emission, while 1.39 tons more SO2, 0.39 tons more NOx and 9.70 tons more Ash emissions could be produced. Overall, the hybrid system performance evaluation result (SPER) was 0.966, and the WB system was 0.746.

The ""Beautiful China"" strategy, launched by the Chinese government in 2020, requires that all cities in China attain 35 μg/m3 or below for annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) by 2035. Meanwhile, China adopts a portfolio of low-carbon policies to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledged in the Paris Agreement. Previous studies demonstrated the cobenefits to air pollution reduction from implementing low-carbon energy policies. Pathways for China to achieve dual targets of both air quality and CO2mitigation, however, have not been comprehensively explored. Here, we couple an integrated assessment model and an air quality model to evaluate air quality in China through 2035 under the NDC scenario and an alternative scenario (Co-Benefit Energy [CBE]) with enhanced low-carbon policies. Results indicate that some Chinese cities cannot meet the PM2.5target under the NDC scenario by 2035, even with the strictest end-of-pipe controls. Achieving the air quality target would require further reduction in emissions of multiple air pollutants by 6 to 32%, driving additional 22% reduction in CO2emissions relative to the NDC scenario. Results show that the incremental health benefit from improved air quality of CBE exceeds 8 times the additional costs of CO2mitigation, attributed particularly to the cost-effective reduction in household PM2.5 exposure.

Future climate change is expected to affect forest growth and thus modify biological rotation age, but knowledge about the effect of climate change on the rotation for both timber production and carbon storage remains limited from process-based growth model. The biological rotation age (BRA) of Larix olgensis plantations in China is technically set for 40 years according to the principle of maximizing timber production, and it is necessary to further examine the BRA with consideration of site quality differences and climate change. On the basis of 164 sample plots from the National Forest Inventory across the Jilin Province, Northeast China, we use the process-based model 3-PGmix to simulate the change of the BRA of Larix olgensis plantations for timber production and carbon storage under climate change. Different climate scenarios are investigated across different site productivity levels. Under the current climate scenario, the BRAs for timber production and carbon storage are approximately 23.8–41.5 years and 25.0–46.4 years, respectively. The BRAs are reduced by 2–9 years under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios. The BRA modification by climate change was site-dependent, and stands with good productivity sites led to shorter BRAs than those with poor productivity sites. The 3-PGmix model effectively simulates the dynamic change of stand volume and biomass for larch plantations. Future climate change with rising temperature, increased precipitation and elevated CO2 concertration is conducive to the growth of stand volume and carbon storage in the order of RCP 8.5 &gt; RCP 4.5 &gt; current. Results can provide scientific implications for adaptive management of Larix olgensis plantations, and shorter biological rotation is suggested for rotation modification under the future climate change in the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3-PGmix model; Biological rotation; Carbon storage; Climate change; Timber production","Climate models; Forestry; Productivity; Rotation; Timber; Adaptive Management; Climate scenarios; Larch plantations; National forest inventories; Process-based modeling; Rising temperatures; Site productivity; Timber production; Climate change; adaptive management; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; coniferous tree; environmental factor; forest management; forestry production; growth; growth modeling; model; China; Jilin; Larix; Larix gmelinii var. olgensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090920396

Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the factors influencing SOC in coffee plantations are necessary for the development of sound land management practices to prevent land degradation and minimize SOC losses. This study was conducted in the main coffee-growing regions of Yunnan; SOC concentrations and storage of shaded and unshaded coffee systems were assessed in the top 40 cm of soil. Relationships between SOC concentration and factors affecting SOC were analysed using multiple linear regression based on the forward and backward stepwise regression method. Factors analysed were soil bulk density (&amp;rho;b), soil pH, total nitrogen of soil (N), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual moisture (MAM), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and elevations (E). Akaike's information criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and residual sum of squares (RSS) were used to describe the accuracy of multiple linear regression models. Results showed that mean SOC concentration and storage decreased significantly with depth under unshaded coffee systems. Mean SOC concentration and storage were higher in shaded than unshaded coffee systems at 20-40 cm depth. The correlations between SOC concentration and &amp;rho;b, pH and N were significant. Evidence from the multiple linear regression model showed that soil bulk density (&amp;rho;b), soil pH, total nitrogen of soil (N) and climatic variables had the greatest impact on soil carbon storage in the coffee system. &amp;copy; 2021 The Author(s).

Sealing formation (caprock) integrity is considered a key risk factor, because of the potential for leaked CO2 or brine migrating into shallow groundwater formations. The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate general caprock sealing efficiency and integrity under typical CO2-EOR conditions, by assessing the influence of hydrological and mineralogical heterogeneity, possible mineralogical alteration, and potential failure of rock due to hydrological and mineralogical changes. An active CO2-EOR project at the Farnsworth Unit (FWU) in the northern Texas is selected as a case study. A coupled reactive-transport-geomechanics model of the FWU caprock (the Morrow Shale and the Thirteen Fingers Limestone) was developed based on site-specific geological data. Key results suggest that the Thirteen Fingers Limestone is an effective caprock. After 5,000 years, effectively no supercritical CO2 penetrates this formation, and the penetration depth of dissolved CO2 in aqueous phase does not exceed 10 m. Because of mineral precipitation in the Morrow Shale, maximum porosity decreases ~25% at the reservoir-caprock interface, suggesting increased caprock sealing efficiency. Geomechanical response of the caprock due to CO2 intrusion and mineral alteration suggests low risk of induced fractures. This study provides a refined evaluation of long-term caprock integrity as a function of coupled hydrological, chemical, and geomechanical processes and is intended to support future assessment of feasibility and safety of geologic CO2 sequestration. ©2020.

For the first time, we report the concurrent construction of the well-defined molecular sieving architectures and tunable surface charges of nanofiltration membranes through precisely controlled release of the nanocapsule decorated polyethyleneimine and carbon dioxide. This novel strategy not only substantially shortens the fabrication process but also leads to impressive performance (permeance up to 37.4 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 together with a rejection 98.7% for Janus Green B-511 Da) that outperforms most state-of-art nanofiltration membranes.

This paper presents the results of a decision-making competition game model involving governments and heterogeneous agricultural enterprises based on bounded rationality. The impact of government on the emission reduction behavior of agricultural enterprises was evaluated. The study revealed that the speed of price adjustment and subsidy intensity may alter the system stability and lead to chaos, with the price adjustment speed having a more sensitive influence on the system than the subsidy intensity adjustment speed. In addition, certain parameters (pe and r0) affected the system stability, decision variables, and the profits made by government and agricultural enterprises. When the parameters became harmful to enterprises and governments, the system fell into chaos and the stable region increased in the direction of the subsidy intensity adjustment speed. Finally, the chaos in the agricultural supply chain was successfully controlled by the delayed feedback control method. © 2020","Bounded rationality; Chaos; Decision-making game; Government subsidy intensity; Nitrogen emission reduction","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Behavioral research; Competition; Decision making; Emission control; Feedback control; Supply chains; Agricultural enterprise; Agricultural supply chains; Bounded rationality; Complexity analysis; Delayed feedback control method; Government subsidies; Intensity adjustment; Supply chain systems; System stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089943259

Whereas titanium oxide has been widely used for photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H2 evolution, and CO2 reduction, few studies have been devoted to TiO2-based photocatalytic valorization of biomass or biomass-derived platform compounds. Here, we report on surface-controlled photocatalysis of TiO2 for selective valorization of furfurals and vanillin that are lignocellulose-derived key platform compounds. The reaction can be switched from hydrogenation of aldehyde group to C–C coupling by manipulating exposed facets; furanic and aromatic alcohols or coupling products, which are fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors, could be produced with high selectivity. Our studies elucidate that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species and thus controls product selectivity. The present work offers an example of selectivity control by engineering TiO2 surfaces for valorization of biomass-derived feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Photocatalysis has emerged as a useful approach to the sustainable production of value-added products from biomass, in which selectivity is the key issue because a number of transformations are possible when multifunctional biochemicals are the reactants. As one of the most popular photocatalysts, TiO2 has mainly been applied to reactions like pollutant degradation that concern more about activity than selectivity. The knowledge about selectivity-controlling principles for TiO2 is limited. Here, we report the first illustration of TiO2-based photocatalysis that succeeds in modulating product selectivity in bioplatform transformations. Fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors have been produced in high yields by controlling the density of oxygen vacancies on TiO2, which governs surface adsorption and reaction and thus determines the product selectivity. This work offers useful insights into the design of selective photocatalysts for biomass valorization by surface engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Wang and colleagues found that the selectivity for photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulose-derived platform chemicals including furfural, methyl furfural, and vanillin depended strongly on the exposed facet of TiO2. They demonstrated that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species, and thus determines product selectivity. Hydrogenation products such as fine chemicals and coupling products as biofuel precursors can be produced in high yields over oxygen-vacancy-rich and oxygen-vacancy-free TiO2 surfaces, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","biomass-derived platforms; photocatalysis; SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; selectivity control; surface engineering; titanium oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094585594

However, their potential application in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains very challenging because metal clusters tend to drive the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In this study, we prepared Fe-cluster sites with positive valence anchored on ordered mesoporous carbon materials for use as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst in carbon dioxide electroreduction. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits high selectivity, with a CO faradaic efficiency of higher than 98% at a low overpotential of 0.37 V, and retains 98.5% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis in 0.5 M KHCO3. In addition, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits enhanced selectivity of more than 95% from -0.5 to -0.8 V in 0.1 M KHCO3, has 98.6% CO faradaic efficiency at a low overpotential of 0.49 V, and retains 99% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis, thus outperforming state-of-the-art Fe-N-based single-atom catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the atomic interfaces on the Fe clusters reduce the reaction barrier for the ∗COOH intermediate, thus contributing to the rapid transformation of CO2 molecules and resulting in excellent catalytic performance.

The decision-making process up to March 2018 is described. When the decision to demolish the NRK building and build a new kindergarten at Lø was made, stopping plans for a ZEN pilot project. The decision was based on the wishes of representatives from two kindergartens who were to be co-located in the planned zero emission kindergarten. The paper asks why two different understandings of the needs of the project were established and proposes solutions for avoiding disaffection with projects with high energy and environmental ambitions during the early stages of the development process. Method. An ethnographic process was carried out by the Research Centre for Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (ZEN Centre) in collaboration with Steinkjer Municipality in Norway in 2017 and 2018. The process included participant observation, individual semi-structured interviews and group interviews. Results. During the planning process, the representatives from the kindergartens experienced that they were not heard, and that the needs of the building users were peripheral to the discussions taking place. When the chairmanship of Steinkjer Municipality took the decision to demolish the old NRK building and build a new kindergarten at Lø, the kindergarten representatives finally felt that user needs were in focus. The process is presented and discussed in the form of two main stories. (1) The citizen's story about the kindergarten at Lø, where the kindergarten representatives' reasons for their request for a new, rather than upgraded kindergarten building, are told. (2) The story about the ZEN pilot project in Steinkjer, that is external, and concept based.

This paper is concerned with how those involved in the design and implementation of climate change policy conceptualize risk and uncertainty. Based on interviews with policy and industry elites in Australia, China and the UK, it finds that participants did not distinguish between “risk” and “uncertainty” in their conceptualization of climate threats. For the majority of them, politics was the most significant source of risk and uncertainty in climate policy, but delegation of otherwise political decisions to the market was seen as the best solution. The conclusion suggests that the conceptual distinction between risk and uncertainty is less important, for policy and industry elites, than the need to develop mechanisms that account for both persistent scientific uncertainties as well as interpretive and moral ambiguities in climate policy design and implementation. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Australia; China; Climate policy; risk perception; uncertainty; United Kingdom","climate change; design; environmental policy; policy implementation; regional policy; risk perception; uncertainty analysis; Australia; China; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089022527

Surface mining for coal is one of the most important drivers of land-use change in the region, reducing native forest cover, causing forest fragmentation, eliminating intact soil, and affecting water resources. The Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) has been demonstrated as a successful best practice for restoring forests on mine-impacted landscapes, but little information exists on how the practice will affect hydrologic processes. A study was initiated to examine soil-water movement, as in-situ saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), combined with soil porosity to quantify the potential influence on streamflow of reclaimed mines relative to an unmined, forested control site in eastern Kentucky. We compared different reclamation techniques and time since reclamation to determine the extent to which hydrologic function can be restored. We also simulated evapotranspiration at the watershed scale as a function of reclamation technique for both historical and projected (2050) climate. Results indicate that conventional grassland reclamation critically changes how soil water transitions to streamflow, primarily due to Ksat variability that exceeds that measured for intact and FRA soils. Sites reclaimed using FRA exhibited a soil-water environment that was more similar to the unmined control. However, all reclaimed mine soils were thinner, retained and stored less soil water, and thus could provide less plant-available water during the growing season. The plant-available water stored in reclaimed landscapes may not be sufficient to support forest health and this is exacerbated by projected climate conditions. However, soil development under a combination of FRA techniques has the potential to mitigate this limitation. © 2020 The Authors","Forest Reclamation Approach; Plant available water; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil water; TOPMODEL","Coal deposits; Coal industry; Forestry; Hydraulic conductivity; Land use; Plants (botany); Porosity; Reclamation; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Timber; Water resources; Forest fragmentations; Hydrologic function; Hydrologic modeling; Hydrologic process; Reclaimed mine soils; Resource extraction; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil water movement; Climate change; climate change; forest management; hydraulic conductivity; hydrological modeling; hydrology; invasive species; soil water; streamflow; Article; climate change; controlled study; environmental reclamation; evapotranspiration; forest management; grassland; hydrology; mineland hydrology; physical phenomena; plant growth; priority journal; process model; reforestation; saturated hydraulic conductivity; soil porosity; soil property; soil water content; soil water movement; stream (river); water availability; water flow; watershed; Appalachians; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088149496

Yet there is limited understanding of impacts across U.S. cities, with varying population sizes, and between different climates. This study sought to examine the daily utilization of police and fire department services, during hot days in 23 U.S. cities representing six climate zones using relative risk (RR) and time series analyses of daily police and fire department incidents. The warm season analyses utilized three temperature metrics: daily maximum temperature (TMAX), daily maximum heat index (HIMAX), and the preceding daily minimum temperature (TMIN). Across these cities, the RR of police department incidents on days where TMAX was at or above the 95th percentile significantly increased within a range from 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3%, 6.3%) to 57% (95% CI: 24.5%, 89.7%), compared with a nonhot day. At the same temperature thresholds, the RR of fire department dispatches increased from 6% (95% CI: 3.0%, 8.6%) to 18% (95% CI: 15.2%, 21.6%). These results remained consistent across temperature metrics and consecutive days of extreme heat. The estimated effects of daily maximum temperature, daily maximum heat index, and daily minimum temperature were nonlinear for police and fire department incidents across all cities. These findings inform climate change adaptation strategies, preparing budgets and personnel for emergency agencies to ensure resilience as periods of extreme heat increase in frequency, severity, and duration. ©2020.

Highly energy-efficient buildings have a greater proportion of embodied GHG emissions from material use (55-87%) compared to operational emissions. A new national standard, NS3720:2018 a methodology for greenhouse gas emission calculations for buildings, has harmonised the life cycle assessment (LCA) calculation of environmental impacts arising from Norwegian buildings and has led to an increase in LCAs. This paper aims to collect life cycle GHG emission data on Norwegian building case studies to help form recommendations for national GHG emission requirements and benchmark values that can be used by the Research centre for zero emission neighbourhoods in smart cities (FME ZEN), Futurebuilt and in Norwegian building codes (TEK). To do this, a statistical analysis of a reference sample is carried out to provide bottom-up derived reference values. Empirical life cycle GHG emission data results are collected from Norwegian building case studies in the reference, design and as-built project phases, sampled from Norwegian programmes and research centres such as Futurebuilt, Framtidens Byer, ZEB and ZEN. Altogether 133 Norwegian building cases have been gathered from 2009-2020, covering 1,023,738m2 of heated floor area for 49,360 building users. A functional unit of '1m2 of heated floor area over a building lifetime of 60 years is used. The results show an interquartile range of 240-492 kgCO2eq/m2 or 4-8.2 kgCO2eq/m2/yr, a median of 396 kgCO2eq/m2 or 6.6 kgCO2eq/m2/yr and a mean of 324 kgCO2eq/m2 or 5,4 kgCO2eq/m2/yr for all building typologies in the as-built phase.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can, in combination with several other mitigation technologies, alleviate global warming by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Reducing climate change-related risks via CCS creates another risk, smaller in extent: the risk that some of the stored CO2 leaks out of the storage complex. This article reviews European legislation and evaluates how one of its objectives, that private liabilities of CCS-related leakage risks are not socialized, is ensured. Slight modifications of European legislation are suggested in order to prevent an indefinite liability of CCS operators in case a storage complex turns out to be unexpectedly and unavoidably prone to CO2 leakages.

For climate change researchers, work-related travel – including for conferences and fieldwork – is a major carbon-emitting activity. At the same time, many argue that climate scientists have an important role in curbing their own aviation emissions to align their practices with their assertions in relation to emissions reduction. We examine the tensions between competing professional demands in relation to flying; measure levels of flying by climate and non-climate researchers; assess influences on choices and attitudes; and consider how information provision and structural changes might enable changes in practice. Study 1 entails a large, international survey of flying undertaken by climate change (including sustainability and environmental science) researchers and those from other disciplines (N = 1408). Study 2 tests effects of varying information provision on researchers’ behavioural intentions and policy support to reduce flying (N = 362). Unexpectedly, we find climate change researchers – particularly professors – fly more than other researchers, but are also more likely to have taken steps to reduce or offset their flying. Providing information about the impacts of aviation increases behavioural intentions and support for institutional policies to reduce flying, particularly amongst more pro-environmental respondents. However, while attitudinal factors (e.g., personal norm) predict willingness to reduce flying, structural/social factors (e.g., family commitments, location) are more important in predicting actual flying behaviour. Recent initiatives to develop a low-carbon and more inclusive research culture within climate science and the broader research community thus need to be supported by broader policies and technologies to encourage and enable low-carbon and avoided travel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation; Climate change; Information; Researchers","air transportation; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; fieldwork; information management; public attitude; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092083941

However, it remains unclear how nitrogen (N) deposition has responded to increases and/or decreases in Nr emissions. This study quantitatively assesses temporal and spatial variations in measurements of bulk and calculated dry N deposition in China from 1980 to 2018. A long-term database (1980–2018) shows that bulk N deposition peaked in around 2000, and had declined by 45% by 2016–2018. Recent bulk and dry N deposition (based on monitoring from 2011 to 2018) decreased from 2011 to 2018, with current average values of 19.4 ± 0.8 and 20.6 ± 0.4 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Oxidized N deposition, especially dry deposition, decreased after 2010 due to NOx emission controls. In contrast, reduced N deposition was approximately constant, with reductions in bulk NH4+-N deposition offset by a continuous increase in dry NH3 deposition. Elevated NH3 concentrations were found at nationwide monitoring sites even at urban sites, suggesting a strong influence of both agricultural and non-agricultural sources. Current emission controls are reducing Nr emissions and deposition but further mitigation measures are needed, especially of NH3, built on broader regional emission control strategies. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Ammonia; Atmospheric deposition; Emission control; Reactive nitrogen","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ammonia; Emission control; Nitrogen; Control strategies; Long-term database; Mitigation measures; Monitoring sites; Nitrogen deposition; Non-agricultural sources; Reactive nitrogen; Temporal and spatial variation; Urban growth; reactive nitrogen species; nitrogen; ammonia; ammonium; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission; nitrogen; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban site; agricultural procedures; Article; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; country economic status; dry deposition; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; feasibility study; geographic distribution; human; nitrogen deposition; pollution control; precipitation; priority journal; quantitative study; reduction (chemistry); urban area; agriculture; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; China; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089209092

Uncertain snow and firn densities lead to significant uncertainties in surface mass balances, especially in the interior regions of the ice sheets, such as the East Antarctic Plateau (EAP). Robust field measurements of surface snow density are sparse and challenging due to local noise. Here, we present a snow density dataset from an overland traverse in austral summer 2016/17 on the Dronning Maud Land plateau. The sampling strategy using 1m carbon fiber tubes covered various spatial scales, as well as a high-resolution study in a trench at 79° S, 30° E. The 1m snow density has been derived volumetrically, and vertical snow profiles have been measured using a core-scale microfocus X-ray computer tomograph. With an error of less than 2 %, our method provides higher precision than other sampling devices of smaller volume. With four spatially independent snow profiles per location, we reduce the local noise and derive a representative 1m snow density with an error of the mean of less than 1.5 %. Assessing sampling methods used in previous studies, we find the highest horizontal variability in density in the upper 0.3m and therefore recommend the 1m snow density as a robust measure of surface snow density in future studies. The average 1m snow density across the EAP is 355 kgm-3, which we identify as representative surface snow density between Kohnen Station and Dome Fuji. We cannot detect a temporal trend caused by the temperature increase over the last 2 decades. A difference of more than 10% to the density of 320 kgm-3 suggested by a semiempirical firn model for the same region indicates the necessity for further calibration of surface snow density parameterizations. Our data provide a solid baseline for tuning the surface snow density parameterizations for regions with low accumulation and low temperatures like the EAP. © Author(s) 2020.",,"glacier mass balance; ice sheet; measurement method; precision; sampling; sea level change; snow cover; tomography; uncertainty analysis; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Queen Maud Land",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096003102

Glucose mineralization increased with nutrient addition up to 11.6% with combined N and P application compared with that without nutrient addition. During 100 days of incubation, approximately 4.5% of SOC was mineralized and was stimulated by glucose addition. Glucose and SOC mineralization increased exponentially with dissolved organic C (DOC):NH4+-N, DOC:Olsen P, and microbial biomass (MB)C:MBN ratios. The relative abundances of Clostridia and β-Proteobacteria (r-strategists) were increased with combined C and NP application at the beginning of the experiment, while the relative abundances of Acidobacteria (K-strategists) were enhanced with the exhaustion of available resource at the end of incubation. The bacteria abundance and diversity were negatively related to the DOC:NH4+-N and DOC:Olsen P, which had direct positive effects (+ 0.63) on SOC mineralization. Combined glucose and NP application decreased the network density of the bacterial community. Moreover, P addition significantly decreased the negative associations among bacterial taxa, which suggested that microbial competition for nutrients was alleviated. The relative abundances of keystone species showed significant positive correlations with SOC mineralization in the soils without P application, revealing that microbes increased their activity for mining of limited nutrients from soil organic matter. Hence, bacteria shifted their community composition and their interactions to acquire necessary elements by increasing SOC mineralization to maintain the microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometric balance in response to changes in resource stoichiometry. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Co-occurrence; Element stoichiometry; Keystone species; Microbial community composition; Soil organic C mineralization","agricultural soil; carbon isotope; community composition; keystone species; microbial community; mineralization; nitrogen isotope; organic carbon; phosphorus; soil carbon; stoichiometry; Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Betaproteobacteria; Clostridia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084850691

Yet, how existing and newly-built assets contribute differently to the footprints of transportation infrastructures is not clear. In this paper, we develop a life-cycle approach to quantify the energy and carbon footprints of urban transportation infrastructures over time, with a clear differentiation between existing and newly-built assets. Taking Guangzhou, China as a case study, we evaluate the dynamic footprints of various types of urban transportation infrastructure (roads, subway, and railway) across their life-cycle stages until 2017, and perform a scenario analysis to 2035 to explore future pathways of footprint mitigation. We find that the energy and carbon footprints of road assets built prior to 2005 are around 36 times higher than those of the subway and 5 times higher than those of the railway. However, this situation has begun to shift over 2006–2017 as the subway and railway have become more popular means of transportation and bigger contributors to the city's energy and carbon footprints. The pace of technological advances in building transportation infrastructure needs to exceed that of the average urban economy to steadily reduce the energy and carbon footprints of the new projects planned. These findings offer a dynamic life-cycle approach and tool to evaluate long-term regulatory policies toward a more sustainable transportation infrastructure system in cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Energy footprint; Life-cycle analysis; Scenario analysis; Urban transportation infrastructure","Artificial life; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Life cycle; Railroads; Guangzhou , China; Life cycle approach; Low-carbon cities; Means of transportations; Regulatory policies; Sustainable transportation; Technological advances; Transportation infrastructures; Urban transportation; advanced technology; carbon footprint; energy efficiency; life cycle analysis; mitigation; railway; scenario analysis; transportation infrastructure; urban transport; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089011500

Since then several other researchers have termed it MILD, Flameless or Distributed combustion and they all show much similarities with the HiTAC. This review underlines that the technology was developed through a cooperation between the Japanese government (NEDO, METI) and Nippon Furnace Kogyo (Japan) as well as the key role played by the University of Maryland (USA) and the International Flame Research Foundation (IFRF – the Netherlands). Tokyo Gas (Japan) also provided an important role, although indirect, in the development. The HiTAC technology development was revolutionary with simultaneous demonstration on significant energy savings (some 25%), reduced equipment size, much reduced pollution (50%, including CO2), and noise in industrial furnaces. The technology is now widely used in many modern industrial furnaces worldwide. Per METI some 39,000 HiTAC burners in 7867 industrial furnaces were installed worldwide that showed fuel savings of 1721 billion liters of crude oil/year. It is estimated that 68 Billion liters/year of fuel oil savings and 180 Billion tons/year of CO2 reduction will be realized by 2030 through the use of HiTAC technology in industrial furnaces. This revolutionary technology continues to be adapted by many countries worldwide. The authors provide a brief review on the HiTAC technology development and give their views on its potential applications on the horizon that will also contribute to cleaner and efficient combustion in many other applications, besides industrial furnaces. These include high intensity gas turbine combustion, portable power, and engines.

Yet, for coastal habitats this approach is often constrained by a) sufficient and relevant habitat extent data and b) significant variability in baseline assessments used to quantify and value regulatory habitat services. Here, the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitat classification scheme is used to map seven key temperate coastal biotopes (littoral sediment, mat-forming green macroalgae, subtidal sediment, saltmarsh, seagrass, reedbeds and native oyster reefs) within the UK's Solent European Marine Site (SEMS). We then estimate the capacity of these biotopes to remove nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and carbon (C), alongside monetary values associated with the resulting benefits. Littoral and sublittoral sediments (including those combined with macroalgae) were the largest contributors to total N, P and C removal, reflecting their large biotope area. However, our results also show considerable differences in relative biotope contributions to nutrient removal depending on how they are analysed and delineated over large spatial scales. When considered at a regional catchment level seagrass meadows, saltmarshes and reedbeds all had considerable N, P and C removal potential. Overall, we estimate that SEMS biotopes provide nutrient reductions and avoided climate damages equivalent to UK £1.1 billion, although this could be nearly £10 billion if water-treatment infrastructure costs and high carbon trading prices are utilised. Despite the variability in the final natural capital evaluations, the substantial regulatory value of N, P and C ecosystem services support a strong rational for restoring temperate coastal biotopes. © 2020","Carbon burial; Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; EUNIS mapping; Natural capital; Nutrient regulation","Carbon; Classification (of information); Climate change; Costs; Emission control; Nutrients; Plants (botany); Sediments; Water quality; Water treatment; Baseline assessment; Classification approach; Ecosystem services; Habitat classification; Infrastructure costs; Nutrient reduction; Spatially explicit; Subtidal sediments; Ecosystems; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; biotope; carbon; climate change; ecosystem service; habitat restoration; marine environment; nitrogen; phosphorus; temperate environment; water quality; Article; bioremediation; biotope; capital; catchment area (hydrology); classification; climate change; coastal waters; conceptual framework; information system; littoral; macroalga; marine environment; native species; nonhuman; oyster; priority journal; seagrass; sediment; separation technique; species habitat; United Kingdom; vegetation; water management; water quality; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088366922

However, in some countries other aspects increasing the role of renewable energy production are also present. Such a country is Ukraine, which is not self-sufficient in energy supply and whose dependency on poorly diversified import of energy carriers regularly leads to political tensions and has socio-economic implications. Production of agricultural biogas seems to be a way to both slow down climatic changes and increase energy self-sufficiency by replacing or complementing conventional sources of energy. One of the most substantial barriers to agricultural biogas production is the low level of agricultural concentration and significant economies of scale in constructing biogas plants. The aim of the paper was thus to assess the potential of agricultural biogas production in Ukraine, including its impact on energy self-sufficiency, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the economic performance of biogas plants. The results show that due to the prevailing fragmentation of farms, most manure cannot be processed in an economically viable way. However, in some regions utilization of technically available manure for agricultural biogas production could cover up to 11% of natural gas or up to 19% of electricity demand. While the theoretical potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions could reach 5% to 6.14%, the achievable technical potential varies between 2.3% and 2.8% of total emissions. The economic performance of agricultural biogas plants correlates closely with their size and bioenergy generation potential. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, by incorporating the multi-principal element feature of compositionally complex alloys, we develop the concept of lightweight steels further and propose a new class of compositionally complex steels (CCSs). This approach allows us to use the high solid solution strengthening and shift the alloys' compositions into previously unattainable phase regions where both nanosized shearable κ-carbides and non-shearable B2 particles are simultaneously formed. The achievement of dual-nanoprecipitation in our CCSs leads to materials with ultrahigh specific tensile strength (up to 260 MPa·cm3 g-1) and excellent tensile elongation (13 to 38%), a combination outperforming all other high-strength high-entropy alloys and advanced lightweight steels. Our concept of CCSs is thus useful for guiding the design of ultrastrong lightweight metallic materials.

The imagery is simulated for one imager of the Copernicus mission on Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) planned by the European Space Agency and the European Commission. The width of the swath of the CO2M instruments is about 300 km and the ground horizontal resolution is about 2 km resolution. A Plume Monitoring Inversion Framework (PMIF) is developed, relying on a Gaussian plume model to simulate the XCO2 plumes of each emission clump and on a combination of overlapping assimilation windows to solve for the inversion problem. The inversion solves for the 3 h mean emissions (during 08:30-11:30 local time) before satellite overpasses and for the mean emissions during other hours of the day (over the aggregation between 00:00-08:30 and 11:30-00:00) for each clump and for the 366 d of the year. Our analysis focuses on the derivation of the uncertainty in the inversion estimates (the ""posterior uncertainty"") of the clump emissions. A comparison of the results obtained with PMIF and those from a previous study using a complex 3-D Eulerian transport model for a single city (Paris) shows that the PMIF system provides the correct order of magnitude for the uncertainty reduction of emission estimates (i.e., the relative difference between the prior and posterior uncertainties). Beyond the one city or few large cities studied by previous studies, our results provide, for the first time, the global statistics of the uncertainty reduction of emissions for the full range of global clumps (differing in emission rate and spread, and distance from other major clumps) and meteorological conditions. We show that only the clumps with an annual emission budget higher than 2 MtC yr-1 can potentially have their emissions between 08:30 and 11:30 constrained with a posterior uncertainty smaller than 20% for more than 10 times within 1 year (ignoring the potential to cross or extrapolate information between 08:30-11:30 time windows on different days). The PMIF inversion results are also aggregated in time to investigate the potential of CO2M observations to constrain daily and annual emissions, relying on the extrapolation of information obtained for 08:30-11:30 time windows during days when clouds and aerosols do not mask the plumes, based on various assumptions regarding the temporal auto-correlations of the uncertainties in the emission estimates that are used as a prior knowledge in the Bayesian framework of PMIF.We show that the posterior uncertainties of daily and annual emissions are highly dependent on these temporal auto-correlations, stressing the need for systematic assessment of the sources of uncertainty in the spatiotemporally resolved emission inventories used as prior estimates in the inversions. We highlight the difficulty in constraining the total budget of CO2 emissions from all the cities and power plants within a country or over the globe with satellite XCO2 measurements only, and calls for integrated inversion systems that exploit multiple types of measurements. © 2020 Author(s).",,"atmospheric plume; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data assimilation; industrial emission; point source pollution; satellite altimetry; uncertainty analysis; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097152373

The discussion starts with an introduction of the different types of SAECs, followed by an overview of the synthetic methodologies to control the atomic dispersion of metal sites and atomically resolved characterization using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In recognition of the extensive applications of SAECs, the electrocatalytic studies are dissected in terms of various important electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Examples of SAECs are deliberated in each case in terms of their catalytic performance, structure-property relationships, and catalytic enhancement mechanisms.

A theoretically coupled δ13Ccarb-δ13Corg pattern due to such dubbed global carbon-cycle event from the negative CIE in Dotternhausen Toarcian stratigraphic profile (southwest Germany) is unexpectedly disturbed by two-step δ13Ccarb-δ13Corg decoupling in which the last step, upper in the stratigraphic order, is of higher magnitude. However, the trigger(s) for these sudden decoupling disturbances are still poorly constrained. Here, connecting new carbon and oxygen isotope data with documentary lipid biomarkers shows that the global carbon cycle during the Toarcian OAE was disturbed by enhanced green sulfur bacteria (GSB) metabolisms and early diagenesis at local scales. The first step δ13Ccarb-δ13Corg decoupling was induced in the initial stage of the GSB bloom. The second step of much larger δ13Ccarb-δ13Corg decoupling arising from a GSB prosperity was, however, exaggerated by early diagenesis through the respiration of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB).

Here, a series of CONs was synthesized by embedding single cobalt sites that were then evaluated for photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. A partially fluorinated, cobalt-loaded CON produced 10.1 μmol carbon monoxide with a selectivity of 76%, over 6 hours irradiation under visible light (TON = 28.1), and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6% under 420 nm irradiation in the presence of an iridium dye. The CONs appear to act as a semiconducting support, facilitating charge carrier transfer between the dye and the cobalt centers, and this results in a performance comparable with that of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts in the literature under similar conditions. The ultrathin CONs outperformed their bulk counterparts in all cases, suggesting a general strategy to enhance the photocatalytic activities of COF materials. © 2020 Macromolecules.

Adolescence is a critical period for neural system development characterized by continuous brain maturation, especially in the prefrontal cortex. The etiology of these adolescent conditions may derive from fetal origin, probably attributed to the adverse effects induced by intrauterine environmental exposure. Anxiety- and depression-like behavior can be induced by gestational exposure to PM2.5 in mice offspring which act as a useful model system. Recent studies show that B-vitamin may alleviate PM2.5-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation- and function-related spatial memory impairment in adolescent mice offspring. However, cortical damage and related neurobehavioral defects induced by gestational PM2.5 exposure, as well as the potential reversibility by interventions in mice offspring require to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate whether B-vitamin would protect mice offspring from the adverse effects derived from gestational exposure to urban PM2.5 on cortical areas to which anxiety and depression are closely related. Pregnant mice were divided into three groups: control group (treated with PBS alone), model group (treated with both PM2.5 and PBS), and intervention group (treated with both PM2.5 and B-vitamin), respectively. The mice offspring were then applied to comprehensive neurobehavioral, ultrastructural, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Interestingly, we observed that gestational PM2.5 exposure led to neurobehavioral defects including anxiety- and depression-like behavior. In addition, neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, increased apoptosis, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Notably, both behavioral and molecular changes could be significantly alleviated by B-vitamin treatment. In summary, our results suggest that the anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational PM2.5 exposure in mice offspring can be ameliorated by B-vitamin supplementation, probably through the suppression of apoptosis, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","B-Vitamin; B-Vitamin ameliorates anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational PM2.5 exposure through suppressing neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex; Depression-like behavior; Neuroinflammation; PM2.5; Prefrontal cortex","Cell death; Chemical activation; Defects; Biological analysis; Brain maturation; Environmental concerns; Environmental exposure; Molecular changes; Neuroinflammation; Oxidative damage; Prefrontal cortex; Mammals; cryopyrin; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; vitamin B group; vitamin; apoptosis; immune response; mental disorder; oxidative stress; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; reproduction; rodent; vitamin; adolescent; air pollutant; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; anxiety disorder; apoptosis; Article; brain cortex; controlled study; depression; environmental exposure; female; male; maternal exposure; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system inflammation; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particle size; particulate matter; prefrontal cortex; progeny; urban area; vitamin supplementation; animal; anxiety; depression; dietary supplement; particulate matter; pregnancy; Mus; Animals; Anxiety; Depression; Dietary Supplements; Female; Mice; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Vitamins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087677295

However, information about how long-term conservation tillage affects agroecosystem nitrogen balance in dryland winter wheat-summer maize cropping is limited. Based on a long-term (&gt;9 yr) field tillage experiment and in-situ observation, we assessed the effects of different tillage practices (i.e., chisel plough tillage (CPT), zero tillage (ZT), and conventional ploughing tillage (PT)) on soil nitrogen balance and crop productivity in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 growing seasons. Each tillage practice was exposed to a local widely adopted N application rate (240 kg ha−1 yr−1) in both seasons. Our results indicated that, compared with PT, CPT and ZT significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced N2O emissions by 39.7% (2.8 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and 55.3% (3.9 kg N ha−1 yr−1), and N leaching by 52.3% (11.8 kg N ha−1 yr −1) and 147.7% (33.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1) across the two growing seasons, respectively. CPT significantly enhanced crop aboveground N uptake by 4.0%, and increased the annual crop yield by 5.9–8.1% (0.8–1.2 t ha−1 yr−1). Although CPT and ZT enhanced NH3 volatilization by 46.7% (14.6 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and 84.3% (26.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1), the total N losses under CPT and ZT were decreased on an average by 7.4% and 22.4%, respectively. Overall, CPT and ZT significantly increased the accumulation of soil total nitrogen in the 0–100 cm layer by 34.8 and 54.1 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Taking N inputs and outputs together, CPT achieved a lower N surplus mainly due to increased crop N harvest and reduced N losses including gaseous emissions and hydrological leaching. Our findings suggest that long-term chisel plough tillage in dryland agroecosystems could serve as a promising soil management practice in increasing crop productivity and maintaining sustainability through enhancing N removal from crop biomass and decreasing N losses via N2O emission and nitrate-N leaching. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Conservation tillage; N loss; N2O; NH3; Nitrogen balance","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Ammonia; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Leaching; Nitrogen; Productivity; Soil conservation; Soils; Sustainable development; Tools; Agricultural productions; Conservation tillage; In-situ observations; Long-term conservation; Nitrate-N leaching; Soil management practices; Soil total nitrogen; Tillage practices; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088401986

Co-governance between the central environmental protection department (CEPD) and local environmental protection departments (LEPDs) is an important means to effectively promote China’s carbon emission reduction strategy. Accordingly, this paper discusses their interactive decision-making and investigates how to optimize the strategic relationships between the CEPD, LEPDs, and carbon emission enterprises (CEEs) under the dual governance system by constructing a trilateral evolutionary game model and analyzing evolutionary stability strategies, achieving a numerical experiment simulation of evolution processes and determining the impacts of various factors using MATLAB, leading to several countermeasures and suggestions. The results indicate that the CEPD should rationally use the incentive mechanism for LEPDs, improve the carbon tax system, and further penalize the nepotistic relationship of LEPDs and CEEs. Furthermore, it is essential to reform the current LEPD performance evaluation system and reduce the cost of LEPD positive regulation through subsidies and financial transfer payments. Additionally, the CEE strategy is affected by carbon reduction tax rates, penalties, subsides, and emission reduction costs and revenues. This study reveals the consequences of interactions between CEPD, LEPDs, and CEEs and presents options for the redesign of incentive and regulatory mechanisms to improve carbon emission reduction performance in China. © 2020, MDPI AG.

The thickness of glacial sediments can reach hundreds of meters. These sediments, which have experienced high intensity erosion through glacial transportation, are susceptible to chemical weathering processes because of the increased reactive mineral surfaces induced via erosion. Infiltrated meteoric water will first attack the glacial sediments, becoming (partially) saturated with weathering products, before interacting with the local bedrock underneath. As a consequence, the glacial deposits will hinder the weathering processes of the underlying local bedrock. In this study, we test this hypothesis by imaging the weathered layer of a previously glaciated terrain in the Medicine Bow Mountains, Wyoming using full-3D seismic ambient-noise tomography. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first full-3D seismic velocity model of the Critical Zone structure under a previously glaciated landscape. Our 3D seismic velocity model reveals that the saprolite weathered from local bedrock is thinner where the overlying glacial deposit layer is thicker. This anti-correlation suggests that the glacial deposits may locally protect the underlying bedrock from chemical weathering by depleting reactive chemicals in the meteoric water and (partially) saturate the meteoric water with weathering products. Our study may provide a potential counter mechanism against glaciation-induced acceleration of chemical weathering of the continents, which regulates atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and the global climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ambient-noise tomography; chemical weathering; critical zone; full-3D tomography; glacial subalpine watershed","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Deposits; Erosion; Geochemistry; Glacial geology; Indicators (chemical); Sediments; Seismic waves; Seismology; Ambient noise tomographies; Atmospheric concentration; Chemical weathering; Chemical weathering process; Induced accelerations; Reactive chemicals; Seismic velocity models; Weathering process; Weathering; bedrock; glacial deposit; seismic noise; seismic tomography; seismicity; snow; subalpine environment; terrain; watershed; weathering; Medicine Bow Mountains; Rocky Mountains; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089802728

Trees (51%), shrubs (22%), and ferns (27%) co-existed spatially, and stored 115.30, 2.05, and 5.94 Mg C, respectively, at a ratio of 19.4:0.3:1. On average, a tree, shrub, and fern/palm stored 138.09 ± 333.7, 5.59 ± 6.0, and 13.36 ± 15.5 kg C per plant. The top five carbon-contributing tree species were exotic pines (29.1%), kauri (9.8%), rimu (3.8%), kahikatea (2.9%), and matai (2.1%). Matai should be the choice in revegetation projects to maximise carbon stock given its unparalleled carbon contribution index (17.2). Stem length was totally ineffective in indicating plant carbon, followed by canopy area. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was a better indicator of tree and shrub carbon. Total vegetation carbon would be underestimated by 3.7% if a DBH threshold of ≥10 cm were adopted for trees, and ≥14 cm for shrubs and ferns, all causing the carbon stock of the respective plant type to be underestimated by about 1.60 Mg C. However, these thresholds would reduce the overall sampling load by 47.2%. The established relationship between DBH and cumulative carbon allows calibration of the estimated carbon in accordance with the DBH threshold adopted in sampling different plants. Whether the amount of calibration still holds true in other types of urban plants requires further study. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Auckland; canopy height; Cumulative carbon stock; DBH; urban plant type","biophysics; carbon sequestration; coexistence; greenspace; urban ecosystem; urban planning; vegetation type; woody plant; Auckland [North Island]; Filicophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091787891

Numerous studies have reported that PM concentrations could be accurately predicted from previous days’ meteorological conditions. However, the hysteretic or lagged effects of meteorological factors on PM concentrations are not clear. In this study, the GeoDetector q statistic method was used to quantify the hysteretic influences of meteorological conditions and their interactions on concentrations of PM2.5 (particles &lt; 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and PM10 (particles &lt; 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 (PM2.5/PM10) at multiple spatial and temporal scales in China. We found that the temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity had primary impacts on PM2.5 concentrations, PM10 concentrations, and the PM2.5/PM10 ratios, respectively, at both national and annual time scales. At the seasonal time scale, precipitation and relative humidity had hysteretic effects on PM concentrations in spring and summer, respectively. Moreover, precipitation and wind speed were dominant hysteretic factors in autumn and winter, respectively. At the regional scale, the dominant hysteretic effects of meteorological factors showed large variations across all regional subdivisions. The interactions between any two meteorological factors had an enhanced hysteretic effect on PM concentrations compared to a single factor. These findings could help us to develop scientific measures to reduce the emissions of air pollution and improve the performance of air pollution prediction models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; GeoDetector; Lagged effects; PM10; PM2.5","Aerodynamics; Air pollution; Hysteresis; Predictive analytics; Wind; Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollution predictions; Hysteretic effects; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; PM10 concentration; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial and temporal scale; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088364499

This study investigates the long-term energy security responses to climate change for Ontario from a planning perspective. A regional climate model (RCM) is employed to assess the climate-driven changes in energy sectors at a 25 km × 25 km resolution. Reliable projections of changes in climatic variables are provided to assess their impacts on cooling degree days, heating degree days, and energy availability. Quantified sensitivities of residential and commercial energy consumptions to degree days are incorporated with future projections to estimate energy demand changes. We then estimate the impact of climate change on the primary power sources, including nuclear power, hydropower, gas, wind energy, and solar energy from a capacity planning perspective. Results indicate that winter warms more rapidly than summer in Ontario. This leads to heating degree days decreasing 2 times faster than cooling degree days increasing. Changes in degree days result in an increase in summer electricity demand and a reduction in winter gas consumption. We also find that efficiencies of hydropower and wind energy could be reduced in different scales because of decreased resource availability. The efficiency of nuclear power is sensitive to the temperature rise, but relatively less reduced compared to other energy sources. Solar energy production can benefit from climate change for the perspective of a decrease in rainy and cloudy days. With the increased electricity demand and decreased availability of water and wind resources, more green energy capacities are expected to build to ensure the long-term energy security for Ontario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Dynamical downscaling; Energy capacity; Energy security; RCPs scenarios","Climate models; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Hydroelectric power; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Solar energy; Wind power; Climate change impact; Cooling (heating) degree day; Energy availability; Heating degree-days; Primary power sources; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Resource availability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088147255

To understand their respective roles, a large number of partitioning studies were conducted. However, each of the scattered case studies may only provide local-to-regional understanding of the contributions from climate-induced changes and human-induced changes to streamflow variations over various study periods. To address if it is possible to reveal the relative contribution of climate-induced changes (dQ_CIC) and human-induced changes (dQ_HIC) from the spatially distributed case studies, and then to predict regional to global spatial pattern of streamflow changes due to climate-induced changes, we reviewed 103 studies providing access to 1321 catchment cases, and performed a meta-analysis which characterized how that population varied with the number of catchment cases per study and the length of study period, and analyzed if and to what extent the bias of that population was influenced by various study factors. Possible catchment streamflow change, relative to the 1960s−2000s, was projected for the 2040s–2060s. Our meta-analysis suggested that, over the past decades, total streamflow change (i.e. dQ_Tot), on average, was −11.9 mm.a−1, and streamflow changes due to dQ_CIC and dQ_HIC were + 3.6 ± 48.1 mm.a−1 and −15.5 ± 44.4 mm.a−1, respectively. We also found that several study factors including catchment size, partitioning method, and climate type (mainly mean annual precipitation) were not important sources of bias for the meta-analysis, as they each only explained a small portion of the variability in dQ_CIC or dQ_HIC. Although study periods of the case studies and climate oscillation influenced the magnitude and direction of dQ_CIC (and dQ_HIC), dQ_CIC showed a strongly temporal invariant dependence on dP, with a ratio of 0.48 for the fitted linear line (p &lt; 0.05). The mean changing rate of dQ_CIC (i.e. dQ_CIC/dt) over the past decades was +0.07 ± 4.13 mm.a−2. Our study heightened the imperative to perform analysis with respect to the spatial variation of dQ response to climate perturbations and/or variation across various regions, and to disentangle hydrological contribution of interactions/feedbacks between climate-induced change and land-use/land-cover changes from the other anthropogenic changes in future partitioning studies for a better understanding of dQ response to climate-induced change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic activities; Catchment streamflow changes; Climate-induced change; Hydrological contribution; Meta-analysis; Partitioning studies","Catchments; Factor analysis; Land use; Runoff; Spatial distribution; Stream flow; Anthropogenic changes; Climate oscillation; Land use/land cover change; Mean annual precipitation; Partitioning methods; Relative contribution; Streamflow variations; Temporal invariants; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; catchment; climate effect; climate oscillation; meta-analysis; spatial variation; streamflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091520301

On the premise of ensuring indoor comfort, the cost-effectiveness of solutions for reducing the building's greenhouse gas has become a critical issue. Based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), this paper establishes a building performance trade-off framework for indoor thermal comfort, economics, and environmental implication. This framework consists of four parts: the establishment of the optimization model; sensitivity analysis; obtain of Pareto frontier solutions, and decision-making analysis. Optimization variables involve envelope type and some envelope physical parameters. The “design variables-building performances” database is obtained by using building simulation software combined with the Latin hypercube sampling algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the key factors affecting building performance. The designer can prioritize these key factors and it can reduce the uncertainty of building performance. A multi-objective optimization method coupling Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) and non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm is proposed to seek the trade-off between three performances (obtain Pareto frontier solutions). The Pareto solution provides a more comprehensive reference for the preferences of different stakeholders, and the set of alternative solutions is further shrunk. Finally, take a specific residential building in China's cold climate zone as a showcase of the trade-off framework. According to the obtained Pareto frontier solution, the solution set is shrunk to a certain range, and the distribution ranges of Life Cycle Costs, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the annual thermal discomfort hour ratio are 122.3–137.1 USD/m2, 15.6–44.8 kg CO2/m2, and 19.1–25.2%, respectively. The trade-off framework adopts the order of objective Pareto optimal and then subjective preference selection, narrowing the scope of alternatives for designers and saving time-cost of decision-making. © 2020 The Authors","Greenhouse gas emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; Life cycle cost; Sustainable building; Thermal comfort","Architectural design; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision trees; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal comfort; Trees (mathematics); Boosted decision trees; Decision making analysis; Environmental emissions; Environmental implications; Environmental problems; Indoor thermal comfort; Latin hypercube sampling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095421021

PM2.5 samples were collected using mid-volume samplers during the autumn of 2017 in all six cities. The samples were analyzed to determine the ambient PM2.5 compositions, including the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), carbonaceous aerosols, and elements concentrations. The chemical ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon and nitrate to sulfate as well as the enrichment factors of elements were calculated to establish the possible sources of PM2.5 in all six cities. The highest PM2.5 concentration was 152 μg/m3 in SJZ, while the lowest concentration was 47 μg/m3 in HRB. During the sampling period in these six cities, the PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization recommended daily average air quality guidelines by 2.4–6.1 times, and WSIIs, carbonaceous aerosols, and elements accounted for 31.8%–61.6%, 9.8%–35.1%, and 0.9%–2.5% of the PM2.5, respectively. In 2013, the Chinese government formulated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) for controlling air pollution, and effective measures have been implemented since then. Compared with previous studies conducted during 2009–2013 before the implementation of the APPCAP, the concentrations of PM2.5 and most of its components decreased to varying degrees, and large changes in the chemical ratios of PM2.5 components were observed.

However, the responses of leaf and root functional traits to e[CO2] are rarely investigated together, limiting our understanding of the whole-plant adaptive strategies to climate change. In this study, 17 temperate woody (nine) and herbaceous (eight) plant species were grown under ambient [CO2] (a[CO2], 380 ppm) and e[CO2] (720 ppm) conditions in the chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, USA), and the responses of 16 key functional traits (anatomy, morphology, physiology) of leaves and typical absorptive roots (the 1st order root) and their relationships were studied. Averagely, we found that e[CO2] increased leaf thickness (LT, +13 %), reduced specific leaf area (SLA, -14 %), increased palisade tissue thickness (PT, +23 %) and the ratio of palisade tissue to spongy tissue thickness (P/S, +14 %) across species, which were accompanied by physiological changes. For absorptive root, root diameter (RD) increased by 15 %, specific root length (SRL) decreased by 12 %, and root tissue density (RTD) decreased by 14 % across species under e[CO2], indicating that plants tend to construct thicker roots with looser tissue under e[CO2] compared to a[CO2]. Also root cortical thickness (CT) and the ratio of cortical thickness to stele radius (C/S) increased by 20 % and 13 % under e[CO2], respectively, implying an increase in root potential absorption capacity. More importantly, the corresponding functional traits of leaf and absorptive root, i.e., LT and RD, SLA and SRL, PT and CT, P/S and C/S, showed positive correlations in their magnitudes of the responses to e[CO2] in both woody and herbaceous species. Our study revealed the coordinated changes of corresponding functional traits in leaf and absorptive root under e[CO2] condition, which provide some insights into the whole-plant resources acquisition strategy under changing environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Above - and belowground linkage; Absorptive root; Anatomical trait; Atmospheric CO2 concentration; Functional trait","absorption; carbon dioxide; growth; herb; leaf area; root system; temperate environment; woody plant; Pennsylvania; Perry County [Pennsylvania]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088785536

Online and offline measurements of NMHCs were conducted during September 2015 in Baoding, Hebei province of China, in order to investigate their sources and roles in ozone formation. Average levels of total NMHCs online measured at the urban site were 44.5 ± 26.7 ppb. Aromatics was the largest contributor to NMHCs levels and OH reactivity, with fraction of 27.1% and 35.9%, respectively. Based on offline measurements at eight sites, we found that toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene displayed the highest level at the site close to automobile manufacturing factories, followed by downwind receptor sites and other sites. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was then used to analyze NMHCs sources. Four factors were identified, including traffic-related emission, automobile manufacturing coating, biogenic emission, and NG/LPG usage and background. Average relative contribution of automobile manufacturing coating to NMHCs levels during the entire online measurement period was 33.4%, and this value increased to 42% during two O3 pollution days. Sensitivity of O3 formation to NMHCs and NOX during an O3 pollution episode were analyzed using a box model based on observations. Relative incremental reactivity (RIR) results suggested that O3 formation was in NOx-titration regime (i.e., highly NMHCs-limited regime). Further scenario analyses on relationship of O3 formation with reduction of NOx and anthropogenic NMHCs (AHC) indicated that AHC and NOx should be reduced by a ratio greater than two and three to achieve 5% and 10% O3 control objectives, respectively. The largest RIR value for anthropogenic NMHC species was from xylenes, which were also an important contributor to SOA formation and dominantly from sources related to automobile manufacturing coating and traffic emission. This means reducing NMHCs emission from automobile manufacturing coating and traffic emission should be given priority for synergetic control of O3 and PM2.5. © 2020 by the authors.

The management of solid waste is critical and becoming a challenge for some cities in China. Waste recycling is an effective solution to solid waste management and seeks to balance ecological sustainability with economic improvements. This study assessed the energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction potential of solid waste using an embodied energy/carbon model from a life cycle perspective. The results showed that compared with the production of virgin materials, solid waste recycling results in a reduction of 294.2 Mtce in energy consumption, and 614.5 Mt in CO2 emission is shown in 2017. The recycling of steel waste was the highest contributor, accounting for more than 45% of energy conservation and at least 62% of CO2 reduction. If 100% recycling of recyclable waste like steel waste and plastic waste can be achieved, energy conservation and CO2 reduction could reach 551.89 Mtce and 933.69 Mt, respectively, accounting for 12.29% of energy consumption and 8.46% of CO2 emission. A robust recycling system must be established to achieve the purpose of environment production and resource conservation. The proposed evaluation framework could help in the decision-making process. The waste classification must be promoted to increase waste recovery rate and improve waste reproduction technology to maximize energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission reduction; Embodied energy and carbon; Energy saving; Recyclable waste; Recycling potential; Waste management","decision making; economic conditions; emission control; energy conservation; recycling; solid waste; waste management; China; carbon; China; city; recycling; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Carbon; China; Cities; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089966471

When analyzing the electricity grid, upstream emissions of EVs in Beijing can be tracked back to Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. This study investigates the inharmonious mechanism of emission reduction to promote EVs in Beijing and Northern China based on 6 scenarios and 42 real EVs. Because there is a neighbor effect, Beijing only accounts for 34%, 34%, 41%, and 35% of the total CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions, respectively. Although the local CO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions can be easily reduced (as long as the conversion of “coal to gas” plan is realized), it is difficult to achieve emission reductions of NOx and SO2 without increasing the clean electricity generation mix in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia at the total emission level. However, there is still a large reduction potential of EVs themselves due to an increasingly clean electricity mix in Beijing, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. Beijing local CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions can be reduced by 86.92%, 98.79%, 99.98% and 99.94%, respectively, and a total reduction of 78.43% of CO2, 93.83% of NOx, 97.85% of SO2 and 99.26% of PM2.5 emissions is possible. Compared with the corresponding ICEV, an EV of 18 kWh/100 km starts to reduce Beijing local CO2, NOx and PM2.5 emissions in scenario 1, 3 and 1, respectively, while the SO2 emissions cannot be reduced. However, the total CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions can be reduced in scenario 2, 5, 5, and 1, respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that the promotion of EVs can reduce Beijing local CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions by 125.568–238.960 g/km, 0.059–0.113 g/km, −0.00003 - - 0.00007 g/km and 0.034–0.065 g/km, respectively. In addition, the total CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 reduction in emissions can be 132.883–253.757 g/km, 0.189–0.361 g/km, 0.299–0.569 g/km and 0.053–0.101 g/km, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions; EVs; Inharmonious mechanism; Neighbor effect; Reduction potential","carbon dioxide; coal; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission control; nitrogen oxides; particle size; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; sulfur dioxide; traffic emission; Article; China; combustion; electricity; exhaust gas; geographic distribution; Inner Mongolia; motor vehicle; particulate matter 2.5; sensitivity analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; prevention and control; Beijing [China]; China; Nei Monggol; Shanxi; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Carbon Dioxide; China; Electricity; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089473405

Roots are known to regulate soil carbon (C) input, but the impacts of different classes of roots on soil microbial community (as indexed by PLFAs) and enzyme activity are uncertain. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess how different classes of woody roots (fine roots ≤ 2 mm and coarse roots > 2 mm) in Pinus tabulaeformis (PT) and Cercidiphyllum japonicum (CJ) plantations influence the microbial community and enzyme potential activity, as compared to natural shrubland. In the fine root rhizosphere soil, the PT and CJ plantations had lower abundances of fungal and gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and the PT plantation had significantly lower acid phosphatase, dehydrogenase, and higher invertase activities compared to the shrubland. The shrubland and CJ plantation had distinctly higher soil microbial parameters (total, fungal, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal PLFAs) and enzyme activities (urease, acid phosphatase, invertase, β-glucosidase, and dehydrogenase) in the fine root rhizosphere than in the coarse root rhizosphere and bulk soils. We concluded that soil organic carbon (SOC) (much more significant) and total nitrogen (TN) were the main factors in regulating soil microbial community and enzymes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of fine roots in regulating microbial community and function.

In this paper, taking 2016 as the study period, we evaluate air pollution efficiency for China’s 30 mainland provinces by using an improved context-dependent slack-based measure (SBM) approach considering air pollution as the undesirable output under the total-factor production framework. The results show that utilizing the context-dependent SBM-Undesirable approach to evaluate provincial air pollution efficiency in mainland China is applicable and effective. Compared to other DEA-based approaches, the approach employed in this study can formulate more achievable short-term air pollution reduction targets for each China’s inefficient province in air pollution. In addition to this, it can also help confirm optimal learning benchmarks and appropriate benchmark-learning pathways for China’s inefficient provinces to combat air pollution.

At present, China has basically established a policy framework to promote the development of green lighting industry, but there is no empirical evidence on the performance of existing policies on energy conservation and emission reduction. Based on the development status of China’s green lighting industry, this paper sorts out the milestones of China’s green lighting industry policy and the current status of the framework of the existing green lighting industry development policies, constructs a policy performance evaluation model for China’s green lighting industry based on the difference-in-difference (DID) model, and evaluates the implementation effects of green lighting industry policies in China from the perspective of energy conservation and emission reduction.

The traditional measurement method has some shortcomings, such as few test points, long test time and complicated process. In this paper, after analyzing the gas emission law of coal particle and the radial gas flow rule of borehole wall, a real-time and fast method for calculating gas pressure with drilling is proposed to establish gas pressure dynamic inversion model based on gas emission quantity of borehole, which is applied to inversion calculation of gas pressure in the directional drilling process. The results show that: (1) Inversion of gas pressure shows that the physical properties of coal seam and the characteristics of gas adsorption affect the amount of gas emission, resulting in different calculation results of gas pressure, which proves the uneven distribution of gas pressure the in coal seam; (2) According to the comparison results, the error range between the theoretical value and the measured value of gas pressure is from 3.6% to 18.1%, which indicates the correctness and reliability of the new model. The error is mainly influenced by the gas emission quantity of coal particle and the permeability coefficient of coal seam after gas desorption; (3) Field application results show that there are many abnormal regions of gas pressure in the coal seam because of geological structure existence. The research results have important practical significance for the analysis of distribution law of coal seam gas and the identification of gas outburst risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal and gas outburst; Gas pressure; Inversion model; Uneven distribution of gas pressure","Boreholes; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Flow of gases; Gas adsorption; Gas bursts; Gas emissions; Infill drilling; Risk assessment; Calculation results; Coal and gas outburst; Distribution of gas; Gas emission quantity; Geological structures; Inversion calculations; Measurement methods; Study and applications; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087830184

Multiple strategies including transport management, urban planning and behavioral changes are required to reduce GHG emissions. Considering the urgent need to improve to urban jobs-housing relationship and reduce transport carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, we propose a complex system model that couples multi-agent based models (ABM) and system dynamics (SD) models to simulate the impact of jobs-housing relationship adjustment policies on CO2 emissions from urban transport. Through simulation of the jobs-housing relationship and comprehensive intelligent simulation of multi-scenario policy schemes, the best optimal combination of schemes is investigated. Results show that the implementation of a single policy and measure can reduce some transport CO2 emissions, but they still rise, and do not reach a peak. To address possible future development of Beijing, three scenarios for transport CO2 emissions reduction were designed, which include Business as usual scenario (BAU), Plan scenario (PS) and Integrated scenario (IS), respectively. Under the IS, carbon intensity could be reduced by 25%–55% compared with 2005, and the environmental economic benefits of each combination scheme were higher than the single measure. Further, we investigated the effects of a reduction in carbon intensity of 65% in 2050 compared to 2005, by simulating 3 different integrated schemes (Combination Scheme Six (CSSI), Combination Scheme Seven (CSSE) and Combination Scheme Eight (CSEI)). This approach showed that CO2 emissions reduction and environmental economic benefits of the CSEI scheme were greater than either of the other two schemes. Therefore, the CSEI scheme is the best optimal development path in an integrated scenario from the long-term goal, and the research results provide decision-making reference and research support for Beijing to achieve low-carbon transportation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Carbon dioxide emissions; Intelligent simulation; Jobs-housing balance","Autonomous agents; Carbon dioxide; Computational methods; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Multi agent systems; System theory; Urban planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Complex system modeling; Environmental economics; Integrated simulations; Intelligent simulations; Low carbon transportations; System dynamics model; Transport management; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088220282

This paper evaluates and ranks global cities based on economic performance and climate change mitigation using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Regular and super-efficiency DEA models are developed under natural disposability and managerial disposability, implying different priorities given to economy and climate change. We apply the models to a dataset of 39 global cities obtained from the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the biggest coalition of global cities to coordinate the cities’ mitigation efforts. The greenhouse gas emissions are classified into scopes 1–3, all of which are treated as undesirable outputs in DEA. In regular DEA models, we identify nine cities that achieve perfect efficiencies regardless of the disposability framework. In super-efficiency models, three cities (Sydney, Tokyo, Vancouver) are always placed into the top five positions. Buenos Aires and Cape Town always fall into the bottom five. The rankings with only scope 1 emissions are significantly correlated with those of all emissions, though with a few notable exceptions (Vancouver and Bogota). The performance of African cities is impeded by scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. The ranking results can be linked to the cities’ economic structure and energy mix. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Global cities; Managerial disposability; Ranking; Super-efficiency DEA","Climate models; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Buenos Aires; Climate change mitigation; Economic performance; Economic structure; Energy mix; Global cities; Super efficiency; Super efficiency dea models; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088117885

Large cyclones are relatively rare, and in popular imagination are thought to hit Mauritius every 15 years. Yet it has been over 25 years since the last cyclone widely considered as ‘significant’. Critically, there is little known about the role of memory in responses to cyclones and details regarding responses to past cyclones in Mauritian history are scant. This article examines past experiences and impacts of cyclones in Mauritius, as well as contemporary perceptions of cyclone vulnerability and memories of historical cyclones. The analysis draws on both community interviews and archival research conducted in Mauritius and takes a longue durée approach. This approach combines an examination of both event and process with historical discourses in an effort to uncover the long-standing and slowly changing relationships between people and extreme events. The results reveal a number of repetitive patterns of responses that act out over the long term and repeat for many of the largest cyclones, indicating that tropical cyclone impact and recovery in Mauritius is strongly conditioned by complex, cultural, and place based memory (and forgetting). While these patterns could be characterised as cycles, the research instead presents a concept of ‘helices’ as a new conceptualisation of long term disaster memory patterns. This research is part of a growing literature arguing for the need to account for the historical processes fundamental to understanding vulnerability. This has implications for disaster risk reduction (including climate change adaptation) in Mauritius, other small islands, and elsewhere. © 2020","Disaster risk reduction; Mauritius; Memory; Tropical cyclones; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092054635

Experience in London, Milan, and Stockholm shows that charging for the use of roads can be effective in reducing emissions, as well as congestion. This study examines the use of predictive cordon tolls based on weather forecasts to reduce ambient air pollution and congestion. Travelers choose their destinations inside or outside the cordon, and whether to drive or take public transport. Passenger vehicles are divided into three classes according to their emission characteristics, and higher tolls are imposed on more polluting vehicles. The Box model of emission dispersion is used to predict air quality. A Markov decision-making process then determines daily toll levels with the objective of maximizing welfare measured by travelers’ surplus, toll revenue, and air pollution health costs. The model is applied to a hypothetical network using recorded weather data for Tehran in 2016. With base-case parameter values, predictive pricing reduces the daily average CO concentration as well as the number of days with dangerous air quality. Predictive pricing yields a higher welfare gain than a fixed toll (i.e., the same every day regardless of weather conditions). The effects of weather information, wind forecast accuracy, forecast time horizon, values of travel time, destination attractions, and road link capacity on the benefits from predictive pricing are analyzed. The performance of the model under randomized weather conditions is also assessed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Markov model; Predictive toll","Air quality; Costs; Decision making; Digital storage; Economics; Meteorology; Pollution control; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Ambient air pollution; CO concentrations; Emission characteristics; Emission dispersion; Passenger vehicles; Public transport; Reducing emissions; Weather information; Weather forecasting; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; decision making; Markov chain; numerical model; public transport; traffic congestion; traffic emission; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092733925

However, secondary forest (SF) growth, resulting from the abandonment of low-productivity pasture areas, offers a potential alternative to counterbalance the effects of deforestation on carbon release to the atmosphere and evapotranspiration reduction. In this work, we present four years of eddy flux measurements of a SF that is approximately 20 years old, located in Central Amazonia, and we compare these measurements with those of a PF in the same region, analyzing daily and seasonal variations in evapotranspiration, gross primary productivity of carbon and water use efficiency. On average, evapotranspiration is 20% higher in the SF (3.6 mm day−1) than in the PF (3.1 mm day−1), while gross primary productivity is only 5% higher in the SF (8.1 gC m−2 day−1) than in the PF (7.8 gC m−2 day−1). Despite robust evidence of higher evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity in SF, the estimated uncertainty range of WUE is large to reach definite conclusions about the differences on carbon gain per water loss between the sites. Nonetheless, the significantly higher evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity of SF may counterbalance both water and C losses from deforestation and has important implications for regional budgets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Evapotranspiration; Gross primary productivity; Land cover change; Secondary growth; Water use efficiency","carbon balance; carbon emission; deforestation; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; land cover; primary production; seasonal variation; secondary forest; water budget; water use efficiency; Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089580391

It measures the exhaust gas concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon mono-and dioxide with a nondispersive infrared method and nitrogen mono-and dioxides and oxygen using an electrochemical cell. In addition, the instrument acquires the engine speed, manifold absolute pressure, inlet and exhaust gas temperature, geo-localization, and vehicle speed. The exhaust mass flow rate is calculated from engine and emission data. The Mini-PEMS was validated on three two-wheelers (one moped and two motorcycles) against laboratory-grade instrumentation in the Vehicle Emissions Laboratory of the European Commission in terms of measured concentrations, exhaust flow, fuel consumption, and mass emission of pollutants. The mean absolute deviations of gas concentrations were 8% for HC, 8% for CO, 13% for NOx , and 2% for CO2, while the mass emissions (which include the exhaust flow determination uncertainty) were 7% for HC, 7% for CO, 9% for NOx , and 5% for CO2. An agreement of 2% was achieved between the fuel consumption measured in the laboratory and calculated by the Mini-PEMS. As an application, the instrument was tested on board the vehicles during on-road trips. The emissions measured on the road were consistent among repeated runs, with differences between laboratory and on-road tests much larger than those between the Mini-PEMS and laboratory.We found similar or larger HC and NOx real-driving emissions and larger CO emissions from motorcycles and smaller ones for the moped. Considering its size and weight, the Mini-PEMS proved to be an efficient tool for vehicle monitoring, research and development and could be tested for in-service monitoring applications related to carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. A tentative approach to characterize particulate mass and particle number was presented and compared to the existing filter method and nonvolatile particle number protocol. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

This agreement combines high ambitions for the reduction of CO2 emissions with policies and measures to achieve these goals. In 2030 CO2 emissions have to be reduced to 49% compared to 1990. In 2050 we should have an CO2 emission free and energy neutral built environment. The existing housing stock plays a major role in the realisation of these goals. The Dutch housing stock comprises of 7.5 million dwellings. The majority of which has to be renovated to a nearly zero energy performance. In a few years' time we will have to speed up the renovation rate to 200,000 carbon free renovations per year, a pace that is needed to make the entire stock of 6 million homes carbon free in the 30 years up to 2050. To support these goals a large innovation program is needed. Method: This paper will elaborate on the analyses of the current state and the needed innovations, hereby also referring to results of evaluation research of the progress in energy renovation in the recent years. Results: The required innovations will be presented in a systemic way. Furthermore, a model is presented of how to organize the innovation (research, applications in practices, pilots etc) in a long running, broad organization incorporating many stakeholders.

The transboundary waters flowing across Asia from their source in the Himalayan 'water towers' are finite resources, already adversely impacted by rising temperatures. China and India share many of the river basins of this region, and both countries implement ambitious national development plans that rely on these resources. Global approaches to address climate change issues on transboundary waters have emerged, but require national and regional cooperative actions, supported by coherent regulatory regimes with adaptation at the core. In the absence of transboundary water agreements between China and India, how will they meet the impacts of changing climatic conditions on their shared freshwaters? This article considers the multilateral and bilateral regulatory frameworks that govern China and India’s transboundary waters in the context of global warming challenges. The findings suggest the emergence of an incomplete adaptation regulatory regime that has yet to coalesce, but which nonetheless shows some promise within a multilateral regionalism context. The hallmarks of an ideal transboundary water adaptation regulatory regime include two main components—comprehensive cooperation and basin-wide resilience management regime. Neither of these exist in the transboundary waters shared between China and India, but there is reason for hope. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; global climate; regulatory framework; water management; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096686270

Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have brought about a range of innovations in precision agriculture, with the potential for adaptation to greenhouses. Simple, traditionally used indices employ only one or two spectral bands, in which the contributions of various pigments and leaf or canopy structure can highly overlap. Consequently, such indices may be insufficient for applications. State-of-the-art models have been developed that can better interpret hyper- and multispectral leaf and canopy imagery by employing the biochemical and radiative transfer properties of vegetation. An example is the soil-canopy observation of photosynthesis and energy balance (SCOPE) model, which was developed specifically for crop canopies. Here we present one of the pillars of SCOPE, the leaf radiative transfer (RT) model Fluspect. Fluspect simulates leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, reflectance and transmittance spectra. The model can be inverted to obtain estimates of leaf chlorophylls, carotenoids, anthocyanins, xanthophyll epoxidation, water and dry matter content. Moreover, it can be linked to a model for leaf photosynthesis and when inverted, provide a method to estimate photosynthesis directly from leaf spectral information. We test the model against a tomato data set, with measured hyperspectral images, chlorophyll, sugar, acid, starch, dry matter content and nutrients. The first study of the data set, using partial least square regression, showed that hyperspectral images have a high correlation with important fruit and leaf compounds. We compared these results to Fluspect retrievals and conventional vegetation indices. In the paper, we discuss the potential added value of using RT models in greenhouse horticulture. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

However, mounting evidence suggests that vegetation may also worsen air quality by slowing the dispersion of pollutants and by producing volatile organic compounds that contribute to formation of ozone and other secondary pollutants. We monitored nanoparticle (>10 nm) counts along distance gradients away from major roads along paired transects across open and forested landscapes in Baltimore (USA), Helsinki (Finland) and Shenyang (China) − i.e. sites in three biomes with different pollution levels − using condensation particle counters. Mean particle number concentrations averaged across all sampling sites were clearly reduced (15%) by the presence of forest cover only in Helsinki. For Baltimore and Shenyang, levels showed no significant difference between the open and forested transects at any of the sampling distances. This suggests that nanoparticle deposition on trees is often counterbalanced by other factors, including differing flow fields and aerosol processes under varying meteorological conditions. Similarly, consistent differences in high frequency data patterns between the transects were detected only in Helsinki. No correlations between nanoparticle concentrations and solar radiation or local wind speed as affecting nanoparticle abundances were found, but they were to some extent associated with canopy closure. These data add to the accumulating evidence according to which trees do not necessarily improve air quality in near-road environments. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Air quality; Nanoparticles; Urban forest; Urban trees","Air quality; Nanoparticles; Roads and streets; Vegetation; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; Condensation particle counters; Forested landscapes; High frequency data; Meteorological condition; Mitigation measures; Nanoparticle concentrations; Nanoparticle deposition; Particle number concentration; Forestry; nanoparticle; advocacy; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); flow field; mitigation; nanoparticle; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; Article; biome; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Finland; forest; land use; Maryland; meteorology; nonhuman; solar radiation; tree; urban area; wind speed; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; forest; particulate matter; tree; Baltimore; China; Finland; Helsinki; Liaoning; Maryland; Shenyang; United States; Varsinais-Suomi; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Baltimore; China; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Forests; Particulate Matter; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089340666

They represent a relevant issue, both for the risks they represent for (infra) structures and frequentation, and for their potential role as terrestrial indicators of climate change. This study aims to contribute to the growing topic of the relationship between climate change and slope instability at the basin scale. The selected study area is the Bessanese glacial basin (Western Italian Alps) which, since 2016, has been specifically equipped, monitored and investigated for this purpose. In order to provide a broader context for the interpretation of the recent rockfall events and associated climate conditions, a cross-temporal and integrated approach has been adopted. For this purpose, geomorphological investigations (last 100 years), local climate (last 30 years) and near-surface rock/air temperatures analyses, have been carried out. First research outcomes show that rockfalls occurred in two different geomorphological positions: on rock slopes in permafrost condition, facing from NW to NE and/or along the glacier margins, on rock slopes uncovered by the ice in the last decades. Seasonal thaw of the active layer and/or glacier debutressing can be deemed responsible for slope failure preparation. With regard to timing, almost all dated rock falls occurred in summer. For the July events, initiation may have been caused by a combination of rapid snow melt and enhanced seasonal thaw of the active layer due to anomalous high temperatures, and rainfall. August events are, instead, associated with a significant positive temperature anomaly on the quarterly scale, and they can be ascribed to the rapid and/or in depth thaw of the permafrost active layer. According to our findings, we can expect that in the Bessanese glacierized basin, as in similar high mountain areas, climate change will cause an increase of slope instability in the future. To fasten knowledge deepening, we highlight the need for a growth of a network of high elevation experimental sites at the basin scale, and the definition of shared methodological and measurement standards, that would allow a more rapid and effective comparison of data. © 2020, The Author(s).","Air and rock temperature; Climate change; Periglacial environment; Rockfalls; Western Italian Alps","air temperature; altitude; climate change; integrated approach; periglacial environment; rockfall; slope stability; Alps; Western Alps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095768147

The conservation of paper collections is strongly interrelated with the relative humidity of the air, as organic-hygroscopic materials act as buffers on relative humidity fluctuations while being vulnerable to moisture-induced damage. In the dynamic simulation of the microclimate within library and archival storage facilities, it is thus fundamental to include the hygrothermal interaction between the building and its hygroscopic content. The hygroscopic behaviour of paper collections can be modelled by hygrothermal tools such as those of the HAM-family (Heat, Air and Moisture), used to simulate simultaneous heat and mass transfers through porous envelope materials. This research aims at investigating the use of the HMWall model coupled with the software IDA ICE (Indoor Climate and Energy) to simulate of the 1-D heat and moisture transfer through a single wall made of paper. A literature survey was carried out to collect the available hygrothermal properties of modern and historical papers. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most relevant hygrothermal parameters in the simulation of moisture gradients across the paper wall. Moreover, the number of sub-layers in the paper wall model was found to significantly affect the internal distribution of moisture gradients. The use of the HMWall model was then tested in the simulation of the hygroscopic behaviour of a single paper wall in both steady-state and transient conditions. Finally, a simplified model able to preserve the accuracy of the results was proposed with the purpose of reducing the computation effort that a high-resolution model could involve if implemented in whole buildings. This study represents the first step towards the application of the HMWall model for the simulation of the indoor climate of library repositories. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Hence, hypoxic tumor cells coordinatively increase the expression of nutrient transporters and pH regulators to adapt and meet their bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands. Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a vital role in pH regulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Numerous studies have established the importance of CAIX in mediating tumor progression and metastasis. To understand the mechanism of CAIX in mediating tumor progression, we performed an unbiased proteomic screen to identify the potential interactors of CAIX in the TME using the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) technique. In this review, we focus on the interactors from this BioID screen that are crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport in the TME. We discuss the role of transport metabolon comprising CAIX and bicarbonate transporters in regulating intra- and extracellular pH of the tumor. We also discuss the role of amino acid transporters that are high confidence interactors of CAIX, in optimizing favorable metabolic state for tumor progression, and give our perspective on the coordinative interplay of CAIX with the amino acid transporters in the hypoxic TME. © Copyright © 2020 Venkateswaran and Dedhar.","amino acid transport; carbonic anhydrase IX; hypoxia; tumor metabolism; tumor microenvironment","alanine serine cysteine transporter 2; amino acid; amino acid transporter; bicarbonate; biotin; carbonate dehydratase IX; carrier protein; L type amino acid transporter 1; multienzyme complex; sodium coupled neutral amino acid trandporter 2; unclassified drug; amino acid transport; cell pH; human; metabolism; metabolite; metastasis; nutrient; protein protein interaction; proteomics; regulatory mechanism; Review; tumor growth; tumor hypoxia; tumor microenvironment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096428155

Large quantities of construction materials and other resources need to be transported to, within, and from construction sites. Implementation of different construction logistics solutions can reduce the impact from construction. The objectives of this article are to map the status and present the current practice of construction logistics in Norway, and to discuss how different no or low emission construction logistics solutions can be promoted. Methods: Methods applied are a literature review including findings from the recent development of emission free construction sites and qualitative case study with interviews carried out in Norway. Results: Findings indicate that lack of regulations, specific requirements and awareness, and use of traditional methods to avoid risks are some of the challenges for minimizing impact from construction logistics. However, opportunities are also present; mainly driven by political ambitions, improved environmental requirements in public procurement tenders and market demands and ambitions for reductions in emissions and costs. Preliminary results from interviews in Norway support these findings. Conclusions: The study show that the goal of achieving no or low emission from construction site is possible through setting ambitious requirements, good planning and a close and open collaboration between involved stakeholders.

This study investigates the co-mobilization of the potentially toxic CTEs antimony (Sb), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), uranium (U), and selenium (Se) with arsenic (As) and iron (Fe) in contrasting high and low As aquifers surrounding the river Bhagirathi in Murshidabad, West Bengal, India. We sought to determine the dominant release mechanisms and fate of each CTEs as they relate to redox conditions, major element dissolution pathways, and characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Groundwater samples collected in 2013 and 2015 field campaigns across six villages in the Murshidabad district were analyzed for major and trace elements, as well as the quantity and optical properties of DOM. East of the river Bhagirathi, the Holocene aquifer contained groundwater with compositions reflective of carbonate mineral dissolution and silicate mineral weathering, along with clear signs of Fe reduction and associated mobilization of As, Sb, Mo, V, and U. Relatively oxic groundwater in the Pleistocene aquifer underlying the study sites on the west side of the river showed minimal Fe reduction and signatures of carbonate mineral dissolution and silicate mineral weathering (i.e., Nabagram), or evaporite mineral dissolution (i.e., Kandi). In groundwater samples from the more oxic Pleistocene aquifer, concentrations of As, Sb, Mo, and V were substantially lower than in the Holocene aquifer, however, U concentrations were relatively higher where carbonate mineral dissolution predominated (i.e., Nabagram). Compelling positive correlations between Fe and CTEs in the Holocene but not in the Pleistocene aquifer implicated Fe reductive processes as the probable pathway for CTEs release. The presence of humic-like DOM ligands and inorganic ions (i.e., Ca2+, CO32−) may also enhance CTEs mobility via aqueous complexation reactions, or possibly by inhibiting CTEs adsorption. We further hypothesize that carbonate mineral dissolution mobilizes U in the absence of Fe reduction, and that U solubility in the reducing Holocene aquifer may be facilitated by carbonate mineral dissolution products (e.g., Ca2+, HCO3−, CO32−) that promote U complexation and the inhibition of (bio)immobilization pathways. Conclusively, potentially toxic CTEs are being mobilized concomitantly with As in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal, probably by microbial Fe reduction. Because these aquifers still contain requisite organic matter and bulk sediment Fe required for Fe reductive processes, it follows that concentrations of CTEs may increase in the future. We therefore argue that despite moderately low concentrations of CTEs in the current study, mechanistic modeling efforts and more extensive monitoring of trace metal(loid)s should be performed to ensure that drinking water supplies do not pose additional health threats in the coming years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antimony; Arsenic; Bengal basin; Groundwater; Health; Molybdenum; Selenium; Uranium; Vanadium","Aquifers; Arsenic; Biogeochemistry; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Complexation; Dissolution; Groundwater resources; Health risks; Hydrogeology; Optical properties; Organic compounds; Potable water; Rivers; Silicate minerals; Trace elements; Vanadium compounds; Water supply; Weathering; Aqueous complexation; Contaminated aquifer; Dissolved organic matters; Major and trace elements; Mechanistic modeling; Pleistocene aquifers; Positive correlations; West Bengal , India; Groundwater pollution; aquifer pollution; arsenic; chemical weathering; complexation; concentration (composition); Holocene; mobilization; Pleistocene; redox conditions; trace element; Bengal; Bhagirathi River [West Bengal]; India; Kandi; Murshidabad; Punjab [India]; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091578658

Moderate prices for oil and oil products along with large volumes of its production led to quite substantial losses, the consequences of which were pollution of the atmosphere, ground, soil as well as water bodies. The environment components (the atmosphere, surface and groundwater, relief, soil and vegetation cover, wildlife) are most negatively affected during the development and exploitation of oil and gas fields. This paper provides a justification for the need to introduce automatic control systems: oil and oil products bottling on soils and terrain, in the territories of oil production facilities and emissions of pollutants (""greenhouse""gases) on flare systems at the field. The work defines the response time and quantity of oil product bottling before the implementation of the automatic oil bottling control system and after its implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed complex using a sensor cable TT5000-HS on the basis of calculations of oil volumes entering the soil in case of oil leakage during oil pipeline depressurization due to accidents, before and after the introduction of an automatic system of monitoring and time of leak detection has been proved. The qualitative and quantitative composition of emissions of pollutants into the atmospheric air during combustion of APG on a torch at the field for 20 years is calculated. The introduction of an automatic emission control plant for the combustion of associated petroleum gas will make it possible to assess in a timely manner the qualitative and quantitative composition of pollutants emissions into the atmosphere on the flare systems of the deposit, as well as to prevent exceeding the standard indicator of associated petroleum gas combustion, to fulfill the RF legislation requirements and provide control of ""greenhouse gases""volume in the world generally.

Upgrading existing glazing could reduce building heating demand by 10% and reduce the TUD emissions by 573.4 tco2-eq/a. However, renovations are often postponed due to unknown energetic glazing quality. Traditional measures such as removing the glazing to a test-lab to identify the ug-value are often not permitted nor practical for existing (heritage-listed) occupied buildings. In this article, methods suitable for the assessment of the energetic quality of existing glazing without removing the glazing from the building, i.e. (a) the use of literature values per building age classification, (b) glazing built up measurement with ug-value calculations per standard and (c) direct ug-value measurement using a portable tool, are tested on the existing window stock of the TUD campus, compared and evaluated in terms of accuracy and easiness of application. Results show that the energetic quality can range widely from a ug-value of 0.5 to 3.5W/m2K within a single building, and that method (a) is not accurate and method (b) is as accurate as method (c), but 20 minutes faster per glazing which, extrapolated to a district like TUD, can save months of work and significantly increases the chances of glazing renovations being carried out. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Strict monument conservation requirements however prohibit changes to the building that affect its visible appearance. In this paper examples of existing PV on heritage buildings around Dresden are presented, and a PV in-roof system that blends in is visualized for a heritage TU Dresden (TUD) building. Using TUD's buildings as a case study, opportunities and challenges of regenerative electricity generation on TUD heritage buildings are discussed. Covering the considered TUD area with PV, a large CO2-emission reduction is feasible. For a self-consumption rate of 70-100%, which seems realistic for the TUD due to the high daytime equipment power and its campus power network that allows buildings to distribute a surplus of generated power to other campus buildings, the payback time is favourable. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, interpretation of ancient n-alkane patterns relies primarily on modern plant wax n-alkane patterns measured from leaves. Little is still known about how n-alkane patterns, and environmental information therein, might be altered during the process of transfer from leaves into soil. We studied the n-alkane patterns extracted from leaves, necromass, and soil samples from an altitudinal gradient in the tropical Andes to clarify if the n-alkane pattern, and the local environmental information reflected, is altered as the plant source material degrades. We considered the (dis)similarity between n-alkane patterns in soil, necromass, and leaves and specifically explored whether a temperature and/or precipitation signal is reflected in their n-alkane patterns. The nalkane patterns showed degradation in soil as reflected by a reduced carbon preference index (CPI). The lower CPI in soils as compared to leaves and necromass was significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation along the transect, most likely because of increased microbial activity under warmer and wetter conditions. Despite degradation, all sample types showed a systematic shift in longer vs. shorter n-alkanes when moving up the transect. Further examination revealed the systematic shift correlated with transect temperature and precipitation. Since transect vegetation is constant along the transect, this would appear to indicate the recording of a climatic signal within the n-alkane patterns that is preserved in the soil, albeit that the correlation was weaker there. The study results warrant further research into a possible underlying causal relationship that may lead to the development of n-alkane patterns as a novel palaeoecological proxy. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air temperature; alkane; environmental change; environmental degradation; environmental gradient; nitrogen; paleotemperature; precipitation (climatology); relative abundance; tropical region; Andes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096219256

The ROW is policy-inactive. We fully characterize the market equilibrium and show that, due to differences in climate policies between the climate club and the ROW, the monopolistic fossil fuel supplier may choose for two limit-pricing phases to postpone entry of renewables producers: First in the climate club and later in the ROW.

Generally, the modeled narrowband and broadband albedo is in very good agreement with satellite observations, leading to a negligible domain-Averaged broadband albedo bias for the interior. Some discrepancies are, however, observed close to the ice margin. Compared to the previous model version, RACMO2.3p2, the broadband albedo is considerably higher in the bare-ice zone during the ablation season, as atmospheric conditions now alter the bare-ice broadband albedo. For most other regions, however, the updated broadband albedo is lower due to spectral effects, radiation penetration or enhanced snow metamorphism. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

It has been hypothesised that these P peaks are due to internal loading after reductive dissolution of ferric iron (Fe(III)) minerals in sediments with a high P/Fe ratio. Here, we experimentally tested that hypothesis by measuring the sediment/water fluxes of P in streams and by testing responses to in-stream oxygenation. A phosphate stock solution with a bromide (Br−) tracer was administered during 3 h in four streams with varying sediment P/Fe ratios during summer (low DO concentration). The experiment was repeated in winter (high DO concentration) in one of the streams. The sediments were either net P sinks (three cases), net unreactive (one case) or a net source (one case), with the net source occurring in the stream with the highest sediment P/Fe and at lowest DO concentration. A direct oxygenation experiment in one stream increased downstream DO concentration with about 1 mg O2 L−1 and decreased the P concentration with, on average, about 0.3 mg P L−1 over a two-week period. The efficiency of oxygenation to reduce P concentrations enhanced when flow rates were lower. In conclusion, this experimental study confirmed the hypothesis that internal P loading in streams is largest in high P/Fe sediments at low DO conditions. Lowering P concentrations in lowland streams should combine reduced P emission and strategies avoiding low DO concentration, i.e. reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrient emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Sediment P flux; Sediment-water interactions; Short term P additions; Stream oxygenation","Biochemical oxygen demand; Iron compounds; Oxygenation; Phosphorus; Biological oxygen demand; DO concentration; Ferric iron; Internal loading; Low-do conditions; Nutrient emissions; Reductive dissolution; Stock solutions; Sediments; biochemical oxygen demand; concentration (composition); mountain stream; oxygenation; phosphorus; sediment-water interface; stream",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091342515

We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success.

Results show that a temporal strategy that employs an explicit circadian clock produces more entropy than a passive strategy that uses internal carbon storage or a balanced growth strategy that requires phytoplankton to grow with fixed stoichiometry. When the community is forced to operate at high specific growth rates near 2 d−1, the optimization-guided model selects for phytoplankton ecotypes that exhibit complementary for winter versus summer environmental conditions to increase entropy production.

In this study, a glassy carbon electrode modified with reduced graphene oxide and Nafion was used as a sensor in a square-wave voltammetry method for determination of amoxicillin in river water samples from Guarapuava city, Brazil. The method was validated, using parameters and statistical tools recommended by the validation guidelines, in the range of 1.8–5.4 μmol L−1 (r = 0.922 and R2 = 85.1%). The analytical curve was constructed using external standard calibration in pure electrolyte, since the matrix effect was not significant. Results of linear regression analysis, lack of fit test and analysis of the residual plots pointed that the linear regression was significant, without lack of fit of linear model and that the variances had homoscedastic distribution. Both coefficients of regression curve were significant and, thus, they were included in the regression equation: Response = 7.0 + 3.5CAMX. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.36 and 1.2 μmol L−1, respectively. The method was selective towards interferents such as humic acids and benzylpenicillin. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and intermediate precision were adequate according to the limits established in literature. The mean recoveries were statistically equal to those obtained through a comparative chromatography method, so, the accuracy of the method was also adequate. Therefore, the method can be applied to the voltammetric determination of amoxicillin in river water, affording reliable and consistent measurements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amoxicillin; Electrochemical sensor; Method validation; Nafion; Reduced graphene oxide; Square-wave voltammetry","Drug products; Electrolytes; Glass membrane electrodes; Graphene; Regression analysis; Statistical mechanics; Voltammetry; Aquatic environments; Glassy carbon electrodes; Limits of detection; Relative standard deviations; River water samples; Square wave voltammetry; Voltammetric determination; Voltammetric methods; Rivers; amoxicillin; graphene oxide; humic acid; penicillin G; water; accuracy; Article; Brazil; chemical analysis; chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; linear regression analysis; pH measurement; practice guideline; priority journal; process development; process optimization; reproducibility; river; square wave voltammetry; structure analysis; validation study; water pollution; electrochemical analysis; electrode; river; Amoxicillin; Brazil; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Limit of Detection; Rivers; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091210965

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution to reduce the CO2 emissions which, however, requires the right electric power production mix for the largest impact. The increase in the electric power consumption caused by the EV charging demand could be matched by the growing share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the power production. EVs are becoming a popular sustainable mean of transportation and the expansion of EV units due to the stochastic nature of charging behavior and increasing share of RES creates additional challenges to the stability in the power systems. Modeling of EV charging fleets allows understanding EV charging capacity and demand response (DR) potential of EV in the power systems. This article focuses on modeling of daily EV charging profiles for buildings with various number of chargers and daily events. The article presents a modeling approach based on the charger occupancy data from the local charging sites. The approach allows one to simulate load profiles and to find how many chargers are necessary to suffice the approximate demand of EV charging from the traffic characteristics, such as arrival time, duration of charging, and maximum charging power. Additionally, to better understand the potential impact of demand response, the modeling approach allows one to compare charging profiles, while adjusting the maximum power consumption of chargers. © 2020 by the authors.

The population growth and continuing urbanization in the world cause many social, economic, technical, and organizational problems related to transportation, businesses, communication networks, services, and utilities that can risk the cities' economic and environmental sustainability. Recently, a smart city concept has been developed to provide a solution to improve citizens' quality of life in urban areas with the adoption of smart and digital technologies and infrastructure for energy, water, mobility, buildings, and government. The smart city concept considers ""zero vision"" that refers to the use of smart city technologies, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Internet of Things (IoT) tools, to minimize negative impacts (i.e., zero traffic accident, zero CO2 emission, zero waste, zero crime) in the cities. However, the research in this zero-vision approach mainly focused on transportation and energy. Urban forestry and urban vegetated areas in the cities inherently provide benefits such as reducing air pollution, urban heat island effects, and flood risk and increasing the water quality, aesthetic value, and value of the property that improve citizens' quality of life. The smart city concept switched towards to sustainable smart city concept that takes into account the services provided by urban forestry and urban vegetation. In this study, the shifts in the smart city concept towards the sustainable smart city, the role of the urban forestry and urban vegetation in this shift was presented. Also, ICTs and IoT tools specifically designed for monitoring, assessing, and managing urban forestry and urban vegetation was reviewed. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The particular perspective we inhabit is determinant of what we can know. Perspective or ‘approach’ is therefore foregrounded by complexity thinkers as an active part of knowing and acting. We take a complexity view of climate change mitigation policymaking to argue that climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach, which determines both our understanding of the climate change mitigation policy problem, and how we respond to it. To construct this argument, we first summarize and describe the existence of a hegemonic scientific and cultural worldview. We use multi-disciplinary literatures to demonstrate how this worldview operates in the approach of the international climate change mitigation policy community. Finally, we draw on empirical datasets to describe how the influence of this worldview characterizes the dominant approach of the South African climate change mitigation policy community. That climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach means that, whilst aspects of the complex policy situation are illuminated by this approach, others are obscured. It is clear from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5°C warming that policymakers are not yet responding adequately to the problem. If approach determines what we see and how we act, it follows that approach can be interrogated as an active site of the policy challenge. A complexity view, for instance, enables us to see differently, emphasizing perspective, impartial knowledge, non-linearities and emergence in complexity and complex systems. This in turn has implications for our policymaking. Key policy insights Policymakers should explore how an understanding of approach informs climate change mitigation policymaking. Climate change mitigation policy communities should critically examine the underlying assumptions and worldviews that influence both how we encounter climate change mitigation and how we act upon it. An appreciation of ‘approach’ demands skills not typically valued or taught to climate change mitigation policymakers, with implications for climate change mitigation policy curricula and the composition of policymaking teams Complexity thinking opens up spaces for policymaking currently obscured by the dominant climate change mitigation policy approaches. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate mitigation; complex systems; complexity thinking; Policy approach; reflexivity; South Africa","climate change; complexity; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; policy analysis; policy approach; policy making; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087484690

In addition, the air pollutants ozone (O3) and particulate matter less than 2.5 um in diameter (PMO2.5) are also radiatively active in the atmosphere and can influence Earth's climate. It is important to understand the effect of air quality and climate mitigation measures over the historical period and in different future scenarios to ascertain any impacts from air pollutants on both climate and human health. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) presents an opportunity to analyse the change in air pollutants simulated by the current generation of climate and Earth system models that include a representation of chemistry and aerosols (particulate matter). The shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) used within CMIP6 encompass a wide range of trajectories in precursor emissions and climate change, allowing for an improved analysis of future changes to air pollutants. Firstly, we conduct an evaluation of the available CMIP6 models against surface observations of O3 and PMO2.5. CMIP6 models consistently overestimate observed surface O3 concentrations across most regions and in most seasons by up to 16 ppb, with a large diversity in simulated values over Northern Hemisphere continental regions. Conversely, observed surface PMO2.5 concentrations are consistently underestimated in CMIP6 models by up to 10 ugm-3, particularly for the Northern Hemisphere winter months, with the largest model diversity near natural emission source regions. The biases in CMIP6 models when compared to observations of O3 and PMO2.5 are similar to those found in previous studies. Over the historical period (1850-2014) large increases in both surface O3 and PMO2.5 are simulated by the CMIP6 models across all regions, particularly over the mid to late 20th century, when anthropogenic emissions increase markedly. Large regional historical changes are simulated for both pollutants across East and South Asia with an annual mean increase of up to 40 ppb for O3 and 12 ugm-3 for PMO2.5. In future scenarios containing strong air quality and climate mitigation measures (ssp126), annual mean concentrations of air pollutants are substantially reduced across all regions by up to 15 ppb for O3 and 12 ugm-3 for PMO2.5. However, for sce-narios that encompass weak action on mitigating climate and reducing air pollutant emissions (ssp370), annual mean increases in both surface O3 (up 10 ppb) and PMO2.5 (up to 8 ugm-3) are simulated across most regions, although, for regions like North America and Europe small reductions in PMO2.5 are simulated due to the regional reduction in precursor emissions in this scenario. A comparison of simulated regional changes in both surface O3 and PMO2.5 from individual CMIP6 models highlights important regional differences due to the simulated interaction of aerosols, chemistry, climate and natural emission sources within models. The projection of regional air pollutant concentrations from the latest climate and Earth system models used within CMIP6 shows that the particular future trajectory of climate and air quality mitigation measures could have important consequences for regional air quality, human health and near-term climate. Differences between individual models emphasise the importance of understanding how future Earth system feedbacks influence natural emission sources, e.g. response of biogenic emissions under climate change. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; climate modeling; CMIP; emission inventory; future prospect; historical perspective; ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097405431

Indeed, in recognition of the climate challenge, many regional and city authorities have set their own net zero targets. What is missing is a grounded principles framework to support what will inevitably be a range of broader public policy actions, which must in turn consider pathways that are not only technically, but economically, socially and politically feasible. Here, we attempt to stimulate discussion on this issue. We do so by making an initial proposition around a set of generic questions that should challenge any decarbonisation action, using the example of carbon capture and storage to illustrate the importance and complexity of ensuring feasibility of actions in a political economy arena. We argue that this gives rise to five fundamental ‘Net Zero Principles’ around understanding of who really pays and gains, identifying pathways that deliver growing and equitable prosperity, some of which can deliver near-term economic returns, while avoiding outcomes that simply involve ‘off-shoring’ of emissions, jobs and gross domestic product. © The Author(s) 2021.","Just transition; net zero; political economy; principles; public policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099346869

In a permafrost-thaw bog in Interior Alaska, we used plant manipulation treatments, field-deployed planar optical oxygen sensors, direct measurements of methane oxidation, and microbial DNA analyses to disentangle mechanisms by which vascular vegetation affect methane emissions. Vegetation operated on top of baseline methane emissions, which varied with proximity to the thawing permafrost margin. Emissions from vegetated plots increased over the season, resulting in cumulative seasonal methane emissions that were 4.1–5.2 g m−2 season−1 greater than unvegetated plots. Mass balance calculations signify these greater emissions were due to increased methane production (3.0–3.5 g m−2 season−1) and decreased methane oxidation (1.1–1.6 g m−2 season−1). Minimal oxidation occurred along the plant-transport pathway, and oxidation was suppressed outside the plant pathway. Our data indicate suppression of methane oxidation was stimulated by root exudates fueling competition among microbes for electron acceptors. This contention is supported by the fact that methane oxidation and relative abundance of methanotrophs decreased over the season in the presence of vegetation, but methane oxidation remained steady in unvegetated treatments; oxygen was not detected around plant roots but was detected around silicone tubes mimicking aerenchyma; and oxygen injection experiments suggested that oxygen consumption was faster in the presence of vascular vegetation. Root exudates are known to fuel methane production, and our work provides evidence they also decrease methane oxidation. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Two methods have previously been proposed to reduce residential energy use associated with the provision of occupant thermal comfort: 1. Occupancy-based HVAC control, operating systems only during confirmed occupancy, and 2. model predictive control (MPC), harnessing a mathematical model and forecasts to find optimal operating strategies. Previous studies estimate the average energy savings of the two methods individually in the range of 21% and 16%, respectively. The research presented herein was carried out to evaluate the energy savings potential in residential buildings by combining both approaches across different climates, house vintages, and occupancy patterns. Occupancy and eight different physical modalities (e.g. CO2 and VOC) data were collected from five homes for time periods of 4-9 weeks. Collected data sets were used to train occupancy prediction models suggested by an extensive literature survey of occupancy model types. The trained prediction models were combined with MPC and detailed EnergyPlus building simulation models to evaluate residential building performance in terms of annual energy savings and thermal comfort, along with discomfort exceedance metrics. Multiple home types and regions were analyzed to understand regional and climate-dependent potential. Based on actual field data, the occupancy models had a prediction inaccuracy between 8% and 35% across the investigated homes. Average occupancy for the collected data ranged from 56% to 86%, a typical range reported in the literature. Building simulations were conducted for three control scenarios: conventional thermostatic control, occupancy-based, and occupancy-based MPC. The results indicate that all advanced strategies improve upon the conventional control, with some scenarios cutting energy use in half with only occasional incurrence of discomfort. The findings indicate that occupancy-aware model predictive residential building control has the potential to drastically reduce energy use and associated emissions while maintaining occupant comfort for both new and existing buildings. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Despite zero on-road greenhouse gas emissions, the upstream emissions from electricity generation cannot be ignored. In this study, a heuristic algorithm was designed to optimize regional electric vehicle charging schedules with the objective of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. Our study is set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Emissions from the charging demand are estimated by a marginal emission model calibrated with historical data for Ontario electricity generation. The results illustrate that the optimized plan can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 97% compared to a base case, where vehicles are powered by gasoline. Four other charging scenarios (home, out of home, after trip, and after 3am) that do not entail optimization were also investigated and compared with the optimized plan. The scenario where charging is only allowed after 3am generates the lowest emissions among all four scenarios but its emissions are 50% higher than the optimized scenario. Charging at the end of each trip was observed to generate the highest emissions. Locations serving the most charging events, and the number of non-residential charging plugs were also evaluated. The home location serves most charging events, followed by workplace. The optimized plan requires the second highest number of public charging plugs. This implies a trade-off between greenhouse gas emissions associated with vehicle charging and investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle charging schedule; GHG; Life-cycle emissions; Marginal emission factor; Optimization","Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic algorithms; Investments; Optimization; Urban transportation; Charging demands; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Electricity generation; Low carbon transportations; Residential charging; Urban transportation systems; Vehicle charging; Gas emissions; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission; greenhouse gas; optimization; power generation; Canada; Hamilton [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088645955

Socioeconomic sustainability is paramount in low-income countries, where milk production and consumption represent a vehicle to improve human nutrition and health, as well as the potential for economic opportunity and improved livelihood of subsistence farmers. These benefits can only be achieved with judicious use of animal stocks and agricultural practices that do not exhaust available natural resources, which are often shared by regional farming communities. Milk and dairy foods provide variety to the diet and make significant contributions to meeting the needs for high-quality protein, calcium, magnesium, selenium, riboflavin, vitamin B12, and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) in at-risk populations, particularly children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Milk production in low-income countries occurs largely in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems where animals play multiple roles and may suffer from undernutrition, leading to negligible or no milk production during several months of the year. Non-food roles of livestock include draft, fuel (manure), store of capital, and insurance against crop failure. These roles and the social standing associated with animal ownership may incentivize the maintenance of large herds that place stress on feed (land) and water resources. Under these circumstances, sustainable intensification (i.e., increasing milk production from currently available resources) represents the single most important and practical strategy to improve the sustainability of milk production and consumption in low-income countries. Improving the genetic potential of animals and the availability of quality feed, and providing balanced nutrition are the most promising strategies to improve milk production and sustainability in low-income countries. For example, the deficit for milk in Ethiopia is estimated at 4.5 billion liters/year, which can be closed, in part, with balanced animal nutrition. Milk production in low-income countries will be more sustainable if it relies on natural resources available locally and regionally to supply essential nutrients to at-risk human populations. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","dairy; low-income country; sustainability","animal; bovine; dairying; developing country; environmental protection; female; human; milk; pregnancy; procedures; Animals; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Dairying; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Milk; Pregnancy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092303123

The results reveal that heatwaves have increased in intensity, frequency and duration across Australia over the past 67 years, such intensification was particularly higher on recent decades. Downscaled future climate projections for Queensland suggest that heatwaves will further intensify over the current century. The projections also highlight that distinct climatic regions within Queensland may have different heatwave responses under global warming, where tropical and equatorial heatwaves appear to be more sensitive to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations than temperate and arid regions.

The IEA-The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) model generator was used to build up the Basilicata Water, Energy and Food model (TIMES-WEF model), which allows users a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of climate change on the Basilicata agri-food system in terms of land use, yields and water availability and a critical comparison of these indicators in different scenarios. The paper focuses on the construction of the model’s Reference Energy and Material System of the TIMES model, which integrates water and agricultural commodities into the energy framework, and on the results obtained through the calibration of the model β version to statistical data on agricultural activities. © 2020 by the authors.

Although meals from insects and/or byproducts from different industries are being recently tested, the meal from terrestrial vegetable species is still the main substitution candidate for fish meal. Here the effects of 0% (Control), 10% (A10) and 30% (A30) inclusion of Narbonne vetch (Vicia narbonensis; ZV-156 strain) meal in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets was assessed in a 63-day feeding trial by means of growth performance, histopathological, nutritional value of the fish fillet and blood biochemistry analyses. A dose-response trial was conducted in triplicate with 25 rainbow trout juveniles (20 g average body weight) per 500 L tank. Narbonne vetch meal decreased total intestine protease activity in vitro (from 26.81% to 48% inhibition), although high temperature partially inhibited the action of antinutritional factors (ANFs). No differences in fish growth performance and no severe histopathological alterations on the proximal intestine were observed between 10% Narbonne vetch inclusion and Control groups. In contrast, high inclusion (30%) of Narbonne vetch led to poor growth performance (30% reduction on final growth) and severe histopathological alterations (e.g., loss of brush border integrity, high number of villi fusion, reduced goblet cells density as well as reduced width of submucosa, muscular and serosa layers). Furthermore, while the A30 diet decreased docosahexaenoic fatty acid (FA) content in fish fillets, the A10 diet improved monounsaturated FA content when compared to that of the Control group. No altered levels of cholesterol, glucose or triglycerides in blood plasma and/or histopathological effects on the liver were observed among fish fed the different experimental diets. Although further research efforts (e.g., identifying potential enzymatic treatments to decrease the action of ANFs from Narbonne vetch meal) might be required, present results show that a low inclusion (10%) of Narbonne vetch in rainbow trout diets is possible. The inclusion of locally produced legumes such a Narbonne vetch might be an interesting approach to reduce carbon footprint in European aquaculture and the dependency on other alternative raw materials such as soybean (Glycine max) imported from third countries. © 2020 by the authors.

Obtained concentrations have been treated by a combination of several receptor-oriented models to reveal source contributions to the suburban PM2.5 at different spatial scales. Applied positive matrix factorization analysis indicated five main groups of emission sources: biomass burning (14.5%), traffic (3.9%), regional combustion/secondary sulphates (28.8%), local combustion/secondary nitrates (29.7%) and soil (5.4%). Local heating units had been pointed out as dominant contributors by long-range transport and ground-wind circulation analyses. Air masses circulating over the Balkan Peninsula denoted regional emissions as responsible for the high concentrations of secondary sulphates. Local and long-range transport analyses combined suggested that the BB and the LC/NO3 originated from the wider urban area. Several Saharan dust episodes were detected as well.

Such shifts are likely accentuated in the rapidly warming Arctic. Targeting a plant community in Northeast Greenland, we asked (a) whether the relative phenology of plants is shifting with spatial variation in temperature, (b) whether local plants compete for pollination, and (c) whether shifts in climatic conditions are likely to affect this competition. We first searched for climatic imprints on relative species phenology along an elevational gradient. We then tested for signs of competition with increasing flower densities: reduced pollinator visits, reduced representation of plant species in pollen loads, and reduced seed production. Finally, we evaluated how climate change may affect this competition. Compared to a dominant species, Dryas integrifolia × octopetala, the relative timing of other species shifted along the environmental gradient, with Silene acaulis and Papaver radicatum flowering earlier toward higher elevation. This shift resulted in larger niche overlap, allowing for an increased potential for competition for pollination. Meanwhile, Dryas emerged as a superior competitor by attracting 97.2% of flower visits. Higher Dryas density resulted in reduced insect visits and less pollen of S. acaulis being carried by pollinators, causing reduced seed set by S. acaulis. Our results show that current variation in climate shifts the timing and flowering overlap between dominant and less-competitive plant species. With climate warming, such shifts in phenology within trophic levels may ultimately affect interactions between them, changing the strength of competition among plants. © 2020 The Authors.

We investigated this question by studying the effect of the Paris Agreement on the American public. Our survey experiments supported three conclusions. First, voluntary international commitments shaped public opinion; public support for emissions control policies was much higher in scenarios where the U.S. government had joined the Paris Agreement than in scenarios where it had not. This effect held not only in the population as a whole, but also by political party. Second, although international agreements were influential in general, they were most effective at changing majority opinion about policies with intermediate costs. Finally, our experiments exposed the dangers of promising too much (overpledging) or too little (underpledging). These findings have important implications for the design and consequences of international agreements. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; goals; international agreements; international relations; voluntary","climate change; emission control; environmental policy; international agreement; international relations; policy approach; political relations; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077074496

Cyanides are highly toxic for human beings, animals, and aquatic organisms. The available physical and chemical methods of wastewater treatment are cost-ineffective. Certain microorganisms are capable of use cyanides as sources of carbon and nitrogen and turn those into ammonia and carbonate. Some plants are also efficient for the processes of cyanides destruction. Phytoremediation of cyanides may be efficient, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and be used as an attractive alternative to traditional physical and chemical processes. This article considers the capability of aquatic plants, which grow in the valley of Zerafshan River on the territory of Uzbekistan, to dispose of cyanides and recover the cyanides-contaminated tailings of Navoi Mining & Metallurgical Combinat. Such aspects as the mechanisms of enzymatic detoxification of cyanides by aquatic plants and microorganisms are discussed.

However, the bacterial community compositions are not systematically elucidated in oil reservoirs with different temperatures. Herein, the diversity of indigenous bacteria and the functional species in the water samples from oil reservoirs with different in situ temperatures was investigated by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that samples in the high (65 °C) and super high (80 °C) temperature oil reservoir had significantly high bacterial richness, even more than twice as much as moderate temperature (36 °C) ones, which showed relatively high bacterial diversity. Meanwhile, the bacterial compositions were almost similar in the high temperature oil reservoirs but there were different relative abundances of the bacterial communities. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that indigenous bacteria fell into 20 phylotypes in which Proteobacteria were the principal phylum in all of samples. At the genus level, 10 out of 22 major genera displayed statistically significant differences. Among of them, Pseudomonas was extremely dominant in all of samples, while Halomonas, Caldicoprobacter, Arcobacter, and Marinobacter tended to be enriched in the high temperature oil reservoirs. Moreover, the abundance of bacterial populations exhibited important distinction in oil reservoir such as hydrocarbon-oxidizing, fermentative, nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic bacteria. Those bacteria were strongly correlated to in situ temperature variation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","16S rRNA gene sequencing; Bacterial community; Functional species; In situ temperature; Oil reservoirs","bacterial DNA; hydrocarbon; RNA 16S; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; genetics; heat; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oil and gas field; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA, Bacterial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hot Temperature; Hydrocarbons; Microbiota; Oil and Gas Fields; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084156567

Nowhere on the planet are blue carbon plants which carry out massive carbon extraction and permanent burial more intensely concentrated than in SE Asia. For the first time we make a national and total inventory of data to date for “blue carbon” buried from mangroves and seagrass and delineate the constraints. For an area across Southeast Asia of approximately 12,000,000 km2, supporting mangrove forests (5,116,032 ha) and seagrass meadows (6,744,529 ha), we analyzed the region's current blue carbon stocks. This estimate was achieved by integrating the sum of estuarine in situ carbon stock measurements with the extent of mangroves and seagrass across each nation, then summed for the region. We found that mangroves ecosystems regionally supported the greater amount of organic carbon (3095.19Tg Corg in 1st meter) over that of seagrass (1683.97 Tg Corg in 1st meter), with corresponding stock densities ranging from 15 to 2205 Mg ha−1 and 31.3 to 2450 Mg ha−1 respectively, a likely underestimate for entire carbon including sediment depths. The largest carbon stocks are found within Indonesia, followed by the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Tropical China, Viet-Nam, and Cambodia. Compared to the blue carbon hotspot of tropical/subtropical Gulf of Mexico's total carbon stock (480.48 Tg Corg), Southeast Asia's greater mangrove–seagrass stock density appears a more intense Blue Carbon hotspot (4778.66 Tg Corg). All regional Southeast Asian nation states should assist in superior preservation and habitat restoration plus similar measures in the USA &amp; Mexico for the Gulf of Mexico, as apparently these form two of the largest tropical carbon sinks within coastal waters. We hypothesize it is SE Asia's regionally unique oceanic–geologic conditions, placed squarely within the tropics, which are largely responsible for this blue carbon hotspot, that is, consistently high ambient light levels and year-long warm temperatures, together with consistently strong inflow of dissolved carbon dioxide and upwelling of nutrients across the shallow geological plates. © 2020","Black carbon; Blue Carbon; Blue carbon mangroves; Blue carbon seagrass; Southeast Asia tropical estuarine carbon; Tropical Southeast Asian blue carbon","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Extraction; Magnesium; Plants (botany); Tropics; Dissolved carbon dioxide; Geologic conditions; Habitat restoration; Papua New Guinea; Seagrass meadows; Similar measures; South-East Asian Nations; Warm temperatures; Organic carbon; blue carbon; carbon dioxide; organic carbon; unclassified drug; black carbon; carbon cycle; concentration (composition); estuarine environment; mangrove; seagrass; tropical environment; Cambodia; China; climate; coastal waters; ecosystem; estuary; Gulf of Mexico; hydrology; Indonesia; Malaysia; mangrove; Myanmar; nutrient; oceanography; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Review; seagrass; Southeast Asia; temperature; Thailand; Viet Nam; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; wetland; Southeast Asia; Rhizophoraceae; Asia, Southeastern; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Gulf of Mexico; Indonesia; Malaysia; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Thailand; Vietnam; Wetlands",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092249473

Here we examine the interannual variability and trends in the latitudinal position of the spring subtropical jet over the Himalayas. During the modern period (1948 to 2018), the spring (March-April-May) jet is typically anchored immediately south of the Himalayas but has rarely (in 1956, 1971, 1984, and 1999) moved poleward to pass over Kyrgyzstan and northwest China. A tree-ring reconstruction of the jet's latitude indicates that such poleward excursions may have become more frequent after 1950, but it is not clear whether that behavior is unprecedented within the past four centuries.

As a fascinating conjugated polymer graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been developed as a hotspot in the research field as a metal-free semiconducting material with the appealing band gap of 2.7 eV. Recently, g-C3N4 has gained tremendous interest in photocatalytic wastewater abatement as well as for hydrogen (H2) generation, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, and pollutant degradation, under exposure to visible light. Plasmonic silver halides (AgX) such as AgCl, AgBr, and AgI as plasmonic photocatalyst have received immense research interest owing to their escalating photocatalytic efficacy and strong surface plasmon resonance effect (SPR). AgX is the photosensitive, broad bandgap semiconducting materials with effectual antimicrobial properties. This review summarizes the heterostructure of carbonaceous g-C3N4 with plasmonic AgX, to reduce the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers, thus enhancing the natural light absorption. g-C3N4 grafted AgX nanoarchitectures can be utilized for several potential applications, for instance, overall water splitting (OWS), CO2 conversion to hydrocarbon fuels, pollutant exclusion, and antibacterial disinfection. This review focuses on the evolution of g-C3N4 as well as AgX, facile, and synthetic routes for fabrication of g-C3N4 tailored AgX, construction of nano-junctions (AgX/g-C3N4) with various photocatalytic applications. Finally, we provided a viewpoint of current hassles and some perceptions of novel trends in this exciting as well as developing research arena. © 2020 The Authors","Energy applications; Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR); Metal free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4); Pollutant mineralization; Semiconductor-based photocatalysis; Wastewater treatment","Bromine compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carrier mobility; Chlorine compounds; Conjugated polymers; Energy gap; Environmental technology; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Image enhancement; Light; Light absorption; Photocatalytic activity; Plasmons; Silver halides; Surface plasmon resonance; Water pollution; Water treatment; Anti-microbial properties; Environmental applications; Environmental remediation; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic systems; Plasmonic photocatalysts; Semiconducting materials; Surface plasmon resonance effects; Iodine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085602289

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are state-of-the-art tools for the fundamental study of reaction mechanisms and predicting the performance of catalytic materials. Proper application of DFT-based methods is crucial when investigating charge-doped electrode surfaces during electrocatalytic and plasma-activated reactions. Here, as a model electrode for plasma-activated CO2 splitting, we studied the interactions of O, CO, and CO2 with the neutral and progressively charged Ag(111) metal surfaces. We show that the application of correction procedures is necessary to obtain accurate adsorption energy profiles of O atoms, CO and CO2 molecules on Ag surfaces that are under the influence of additional electrons. Interestingly, the oxidation of CO is found to shift from a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism on a neutral electrode to an Eley–Rideal mechanism on charged electrodes. Furthermore, we show that the surface charging of Ag(111) electrodes increase their CO2 reduction performance by enhancing the adsorption of O atoms and desorption of CO molecules. A further increase in the absolute charge-state of the electrode surface is expected to waive the thermodynamic barriers for the CO2 splitting reaction. © 2020","CO2 reduction; Density functional theory; Silver electrode; Surface charge","Carbon dioxide; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electrodes; Molecules; Surface charge; Adsorption energies; Catalytic materials; Computational studies; Correction procedure; Electrode surfaces; Fundamental studies; Splitting reactions; Thermodynamic barriers; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083342344

This results in major economic losses in agriculture and forestry every year. Climate change aggravates the adverse effects of combined stresses and increases such losses. Trees suffer even more from the recurrence of biotic and abiotic stress combinations owing to their long lifecycle. Despite the effort to study the damage from individual stress factors, less attention has been given to the effect of the complex interactions between multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. In this review, we assess the importance, impact, and mitigation strategies of climate change driven interactions between biotic and abiotic stresses in forestry. The ecological and economic importance of biotic and abiotic stresses under different combinations is highlighted by their contribution to the decline of the global forest area through their direct and indirect roles in forest loss and to the decline of biodiversity resulting from local extinction of endangered species of trees, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and reduction in the productivity and quality of forest products and services. The abiotic stress factors such as high temperature and drought increase forest disease and insect pest outbreaks, decrease the growth of trees, and cause tree mortality. Reports of massive tree mortality events caused by “hotter droughts” are increasing all over the world, affecting several genera of trees including some of the most important genera in plantation forests, such as Pine, Poplar, and Eucalyptus. While the biotic stress factors such as insect pests, pathogens, and parasitic plants have been reported to be associated with many of these mortality events, a considerable number of the reports have not taken into account the contribution of such biotic factors. The available mitigation strategies also tend to undermine the interactive effect under combined stresses. Thus, this discussion centers on mitigation strategies based on research and innovation, which build on models previously used to curb individual stresses. © Copyright © 2020 Teshome, Zharare and Naidoo.","economic impact; forest disease; insect pests; mitigation; response; stress interaction; tree growth; tree mortality",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097617574

Additionally, the costs of electrifying stoves vs cars for Latvian households was compared. Technical assessment of decarbonization potential revealed that the most adaptive way for CO2reduction in households is to concentrate efforts first on electrification of stoves in Latvian kitchens; and most preferable first step-to begin with equipment that uses LPG.

Precedents of other planned capitals can contribute to an understanding of the potential long-term impacts of Indonesia’s new capital. We used historical nighttime lights to quantitatively assess the spatial growth footprint of 12 previous planned capitals, and conducted land-use analyses to identify the potential environmental impacts on Borneo’s natural environment. Our assessment suggests that it is likely that the direct footprint of the new capital could grow rapidly, expanding over 10 km from its core in less than two decades and over 30 km before mid-century. We identified sensitive ecosystems which may be affected by the new capital’s direct and indirect footprint, such as forest reserves, mangrove and peat. Deforestation emissions from the new capital’s direct (30 km) and indirect (200 km) footprint could be approximately 50 MtCO2e and 2326 MtCO2e respectively, equivalent to 2.7% and 126% of Indonesia’s 2014 greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss how planned capitals can spatially restructure the socio-political geographies of cities and nation-states by interacting with meanings, symbolisms and power relations, which may aggravate environmental impacts but also be seized upon as a catalyst for improving environmental performance in Borneo and Indonesia. Finally, we recommend the use of best practices in impact assessment and sustainability as a necessary first step towards protecting Borneo. © 2020 by the authors.

The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas, can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability, quality, or decomposition capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating CO2 emissions. The study was carried out in the municipality of Selvíria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing, subsidized by the forage plant Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas, and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The results indicated that soil management practices, followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with U. brizantha, increased the total OC (TOC) stocks through the stable fraction (OC associated with the mineral fraction) and consequent reduction in CO2 emissions from the soil. This highlights the spatial variability in CO2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere. The use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast CO2 emissions from the soil. This small-scale study provides a theoretical basis for the large-scale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control CO2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems, particularly in degraded pasture areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture sustainability; Greenhouse effect; Land use change; Particulate carbon","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cattle; cerrado; cultivation; decomposition; forage; organic carbon; pasture; soil emission; total organic carbon; Brazil; Mato Grosso do Sul; Bos; Urochloa brizantha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086123368

TPM contains solid and liquid contaminants and condensable particulate matter (CPM), which is mainly composed of sulfate and various anions, cations, and metal ions. This study selected three typical large-capacity coal-fired power plants in Shanghai retrofitted with ultra-low emission technology and monitored their emissions of PM2.5, SO3, and CPM during power generation. The results showed that the plants achieved comprehensive removal rates of 99.689-99.878% and 86.99-92.92% for PM2.5 and SO3, resulting in emitted concentrations of approximately 0.99-1.79 and 1.91-2.50 mg m-3, respectively, which are considerably lower than those associated with the traditional flue gas process. Additionally, a significant decrease in the emitted filterable particulate matter (FPM) caused a simultaneous decrease in CPM. After being equipped with the ultra-low emission technology, the units displayed a 76% reduction in the emitted FPM concentration and a smaller FPM/CPM ratio (1:2 vs. 1:1).

To date, most have focused on charge transfer and energy transfer from QDs to TMDs, that is, from 0D to 2D. Here, we present a study of the energy transfer process from a 2D to 0D material, specifically exploring energy transfer from monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) to near-infrared emitting lead sulfide-cadmium sulfide (PbS-CdS) QDs. The high absorption cross section of WS2 in the visible region combined with the potentially high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of PbS QD systems makes this an interesting donor-acceptor system that can effectively use the WS2 as an antenna and the QD as a tunable emitter, in this case, downshifting the emission energy over hundreds of millielectron volts. We study the energy transfer process using photoluminescence excitation and PL microscopy and show that 58% of the QD PL arises due to energy transfer from the WS2. Time-resolved photoluminescence microscopy studies show that the energy transfer process is faster than the intrinsic PL quenching by trap states in the WS2, thus allowing for efficient energy transfer. Our results establish that QDs could be used as tunable and high PL efficiency emitters to modify the emission properties of TMDs. Such TMD-QD heterostructures could have applications in light-emitting technologies or artificial light-harvesting systems or be used to read out the state of TMD devices optically in various logic and computing applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Energy transfer; Lead sulfide-cadmium sulfide; Quantum dot; Transition metal dichalcogenide; Tungsten disulfide; Two-dimensional; Zero-dimensional","Antennas; Cadmium sulfide; Charge transfer; Computation theory; II-VI semiconductors; Infrared devices; IV-VI semiconductors; Lead compounds; Monolayers; Nanocrystals; Optoelectronic devices; Photoluminescence; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Absorption cross sections; Artificial light harvesting; Efficient energy transfer; Light emitting technologies; Photo-luminescence excitation; Photoluminescence efficiency; Time-resolved photoluminescence; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Energy transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096106652

The analysis highlights how neoliberal economic rationalism can appropriate public value choice under the guise of technocratic expertise. Experts are often considered responsible agents for the effective administration of public infrastructure, even when ostensibly technical decisions concerning infrastructure management seem to demand normative, political input. Technocratic administration arising from economic rationalist priorities can thereby exacerbate the hazards presented by climate variability and advancing climate change. Climate risk managers in both cases over-relied on operating protocols and the expertise of engineers to administer public infrastructure in pursuit of economic priorities. When operating protocols proved insufficient in the face of climate extremes, however, blame was assigned to experts despite their making all available attempts to avert disaster. Through analysis of these cases, the paper discusses the need for normative transparency in expert-led public administration and better integration of multi-level governance for climate resilience when pursuing economic rationalist imperatives. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment","climate change adaptation; dam management; economic rationalism; experts; infrastructure","administrative framework; climate change; comparative study; dam; demand analysis; environmental economics; governance approach; infrastructure; public administration; water management; Australia; Brisbane; Cork [(CNT) Munster]; Ireland; Munster [Ireland]; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086125831

Current plans for power sector mainly focus on the clean and low-carbon development, while it is unclear how to reconcile CO2-reduction target with water-saving target. In this paper, an optimization model named NET-Power (National Energy Technology-Power) is developed to simulate the deployment of power generation technologies, and to further answer whether there is a conflict or not between water-saving target and CO2-reduction target in the power sector. The result shows that peaking carbon emissions before 2030 in the power sector may increase the water consumption by 34.85Gt. In addition, to further meeting the water constraint on the basis of peaking carbon emissions would lead to a higher carbon intensity of thermal power. These findings indicate that low-carbon transition will cause significant water-carbon contradiction, which mainly lies in nuclear power technology and dry-cooling technology. Finally, the optimal technology layout path that can meet the dual constraints of water and carbon for the power sector in China is proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Low-carbon transition; NET-Power model; Power sector; Water saving; Water-carbon nexus","Carbon dioxide; Nuclear fuels; Water conservation; Electricity generation; Energy technologies; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon transitions; Nuclear power technology; Optimal technology; Optimization modeling; Power generation technology; Carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; water; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; optimization; water use; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; China; conflict; controlled study; cooling; cost; dry cooling technology; electric power plant; electricity; energy consumption; fluid intake; hydropower; mathematical model; nuclear energy; power generation technology; priority journal; simulation; technology; water conservation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088500158

The mobile observations were performed in both summer (July 2017) and winter (January and February 2018) and the total driving mileage exceeded 3000 km. The concentrations of NO2 and SO2 in different seasons and areas were significantly different. During winter, serious NO2 and SO2 pollution was observed in northern Anhui Province, central Shandong Province, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. The evolution and transportation processes of three typical heavy pollution cases were discussed in detail. Combined with the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model simulated wind field information, the NO2 transportation flux from northern Jiangsu Province to northern Anhui Province is quantified as 7.12 kg s−1. Finally, we estimated the NO2 and SO2 emissions from the Dezhou and Hengshui power plants by plume cross section scanning and encircled observations, respectively. The NO2 and SO2 emission fluxes of the Dezhou Power Plant are 0.79 kg s−1 and 1.11 kg s−1, respectively, while the NO2 and SO2 emission fluxes of the Hengshui Power Plant are 0.12 kg s−1 and 0.36 kg s−1, respectively.

Soil metallic nutrients, an integrated part of soil nutrient fertility, play a significant role in the maintenance of ecosystem functions. However, how soil metallic nutrients respond to global warming remains poorly understood. Spatial observations across a temperature gradient provide a solid evidence in clarifying the long-term responses of soil metallic nutrients to global warming. But due to the collinearity between temperature and precipitation in the geographical patterns, the influence of temperature on soil metallic nutrients might be interfered by the precipitation effect. To minimize the precipitation effect, this study conducted a soil sampling over broad geographical scale along the 400 mm isohyet in China, which extends about 6000 km. Variations in soil potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) concentrations across the temperature transect were investigated. These four elements all increased until mean annual temperature (MAT) increased to about 2 °C and then decreased with increasing MAT. Temperature, soil property and vegetation type were responsible for the changes of soil metallic nutrients at MAT below 2 °C; altitude, soil property, vegetation type and soil parent material were dominant influential factors of soil metallic nutrients at MAT above 2 °C. Temperature exerted an indirect influence on soil metallic nutrients through its effects on soil property, vegetation type, rock weathering, microbial decomposition and plant growth. It could be expected based on our results that the effects of global warming on soil K, Ca, Mg and Fe might depend on local MAT. Different regions with different climates should adopt different strategies to cope with the effect of global warming on soil metallic nutrients so that ecosystems maintain stable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Metal; Precipitation effect; Soil fertility; Soil nutrients","Ecosystems; Global warming; Metals; Soils; Vegetation; Weathering; Ecosystem functions; Geographical patterns; Influential factors; Mean annual temperatures; Microbial decomposition; Precipitation effects; Spatial observation; Terrestrial ecosystems; Nutrients; calcium; iron; magnesium; potassium; calcium; climate effect; fertility; global warming; iron; magnesium; metal; nutrient; potassium; soil chemistry; soil nutrient; soil property; temperature effect; temperature gradient; terrestrial ecosystem; altitude; Article; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental impact; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; nutrient content; precipitation; priority journal; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil metallic nutrient; soil property; soil quality; temperature sensitivity; vegetation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088308924

Here we apply this technology to assess chemical and physical controls on sublacustrine vent fluids in Yellowstone Lake, WY. Autonomous sensor systems were deployed in August 2017 using ROV assets to position instruments at two sites in the Deep Hole region of the Lake, off-shore from Stevenson Island. Earlier studies have documented that fissure related depressions (~120 m water depth) in this region host numerous vents issuing high enthalpy, CO2 saturated and H2S bearing vapor, at temperatures in excess of 150 °C. The YSZ (ceramic)-based in-situ chemical sensors deployed here were designed to measure pH and redox at 60 s intervals for up to one year. Two titanium-sheathed thermocouples, one coupled directly to the electrochemical sensor and another, independently powered and positioned slightly deeper in vents at deployment sites, provided insight on maximum temperature in the near surface region. In addition to in-situ chemical and temperature data, vent fluid samples were acquired at the outset and during recovery with a novel isobaric system that maintains lake bottom pressure, precluding fluid-sample de-gassing. At the same time, push cores of vents and in the near vent region were also acquired. The mineralized cores provide evidence of long term mass transfer processes, while also facilitating insertion and stabilization of the sensor units on the lake floor. Recovery of the sensors documented similar chemical controls at both sites, suggesting compositionally invariant vapor influx, characterized by moderately low pH (~4–5) and reducing conditions, buffered by CO2 and H2S, respectively. Accordingly, the diatomaceous sediment was extensively altered to kaolinite and pyrite. Temperature variability at the two sites was especially significant. One site (Site B), situated on the slope of what might be a hydrothermal domal structure, demonstrated noteworthy cooling and heating episodes that may be associated with hydrothermally or seismically triggered sediment slumping events. Upon instrument recovery in 2018, the vent site was largely sediment covered and the sensor insert showed evidence of dis-location and melting by conductive heating under the hot sediment overburden. The initially active and high temperature vent fluid (~148 °C) had largely ceased and replaced by diffuse flow venting at the margin of the previous up-flow zone. The time series in-situ chemical and physical data obtained in the course of the study document the existence of a dynamic hydrothermal system in time and space, while underscoring the challenges of research of this type in such environments. © 2020","Hydrothermal fluids; In-situ sensor; pH and redox; Seismic activity; Temperature logger; Yellowstone Lake","Carbon dioxide; Dynamics; Electrochemical sensors; High temperature operations; Hydrogen sulfide; Kaolinite; Lakes; Mass transfer; Pyrites; Recovery; Sediments; Temperature sensors; Thermocouples; Time series; Vents; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Yttrium metallography; Conductive heating; Heat and mass transports; Hydrothermal system; Mass transfer process; Maximum temperature; Near surface regions; Reducing conditions; Temperature variability; Hydrochemistry; data; heat transfer; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal system; hydrothermal vent; in situ measurement; mass transfer; pH; redox conditions; seismicity; sensor; temperature; United States; Wyoming; Yellowstone Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091196895

One such disruptive solution is a morphing wing cargo UAV, with distributed propulsion. This paper investigates the aerodynamics, flight dynamics and control of a scaled down technology demonstrator UAV, built to validate the feasibility of the morphing wing concept. Several types of analyses are run to gain knowledge on the performance, stability and control properties of the aircraft. The flight mechanical effects of the distributed propulsion system are taken into account based on the integral momentum theorem. The increased flow speed behind propellers increases the local lift forces. Therefore, the distributed propulsion can be used to control the roll, pitch and yaw motion of the morphing wing aircraft. The nonlinear 6 degrees of freedom, distributed propulsion aircraft model is constructed utilizing the stability and control derivatives obtained from the aerodynamic analysis. Grid and Tensor Product (TP) type linear parameter-varying (LPV) models of the morphing wing aircraft are generated via Jacobian linearization and TP model transformation. The LPV models capture the parameter varying dynamics arising from the airspeed, morphing wing and payload weight variations. Gain scheduled lateral and longitudinal baseline controllers are synthesized using the grid-based LPV model of the aircraft. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Aerodynamic stability; Aircraft control; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Emission control; Flight control systems; Flight dynamics; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Propulsion; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerodynamic analysis; Distributed propulsions; Dynamics and control; Emission reduction targets; Jacobian linearization; Linear parameter varying models; Stability and control; Unconventional aircraft; Wings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100905496

However, projections from Earth System Models are undermined by poorly constrained assumptions regarding the biological cycling of iron, which is the main limiting resource for NPP over large parts of the ocean. In this study, we show that the climate change trends in NPP and the biomass of upper trophic levels are strongly affected by modifying assumptions associated with phytoplankton iron uptake. Using a suite of model experiments, we find 21st century climate change impacts on regional NPP range from −12.3% to +2.4% under a high emissions climate change scenario. This wide range arises from variations in the efficiency of iron retention in the upper ocean in the eastern equatorial Pacific across different scenarios of biological iron uptake, which affect the strength of regional iron limitation. Those scenarios where nitrogen limitation replaced iron limitation showed the largest projected NPP declines, while those where iron limitation was more resilient displayed little future change. All model scenarios have similar skill in reproducing past inter-annual variations in regional ocean NPP, largely due to limited change in the historical period. Ultimately, projections of end of century upper trophic level biomass change are altered by 50%–80% across all plausible scenarios. Overall, we find that uncertainties in the biological iron cycle cascade through open ocean pelagic ecosystems, from plankton to fish, affecting their evolution under climate change.

Transportation in form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) could be an alternative to the traditional transportation by pipeline or, as liquefied gas, by ships, but the ratio between the mass of transported gas and the container weight is currently too low. One of the many projects focusing on the development of innovative lightweight pressure cylinders is GASVESSEL, which proposes composite cylinders with a diameter of more than 3 m: loaded on a ship, they could allow transporting quantities of CNG as big as 10,000 tons. The related loading and unloading processes affect both the overall time required for transport and the quantity of transported gas; therefore, they have an impact on the economic feasibility of the whole project. In this paper, a newly developed process simulation model is presented that allows assessing the duration of the loading and unloading processes, the mass of transported CNG, and the amount of power and energy required by the process. The model is useful to support the design of the system considering different plant components and operating strategies. It is applied to the analysis of the loading and unloading of a ship that meets the GASVESSEL project specifications. The results show that the duration of the process is of the order of magnitude of 100 h, depending on ambient temperature, and that the energy consumption can vary in the range of 150–180 kJ for a unit mass of CNG. Finally, the model is used to simulate the same process with hydrogen, an energy carrier that allows meeting, together with the use of fuel cells, the requirements of zero local emissions. The results show increments of both the final loading temperature and compressor power with respect to the CNG case. © 2020 by the authors.

However, currently lacking is a numerical model capable of simulating a diversity of environments in the ocean, where CH4 can be produced and destroyed, and with the flexibility to be able to explore not only relatively recent perturbations to Earth's CH4 cycle but also to probe CH4 cycling and associated climate impacts under the very low-O2 conditions characteristic of most of Earth's history and likely widespread on other Earth-like planets. Here, we present a refinement and expansion of the ocean-atmosphere CH4 cycle in the intermediate-complexity Earth system model cGENIE, including parameterized atmospheric O2-O3-CH4 photochemistry and schemes for microbial methanogenesis, aerobic methanotrophy, and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). We describe the model framework, compare model parameterizations against modern observations, and illustrate the flexibility of the model through a series of example simulations. Though we make no attempt to rigorously tune default model parameters, we find that simulated atmospheric CH4 levels and marine dissolved CH4 distributions are generally in good agreement with empirical constraints for the modern and recent Earth. Finally, we illustrate the model's utility in understanding the timedependent behavior of the CH4 cycle resulting from transient carbon injection into the atmosphere, and we present model ensembles that examine the effects of atmospheric pO2, oceanic dissolved SO2 4 , and the thermodynamics of microbial metabolism on steady-state atmospheric CH4 abundance. Future model developments will address the sources and sinks of CH4 associated with the terrestrial biosphere and marine CH4 gas hydrates, both of which will be essential for comprehensive treatment of Earth's CH4 cycle during geologically recent time periods. © Author(s) 2020.

Besides having an ecological function to maintain biodiversity and environmental balance, it also has its economic and socio-cultural functions. Furthermore, it has provided enormous benefits for life and has had positive social and economic impacts. Peat ecosystems have been damaged due to the mismanagement of land. Areas that play specific roles in its sustainability have been converted to lands for business activities, which contradicts their characteristic function. Land cover restoration policies will be useful for improving the quality of participatory-based land cover, protecting peat domes, and conserving watersheds (DAS). An increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which occurs due to insufficient peatland management is a serious threat to local communities and their livelihoods. Furthermore, the ecosystem can be conserved by ensuring that water is properly managed, drainage to cultivated areas is limited and peat swamp forest systems are protected.

Prairie restorations can improve ecosystem services on former agricultural lands, but prairie restorations on mine lands are relatively under-studied. This study investigated the impact of prairie restoration on mine lands, focusing on the plant community and soil properties. In southeast Ohio, 305 ha within a ~2000 ha area of former mine land was converted to native prairie through herbicide and planting between 1999–2016. Soil and vegetation sampling occurred from 2016–2018. Plant community composition shifted with prairie age, with highest native cover in the oldest prairie areas. Prairie plants were more abundant in older prairies. The oldest prairies had significantly more soil fungal biomass and higher soil microbial biomass. However, many soil properties (e.g., soil nutrients, β-glucosoidase activity, and soil organic carbon), as well as plant species diversity and richness trended higher in prairies, but were not significantly different from baseline cool-season grasslands. Overall, restoration with prairie plant communities slowly shifted soil properties, but mining disturbance was still the most significant driver in controlling soil properties. Prairie restoration on reclaimed mine land was effective in establishing a native plant community, with the associated ecosystem benefits. © 2020 by the authors.

The fracture toughness of mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode I/II of sandstone before and after the experiment was tested, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the fracture mechanical characteristics of sandstone. Results showed that the pure mode I fracture toughness of sandstone immersed in supercritical CO2 (ScCO2), liquid CO2, and gaseous CO2 for 30 days decreased by 27.89%, 11.01%, and 17.43%, respectively, compared to nonimmersed sandstone. Pure mode I fracture toughness was more sensitive than mixed-mode I/II and pure mode II fracture toughness to the various CO2 phase states. Furthermore, the ability of sandstone to resist fracture and failure was significantly reduced by the adsorption of CO2 in different phases. The effects of the different phases were in the following order: ScCO2 &gt; gaseous CO2 &gt; liquid CO2. The decreased ability of sandstone to resist fracture was primarily due to the geophysical and chemical reactions between CO2 and minerals, the alteration of minerals, or the formation of new substances. SEM observations showed that liquid CO2 adsorption caused the sandstone to undergo intergranular fracture, and the adsorption of gaseous CO2 promoted the occurrence of transgranular fractures. In particular, due to the ScCO2 adsorption, various fracture forms such as intergranular fractures, transgranular fractures, and mutual coupling fractures existed simultaneously. Sandstone exhibited numerous fractures and pores, and fracture resistance was weakened. Results of this study have important significance for evaluating the stability and safety of CO2 geological storage. © 2020 The Authors.

Hybrid generation that exploits complementarity in resource characteristics among different renewable types potentially provides value for minimising technical constraints and increasing the effective use of the network. Tidal, wave and wind energy are prominent offshore renewable energy sources. It is of importance to explore their potential complementarity for increasing network integration. In this work, the novel introduction of these distinct offshore renewable resources into hosting capacity evaluation enables the quantification of the benefits of various resource combinations. A scenario reduction technique is adapted to effectively consider variation of these renewables in an AC optimal power flow-based nonlinear optimisation model. Moreover, the beneficial impact of active network management (ANM) on enhancing the renewable complementarity is also investigated. The combination of complementary hybrid generation and ANM, specifically where themaxima of the generation profiles rarely co-occur with each other and with the demand minimum, is found to make the best use of the network components. © 2020 by the authors.","Electricity distribution network; Hosting capacity; Offshore wind; Optimisation; Tidal; Wave","Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Nonlinear programming; Offshore oil well production; Tidal power; Wind power; Ac optimal power flows; Electricity distribution networks; Network integration; Non-linear optimisation; Offshore renewable energies; Resource characteristic; Scenario reduction techniques; Technical constraints; Offshore power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106652410

To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acid rain; Air pollutant prediction; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Extreme learning machine; Sample entropy; Whale optimization algorithm","Acid rain; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Air pollutant concentrations; Decomposition algorithm; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Extreme learning machine; Optimization algorithms; Secondary decomposition; Sequence reconstruction; Terrestrial ecosystems; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); decomposition; empirical analysis; modeling; nitrogen dioxide; optimization; prediction; sulfur dioxide; terrestrial ecosystem; air pollutant concentration prediction model; algorithm; Article; complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method; concentration (parameter); controlled study; decomposition algorithm; entropy; information processing; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; mode decomposition; model; prediction; reliability; sequence reconstruction; signal processing; support vector machine; whale optimization algorithm; air pollutant; air pollution; ecosystem; forecasting; Cetacea; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Ecosystem; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088977720

However, few studies have considered how urbanization affects carbon emission efficiency. To explore the impact of urbanization on carbon emission efficiency, this study evaluates the carbon emission efficiency based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2016. The correlations between six factors, including the level of urbanization, and carbon efficiency were analyzed by using a stochastic frontier model that combines with the translog production function. The results suggest that, first, despite the steady improvement in China's carbon efficiency, the average carbon efficiency is 0.5730 in 2016, with room for improvement of 42.70%. Second, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and carbon emission efficiency. The coefficient of the urbanization level is −0.6370, and the coefficient of its square is 1.2310. In the early stage, the expansion of the scope of urbanization promotes the improvement of carbon emission efficiency. Once the urbanization level passes the critical point, the economic growth rate will lag behind the growth rate of carbon emissions. Third, economic development level, energy consumption structure, foreign trade, and government intervention are positively correlated with carbon emission efficiency. Industrial structure inhibits the improvement of carbon emission efficiency. The conclusion provides a theoretical reference for urban planning and the green economy for government policymakers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission efficiency; Green economy; Stochastic frontier analysis; Translog production function; Urbanization","Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; International trade; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Urban growth; Carbon emission efficiencies; Economic growth rate; Energy consumption structure; Government intervention; Industrial structures; Stochastic frontier models; Trans-log production functions; Urbanization levels; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087867129

Industrial emissions of PM2.5, SO2, NOx and other pollutants have a significant impact on regional air quality. Monitoring industrial pollution emissions is of great significance for the prevention and control of air pollution. The VIIRS Nightfire products can detect thermal anomalies in heavy industrial sectors, thus providing a new means for monitoring industrial activities. In this study, the VIIRS 375 product was selected to study the spatial and temporal changes of the heavy industrial thermal anomalies through spatial analysis and mathematical statistics methods. Furthermore, it is the first time to use thermal anomaly radiative power (CTRP) to evaluate the spatiotemporal pattern of industrial pollution emissions and its impact on air quality in the BTH region. We observed that the spatial distribution of CTRP was unbalanced and that Tangshan-Tianjin and Handan-Xingtai- Shijiazhuang were found to be high-density pollution areas. The CTRP in Tangshan and Handan were higher than in other cities, accounting for 72.41% of their area. From 2012 to 2018, CTRP in this region decreased by 17.2% per year while in Langfang decreased by 72.9% per year. The CTRP also showed a significantly positive correlation with industrial energy consumption. Emissions of SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 were high in the area of intense distribution of thermal anomalies. When compared to the density of tropospheric NO2 and SO2 columns and the monitored concentrations of SO2 and PM2.5, CTRP was consistent with the trend of interannual variations and spatial distributions. The energy-saving and emissions reduction measures taken by the industrial sector in the BTH contributed significantly to improving regional air quality. Remote sensing-based monitoring can provide regional industrial energy consumption in real-time and reflect pollution emissions, providing a basis for industrial pollution emissions regulation and reduction policy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; CTRP; Industrial emissions; Remote sensing; VIIRS Nightfire","Air quality; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution detection; Quality control; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Statistics; Thermal pollution; Industrial activities; Industrial energy consumption; Interannual variation; Mathematical statistics methods; Positive correlations; Prevention and controls; Spatial and temporal changes; Spatiotemporal patterns; Energy utilization; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); industrial emission; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; temperature anomaly; VIIRS; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tangshan; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084949191

Application of biofertilizer has been considered as an effective approach for soil improvement and agriculture sustainability. In this study, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of B. subtilis biofertilizer on mitigating NH3 volatilization and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Compared with organic fertilizer, the incorporation of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced NH3 volatilization by up to 44%. Moreover, the application of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced the abundance of ureC gene, and increased the abundance of functional genes (bacterial amoA and comammox amoA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). This indicated that the conversion of fertilizer nitrogen to NH4+-N was decreased and the nitrification process was increased. In brief, the application of B. subtilis biofertilizer reduced the “source” and increased the “sink” of NH4+-N, thus reducing the retention of NH4+-N in alkaline soil, and mitigating NH3 volatilization. These results indicated that B. subtilis biofertilizer is an effective control strategy for agricultural NH3 emission, maintaining high crop yield and mitigating environmental disturbance. © 2020 The Authors","Ammonia volatilization; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial community; Biofertilizer; Functional gene; Soil enzyme","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ammonia; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Genes; Nitrification; Soils; Sustainable development; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Effective approaches; Environmental disturbances; Fertilizer applications; Global environment; Nitrification process; Nitrogen deposition; Organic fertilizers; Nitrogen fertilizers; ammonia; biofertilizer; fertilizer; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; unclassified drug; fertilizer; alternative agriculture; ammonia; biofertilizer; biome; emission; gene; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; soil improvement; soil nitrogen; agriculture; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; amoA gene; Article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial gene; comammox; controlled study; environment; harvest; nonhuman; priority journal; soil acidity; soil microflora; ureC gene; volatilization; Bacillus subtilis; microbiology; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nitrosomonadales; Agriculture; Ammonia; Bacillus subtilis; Fertilizers; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088825846

For urban communities in Indonesia, mosques play an important role in social life. The Muslims carry out various kinds of activities in mosques besides praying. With its various activities, the mosque also has unique energy use characteristics when compared to other types of buildings such as houses, offices, and commercials. This paper presents an analysis of energy use in mosques in urban areas with tropical climate. Data was collected through a survey of mosques during 2018 to 2019 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The results show that the use of energy in mosques in urban areas in Yogyakarta on average consumes 182.2 kWh per day. The highest use is for air conditioning by 29.16%. Overall, the mosque energy consumption intensity varies from 0.16 to 4.54 kWh per square meter monthly and all of them meets criteria as very efficient buildings. In the other side, only 6 out of 15 mosques meet the national standard for lighting. In the term of green building standard, there are 9 out of 15 mosques meet the criteria in energy consumption aspect.

This phenomenon occurs more apparently in acoustic sensor surveillance system and complicates angle-only target tracking problems. As a result, the current state of the target kinematic information is difficult to estimate. For the double observer systems, even if they are synchronized, there is a time-offset between the observers due to signal propagation delay. So each observer receives signals from the same target at different emission times. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to deal with this time-offset by building a set of constraints for a centralized double observer system in a three-dimensional environment, and using the Gauss-Helmert model for the state transition of two adjacent consecutive states. Furthermore, we consider the varying underwater sound speed and apply a sound speed profile model.

It lacks conventional energy resources and is alternative energy disadvantaged. Yet its aggregate carbon intensity, given by the ratio of carbon emissions to GDP, dropped by 30% from 2005 to 2014. Currently it has a relatively low carbon intensity. Using I–O analysis, we study Singapore's aggregate carbon intensity and the factors contributing to its changes at different levels, i.e. final demand, sector, and transmission levels. It is found that domestic exports accounted for nearly two-thirds of Singapore's aggregate carbon intensity, followed by private consumption and investment. At the sectoral level, the top three contributors were the petroleum, petrochemical, and land transport sectors. Improvements in emission intensity and final demand structure were major factors contributing to reductions in carbon intensity. Our study contributes to the literature in two aspects. Methodologically, it deals with embodied emission intensity and analyzes its changes from the demand perspective. This differs from most studies in the literature from the production perspective. Empirically, the findings and policy implications are unique as they are applicable to a major city. With urbanization taking place in many developing countries, cites’ role in emissions and environmental sustainability are growing in importance but not many in-depth analyses similar to our study have been reported. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregate carbon intensity; Aggregate embodied intensity; Attribution analysis; Input-output analysis; Singapore; Structural decomposition analysis","Aggregates; Developing countries; Energy resources; Investments; Petroleum transportation; Public policy; Sustainable development; Alternative energy; Carbon intensity; Demand structures; Embodied emissions; Emission intensity; Environmental sustainability; In-depth analysis; Policy implications; Carbon; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; demand analysis; export; input-output analysis; sustainability; urbanization; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089489563

Hallmarks of this active process are sharp location-dependent frequency tuning and compressive nonlinearity over a wide stimulus range. The amplifier relies on outer hair cell (OHC)-generated forces driven in part by the endocochlear potential, the ∼+80 mV potential maintained in scala media, generated by the stria vascularis. We transiently eliminated the endocochlear potential in vivo by an intravenous injection of furosemide and measured the vibrations of different layers in the cochlea's organ of Corti using optical coherence tomography. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were also monitored. After furosemide injection, the vibrations of the basilar membrane lost the best frequency (BF) peak and showed broad tuning similar to a passive cochlea. The intra-organ of Corti vibrations measured in the region of the OHCs lost the BF peak and showed low-pass responses but retained nonlinearity. This strongly suggests that OHC electromotility was operating and being driven by nonlinear OHC current. Thus, although electromotility is presumably necessary to produce a healthy BF peak, the mere presence of electromotility is not sufficient. The BF peak recovered nearly fully within 2 h, along with the recovery of odd-order distortion product otoacoustic emissions. The recovery pattern suggests that physical shifts in operating condition are a critical step in the recovery process. © 2020 Biophysical Society",,"animal; basilar membrane; cochlea; hearing; outer hair cell; vibration; Animals; Basilar Membrane; Cochlea; Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer; Hearing; Vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094958802

Although wind energy production is to some desirable as a form of renewable energy for reducing global CO2 emission, it conflicts with conservation goals when airborne animals die during collisions. Yet, protecting species with high collision risk may prevent to some extent the deployment of wind turbines or involve altered operation schemes with lowered energy production, two constraints impairing the development of wind energy production. Stakeholders involved in wind turbine projects discuss this dilemma not only based on their knowledge and interests, but also on their thoughts and emotions about wind turbines or affected animals such as bats. We studied some of these cognitions and emotions of stakeholders involved in the local realization of wind turbine projects (e.g. planning or authorization) to shed light on fundamental aspects of disagreements. We undertook a self-administered online survey (n=537 respondents) with six stakeholder groups from the wind energy and conservation sector to understand i) their value orientations, beliefs and emotions, the predictive potential of ii) value orientations, beliefs, emotions on trust as well as iii) trust among and in stakeholders involved in decision making processes. We observed that beliefs about the importance of wind turbines and emotions towards wind turbines differed across stakeholders while emotions towards bats were generally positive. Overall, stakeholders had low trust in each other. Representatives from the wind energy sector had more trust in politicians compared to conservationists. Trust was most strongly influenced by beliefs about the importance of wind turbines. Beliefs about the importance of wind turbines were in turn most strongly influenced by emotions towards bats and wind turbines. We argue that awareness of different beliefs and emotions among stakeholders should be acknowledged in this apparent conflict to foster trust among stakeholders. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Conflict mitigation; Human dimensions; Renewable energy","Animals; Decision making; Energy policy; Surveys; Wind power; Decision making process; Energy productions; Human dimensions; Operation schemes; Renewable energies; Stakeholder groups; Value orientation; Wind energy production; Wind turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087520228

In order to illustrate the interaction of the SDG's, a Secant-Pile/Bulkhead Shore-Protection project that is buried within a dune-system and is in harmony with the surrounding coastal environment was chosen. Constructability issues will be discussed and illustrated, and data measurements provided to showcase the efficiency of this system, resulting in GFRP assembly time savings of 32% to 52%, lightweight installations and ease of constructability. An indication will be provided how the construction sector (i.e. sustainable built environment) can contribute towards Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11) of the future, along with the challenges that are associated with new materials and methods that yet have to find a broader foothold. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

UN SDG 13 calls for climate action to strengthen the resilience of our cities and reduce the impact of climate change. In this work, a modern, naturally ventilated school in Southampton, UK was used to evaluate single, ""hard"", passive retrofit measures and ""soft"", building management solutions that could increase the wellbeing of students and reduce current and future demand for cooling. The school was selected as it represents the current standardised design guidance for schools released in 2012 by the Department of Education (DfE). The research presents air temperature observations collected during the summer of 2015. Dynamic thermal modelling was undertaken to evaluate passive retrofit and ""soft""solutions to reduce the overheating risk. The model was validated with temperature data collected from the school classrooms. The results indicate that (a) such school buildings have high likelihood of overheating, based on children's comfort temperatures and (b) passive retrofits focused on shading and ventilation could help to reduce the classroom temperature when required. It is recommended that ""soft""adaptive solutions will prove effective to reduce future air conditioning demand, but this will require a radical change in established practices.

Here 0.1M zinc sulphate mixed with ammonia solution is taken as the cationic precursor and distilled water at 70 °C as the anionic precursor. Lithium doping is done by adding anhydrous Lithium chloride (LiCl) in cationic solution at different atomic weight percentage (5%, 10% and 15%) as required.The samples were annealed for 1 hour at a holding temperature of 500 °C.The X ray diffraction analysis showed that the undoped samples are in amorphous phase. The doped (5 wt.%) samples showed peaks corresponding to ZnO hexagonal wurtzite structure and the calculations revealed that the lattice parameters are close to the standard values. But the Li doped samples at atomic weight percentages 10 and 15 showed much variation from ZnO crystal structure and 15 wt.% sample was completely turned to amorphous state. The UV-Visible transmission was 80% for the undoped sample. The transmission reduced to below 1.5% for the Li:ZnO film at 5 wt.% doping. Again the transmission properties improved with increase in doping and was 80% for the film with 15 wt.% doping.The photoluminescence spectra of the samples were drawn. The undoped sample showed a strong broader peak centered near 400 nm, corresponding to near band edge emission and some minor peaks at longer wavelength region, indicating the presence of defects. After doping at atomic weight 5%, this shorter wavelenghth emission had been reduced and the longer crystal defect related emission became dominant, which may be the cause for reduction in transmission of the sample.

In this study, the seasonal changes in microbial communities associated with operational parameters of two full-scale ADs (C and W plants) treating FW were analyzed. The organic loading rate (OLR) variability had an influence on the seasonal CH4 yield; the W plant had a lower CH4 yield with an unstable AD performance while the C plant had a higher CH4 yield with a stable AD performance. It was mainly due to the substantially different NH4+ concentration; the W plant had a NH4+ concentration nearly 1.6 times higher compared to the C plant. The high NH4+ presence in the W plant led to the dominance of class Clostridia, and methanogenesis was mostly done by hydrogenotrophs (Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis).

Unequal access to urban vegetation might exacerbate existing socioeconomic differences. Studies performed in cities of developed countries show that the population with higher socioeconomic status has more access to ecosystem services provided by vegetation. In urban areas, with small internal climatic variation, plant productivity measured through satellite imagery is a good indicator of vegetation availability that can be mapped. In this study, we characterized the distribution of plant productivity in 40 Argentine urban centers and we identified socio-environmental variables that control its spatial patterns within and among urban centers. We used socioeconomic indicators obtained from the 2010 National Population and Households Census and a 4-year mean plant productivity measured through the integration of NDVI values derived from MODIS satellite images. In most of the analyzed cities, plant productivity increased as socioeconomic status decreased; and only in 25% of the cities, we found a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and plant productivity. In the latter case, most of the cities were placed in arid environments, where both the cost of watering and the effect of subsidized water on plant productivity are proportionally higher. Buenos Aires and Bariloche, which also showed positive associations between socioeconomic status and plant productivity, are located in humid environments, but Buenos Aires is the most densely populated city of Argentina and Bariloche is a touristic city; in these cities, the relative cost of keeping green spaces instead of building housing infrastructure is also high. These results show that vegetation distribution among socioeconomic status is more diverse than suggested by the literature and that the appropriation of vegetation productivity by groups with higher socioeconomic status only occurs when vegetation cost increases to the point of becoming a luxury good. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","MODIS; social inequalities; socio-environmental control; TIMESAT; urban vegetation; vegetation productivity","ecosystem service; MODIS; NDVI; satellite imagery; socioeconomic indicator; socioeconomic status; urban area; urban ecosystem; vegetation dynamics; Argentina; Bariloche; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Rio Negro [Argentina]; Argentinidae; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077555380

A number of species directly related to the function of the material are characterized using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Isolated Eu2+ sites are identified and associated with the substitutional doping for Ca2+ in the lattice which are responsible for the 645 nm emission of interest. Another inactive Eu2+ site based within a “EuO” type phase aggregated on the surface of the material is also identified, as well as competitive F+ center defects that are known to reduce emission from the Eu2+ sites. Intrinsic Mn2+ impurities are identified and used as local order probes to determine changes in ordering and symmetry upon cryo-milling and heating treatments of the samples. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies are also conducted to complement the local structure observations.

However, the lack of microbial aggregation under haloalkaline conditions limits the volumetric rates of sulfate and thiosulfate reducing bioreactors. As biomass retention in haloalkaline bioreactors has not been studied before, sand was chosen as a biomass carrier material to increase cell retention and consequently raise the volumetric rates. The results showed that ~10 fold higher biomass concentrations could be achieved with sand, compared to previous studies without carrier addition. The volumetric rates of sulfate/thiosulfate reduction increased approximately 4.5 times. Biomass attachment to the sand was restricted to cavities within the sand particles. Acetate produced by acetogenic bacteria from H2 and CO2 was used as carbon source for biomass growth, while formate that was also produced from H2 and CO2 enhanced sulfate reduction. The microbial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and Tindallia related bacteria were probably responsible for formate formation from hydrogen. The community attached to the sand particles was similar to the suspended fraction, but the relative abundance of sequences most closely related to Desulfohalobiaceae was much higher in the attached fraction compared to the suspended fraction (30% and 13%, respectively). The results indicated that even though the biomass attachment to sand was poor, it still increased the biomass concentration and consequently the sulfate and thiosulfate reduction volumetric rates. © 2020","Acetogenesis; Biomass retention; Carrier material; Formate; Haloalkaline biodesulfurization; Hydrogen; Sulfate reduction; Thiosulfate reduction","Bacteria; Bioreactors; Carbon dioxide; RNA; Sand; Sulfur compounds; Acetogenic bacteria; Biodesulfurization; Biomass attachment; Biomass concentrations; Formate formation; Microbial community composition; Relative abundance; Sulfate reduction; Biomass; carbon dioxide; chemical compound; haloalkaline; hydrogen; RNA 16S; sulfate; thiosulfate; unclassified drug; RNA 16S; sulfate; biomass; bioreactor; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); gene expression; immobilization; relative abundance; RNA; sulfate; amplicon; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium; biomass; carbon source; concentration (parameter); Desulfohalobiaceae; immobilization; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; retention time; sand; species composition; Tindallia; biomass; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; Desulfohalobiaceae; Tindallia; Biomass; Bioreactors; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sand; Sulfates; Thiosulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088636610

In recent decades, traditional extensive management of olive groves has shifted to an intensive regime, with some cases of abandonment. These situations triggered negative environmental and economic externalities that led farmers to adopt increasingly multifunctional management models. From a transdisciplinary perspective, the current state of Spanish olive groves was analyzed, assessing their vulnerability to climate change as one of the main threats to their sustainability. Based on our findings and assuming that by 2050, in the Mediterranean, there will be an increase in temperature of 0.8–2.3◦C and a decrease in rainfall of up to 200 mm per year, a displacement of the distribution area of olive groves is expected towards zones of lower temperature and higher moisture. The predicted climatic conditions would increase evapotranspiration of vegetation and atmospheric CO2 emissions. Moreover, climate change will reduce the chill accumulation in olive groves, altering its flowering, fructification and crop yields. Thus, it is necessary to adopt management models that promote olive grove resilience in face of climate change, ensuring their socio-ecological sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

On that basis, this study focuses on the third-country effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in BRI related countries, and delves into its spatial interaction from rising impacts of China's global economic cooperation activities, with the economic & political distance from China as institutional factors, using spatial econometric method in a panel data of 60 BRI countries from 2007 to 2016. Accordingly, the empirical results first significantly reveal the existence of spatial autocorrelation for CO2 emissions per capita in BRI countries by Moran's I test. Furthermore, according to the main estimated results of the spatial Durbin model with spatial fixed effects, China' s OFDI and imports to BRI countries exert third-country effects or spatial spillover effects; from the perspective of sustainability and emission reduction during BRI, China is required to launch more economic cooperation in emerging and low carbon industries with limited political claims. In response, BRI countries are supposed to develop its high tech and low carbon complementary industries with surrounding countries, so as to keep the CO2 emissions at a low level. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on air pollution levels and the subsequent reductions in mortality for urban areas in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. We calculated changes in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) during mitigation period versus the baseline period (pre-mitigation measure) using the difference-in-difference approach and the estimated avoided total and cause-specific mortality attributable to these changes in PM2.5 by state and district. We found that PM2.5 concentration during the mitigation period decreased for most states (except for 3 states) and the capital. Decreases of average PM2.5 concentration ranged from 0.25 μg/m3 (4.3%) in Maryland to 4.20 μg/m3 (45.1%) in California. On average, PM2.5 levels across 7 states and the capital reduced by 12.8%. We estimated that PM2.5 reduction during the mitigation period lowered air pollution-related total and cause-specific deaths. An estimated 483 (95% CI: 307, 665) PM2.5-related deaths was avoided in the urban areas of California.

For this purpose, IDF curves were determined using recorded short-term rainfall from 15 stations. Then, the efficiency of the scale invariance theory was evaluated in determining IDFs by comparing IDFs resulting from observed data and IDFs estimated from the scaling model. Results demonstrated that two sets of IDFs had a good coincidence. In the next step, the data from three RCM models of the CORDEX project under two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used, and daily rainfall was downscaled by the musica package. Finally, IDFs were determined for two future periods including 2025–2049 as near future and 2075–2099 as far future.

It displays a range of future solar geoengineering deployment scenarios that are intended to reduce anthropogenically-caused radiative forcing beginning in 2035. The scenarios reviewed herein include three commonly modeled representative concentration pathways (4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and three possible radiative forcing targets (halving future warming, halting warming, and reversing temperatures to 2020 levels). The program relies on three successive generations of newly designed high-altitude tanker aircraft to deliver aerosols to an altitude of ~20 km. Sulfates are assumed to be the aerosol used in conjunction with the first generation tanker, supplanted by an as-yet-determined ‘Aerosol 2’ with the later generation aircraft. The aggregate cost over the remainder of the 21st century and the annual cost in 2100 both vary by an order of magnitude between the cheapest and the most expensive scenarios. However, the cost-per-ton of deployed aerosol varies little among scenarios and the cost-per-degree-of-warming-avoided is similarly consistent. Relative to other climate interventions and solutions, SAI remains inexpensive, but at about $18 billion yr−1 per degree Celsius of warming avoided (in 2020 USD), a solar geoengineering program with substantial climate impact would lie well beyond the financial reach of individuals, small states, or other non-state potential rogue actors and would instead be the exclusive domain of large national economies or coalitions including at least one such economy. © 2020 The Author(s).

Intensive management in early-seral forest and other stages could reduce understory plant diversity and homogenize community compositions. Furthermore, the relative effects of management regime may vary at different stages of forest development. To what extent do taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity vary by seral stage and/or ownership (a proxy for management regime) after accounting for climatic variation? For 2224 plant species sampled systematically at 16,330 sites in sixteen Plant Association Zones (PAZs) of Washington, Oregon and California, we estimated taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity (both alpha = richness and beta = heterogeneity measures). Seral stage was inferred using forest structural metrics. Permutational multivariate analyses tested the relative effects of seral stage and ownership type. Across PAZs, a common motif emerged: low diversity in sparse, untreed stages indicated an accumulation period after stand-replacing disturbances, followed immediately by peak diversity in early sapling stages, after which gradually declining diversity coincided with the loss of shade-intolerant species during stand development and canopy closure. Departures from this motif tended to be in climatically less-permissive locations. More of the variation in diversity was explained by seral stage than ownership type (and their interactions were seldom significant). Discriminating the nuanced effects of different management regimes will require context-dependent proxies other than ownership. Identifying generalities in vegetation dynamics—and departures from those generalities—can help balance ecological and social objectives in rapidly changing forest landscapes. © 2020","Complex early-seral forests; Diversity; Ecosystem services; Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); Forest management; Forest structural development; Understory vegetation","Ecology; Multivariant analysis; Vegetation; Accumulation periods; Community composition; Ecosystem functioning; Intensive management; Multi variate analysis; Phylogenetic diversity; Understory vegetation; Western United States; Forestry; community composition; ecosystem function; juvenile; multivariate analysis; phylogenetics; plant community; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy; understory; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088091984

Sustainability of these systems lies in identifying conditions that promote high biomass yields on marginal lands under low-input agricultural practices. Associative nitrogen fixation (ANF) is a potentially important nitrogen (N) source for these crops, yet ANF contributions to plant N, especially under fertilizer N addition are unclear. In this study, we assess structure (nifH) and function (ANF) of switchgrass root-associated diazotrophic communities to long-term and short-term N additions using soil from three marginal land sites. ANF rates were variable and often unexpectedly high, sometimes 10× greater than reported in the literature, and did not respond in repeatable ways to long-term or short-term N. We found few impacts of N addition on root-associated diazotrophic community structure or membership. Instead, we found a very consistent root-associated diazotrophic community even though switchgrass seeds were germinated in soil from field sites with distinct diazotrophic communities. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that root-associated diazotrophic communities have the potential to contribute to switchgrass N demands, independent of N addition, and this may be driven by selection of the diazotrophic community by switchgrass roots. © The Author(s) 2020.

Activated carbon may be manufactured as powdered activated carbon (PAC), gritty activated carbon (in a form of raw angels grains) or granulated activated carbon (GAC). The production of the GAC is based on carbonaceous raw materials and various types of binders. The carbon mass is mixed with the binder and formed in cylindrical granules. The binder’s recognition is in a scientific literature side-topic and still needs wider examination. For many years GAC production have been concentrated on the possibility of using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC). Therefore, the aim of the research was to develop a new binder, in the available technology of granulated activated carbon production. Such binders were tested such as: tall oil (TO), sugar beet molasses (SBM), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC), SCMC using a verified technological process and SCMC with the addition of gas tar (GT). The conducted research shows that all the quality requirements were met by activated carbons with SBM as a binder. Additionally they showed very high adsorption properties.

As a step towards sustainability, small or temporary structures can be constructed by reusing a variety of rigid materials that are found in abundance in scrapyards. This paper emphasizes the sustainability aspects of reusing scrap materials for constructing a bus shelter using the principles of tactical urbanism. The selected materials include scrap steel pipes, wasted foam sheets, gypsum board, plastic cans and bottle caps. After minimal modifications (cleaning, sizing and shaping), they were converted to suitable panels and members of designed dimensions. The embodied carbon analysis showed that 130.23 kg equivalent of carbon dioxide is saved by not using new materials in construction. By this approach, the net embodied carbon for the entire structure is turned to be negative (-85.23 kg equivalent of carbon dioxide). On another aspect of tactical urbanism, a suitable construction methodology is designed to utilize minimal time and manpower for construction which also could reduce the carbon and energy footprints substantially. The innovative provision for using clamps on the skeleton frame enabled direct insertion of panels, thus minimizing the requirements for fasteners or adhesives. The entire structure is found to be light in weight and portable but strong against pulling loads. The social and environmental aspects of sustainability were evaluated using checklist, sectoral matrix and checklist methods. We envisage this approach in making security homes, isolation wards at times of contagious outspread, locomotive stalls etc. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon footprint; EIA; Lightweight structure; Reuse of crap materials; Sustainability; Tactical urbanism",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097163415

We estimate the temporal and diurnal changes of the six criteria air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous pollutants (NO2, O3, CO, and SO2) during lockdown (25th March – 3rd May 2020) across regions of India using the observations from 134 real-time monitoring sites of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Significant reduction in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO has been found in all the regions during the lockdown. SO2 showed mixed behavior, with a slight increase at some sites but a comparatively significant decrease at other locations. O3 also showed a mixed variation with a mild increase in IGP and a decrease in the South. The absolute decrease in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was observed during peak morning traffic hours (08–10 Hrs) and late evening (20–24 Hrs), but the percentage reduction is almost constant throughout the day. A significant decrease in day-time O3 has been found over Indo Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India, whereas night-time O3 has increased over IGP due to less O3 loss. The most significant reduction (∼40–60%) was found in PM2.5 and PM10. The highest decrease in PM was found for the north-west and IGP followed by South and central regions. A considerable reduction (∼30–70%) in NO2 was found except for a few sites in the central region. A similar pattern was observed for CO having a ∼20–40% reduction. The reduction observed for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and enhancement in O3 was proportional to the population density. Delhi's air quality has improved with a significant reduction in primary pollutants, however, an increase in O3 was observed. The changes reported during the lockdown are combined effect of changes in the emissions, meteorology, and atmospheric chemistry that requires detailed investigations. © 2020 Elsevier LtdFirst comprehensive study representing over 130 sites over India to Assess the changes in spatial, Temporal patterns in pollution during lockdown to support future mitigation strategies © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Delhi; Ozone; Particulate matter; Pollution reduction; Traffic emissions","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Fog; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Central pollution control boards; Criteria air pollutants; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Mitigation strategy; Particulate Matter; Population densities; Primary pollutants; Real time monitoring; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; COVID-19; diurnal variation; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; temporal variation; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; India; particulate matter; population density; reduction (chemistry); traffic; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; India; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089475937

In this study, a district-wise comprehensive emission inventory of key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, N2O, NH3, CH4, NMVOC, EC, OC, PAH) emitted during primary crop residue burning was developed using activity data for the major agrarian states of north India for the agricultural year 2017–18. The emissions were scaled to the spatial resolution of 1 km grid to study the spatial distribution of crop residue burning activities using VIIRS Thermal anomalies datasets. An estimated 20.3 Mt and 9.6 Mt of crop residue were burned in Punjab and Haryana, resulting in an emission of 137.2 Gg and 56.9 Gg of PM2.5 and 163.7 Gg and 72.1 of PM10 Gg for respective states. The emissions of EC, OC, and PAHs were 8.6 Gg, 45.7 Gg, and 0.08 Gg in Punjab, whereas in Haryana emissions were 3.7 Gg, 17.7 Gg, and 0.03 Gg, respectively. The results show that rice and wheat crops were major contributor to residue burnt at the field (&gt;90%) leading to the high load of atmospheric emissions in the IGP region. Further, CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions were 34.8 Tg and 17.3 Tg for Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Around 30000 and 8500 active fires were detected by VIIRS over the agricultural area of Punjab and Haryana during the studied year. The GIS-based bottom-up approach using gridded emission inventory shows pollutant distribution dominates over the south-western part of Punjab and north-western region of Haryana. The proximity of these regions to Delhi and transboundary movement of emissions towards Indo-Gangetic plains causes high air pollution episodes. The high-resolution inventory of various pollutants will be useful for regional air quality models to better predict and manage the hotspot of air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier LtdStudy computed the annual gridded emissions with a high spatial resolution (1 × 1 km) for all major pollutants in dominant agriculture states of India using GIS-based approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crop residue burning emissions; Emission inventory; High resolution; IGP; NCAP; VIIRS","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Image resolution; Air pollution episodes; High resolution inventories; High spatial resolution; High-resolution emission; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Pollutant distribution; Regional air quality models; Transboundary movements; Gas emissions; ammonia; carbon dioxide; methane; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; agricultural emission; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; emission inventory; image resolution; particulate matter; pollutant source; VIIRS; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; Article; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; exhaust gas; India; information processing; particulate matter; plant residue; pollution transport; public health; air pollutant; fire; India; Haryana; India; Punjab [India]; Triticum aestivum; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088367081

The W-Gg-Pm compared to first year, exhibited an increasing patterns of wheat and green gram yields by 6.51 and 7.04 % in second year, and 8.99 and 26.8 % in third year cropping sequence. The P-Gg-R system recorded the highest rice equivalent yield (17.4 t ha−1), N and K uptake, partial factor productivity and microbial diversity. Significant changes in most of the microbial activities, soil enzymes, water holding capacity, soil organic carbon, total C and N, C: N ratio and cation exchange capacity was recorded. Inclusion of legumes in rice or wheat -based cropping systems recorded significantly higher microbial and enzymatic activities, soil quality and crop yields. The highest physical, chemical and biological properties were observed in L–R system, closely followed by W-Gg-R, and the lowest in M–R system. The L–R system enhanced SOC by 11.6, 4.64, 4.64 and 2.48 % over M–R, W-R, W-Gg-Pm and P-Gg-R, respectively, while P-Gg-R system recorded the highest substrate oxidation rates (0.076 OD h−1), which was 22.4 % better to M–R system. The L–R system had the highest (0.844) soil quality index, while it was the lowest (0.727) in M–R system.

It makes a case why we should care about islands and their sustainability. Islands are hotspots of biocultural diversity, and home to 600 million people that depend on one-sixth of the earth’s total area, including the surrounding oceans, for their subsistence. Today, they are on the frontlines of climate change and face an existential crisis. Islands are, however, potential “hubs of innovation” and are uniquely positioned to be leaders in sustainability and climate action. We argue that a full-fledged program on “island industrial ecology” is urgently needed with the aim to offer policy-relevant insights and strategies to sustain small islands in an era of global environmental change. We introduce key industrial ecology concepts, and the state-of-the-art in applying them to islands. Nine contributions in this Special Issue are briefly reviewed to highlight the metabolic risks inherent in the island cases. The contributors explore how reconfiguring patterns of resource use will allow island governments to build resilience and adapt to the challenges of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

This research aims to understand how climate variability and other stressors are impacting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Azamgarh district, eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data from 84 smallholder farmers were collected using mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches, including interview and participatory methods, informed by multiple stressor and sustainable livelihood frameworks. Results revealed that farmers are increasingly facing problems caused by the reduced duration and number of rainy days, and erratic rainfall. Anomalies in seasonal cycles (longer summers, shorter winters) seem to have altered the local climate. Farmers reported that repeated drought impacts, even in years of moderate rainfall, are adversely affecting the rice crop, challenging the formal definition of drought. Climate variability, identified as the foremost stressor, often acts as a risk multiplier for ecological (e.g., soil sodicity), socio-economic (e.g., rising costs of cultivation) and political (e.g., mismatching policies and poor extension systems) stressors. In addition to climate stresses, resource-poor marginal groups in particular experienced higher risks resulting from changes in resource management regimes. This study provides an important cue to revisit the formal definitions of normal rainfall and drought, accommodating farmers’ perceptions that evenly distributed rainfall, and not total rainfall is a key determinant of crop yields. Though India has developed adaptive measures for climate change and variability, integration of farmers’ perceptions of climate and other stressors into such policies can improve the resilience of smallholder farmers, who have hitherto depended largely on autonomous adaptation strategies. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asia; Climate change; Hazards; Land users; Multiple stressors","Crops; Drought; Rain; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability; Participatory methods; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Resource management; Smallholder farmers; Sustainable livelihood; Climate change; rain; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; environmental stress; livelihood; perception; resource management; risk assessment; smallholder; agricultural management; agricultural worker; Article; climate change; drought; ecological procedures; environmental stress; harvest; human; market; perception; politics; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rainy season; rice; socioeconomics; soil quality; summer; sustainable agriculture; technology; tillage; Uttar Pradesh; winter; agriculture; climate change; India; India; Uttar Pradesh; Agriculture; Climate Change; Droughts; Farmers; Humans; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089358387

The options on providing access to irrigation water, strategic use of irrigation, and better crop husbandry practices were evaluated for their potential to impart climate resilience in farming systems. Irrigation trials revealed that, in the event of delayed rainfall, irrigation of 229-267 mm ensured timely transplanting and resulted in higher paddy yields (7.0 t ha−1). Supplemental irrigation during a mid-season dry spell increased paddy yield to from 0.64 to 6.1 t ha−1. Better vegetable cultivation practices viz. drip irrigation, polythene mulch, nursery raising in seedling trays and raised bed cultivation exhibited great potential to build climate resilience in the farming systems of the region. The study highlights the need for investments in small water harvesting structures and the promotion of alternative ways of cultivating and irrigating paddy during different climatic situations.

Given that CO2 and air pollutants in cities both originate from fossil fuel combustion, monitoring urban CO2 concentrations using a mobile vehicle and from the top of tall buildings can be a potentially effective approach for diagnosing the air quality. The local enhancement values (△species) related to urban emission sources were estimated by eliminating baseline concentrations. The results obtained showed high correlation coefficients between △CO2 and △air pollutants (i.e., 0.753, 0.505, and 0.525 for △CO, △NOX, and △NO2), confirming the applicability of CO2 as an indicator of air pollutant sources in downtown Seoul. The evaluation of the air quality in the study area using air pollutant ratios, including the ratios of CO and NOX/NO2, relative to CO2 showed that the ratios of △CO, △NOX, and △NO2 relative to △CO2 were 5.76, 1.89, and 0.21 ppb ppm−1. The estimated △NO2/△NOX ratio (11%) and a comparison of the △NOX/△CO2 ratios obtained with those reported for other cities in different countries suggested the possibility of a relationship between the current air quality in downtown Seoul and the use of diesel vehicles. Results suggest that the development of municipal policies aimed at mitigating climate change should consider the co-benefit of air quality improvement so as to ensure the effective reduction of CO2 and air pollutant emissions. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollutants; Carbon dioxide; Co-benefit; Environmental policy; Mobile monitoring; Winter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089381171

The most common approach relies on a petroelastic model to convert the flow simulator outputs into acoustic impedance. The comparison of this simulated data with the observed time-lapse seismic anomalies enables the computation of changes in the reservoir models' parameters, reducing the uncertainty, and improving the reservoir characterization. Among other properties, the petroelastic model requires fluid models capable of forecasting the speed of sound. This fact becomes more challenging when the oil is volatile and contains a significant amount of CO2, which is the case in some reservoirs in the Brazilian pre-salt region. In this situation, some classical models fail to predict the speed of sound in the oil phase within reasonable accuracy. Other models require testing for specific fluids or are not conveniently build to the integration with actual compositional reservoir simulators. Therefore, we propose the application of a calibrated cubic equation of state to represent the fluid behavior for both reservoir flow and petroelastic simulations. For this purpose, we describe a methodology in which the fluid model is progressively adjusted using reservoir engineering and speed of sound experimental data, depending on the available information. We applied this methodology using the well-known Peng-Robinson equation, but similar results could be obtained with other models of this class. We show that the match to the conventional pressure-volume-temperature data, a common practice in reservoir engineering, can be enough to generate fluid models capable of forecasting the speed of sound. Furthermore, the speed of sound experimental data can improve the fluid characterization without jeopardizing the previous fitted experiments. We tested our methodology with experimental data of a fluid of one reservoir in the Brazilian pre-salt region. Moreover, we compared the results obtained in the equation of state with other published correlations and simplified models. Synthetic reservoir models with different production strategies were applied in these comparisons. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cubic equation of state; Hydrocarbon fluid; Petroelastic model; Speed of sound","Acoustic impedance; Acoustic wave velocity; Equations of state; Forecasting; Geophysical prospecting; Integration testing; Plasma flow; Reservoir management; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Compositional Reservoir; Compositional reservoir simulators; Cubic equation of state; Peng-Robinson equations; Pressure-volume-temperatures; Reservoir characterization; Synthetic reservoir models; Time-lapse seismic data; Subsalt strata; computer simulation; data assimilation; data set; fluid flow; forecasting method; hydrocarbon reservoir; seismic data; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088041540

In this paper, we propose a new method to provide an annual burned area map of Mato Grosso State located in the Brazilian Amazon region, taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution sensors. The method consists of generating the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy–Vegetation), and Suomi NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) datasets. The shade fraction images highlight the burned areas, in which values are represented by low reflectance of ground targets, and the mapping was performed using an unsupervised classifier. Burned areas were evaluated in terms of land use and land cover classes over the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes in the Mato Grosso State. Our results showed that most of the burned areas occurred in non-forested areas (66.57%) and old deforestation (21.54%). However, burned areas over forestlands (11.03%), causing forest degradation, reached more than double compared with burned areas identified in consolidated croplands (5.32%). The results obtained were validated using the Sentinel-2 data and compared with active fire data and existing global burned areas products, such as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1, and Fire CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative) products. Although there is a good visual agreement among the analyzed products, the areas estimated were quite different. Our results presented correlation of 51% with Sentinel-2 and agreement of r2 = 0.31, r2 = 0.29, and r2 = 0.43 with MCD64A1, MCD45A1, and Fire CCI products, respectively. However, considering the active fire data, it was achieved the better performance between active fire presence and burn mapping (92%).

China has been suffering from serious regional air pollution problems, characterized by high concentrations of surface O3 and PM2:5. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to quantify the sensitivity of surface O3 and PM2:5 to key meteorological parameters in different regions of China. Six meteorological parameters were perturbed to create different meteorological conditions, including temperature (T ), wind speed (WS), absolute humidity (AH), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), cloud liquid water content (CLW) and precipitation (PCP). Air quality simulations under the perturbed meteorological conditions were conducted in China in January and July of 2013. The changes in O3 and PM2:5 concentrations due to individual meteorological parameters were then quantified. T has a great influence on the daily maximum 8 h average O3 (O3-8 h) concentrations, which leads to O3-8 h increases by 1.7 in January in Chongqing and 1.1 ppbK1 in July in Beijing. WS, AH, and PBLH have a smaller but notable influence on O3-8 h with maximum change rates of 0.3 ppb%1, 0:15 ppb%1, and 0.14 ppb%1, respectively. T , WS, AH, and PBLH have important effects on PM2:5 formation of both in January and July. In general, PM2:5 sensitivities are negative to T , WS, and PBLH and positive to AH in most regions of China. The sensitivities in January are much larger than in July. PM2:5 sensitivity to T , WS, PBLH, and AH in January can be up to 5 ugm3 K1, 3 ugm3 %1, 1 ugm3 %1, and C0:6 ugm3 %1, respectively, and in July it can be up to 2 ugm3 K1, 0:4 ugm3 %1, 0:14 ugm3 %1, and C0:3 ugm3 %1, respectively. Other meteorological factors (CLW and PCP) have negligible effects on O3-8 h (less than 0.01 ppb%1) and PM2:5 (less than 0.01 ugm3 %1). The results suggest that surface O3 and PM2:5 concentrations can change significantly due to changes in meteorological parameters, and it is necessary to consider these effects when developing emission control strategies in different regions of China. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

The five-model ensemble captures the observed general distribution of climate zones, with a distinct latitudinal pattern over the densely populated eastern China, a subarctic zone in the western mountains including the Tibetan Plateau and a cool dry zone in the Tarim and Turpan basins; large disparities are found in northwestern China due to warm and dry biases. Observational data identifies a recent northward shift of most climate zones in eastern China and a shrinking of the subarctic climate zones over the Tibetan Plateau, which caused a building climate zone change for 18% of the country's land area. As the warming continues in the future, the five-model ensemble projects additional climate zone changes influencing 43% and 55% of the country by mid- and late-century, respectively. In addition, the total area of the subarctic zone is projected to decrease from 16.6% of the country in present-day climate to 9.2% and 7.4% in the mid- and late-century, respectively, and that of the hot or very-hot climate zone is projected to expand from 4.2% to 9.1% and 11.3%, respectively.

Herein, we demonstrate that transitional metal borides (TMBs) Ni3B, Co3B and Fe2B can serve as effective and low-cost cocatalysts to enhance the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light, while other TMBs (TaB2, NbB2 and MoB) are almost ineffective. The performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction depends on the metal site in TMBs, among which Ni3B exhibits the highest selectivity and activity compared to those of other TMBs. Specifically, Ni3B exhibits a CO evolution rate of 157.7 μmol h-1 with selectivity of 93.0% in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a light absorber under visible light, representing state-of-the-art cocatalyst. The excellent activity of Ni3B can be ascribed to its metallic feature that can efficiently transport photogenerated electrons from the light absorber, as well as the unique Ni-B bond that acts as an electron accumulator to provide abundant long-lived electrons to be injected into Ni0 active sites for the activation of CO2. These findings may provide the principle guidance for the search and design of efficient cocatalytic materials and systems for solar energy conversion.

Basing on the combination of the multi-index method and the improved equal-proportion distribution method, and fully considering the differences in economic factors, population factors, energy factors, technological factors among cities, China’s 2030 carbon intensity reduction target was allocated. The results indicate that: (1) Under the target constraint of 60% reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (carbon intensity) in 2030 compared to 2005, the carbon intensity target reduction rate (CITRR) of 285 Chinese cities is between 17.65% and 141.14%, with an average reduction rate of 51.52%; (2) the CITRR of cities presents significant spatial positive correlation, and the Global Moran I correlation index is 0.38; and (3) the distribution trend of CITRR is the same as the general trend of economic development of China, showing a basic trend of gradual decline from south to north and from coastal to inland. The allocation method takes into account fairness and efficiency, and reflects the differences between cities, so that the allocation results are likely to be accepted by all parties. Meanwhile, this method breaks the limitation of the lack of city’s data and is likely to implement in actual operation. Cities should choose distinguished low-carbon economic development paths, in combination with their characteristics of economic and social development, and carry out inter-city cooperation to promote carbon emission reduction steadily. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper develops a reinforcement learning based algorithm to operate a community owned electric vehicle fleet, which provides ride-hailing services to local residents. The goals of operating the electric vehicle fleet are to minimize customer waiting time, electricity cost, and operational costs of the vehicles. A novel framework characterized by decentralized learning and centralized decision making is proposed to solve the electric vehicle fleet dispatch problem. The decentralized learning process allows the individual vehicles to share their operating experiences and deep neural network model for state-value function estimation, which mitigates the curse of dimensionality of state and action domains. The centralized decision making framework converts the vehicle fleet coordination problem into a linear assignment problem, which has polynomial time complexity.

In order to effectively mobilize and harmonize resources to address climate change at country level, the idea of establishing national climate finance institutions (NCFIs) with the duty to mobilise, manage and allocate funds to implement climate change actions has gained prominence among developing countries. This study develops an indicator-based framework to evaluate the institutional effectiveness of the Indonesian Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF) as a case study. Building on previous frameworks and principles of climate finance, a total of 21 indicators were identified, these indicators were categorized into five effectiveness components, which are: were identified, and these indicators were categorized into five effectiveness components, which include: legal and regulatory framework, fund mobilization and sustainability, fund management and allocation, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency and accountability. We find that the major and fundamental weakness of the ICCTF is its inability to adequately mobilize funds, while its strength is in management and allocation of available resources. Inclusion of the legal and regulatory framework component, which has been largely absent in previous studies, further enabled us to identify critical legal gaps in the operationalization of the ICCTF. While the current legal foundation of the ICCTF ensures transparency and accountability, it significantly constrains the ICCTFs flexibility and innovative potentials. © 2020, Hasanuddin University.

Nonthermal plasma is a vital solution for the generation of vibrationally excited molecules, thereby enhancing mode-selective surface chemistry. Especially, plasma-enabled promotion of heterogeneous catalysis for CH4 conversion attracts keen attention because the strong C–H bond breaking is possible via vibrational excitation of CH4 at low temperature. Similarly, vibrational excitation of CO2 possesses unique reactivity in heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we provide a rigorous determination of kinetic parameters of CH4 dry reforming to elucidate the drastic reaction promotion mechanism enabled by plasma-catalyst interaction. Lanthanum-modified Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was combined with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) at 5 kPa and 400–700 °C without dilution gas. Reaction order for CH4 and CO2 were determined respectively as 0.68 and −0.17; these values were kept unchanged by DBD, indicating the surface coverage of CH4 and CO2 was not influenced by nonthermal plasma. The Arrhenius plot for forward CH4 rate constant revealed that 12 kHz DBD hybrid reaction is characterized as mixed catalysis where plasma and thermal catalysis are not decoupled. The apparent activation energy was influenced only slightly by the specific energy input (SEI, eV/molecules) and gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV, h−1), because the electrical properties of streamer swarm are not influenced to a large extent by either SEI or GHSV at fixed frequency. In contrast, 100 kHz DBD yielded significant improvement of CH4 and CO2 conversion via vibrational excitation. Activation energy decreased from 91 kJ/mol to 44.7 kJ/mol which was well correlated with the state-specific gas-surface reactivity of vibrationally excited CH4 on Ni surfaces. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Activation energy; Arrhenius plot; CH4 dry reforming; Plasma catalysis; Streamer swarm; Vibrationally excited species","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Arrhenius plots; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Excited states; Rate constants; Temperature; Apparent activation energy; Dielectric barrier discharges; Gas surface reactivity; Heterogeneous catalyst; Selective activation; Specific energy input; Vibrational excitation; Vibrationally excited; Surface reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086455984

Reinforcement learning is considered as superior approach to build traffic light timing scheme by many recent studies. It fulfills real adaptive control by the means of taking real-time traffic information as state, and adjusting traffic light scheme as action. However, existing works behave inefficient in complex intersections and they are lack of feasibility because most of them adopt traffic light scheme whose phase sequence is flexible. To address these issues, a novel adaptive traffic signal timing scheme is proposed. It's based on actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, and advanced techniques proximal policy optimization and generalized advantage estimation are integrated. In particular, a new kind of reward function and a simplified form of state representation are carefully defined, and they facilitate to improve the learning efficiency and reduce the computational complexity, respectively. Meanwhile, a fixed phase sequence signal scheme is derived, and constraint on the variations of successive phase durations is introduced, which enhances its feasibility and robustness in field applications.

In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), nitrate could contribute 56% of SNA and 34% of total PM2.5 during haze episodes. In this study, a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to provide a comprehensive understanding of nitrate source and formation under severe pollution during winter 2015 and 2016. Three haze episodes (HEP1, HEP2 and HEP3) and one clean episode (CEP) were selected to investigate the emission sector and regional contributions to nitrate at six environmental monitoring sites in the YRD. Source apportionment results showed that industry (35%), transportation (32%) and power (28%) sectors were the important sources of nitrate during haze episodes. Regional transport (60–98%) was responsible for the high nitrate concentrations in the YRD. During haze episodes, the high ozone production (PO3) rate (up to 700 ppb/h) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) removal rate (up to 9 ppb/h) were observed in the daytime indicating the important atmospheric oxidation capacity in the YRD. Also, the nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) analysis elucidated that daytime photochemistry played an important role in nitrate formation and the heterogeneous chemistry enhanced the high nitrate at night. Results from emission scenario analysis demonstrated that averaged nitrate concentration in Shanghai decreased by 18% during haze episodes under emission reductions of 20% NOx, NH3 and VOC in the YRD, and Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Hebei provinces. Emission reduction on the regional scale (one city and its surrounding areas) is an efficient strategy to reduce nitrate concentration in the YRD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emission reduction; Formation mechanism; Haze episodes; Nitrate; Regional transport; Source apportionment","Air quality; Ammonia; Chemical analysis; Emission control; River pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric oxidation capacity; Community multi-scale air qualities; Environmental Monitoring; Heterogeneous chemistry; Nitrate concentration; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Source apportionment; Yangtze river delta; Nitrates; hydroxyl radical; nitrate; ozone; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; environmental monitoring; haze; nitrate; particulate matter; source apportionment; winter; Article; concentration (parameter); environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; haze; humidity; oxidation; particulate matter; priority journal; river; waste component removal; winter; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086823848

Among multiple-effect distillation units, diffusion type is more compact, portable and high productive. In the present study, a novel type of passive multi-chamber vertical solar diffusion still is proposed and the impact of various system and climatic parameters on its performance and economics has been evaluated and presented. Triple chamber vertical diffusion still is found economical and it has a performance ratio and exergy efficiency of around two and 23.15%, respectively. Exposing the aperture of distillation unit to wind flow revealed a negative impact on its yield but the reverse is observed when the last condensing unit is exposed to the wind. Lower distillation and exergy efficiency is observed for 1st diffusion chamber compared to other chambers due to increased heat loss from absorber plate. Evaporative heat transfer ratio of diffusion chambers increased from 0.81 to 0.97 with increase in solar radiation intensity from 100 to 1000 W/m2. The optimized unit is simulated under the climatic conditions of various locations of Tamil Nadu state of India under sole south orientation and east-west manually tracked mode. Annual average yield of 11.13 kg/m2d is obtained with an exergy efficiency of 13.85% for east-west manually tracked unit. Distillate production cost and financial payback time of the unit are estimated to be 900.00 INR/kL and 0.63 Year, respectively. The proposed unit also has a capability to mitigate 67.93 tons (average) of CO2 emission during its 20 Year lifetime.

Because consistently cold periods are required to form stable and thick ice, warmer winters could degrade ice conditions and increase the likelihood of falling through the ice. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of winter drowning from 10 Northern Hemisphere countries. We documented over 4000 winter drowning events. Winter drownings increased exponentially in regions with warmer winters when air temperatures neared 0°C. The largest number of drownings occurred when winter air temperatures were between -5°C and 0°C, when ice is less stable, and also in regions where indigenous traditions and livelihood require extended time on ice. Rates of drowning were greatest late in the winter season when ice stability declines. Children and adults up to the age of 39 were at the highest risk of winter drownings. Beyond temperature, differences in cultures, regulations, and human behaviours can be important additional risk factors. Our findings indicate the potential for increased human mortality with warmer winter air temperatures. Incorporating drowning prevention plans would improve adaptation strategies to a changing climate. © 2020 Sharma et al.

The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) is a federal program designed to subsidize farmers to establish, produce and deliver biomass feedstock to biorefineries. This study evaluated the impacts of BCAP on the optimal biofuel supply chain decisions considering feedstock yield uncertainty and associated investment risk given diverse risk preferences of the biofuel sector. The expected cost for a risk-neutral biofuel sector was minimized using a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program, whereas the Conditional Value-at-Risk of the supply chain was optimized for a risk-averse sector. Ex-ante analysis of a switchgrass-based biofuel sector in west Tennessee indicates BCAP payments could lower expected cost and investment risk for both risk-averse and risk-neutral biofuel sectors. However, the cost saving and risk reduction resulting from BCAP incentives for the risk-averse biofuel sector were higher than the risk-neutral biofuel sector. In addition, BCAP payments may drive more cropland to be converted for switchgrass, which potentially mitigates water-induced soil erosion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with net carbon sequestration, but may also create unintended consequence of competition for land between food and fuel use. © 2020 The Authors","Biomass crop assistance program; Risk-averse; Stochastic model; Uncertainty","Biofuels; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Investments; Plants (botany); Risk analysis; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Value engineering; Biofuel supply chains; Biomass feedstock; Carbon sequestration; Cellulosic biofuels; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Government subsidies; Mixed integer linear program; Unintended consequences; Risk assessment; agricultural worker; biofuel; governance approach; investment; preference behavior; risk assessment; subsidy system; uncertainty analysis; Tennessee; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089486917

This paper reports an additive-engineering strategy which provides moisture resistance and passivates defects of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) absorber layer of perovskite thin film via introducing organic molecule 4, 4′-Bis (N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP). GIXRD results show that CBP molecules do not enter into the perovskite crystal. Contact angle measurement and XPS studies suggest that CBP plays a role in boosting moisture resistance. XPS also supports that a small amount of CBP reduces carbon related impurities. CBP causes improved optical properties via bulk defect passivation. These results are found to be in accordance with steady-state and transient photoluminescence studies, where improved photoluminescence is observed for CBP added MAPbI3 films with reduced non-radiative recombination centers. Defects passivation and moisture resistance imparted by CBP molecules result in improved photovoltaic parameters and electroluminescence efficiency eventually.

We have identified 25 sites, 100 km2 each, where the flora is represented in full the most. We studied the relationships between the general species richness (SR) and the richness of particular life forms (LF) of vascular plants with climate and relief using multiple regression methods. Our study shows that the special function of March precipitation is the factor that influences the most the spatial change of the SR and LF. When increasing the precipitation in the model by only 1 mm, this leads to a decrease in the number of species by 7.1%. Winter precipitation and temperature are important factors as well; together they are responsible for 70-82% of the SR variation. These close links made it possible to develop the maps of the species richness of the study area. The SR model did not include solar radiation, one of the most important environmental factors, as a significant predictor. This factor was omitted due to the analysis of the number of species of particular LF, which showed the maximum illumination of the slopes as a highly significant factor for number of them. The two dominant LFs (hemicryptophytes and therophytes), which account for 73% of the total number of species, depend oppositely on the illumination.

This study aims to explore the coordinated effects (co-effects) on export-driven emissions (EEs) and the hidden driving forces in China's individual provinces. Based on the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) method, seven socioeconomic factors of the changes in CO2 and particulate matter (PM) EEs during 2007–2012 are estimated by province. The co-effects on provincial EEs, categorized as co-benefits, trade-offs and co-detriments, are assessed to reveal regional disparities. The results show that the changes in energy efficiency have led to the greatest co-benefits in all factors, while changes in emission coefficients, industrial structure, and regional distribution of exports have led to limited co-benefits in a few of provinces. The other factors, variations of population and export per capita, have resulted in co-detriments. The co-effects and their factors varied greatly across provinces. Some provinces were more likely to obtain co-benefits because of their first mover advantages or special actions for green development, such as Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, Tianjin, Yunnan and Guizhou, dispersedly distributed in coastal and inland regions. On the other hand, as trade-offs and co-detriments existed extensively in some provinces, related factors should be monitored and adjusted. Identifying co-effects and corresponding key factors at the regional level provides valuable insights into green transition of China's exports, and raises the importance of policy integration and regional cooperation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Co-benefits; Export-driven emissions; Multi-regional input-output model; Regional disparities; Structural decomposition analysis; Trade-offs","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Industrial emissions; First mover advantages; Industrial structures; Regional cooperation; Regional disparities; Regional distribution; Socio-economic factor; Structural decomposition; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088116923

Due to the global threat, many countries impose immediate lockdown. The impact of lockdown on the environmental pollutants and climate indicators gained considerable attention in the literature. This study aims to describe the variations in the environmental pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10) with and without the lockdown period in the majorly hit states and provinces of the USA and China, respectively. Data during the first quarter year of 2019 and 2020 (lockdown period) was used in this study. Moreover, the effect of these pollutants on the pandemic spread was also studied. The results illustrated that the overall concentrations of CO, NO2 and PM2.5 were decreased by 19.28%, 36.7% and 1.10%, respectively, while PM10 and SO2 were increased by 27.81% and 3.81% respectively in five selected states of the USA during the lockdown period. However, in the case of chosen provinces of China, overall, the concentrations of all selected pollutants, i.e., CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10, were reduced by 26.53%, 38.98%, 18.36%, 17.78% and 37.85%, respectively. The COVID-19 reported cases and deaths were significantly correlated with NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 in both China and the USA. The findings of this study concluded that the limited anthropogenic activities in the lockdown situation due to this novel pandemic disease result in a significant improvement of air quality by reducing the concentrations of environmental pollutants. As the trend goes on, the reduction of most pollutant concentrations is expected as long as partial or complete lockdown goes on.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Coronavirus; Environmental gradients; PM10; PM2.5; USA","air quality; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); environmental quality; epidemic; human activity; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution control; viral disease; World Health Organization; China; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089259623

However, beyond CO2, some other greenhouse gases (GHGs) like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), being two notable gases, contribute to global warming. Since 1900, the concentrations of CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions have been elevating, and due to the effects of the previous industrial revolution which is responsible for climate forcing. Globally, emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from agricultural sectors are increasing as around 1% annually. Moreover, deforestation also contributes 12–17% of total global GHGs. Perhaps, the average temperature is likely to increase globally, at least 2 °C by 2100—by mid-century. These circumstances are responsible for climate forcing, which is the source of various human health diseases and environmental risks. From agricultural soils, rhizospheric microbial communities have a significant role in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Every year, microbial communities release approximately 1.5–3 billion tons of carbon into the atmospheric environment. Microbial nitrification, denitrification, and respiration are the essential processes that affect the nitrogen cycle in the terrestrial environment. In the twenty-first century, climate change is the major threat faced by human beings. Climate change adversely influences human health to cause numerous diseases due to their direct association with climate change. This review highlights the different anthropogenic GHG emission sources, the response of microbial communities to climate change, climate forcing potential, and mitigation strategies through different agricultural management approaches and microbial communities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide greenhouse gas; Carbon sequestration; Human health; Mitigation; Non-CO2 greenhouse gases; Soil microbes","agricultural soil; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemistry; climate change; climate feedback; climate forcing; emission; greenhouse gas; microbial community; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; transformation; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089101308

In such assessments, it is important to avoid prospective policy shortcomings. Hence, a wide range of sensitivities of mobile-source emissions must be understood, particularly from a traffic modeling standpoint. This paper takes a step in that direction and explores the effects of certain supply-side network attributes on emissions. Three key elements are investigated: level-of-detail of traffic activity, link speeds in the network, and link lengths. Both aggregated (hourly) and fine-grained (per-second) traffic activities are modeled using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment tool. Emissions are modeled using US Environmental Protection Agency's Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES). System-wide estimates of five criteria pollutants (CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2) and greenhouse-gases (CO2) are developed for a weekday morning peak-hour modeling period. Numerical experiments on a rapidly growing county in Central Texas, US, indicate that emission estimates are sensitive to all the aforementioned supply-side variables. Most notably, median network-wide estimates are found to increase in magnitude with aggregation of traffic activity and speeds. Effects of link lengths appear to be more prominent in high-speed traffic corridors, such as restricted-access highways, than low-speed unrestricted-access arterials. The latter, however, witness more traffic dynamics and subsequently contribute more to deviation in emission estimates across levels-of-detail. The findings highlight the need to be mindful of such physical sensitivities of emissions while enacting policy decisions, which frequently rely on network-based regional emissions inventories. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic traffic assignment; Low-carbon traffic; Mobile-source emissions; MOVES; Network-based emissions","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; computer simulation; greenhouse gas; numerical model; road traffic; traffic emission; traffic management; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055535789

International agreements, as a result of such interaction, cover various spheres of human activity. An example of universally meaningful and purposeful activity can be achievement of a global temperature goal by decarbonizing the economy of the whole world. The article presents the necessity and suggests the main directions for improving the theory and practice of using management standards based on the well-known principles of cybernetics. The relevance of using standard approaches to solving the decarbonization problem is proved by the comparative efficiency of decisions made at the level of energy policies of different countries and the need for corrective actions. It is not enough to know the theory - the practical application of General approaches in the theory of management to solving practical problems of ecology and energy can give a larger scale effect. The authors conclude that there is little consistency in the energy policies of the countries that signed the Paris Climate agreement. The isolation of innovation development at the level of individual countries, including Russia, does not allow us to use the prospects for technology exchange, taking into account the requirements of the agreement. Forced localization of production and ensuring energy security lead to a decrease in the rate of de-urbanization at the global level. The purpose of the research in the article was to identify the possibility of applying management theory to solve interstate problems in the field of global climate management. The authors show that the shortcomings in the environmental activities of individual countries and, especially, in their interaction are explained primarily by the departure from the known patterns of optimal organizational management, set out today in the management standards. © 2020 ACM.","climate agreement; decarbonization; energy policy; freedom; global temperature target; management; opportunities; principles of cybernetics","Energy policy; Energy security; Manufacture; Planning; Comparative efficiencies; Environmental activities; Global climate changes; Global temperatures; Management standards; Organizational management; Technology exchange; Theory and practice; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117541057

Understood as a more comprehensive approach to low-emissions development than jurisdictional-scale accounting for REDD+, JA was seen as a way to address challenges faced by early efforts to implement corporate commitments to deforestation-free supply chains. JA initiatives sought to align government-led, multistakeholder processes within provinces and districts with prospective external incentives for jurisdictional-scale performance. By early 2020, elements of the concept had been incorporated into official plans and regulations in several provinces and districts and was recognized in the government’s national medium-term development plan. Over the intervening years, the community of JA proponents and practitioners had grown rapidly and coalesced around a common understanding of what the approach entails. Credible, locally led JA initiatives were underway with international support in at least a dozen provinces and districts, and a national platform had been established to link districts that had committed to sustainability. Those initiatives were accompanied by active discourses on proposals for fiscal transfers and preferential market access to provide incentives for improved jurisdictional-scale performance based on indicators such as reduced deforestation. While it is too early to assess the ability of JA to generate significant results, practitioners have identified a number of constraints. Those include still-limited material incentives for change compared to the factors that drive business-as-usual deforestation, limited availability of spatial data for better land-use planning, low capacity of district-level officials, and misalignment of government policies between subnational and national entities and across ministries. In order to adequately test the JA theory of change, greater emphasis on creating external incentives and linking JA initiatives across jurisdictions and scales is needed to complement the facilitation of activities within individual provinces and districts. © Copyright © 2020 Seymour, Aurora and Arif.","deforestation; Indonesia; jurisdictional approach; peatland; sustainable land use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106157954

In this work, we focus on the study of methane and DOM distribution and genesis in the ground ice samples of thermodenudational exposure in the Central Yamal (Russian Arctic). We propose that the liberation of the ice-trapped CH4 and generation of CO2 by DOM mineralization are the earliest factors of atmospheric greenhouse gases emission as a result of permafrost thawing. The observed enormously “light” isotope signatures of methane (δ13 C &lt; −80%, δD &lt; −390%) found in the tabular ground ice units significantly divergent in morphology and localization within the exposuremay be related to subzero (cryogenic) carbonate reduction a as significant factor of the local methane enrichment. DOM is mainly formed (&gt;88%) by biochemically refractory humic acids. Distribution of the labile protein-like DOM reflects the specific features of carbon and nitrogen cycles in the tabular ground ice and ice wedge samples. Tabular ground ice units are shown to be a significant source of methane and high quality organic matter as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Ice wedges express a high variation in DOM composition and lability. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogeochemical cycling; Climate change; Dissolved organic matter; Greenhouse gas emission; Ground ice; Permafrost",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095950918

These off-line model-based simulations cannot use online measured greenhouse conditions (temperature, humidity) and must rely on historical weather data and on well-established greenhouse and crop properties. An important element of such simulations is the partitioning of the dissipated energy into sensible and latent heat, which can be achieved in different ways. Specifically, the rate of evapotranspiration (ET) may be obtained from 1) knowledge of the aerodynamic and stomatal canopy resistances, 2) estimating ET from atmospheric conditions and control settings, or 3) estimating the Bowen (sensible to latent heat) ratio in the ventilation stream (VBR) from the atmospheric conditions. The objective of this study is to compare the simulated behaviour of a tomato greenhouse, based on these three quite different approaches, both among themselves and against a full-year data set from a commercial Dutch cherry-tomato greenhouse. Using a quasi-steady-state simulation-optimization program with hourly time steps, trajectories of indoor conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration), control actions (heating, ventilation, CO2 enrichment, thermal screen), yield and ET were obtained, and their monthly averages presented. At the monthly time scale the simulated results are very similar among themselves and to those observed, with the exception that the simulated summer CO2 concentrations, and hence fruit yield, are higher than those observed, possibly due to the optimization inherent in the simulations. The considerable VBR discrepancy between the three ET formulations during autumn is due to low nighttime ET, but this has a negligible effect on the daily calculated ET. In conclusion, it seems that for off-line design purposes a simple linear dependence of ET on global radiation is sufficient. Adaptation of the model to existing facilities may require a more refined version of the VBR approach. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

We tested the generality of this diversity effect on ecosystem functioning, as an application of ecological theory by quantifying potential nitrous oxide emissions in grasslands restored from agriculture containing high and low diversity. We performed an initial plant survey to develop the study design from quadrat analyses (used to determine sampling frame size that maximizes variance in plant community structure), semivariogram analyses of plant community PCA scores (used to determine minimum distance between sampling frames), and upper and lower quartiles of plant diversity (Shannon's diversity). We sampled high (per field n = 6, total n = 60) and low (per field n = 6, total n = 60) diversity (high diversity: mean Shannon diversity index = 1.69; low diversity: mean Shannon diversity index = 0.73) plant communities within 10 to 12 y old restorations co-located at Nachusa Grasslands (Franklin Grove, IL, USA). We found potential N2O emissions were nearly seven times greater in low diversity compared to high diversity communities. Inorganic N availability, relative amounts of nitrification and denitrification, and water extractable C did not explain difference in potential N2O emission from soil with contrasting plant diversity. Although the mechanism for large variation in this ecosystem function corresponding with biodiversity remains undetermined, this work shows that management for plant diversity may reduce N2O emissions from soil. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Denitrification; Diversity; Ecosystem functioning; Grasslands; Nitrification; Water extractable organic carbon","agricultural soil; ecosystem function; grassland; nitrification; nitrous oxide; plant community; species diversity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090362832

Road transport is a significant contributor to PM2.5 emissions in urban areas and as such it is important to understand and be able to accurately model the effects of vehicles on PM2.5 emissions. In this paper a computer vision algorithm is introduced which is able to extract vehicle trajectories from video footage. The algorithm has a 100% accuracy for overall total vehicle counting. Comparing the speeds predicted by the computer vision script to manually following a single vehicle feature on the video file, the average relative speed accuracy is 2.7% at a 1 Hz time resolution. Using these vehicle trajectories in an instantaneous vehicle emissions model and also as input to COPERT v5, tailpipe PM2.5 emissions were estimated and compared to on-road measurements. It was shown that a local sensor is not sufficient to determine vehicle tailpipe emissions due to the influence of meteorological conditions and other emission sources. Combining computer vision with an instantaneous vehicle emissions model is a useful method to evaluate changes in emissions caused by transport policies. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Computer vision algorithms; Emission sources; Meteorological condition; Tailpipe emission; Transport policy; Vehicle counting; Vehicle emission; Vehicle trajectories; Computer vision",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099580319

Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND, we systematically compare region-specific mitigation strategies and challenges of reaching domestic net-zero carbon emissions in 2050. Embarking from different emission profiles and trends, we find that all of the regions have technological options and mitigation strategies to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Regional characteristics are mostly related to different land availability, population density and population trends: While Japan is resource limited with respect to onshore wind and solar power and has constrained options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), their declining population significantly decreases future energy demand. In contrast, Australia and the US benefit from abundant renewable resources, but face challenges to curb industry and transport emissions given increasing populations and high per-capita energy use. In the EU, lack of social acceptance or EU-wide cooperation might endanger the ongoing transition to a renewable-based power system. CDR technologies are necessary for all regions, as residual emissions cannot be fully avoided by 2050. For Australia and the US, in particular, CDR could reduce the required transition pace, depth and costs. At the same time, this creates the risk of a carbon lock-in, if decarbonization ambition is scaled down in anticipation of CDR technologies that fail to deliver. Our results suggest that industrialized economies can benefit from cooperation based on common themes and complementary strengths. This may include trade of electricity-based fuels and materials as well as the exchange of regional experience on technology scale-up and policy implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

This article reviews the scholarship on this subject and discusses the results of the first empirical study focused on it, a quantitative and qualitative survey of 607 US-Americans between the ages of 27 and 45. While 59.8% of respondents reported being “very” or “extremely concerned” about the carbon footprint of procreation, 96.5% of respondents were “very” or “extremely concerned” about the well-being of their existing, expected, or hypothetical children in a climate-changed world. This was largely due to an overwhelmingly negative expectation of the future with climate change. Younger respondents were more concerned about the climate impacts their children would experience than older respondents, and there was no statistically significant difference between the eco-reproductive concerns of male and female respondents. These and other results are situated within scholarship about growing climate concern in the USA, the concept of the carbon footprint, the carbon footprint of procreation, individual actions in response to climate change, temporal perceptions of climate change, and expectations about the future in the USA.

In order to support the recycling of materials, it is necessary to determine the quantities in the building stock and those caused by construction activities. At present, a large number of different actors use different categories for construction materials and the raw materials they consist of as well as for waste categories, depending on their field of activity. This results in imprecisions that make it difficult to consistently track and influence mass flows and hinder targeted resource management. This is the starting point of this paper as it discusses possibilities to establish a consistent allocation of materials to context-typical groups following the approach of continuous material flow analysis. On the input-side, aspects of mineral planning and on the output-side aspects of waste and secondary raw material management are being considered and references to grey emissions are established along the entire process chain. In this way, cross-departmental planning relating to recycling management and climate protection will be supported. With regard to the object of consideration and the level of action, a distinction is made between two different spatial scale levels: on the one hand, the individual building level, where the material inventory approach is used to provide detailed information on the building's material composition, and on the other hand the regional level, for which more aggregated information on building material groups is provided in the form of material cadastres.

Considerable progress has been made in the energy-efficient operation of buildings, thus the importance of grey emissions is increasing and will become a future field of action for municipalities as well. So far, there is poor knowledge regarding quantities, fields of actions and impacts. This paper is addressing this gap by applying a bottom-up material flow analysis (MFA) approach on the domestic building stock of Hamburg, and by calculating material-induced grey emissions of alternative building stock compositions as well as impacts of technical and social innovations. Overall, the stock induced grey emissions amount to 41.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Impact with regard to technical innovations concerning GHG reduction is rather limited. In contrast, impact achieved by ambitious social innovation is quite significant. This means that technical innovations must be considered in a more radical way and merged with social innovations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Sustainable development; Building stocks; Domestic buildings; Emission targets; Energy efficient operations; GHG reductions; Material flow analysis; Social innovations; Technical innovation; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097167781

Solar energy will play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electric energy sector. Concerns over solar installations’ impacts to host communities and the environment have led to growing conflicts over solar energy siting on Long Island, in other parts of New York, and throughout the US. Understanding community members’ perspectives is critical for reducing conflict. Solar energy can be deployed more quickly and at lower cost if projects are structured to address the concerns and meet the needs of the community. This paper presents the results of a survey of residential utility ratepayers that examined their perceptions, preferences, and priorities concerning mid-to large-scale solar development on Long Island (250 kW and larger). The survey asked respondents to consider specific installation types, financial models, and other aspects of solar development. Results indicate that respondents were overwhelmingly supportive of mid-to large-scale solar development in their communities. The most highly supported development types were solar systems on rooftops and solar systems that are co-located with other land uses (mixed use) at a particular site, such as parking canopies, landfills, or integration with agriculture. The most highly supported financial models included privately funded projects by local developers and community solar projects. The largest concern about solar development expressed by respondents did not involve tree removal or visibility (as initially hypothesized to be the most significant considerations) but rather the fairness of the distribution of economic benefits associated with solar development. This paper provides concrete insight into particular models of solar development that may invoke less conflict and more community support. © 2020 by the authors.

This study evaluates the association between short-term variation in air pollution and treatments for acute thrombo-embolic events among the whole Belgian population. In a bidirectional time-stratified case-crossover design, we included 227,861 events treated with endovascular intervention and 74,942 with antithrombotic enzymes that were reimbursed by the Belgian Social Security between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2013. We compared the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution (PM10 and PM2.5), as estimated at the municipality level on the day of the event (lag 0) and two days earlier (lag 1 and lag 2) with those of control days from the same month, matched by temperature and accounting for day of the week (weekend vs week days). We applied conditional logistic regression models to obtain odds ratios (OR) and their 95% CI for an increase of 10 μg/m3 (PM10) or 5 μg/m3 (PM2.5) in pollutant concentrations over three lag days (lag 0, 1 and 2). We observed significant associations of PM10 and PM2.5 with treatment of acute thrombo-embolic events at the three lags. The strongest associations were observed for air pollution concentrations on the day of the event (lag0). Increases of 10 μg/m3 PM10 and 5 μg/m3 PM2.5 on lag0 increased the odds of events treated with endovascular intervention by 2.7% (95%CI:2.3%–3.2%) and 1.3% (95%CI:1%–1.5%), respectively, and they increased the odds of events treated with antithrombotic enzymes by 1.9% (95%CI:1.1–2.7%) and 1.2% (95%CI:0.7%–1.6%), respectively.

M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS CM) are performed. These simulations are forced by changes of the parameters of the Earth orbit, total solar irradiance, volcanic (stratospheric) aerosols optical depth (only since 500 C. E.), atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O), land use, tropospheric sulphate burden, and population density. It is found that the externally forced part of the terrestrial carbon cycle (TCC) interannual variability (IAV) was mostly driven by volcanic activity in the preindustrial part of the last millennium with an increase of importance of anthropogenic forcing during the 20th century. The latter enhanced IAV in the 20th century. For different time intervals and for different kinds of external forcing, coefficient of variation of IAV in different TCC characteristics is smaller (typically, up to few percent) in forested regions and larger in the regions covered by grasses (e.g., in tundra), where it could be as large as several tens of per cents for fire return interval. We show that the externally forced IAV of gross primary production during the 20th century dramatically increased as compared to that during the preindustrial period. In addition, the land use activity increases the relaxation time scale of the vegetation carbon stock by one order of magnitude. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Orbits; Population statistics; Sulfur compounds; Volcanoes; Atmospheric concentration; Coefficient of variation; Gross primary production; Interannual variability; Relaxation time scale; Russian Academy of Sciences; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Total solar irradiance; Density of gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097540713

In addition to the known asymptotic self-similar solutions for low buoyancy regimes, we introduce two novel ones for the high buoyancy regimes via power series solutions. Explicit results for the peak pressure value on the cap, which arises in the vicinity of the well, are derived and discussed for all flow regimes. The analytical results derived are then applied for cap integrity considerations in six test cases of CO2 geological storage from the PCOR partnership, most of which correspond to high buoyancy conditions. The validity of the self-similar solutions which are late time asymptotics, is verified with CFD numerical simulations with a commercial software.

We estimate the relationship between mortality and two major air pollution regulations, the Supreme Court Action Plan (SCAP) and the Catalytic Converter (CC) policy. Although data for mortality in India have improved over time, the annual average mortality for many districts is volatile, with many outliers and missing values. After addressing these measurement issues in a difference-in-differences setup, we do not find evidence that the policies were effective in significantly reducing mortality. In an effort to understand the potential benefits of reducing pollution levels in India, we investigate the association of different pollution types with mortality. This analysis relies upon relatively recent satellite data on PM2.5 levels in India. We examine this relationship for India for the first time, using a fixed effects model in an attempt to address issues of endogeneity and measurement error. We find that PM2.5 levels are positively associated with mortality, with a 10% increase in pollution conditionally associated with a 2.0% increase in the mortality rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Environmental regulations; India; Mortality; PM2.5","Economics; Natural resources management; Annual average; Difference-in-differences; Mortality rate; Pollution level; Pollution regulation; Pollution standards; Potential benefits; Satellite data; Air quality; atmospheric pollution; mortality; particulate matter; pollution policy; regulatory approach; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087774747

Thus, creating energy-efficient storage systems, that reduce the carbon footprint of enterprise data centers is an area of interest and need. We propose ECOSTAR, a cost-effective, tiered object storage architecture modeled for OpenStack Swift, that is aimed at significantly optimizing the energy consumption in data centers while keeping availability constraints in check. There has been work towards using Solid State Drives (SSDs) as a staging layer on top of traditional HDDs, to improve request performance and provide greater energy efficiency. In the proposed hierarchical architecture, we extend the tiering approach by introducing a layer of Tape Drives that will be used to store replicas of partitions that are infrequently accessed, providing a noteworthy reduction in energy consumption. Tape Drives also provide increased durability while significantly reducing the architectural setup costs. Tapes, being a means of offline storage, also increases security against cyber attacks.

Such episodes are produced under specific meteorological conditions, which favour the sudden increase of levels of air pollutants. This study has investigated the influence of the mixing layer height (MLH) on the concentration levels of atmospheric pollutants and daily mortality in Madrid, Spain, during the period 2011–2014. It may help to understand the causes and impact of local high-pollution episodes. MLH at midday over Madrid was daily estimated from meteorological radio soundings. Then, days with different MLH over this urban area were characterized by meteorological parameters registered at different levels of an instrumented tower and by composite sea level pressure maps, representing the associated synoptic meteorological scenarios. Next, statistically significant associations between MLH and levels of PM10, PM2.5, NO, NO2, CO and ultra-fine particles number concentrations registered at representative monitoring stations were evaluated. Finally, associations between all-natural cause daily mortality in Madrid, MLH, and air pollutants were estimated using conditional Poisson regression models. The reduction of MLH to values below 482 m above-ground level under strong atmospheric stagnation conditions was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in levels of NO, NO2, CO, PM2.5 and ultra-fine particle number concentrations at urban-traffic and suburban monitoring sites. The decrease of the MLH was also associated to a linear increase of the daily number of exceedances of the UE NO2 hourly limit value (200 μg/m3) and levels of air pollutants at hotspot urban-traffic monitoring stations. Also, a statistically significant association of the MLH with all-natural cause daily mortality was obtained. When the MLH increased by 830 m, the risk of mortality decreased by 2.5% the same day and by 3.3% the next day, when African dust episodic days were excluded. They were also higher in absolute terms than the increases in risk of mortality that were determined for the exposition to any other air pollutant. Our results suggest that when the prediction models foresee values of MLH below 482 m above-ground level in Madrid, the evolution of high-contamination episodes will be very favourable. Therefore, short-term policy measures will have to be implemented to reduce NO, NO2, CO, PM2.5 and ultra-fine particle emissions from anthropogenic sources in this southern European urban location. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Gaseous pollutants; Health effects; Mixing layer height; Particle number concentration; PMx; Urban air pollution","atmospheric pollution; composite; concentration (composition); episodic event; mixing ratio; parameterization; Poisson ratio; regression analysis; sea level pressure; traffic emission; urban area; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; meteorology; particulate matter; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088958068

Over three-hundred meter-thick fossiliferous Middle-to Late Devonian carbonate deposits of the Bahram Formation in the Anarak region (western Central Iran) are composed of dark grey limestone, dolostone, and interbedded shale. Seventeen microfacies have been distinguished, which correspond to four depositional sub-environments, i.e., tidal flat, lagoon, shoal, and open marine. The Middle–Late Devonian carbonate deposits were deposited on a homoclinal carbonate ramp. Seven third-order depositional sequences are identified, apparently controlled by relative sea level change. Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, and major and trace elements of micritic carbonate samples document details about the geochemical, palaeoenvironmental, and diagenetic processes; they also indicate that the carbonates underwent meteoric diagenesis within a semi-closed diagenetic system. The low concentrations of trace elements indicative of euxinic conditions, including Mo, Cr, V, and As, suggest well-oxygenated depositional environment. Carbon isotope values show a meaningful relationship to major sequence-stratigraphic key surfaces, with more negative values occurring at the sequence boundaries and positive values corresponding to maximum flooding surfaces. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate ramp; Geochemistry; Iran; Microfacies; Middle–Late Devonian; Sequence stratigraphy","carbon isotope; carbonate rock; depositional environment; Devonian; diagenesis; paleoenvironment; sequence stratigraphy; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088931127

Hydrogen is eco-friendly, renewable, and green. The synthesis and development of materials with great potential for hydrogen storage is still a challenge in research and needs to be addressed to store hydrogen economically and efficiently. Various solid-state materials have been fabricated for hydrogen energy storage; however, carbon-based nanocomposites have gained more attention because of its high surface area, low processing cost, and light weight nature. Carbon materials are easy to modify with various metals, metal oxides (MOs), and other organometallic frameworks because of the functional groups available on the surface and edges that increase the storage capacity of hydrogen. In addition, chemisorption is another way to enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon-based nanocomposites. In this review, we discuss the success achieved thus far and the challenges that remain for the physical and chemical storage of hydrogen in various carbon-based nanocomposites. Various compositions of catalysts (eg, metal, MOs, alloy, metal organic frameworks) and carbon materials are designed for hydrogen storage. Superior energy storage in hybrids and composites as compared with pristine materials (catalysts or carbon nanotubes) is governed by the interaction, activation, and hydrogen adsorption/absorption mechanism of materials in the reaction profile. (Nano)composites comprising carbon material with metals, MOs, or alloys are important in this field, not only because of their potential for hydrogen sorption but also their significant cyclic stability and high efficiency upon successive adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon nanotubes; graphene oxide; hydrogen; nanocomposites; renewable energy","Gas adsorption; Hydrogen fuels; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metals; Nanocatalysts; Nanocomposites; Organometallics; Adsorption-desorption cycles; Alternative energy source; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen energy storages; Hydrogen storage capacities; Scientific community; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Solid-state materials; Hydrogen storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087754313

Therefore, in this paper is presented the curricular design of the course ""Public Health and Sustainable Development""offered at Universidad del Magdalena. This course covered three topics in its order: 1) the relationship between sustainability and health; 2) the knowledge about SDGs and their global agenda; 3) and ways for increase healthy life and sustainable development in context. With these three topics the SDGs analyzed were: #3 Good health and well-being #4 Quality education, #6 Clean water and sanitation, #7 Affordable and clean energy, #11 Sustainable cities and communities, and #13 Climate action. The evaluation was based on rubrics, the students presented oral workshops and group written reports, and a final report that addressed the relationship between health and public and SDG. It can be concluded that the students achieved a first level of knowledge in the relationship between public health and the SDGs. This work identified that there are three main environmental problems of the city of Santa Marta: the public supply of drinking water for human consumption, continuous increase of high temperatures, and lack of vegetation. In this way, new buildings must generate an impact on public health, guaranteeing a healthy urban environment. In Santa Marta, the University must have a central role as an integrating axis, promoting healthy and sustainable behavior in society; and based in this work there are elements for a climate emergency declaration in Universidad del Magdalena. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curricula; Developing countries; Outages; Planning; Population statistics; Potable water; Public health; Vegetation; Emergency declarations; Environmental problems; Future generations; High population density; Human consumption; Social determinants of healths; Sustainable cities; Urban environments; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097138984

During the curfew period the daily O3 mean concentration increased by 96%, 109% and 95% in comparison to the concentrations for the same period in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. This increase is mainly explained by considerable reduction in NOx emissions, thus there was little titration of ozone accumulated in the city environment due to its shallow boundary layer by NO, reaching its maximum concentration at midday. Among studied pollutants that influence O3 formation (CO, NO2, PM2.5) during the curfew the contaminant that showed the greatest reduction in the mean concentration compared to three previous years was NO2, followed by CO and PM2.5. The daily O3 8-hour mean concentrations during the curfew both on weekdays and weekends were lower than the limit values. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of secondary pollutants such as O3 under strict measures of control of primary pollutant emissions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Boundary layers; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Planning; Sustainable development; Troposphere; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Limit values; Maximum concentrations; Mean concentrations; NOx emissions; Previous year; Primary pollutants; Tropospheric ozone; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097650261

Given this scenario, Brazil has increased the availability of this resource to meet the demand of more interior regions and increases its autonomy with respect to this fuel. The aim of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of current and future natural gas supply situations in Brazil. To this end, the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique is applied, with a cradle-to-gate approach for the climate change (CC) and primary energy demand (PED) impact categories. For the current scenario, the main contributions to CC occur in the form of CH4 emissions during gas transportation operations (crude or refined) and resource withdrawal from reserves. For future supplies, the applied analysis identifies transport distance as an important PED focus, whereas the same parameter and the distributed volume of refined gas are noteworthy as impact sources concerning CC. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The study explores the switching intentions of people from motorized vehicles to electric vehicles by integrating push-pull-mooring model and institutional theory. The study incorporates environmental quality, regulative environment, alternative attractiveness, normative environment, self-(decision)efficacy, and willingness to pay into an integrated framework. The study further analyzes the green behavior of consumers by extending switching intentions for electric vehicles. The integrated framework explains mooring as the most influential factor followed by normative environment from pull factors and environmental quality from push factors. The effect of regulative environment remains weak and significant, but the effect of alternative attractiveness remains weak and insignificant.

Recently, numerous hybrid systems in which supramolecular photocatalysts comprised of a photosensitizer and catalytic-metal-complex units are immobilized on inorganic solid materials, such as semiconductors or mesoporous organosilica, have been reported as CO2-reduction photocatalysts for various functions, including water oxidation and light harvesting. In the present study, we investigated the photocatalytic properties of supramolecular photocatalysts comprised of a Ru(II)-complex photosensitizer and a Re(I)-complex catalyst fixed on the surface of insulating Al2O3 particles: the distance among the supramolecular photocatalyst molecules should be fixed. Visible-light irradiation of the photocatalyst in the presence of an electron donor under a CO2 atmosphere produced CO selectively. Although CO formation was also observed for a 1:1 mixture of mononuclear Ru(II) and Re(I) complexes attached to an Al2O3 surface, the photocatalytic activity was much lower. The activity of the Al2O3-supported photocatalyst was strongly dependent on the adsorption density of the supramolecular moiety, where the initial rate of photocatalytic CO formation was faster at lower density and higher photocatalyst durability was achieved at higher density. One of the main reasons for the former phenomenon is the decreased quenching fraction of the excited state of the photosensitizer unit by the reductant dissolved in the solution phase in the case of higher density. This is due to the self-quenching of the excited photosensitizer unit and steric hindrance between the condensed supramolecular photocatalyst molecules attached to the surface. The higher durability of the more condensed system is caused by intermolecular electron transfer between reduced supramolecular photocatalyst molecules, which accelerates the formation of CO in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Coadsorption of a Ru(II) mononuclear complex as a redox photosensitizer could drastically reinforce the photocatalysis of the supramolecular photocatalyst on the surface of the Al2O3 particles: more than 10 times higher turnover number and about 3.4 times higher turnover frequency of CO formation. These investigations provide new architectures for the construction of efficient and durable hybrid photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction, which are composed of metal-complex photocatalysts and solid materials. ©",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Artificial photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Durability; Electron transport properties; Excited states; Hybrid materials; Hybrid systems; Light; Mesoporous materials; Metal complexes; Molecules; Photocatalytic activity; Photosensitizers; Quenching; Rhenium compounds; Silica; Supramolecular chemistry; Adsorption densities; Intermolecular electron transfer; Mesoporous organosilicas; Mononuclear complexes; Photocatalytic property; Photocatalytic systems; Supported photocatalyst; Visible-light irradiation; Ruthenium compounds; aluminum oxide; carbon dioxide; methylphosphonic acid; rhenium; ruthenium; absorption; adsorption; Article; complex formation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; deprotonation; desorption; dimerization; dispersion; electron transport; electrospray mass spectrometry; irradiation; light scattering; limit of detection; oxidation reduction potential; particle size; photocatalysis; photochemical quenching; process optimization; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum yield; solubility; substitution reaction; ultraviolet spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095817611

Quantifying the consequences of long-term, decadal multigenerational exposure to elevated [CO2] and the genetic changes that may underpin evolutionary mechanisms with [CO2] as a driver remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated both plastic and evolutionary plant responses to elevated [CO2] by applying multi-omic technologies using populations of Plantago lanceolata L., grown in naturally high [CO2] for many generations in a CO2 spring. Seed from populations at the CO2 spring and an adjacent control site (ambient [CO2]) were grown in a common environment for one generation, and then offspring were grown in ambient or elevated [CO2] growth chambers. Low overall genetic differentiation between the CO2 spring and control site populations was found, with evidence of weak selection in exons. We identified evolutionary divergence in the DNA methylation profiles of populations derived from the spring relative to the control population, providing the first evidence that plant methylomes may respond to elevated [CO2] over multiple generations. In contrast, growth at elevated [CO2] for a single generation induced limited methylome remodelling (an order of magnitude fewer differential methylation events than observed between populations), although some of this appeared to be stably transgenerationally inherited. In all, 59 regions of the genome were identified where transcripts exhibiting differential expression (associated with single generation or long-term natural exposure to elevated [CO2]) co-located with sites of differential methylation or with single nucleotide polymorphisms exhibiting significant inter-population divergence. This included genes in pathways known to respond to elevated [CO2], such as nitrogen use efficiency and stomatal patterning. This study provides the first indication that DNA methylation may contribute to plant adaptation to future atmospheric [CO2] and identifies several areas of the genome that are targets for future study. © 2020 The Authors.

In the automotive sector, Euro 4 regulations came into force in January 2013 in accordance with European Union (EU) emission standards for heavy‐duty diesel engines and are based on steady‐state testing. In the marine sector, the International Maritime Organization(IMO) Maritime Environment Protection Committee(MEPC) is a group of experts who discuss all problems related to the prevention and control of marine pollution from ships, such as efforts to reduce ozone‐depleting substances and greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce the harmful emissions from marine diesel engines, a wet‐type exhaust gas cleaning system was developed in this study. As a test, seawater, electrolyzed water, and sodium hydroxide were sequentially injected into the exhaust gas. SO2 was reduced by 98.7–99.6% with seawater injection, NOx by 43.2–48.9% with electrolyzed water injection, and CO2 by 28.0–33.3% with sodium hydroxide injection. © 2020 by the authors.

In this article, we determine how CO2 emissions attributable to U.S. steel consumption can be cut by 70% by 2050. We vary four key steel cycle parameters (U.S. steel stocks per capita, recycling rate, product lifespan, and manufacturing yield) in a dynamic material flow analysis to determine a range of values for annual steel demand and the scrap available for recycling. We combine these data with steelmaking technology and trade scenarios to calculate potential U.S. steel sector emissions in each year to 2050. Only 20% of the pathways we modeled for the U.S. steel sector achieved the emissions target. Emissions in 2050 are most sensitive to the CO2 released per kilogram of steel produced and the steel stocks per capita. Deployment of emerging low carbon steelmaking technology alone is insufficient to achieve the emissions cut; conversely, reducing stocks per capita from the current ∼11 tons/capita toward levels in the U.K. and France, ∼8 tons/capita, would enable the emissions cut to be achieved under a range of foreseeable steelmaking technology scenarios and steel cycle parameters. If action to reduce per capita steel stocks is delayed by more than five years, then it is likely infeasible for the U.S. steel sector to stay within its 2050 CO2 budget because of the increased demand for emissions-intensive steel made from iron ore. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Iron ores; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Steelmaking; Cycle parameters; Dynamic materials; Manufacturing yield; Product lifespan; Recycling rate; Steel consumers; Steel consumption; Technology scenarios; Low carbon steel; carbon; carbon dioxide; manganese; phosphorus; silicon; steel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; steel; Article; electricity; exhaust gas; France; furnace; greenhouse gas; human; recycling; United Kingdom; industry; United States; Matthiola; Carbon Dioxide; France; Industry; Recycling; Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095813531

The objective of this work was to analyze trends in extreme temperature indices in Aguascalientes. With RClimdex 1.0 and data on daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin), 16 temperature indices were calculated. The trend in indices was determined with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test (p ≤ 0.05), while the rate of change was obtained with Theil-Sen’s trend estimator. Significant positive trends were observed in 72 time series of indices associated with Tmax and in 39 time series of indices associated with Tmin. Significant negative trends were observed in 22 time series of indices associated with Tmax, and in 45 time series of indices associated with Tmin. In some regions of Aguascalientes, diurnal warming is occurring; in others, warmer or less cold nights prevail. The changes in extreme temperature indices might have severe implications in the use of irrigation water, cause physiological stress in crops, promote respiratory and cardiac diseases, and improve the reproduction cycles and populations of insects. Also, the fruit production, such as guava, could be affected under the reduction of minimum temperature, and the increase in warm days where other fruit trees are cultivated can intensify the use of chemical compensators of cold. These results are of significance for long-term economic planning and design of strategies of adaptation/mitigation to climate change. In Aguascalientes, the changes observed in extreme temperature indices could be due to climate change of a bigger scale, either regional or at the watershed level. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; diurnal variation; extreme event; regional climate; temperature profile; time series; trend analysis; watershed; Aguascalientes; Mexico [North America]; Hexapoda; Psidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091302781

We review the literature to document how climate change may disrupt these ecological interactions and develop a conceptual framework to integrate the pathways of plant-microbe responses to climate over different scales in space and time. We then create a blueprint to aid generalization that categorizes climate effects into changes in the context dependency of plant-microbe pairs, temporal mismatches and altered feedbacks over time, or spatial mismatches that accompany species range shifts. We pair a new graphical model of how plant-microbe interactions influence resistance to climate change with a statistical approach to predictthe consequences of increasing variability in climate. Finally, we suggest pathways through which plant-microbe interactions can affect resilience during recovery from climate disruption.

In recent times, disaster management is required for sustainable management. Researchers, geographers, climatologists, regional planners in every country are trying to control and mitigate the effect of disasters. The Ajoy River basin of eastern India is facing the acute problem of flood in every monsoon period and this region is highly populated as well as agricultural productivity is very high. So, this region is taken into consideration as a study region through various natural and anthropogenic factors. The current research work is presenting flood susceptible areas in Ajoy River basin using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) model in GIS environment. To establish the final result different flood susceptibility causal factors (topographical, hydrological, soil characteristics, environmental and geological) are envisaged. The models result was evaluated through Area Under Curve (AUC) values with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). The condition or environment of flood is shown by AUC. When AUC values shows more than 0.95 then there will be strong probability of flood occurrence. Here the AUC values for the BBO, RF and SVM are 0.985, 0.925 and 0.896 respectively. In this study out of three models, BBO showed us best result (AUC = 0.98) and made assurance that BBO is a prominent method for identifying the flood prone areas in eastern part of India, a monsoon dominated region and help to take managing step for regional mitigation as well as development planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BBO; Flood prone areas; Natural disaster; RF; SVM","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Heuristic algorithms; Land use; Productivity; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Watersheds; Agricultural productivity; Anthropogenic factors; Biogeographybased optimizations (BBO); Development planning; Disaster management; Receiver operating characteristics; Soil characteristics; Sustainable management; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087873281

Purpose: The aim of this review is to summarise current treatment options, evaluate their efficacy and make provide recommendations on the optimal management of the disease. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using the PubMed database for articles referring to the treatment of VaIN. We restricted our search only in articles written in English with publication dates within the last 10 years. Results: Surgical approach included local excision, CO2 laser ablation, CO2 laser skinning colpectomy and laparoscopic upper vaginectomy. Medical management was based on intravaginally administered topical agents such as 5% imiquimod cream, 5-fluorouracil cream and topical oestrogens. Intracavitary radiation therapy was reported in two forms: Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy and high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. All treatment options were well tolerated, with satisfactory cure rates and acceptable recurrence rates. Conclusion: The choice of treatment depends upon many factors. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment and should be performed if invasion cannot be excluded. Topical agents are useful for persistent, multifocal lesions or for women that cannot undergo surgical treatment. Brachytherapy is associated with high morbidity rates and should be reserved for women who have multifocal disease, are poor surgical candidates and/or have failed other treatments. CO2 laser ablation achieves minimal scarring and sexual dysfunction; however, invasive disease should be ruled out with biopsies before the initiation of the treatment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"estrogen; fluorouracil; imiquimod; imiquimod; brachytherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clinical effectiveness; clinical research; colpectomy; disease management; gynecologic surgery; human; intracavitary radiation therapy; laparoscopic upper vaginectomy; laser surgery; low energy radiation; morbidity; priority journal; quality of life; radiation dose; Review; scar formation; sexual dysfunction; surgical approach; therapy; treatment indication; treatment outcome; tumor invasion; uterus surgery; vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia; carcinoma in situ; female; retrospective study; tumor recurrence; vagina tumor; Carcinoma in Situ; Female; Humans; Imiquimod; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Retrospective Studies; Vaginal Neoplasms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088987482

However, the functional role of mitochondria in glial cells has been poorly studied. Recent reports have demonstrated unequivocally that astrocytes do not require mitochondria to meet their bioenergetics demands. Then, the question remaining is, what is the functional role of mitochondria in astrocytes? In this work, we review current evidence demonstrating that mitochondrial central carbon metabolism in astrocytes regulates overall brain bioenergetics, neurotransmitter homeostasis and redox balance. Emphasis is placed in detailing carbon source utilization (glucose and fatty acids), anaplerotic inputs and cataplerotic outputs, as well as carbon shuttles to neurons, which highlight the metabolic specialization of astrocytic mitochondria and its relevance to brain function. © Copyright © 2020 Rose, Brian, Pappa, Panayiotidis and Franco.","anaplerotic; astrocytes; bioenergetics; cataplerotic; fatty acid oxidation; glycolysis; mitochondria; redox","6 phosphofructokinase; adenylate kinase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ciliary neurotrophic factor; coenzyme A; electron transferring flavoprotein; fatty acid; flavine adenine nucleotide; glucose; glucose transporter 1; hypoxia inducible factor 1; long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase; n acetylglucosamine; neurotransmitter; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; pyruvate carboxylase; pyruvate dehydrogenase; reactive oxygen metabolite; uridine diphosphate; aerobic metabolism; anaplerosis; astrocyte; bioenergy; blood brain barrier; brain function; brain metabolism; carbon metabolism; carbon source; carbon utilization; cataplerosis; chemical reaction; citric acid cycle; fatty acid oxidation; glycolysis; ketogenesis; ketolysis; lipid metabolism; metabolic regulation; mitochondrial respiration; neurotransmission; oxidation reduction state; oxidative phosphorylation; pentose phosphate cycle; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096204344

However, the country currently lacks a comprehensive integrated place-based assessment of social vulnerability that covers the entire territory. In consequence, the present study employed the SoVI® method to understand the pre-existing social vulnerability throughout the territory as a first step in national disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation planning. The social vulnerability assessment presented in this study is based on the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI®) developed for the United States of America (USA). The Colombian index was constructed using data from the 2005 census provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and the 2009 data of the Selecting Beneficiaries of Social Programs (SISBEN). The analysis included the municipalities with available information of their urban and rural areas (1118). The results show seven factors that explain 64% of the variance. The values range from +17.85 (High social vulnerability) to −4.85 (low social vulnerability). In general, the most vulnerable municipalities are located in the Pacific and Amazon regions, the southern areas of the Orinoco and the northern part of the Caribbean. The application of SoVI® for Colombia presented in this paper indicates a regionalization of vulnerability within the territory between areas of industrial and economic growth (urban), and areas of poor socio-economic development that may also be marked by the presence of political conflict and production of illegal crops (rural). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Colombia; Natural hazards; Social vulnerability; Social vulnerability index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091227263

This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends. Therefore, this paper describes the behavior of PM2.5 emissions particulate matter from the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world according to the WHO, measured before-after the start of the quarantine.

This study aims to increase the sensitivity towards tourism-related climate information to support an adjusted and responsible planning in the tourism industry in Barcelona, Spain. The assessment of local climate and bioclimate conditions was conducted by using meteorological data from 2007 to 2017. Accordingly, a bioclimatological brochure with practical use was designed integrating thermal, esthetic, and physical climate facets for tourism, which were analyzed in 10-day intervals and combined with the Climate-Tourism-Information-Scheme (CTIS). The CTIS of Barcelona highlights that the most suitable climatic and bioclimatic conditions last from the end of February to the first 10 days of June, and from September to mid-November, where all analyzed parameters converge at a relatively high rate of ideal conditions. This study certainly is a contribution on how to evaluate the climate and bioclimate for a defined destination from the perspective of tourism.

There are more than 1 million km of highways in the country and the search for alternative technologies to reduce emissions from the transport industry is increasing. The Blue Corridor research started to replace heavy-duty vehicles fueled by conventional diesel to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its effect on pollutant emissions reductions. In this context, this paper aims at evaluating the atmospheric dispersion of particulate matter (PM) from road heavy-duty trucks in 12 cities in the São Paulo State, assessing the impacts of the replacement of full fleet powered by diesel to LNG and the effects on the health of the local population. The model AERMOD was used to simulate the dispersion of PM produced by heavy-duty vehicles fuel combustion and the methodology suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to analyze the number of deaths attributed to the PM emitted. Results showed some municipalities with high PM concentrations, which exceeded the limits suggested by WHO. In terms of health issues, cardiovascular diseases in a population older than 30 years were the main cause of death from PM emissions. When it comes to fuel replacement, LNG helps to reduce PM emissions, but considering this reduction alone is not sufficient to avoid attributable deaths. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality dispersion model; Health impact; Heavy-duty trucks; LNG; Particulate matter","Automobiles; Diesel engines; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Health; Natural gas vehicles; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Trucks; Alternative technologies; Atmospheric dispersion; Cardio-vascular disease; Heavy duty vehicles; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Particulate Matter; Pollutant emissions reduction; World Health Organization; Liquefied natural gas; liquefied natural gas; cause of death; concentration (composition); emission; emission control; particulate matter; pollution effect; public health; traffic emission; World Health Organization; air pollution; air quality; all-terrain vehicle; Article; atmospheric dispersion; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; combustion; health impact assessment; highway; particulate matter; priority journal; World Health Organization; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090000897

This paper focuses on this nexus from the point of view of the energy that is required by wastewater treatment plants, which are intensive energy consumers and major emitters of greenhouse gases. The main objective of the study is to investigate the possible use of a wastewater plant’s internal chemical, potential, and kinetic energy, and the addition of external renewable technologies with a view to achieving clean energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For this purpose, an analysis is made of the feasibility of introducing alternative technologies—anaerobic digestion, hydraulic turbines, wind turbines, and photovoltaic modules— to meet the plant’s energy needs. The plant chosen as case study (Jinamar plant, Canary Islands, Spain) has an energy consumption of 2956 MWh/year, but the employed methodological framework is suitable for other plants in locations where the renewable energy potential has previously been analyzed. The results show that a renewable energy production of 3396 MWh/year can be obtained, more than enough to meet plant consumption, but also confirm the need for an energy storage system, due to seasonal variability in energy resource availability. In terms of climate change mitigation, the emission of 2754 tons/year of greenhouse gases is avoided. In addition, the economic viability of the proposed system is also confirmed. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition to the principles of modern and affordable housing, the objectives of the Climate Protection Plan 2050 and requirements of sustainability have been taken into account. As a result, proposals for the updating and optimization of existing regulations have been developed to ensure sustainable construction of public housing. The criteria already address large parts of the sustainability and climate protection goals. Some aspects such as biodiversity at the site or the consideration of neighbourhoods have been included. Subsequently, it was examined how these different systems could be brought together in an updated evaluation system for new housing construction.

Experiments with steady-state and dynamically recorded U(i)-characteristics are performed in order to evaluate the performances over a wide temperature range and for different operating conditions. Furthermore, the influence of the operating pressure is quantified via the temperature and pressure dependency of the related ASR values of each stack. Impedance analysis is conducted in order to investigate the major differences and the pressure effect on the specific process resistances during steam and CO2 electrolysis. In case of the stack with fuel electrode supported cells, the ASR is found to decrease significantly at elevated pressure leading to an overall performance gain, whereas the stack with electrolyte supported cells shows a minor pressure effect. An impedance study shows that the diffusion and activation resistances are significantly affected when conducting CO2 instead of H2O electrolysis for both stack concepts. Furthermore, the pressure sensitivity is found to be more dominant during CO2 electrolysis than during pure steam electrolysis operation. © 2020 The Authors","Electrolysis; Pressurized operation; Solid oxide stack; Syngas production","Carbon dioxide; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolysis; Fuels; Solid electrolytes; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Different operating conditions; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrolyte-supported cells; Experimental comparison; Impedance analysis; Pressure sensitivities; Temperature and pressures; Wide temperature ranges; Pressure effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089108962

This is because the harmful particles will penetrate into human's body through exposure to surrounding. The existence of air pollution event is one of the causes for air quality to be low in affected urban area. To monitor this event, a proper management of urban air quality is required to solve and reduce the impact on human and environment. One of the ways to manage urban air quality is by modelling ambient air pollutants. So, this paper reviews three modelling tools which are AERMOD, CALPUFF and CFD in order to visualise the air pollutants in urban area. These three tools have its own capability in modelling the air quality. AERMOD is better to be used in short range dispersion model while CALPUFF is for wide range of dispersion model. Somehow, it is different for CFD model as this model can be used in wide range of application such as air ventilation in clothing and not specifically for air quality modelling only. Because of this, AERMOD and CALPUFF model can be classified in air quality modelling tools group whereas CFD modelling tool is classified into different group namely a non-specific modelling tool group which can be implemented in many fields of study. Earlier air quality researches produced results in two-dimensional (2D) visualization. But there are several of disadvantages for this technique. It cannot provide height information and exact location of pollutants in three-dimensional (3D) as perceived in real world. Moreover, it cannot show a good representation of wind movement throughout the study area. To overcome this problem, the 3D visualization needs to be implemented in the urban air quality study. Thus, this paper intended to give a better understanding on modeling tools with the visualization technique used for the result of performed research. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Hybrid wind-wave farms can reduce installation and maintenance costs, and increase the renewable energy availability of a location by compensating for the wind’s intermittent nature with good wave conditions. In addition, wave farms can provide protection to wind farms, and the combined wind/wave farm can provide coastal protection. This work aims to assess the future hybrid wind-wave energy resource for the northwest coast of Iberian Peninsula for the near future (2026–2045), under the RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenario. This assessment was accomplished by applying a Delphi classification method to define four categories, aiming to evaluate the richness (wind and wave energy availability, downtime), the variability (temporal variation), the environmental risk (extreme events), and cost parameters (water depth and distance to coast) of the wind and wave resources. The combined index (CI), which classifies the hybrid wind-wave resource, shows that most of the NW Iberian Peninsula presents good conditions (CI > 0.6) for exploiting energy from wind and wave resources simultaneously. Additionally, there are some particularly optimal areas (CI > 0.7), such as the region near Cape Roca, and the Galician coast. © 2020 by the authors.

Traditional CO2 capture methods employ temperature or pressure swings; however, electrochemical swings, in which an applied potential modulates nucleophilicity, are also possible to mediate the capture and release of CO2. In contrast to the breadth of electrochemical CO2 reduction research, electrochemically mediated CO2 capture and concentration is an emerging field. Although some aspects are reminiscent of those in CO2 reduction, like local pH gradients and (bi)carbonate equilibria, ultimately electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration poses its own unique challenges that will benefit from insights from intercalative batteries, redox flow batteries, and biomimetic/-inspired design, among other fields. After an introduction to carbon capture and current chemical strategies, this Review highlights promising emerging electrochemical methods to enable CO2 capture and concentration; specifically discussed are organic redox, transition metal redox, and pH swings.

Design: A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used. We carried out the research in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology checklist. Methods: The study was carried out from August–October of 2018 using a structured electronic questionnaire. A total of 965 participants were selected with convenience sampling in Guangdong province. Results: A total of 786 valid questionnaires were collected in this study. The average burnout score of participants was 38.19 (SD 13.32) and 67.4% of them rated their burnout as more than 30 points, while 5.7% were higher than 60 points. The multi-variable linear regression model explained 9.4% of the variance in burnout related to sociodemographic variables (p < 0.001). Empathy was significantly and positively associated with nursing organizational climate and emotional exhaustion while negatively associated with reduced personal accomplishment. In addition, nursing organizational climate mediated the relationship between empathy and reduced personal accomplishment. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both empathy and nursing organizational climate are protective factors that prevent burnout in this population. Managers can alleviate nurses’ burnout through developing empathy and improving the organizational climate. Impact: This study demonstrates that empathy is not the cause of burnout; rather, it can prevent nurses from experiencing burnout. Nursing organizational climate is another protective factor that has a mediating effect on empathy and burnout. Improving empathy and nursing organizational climate could help reduce nurse burnout. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","burnout; emotional exhaustion; empathy; mediating effect; nurses; nursing organizational climate; personal accomplishment","adult; article; burnout; checklist; controlled study; convenience sample; demography; emotional stress; empathy; female; human; human tissue; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; manager; nurse; observational study; organizational climate; prevention; questionnaire; China; cross-sectional study; empathy; nursing staff; Burnout, Professional; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empathy; Humans; Nurses; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090168061

As the main grain producing area in China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is facing serious O3 pollution. This study analyzed the hourly ground-level O3 observation data of 158 stations from 2014 to 2019 in YRD, and grain production data of 193 districts and counties. The exposure-response relationships based on AOT40 (accumulated hourly O3 concentration above 40 ppb) was used to estimate the yield loss and economic loss of two food crops (winter wheat and rice). This study used spatial interpolation and calculated the specific data values of each district and county in order to improve the assessment reliability. For years 2014–2019, averaged O3 concentration during the 75 days growing period of rice and wheat were 33.1–50.6 ppb and 32.2–48.0 ppb, AOT40 value were 5.2–12.0 ppm h and 4.6–9.4 ppm h, and the averaged relative yield losses were 4.9%–11.4% and 9.4%–19.3%, respectively. The trend of O3 in the YRD in a six-year period peaked in 2016 and 2017 for rice and winter wheat, respectively. During 2014–2017, the average estimated yield loss of rice was 2445 Mt. accounting for about 9.1% of the actual production, and the average estimated economic loss was about 1037 million USD; for winter wheat, it was 2025 Mt, 20.4% and 736 million USD, respectively.

The stability limit, flame configuration, NOx emissions, and burn-off rate of the combustor were investigated experimentally under various global equivalence ratios (ϕg) and fuel flow rates (qf). Results show that the combustor exhibits a large stability limit with ϕg and qf as low as 0.01 and 6 × 10−5 m3/s respectively. Complete combustion and ultra-low NOx emissions of less than 3 ppm can be achieved at ϕg of 0.3 and qf of more than 30 × 10−5 m3/s, indicating that the combustor has a good potential for ultra-lean combustion and low NOx emission. The pressure fluctuation amplitude is always less than 1300 Pa during the entire experiments. The vortex-induced flame has a diffusion-like flame structure, which provides a suitable equivalence ratio zone under ultra-lean conditions, whilst the high peak combustion temperature indicates an intensified combustion, which is responsible for the large stability limit and low-pressure fluctuation amplitude. Subsequently, the enhanced stabilization can enable the ultra-lean combustion and the ensued low temperature to conduct, whilst the vortex-flow can decrease the local flow velocity and enable the turbulent diffusion velocity of NO to be dominant, which can make the NO emission reduced further. The decreased area of high-temperature region and the appearance of the negative reaction rate region of NO is the essential reason for the decrease of the NO emission at lean cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Axial fuel-injected; NOx emission; Stability limit; Turbulent diffusion velocity; Ultra-lean combustion; Vortex-tube combustor","Combustion; Combustors; Diffusion; Flow velocity; Nitrogen oxides; Stability; Temperature; Combustion temperatures; Equivalence ratios; Flame configuration; Global equivalence ratio; Pressure fluctuation; Reduction mechanisms; Turbulent diffusion; Ultra-lean combustions; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088323230

Results show that the limit of global equivalence ratio can be as low as 0.01 and the amplitude of pressure fluctuation is always less than 1300 Pa, indicating fairly good performance in combustion stabilization of the combustor. In the operation range, there is a trade-off region with low NOx and CO simultaneously. The diffusion-like flame structure in this combustor can enhance the local equivalence ratio, whilst the flow field structure can also promote the transport of chemical enthalpy to the flame front, thus facilitating the stabilization.

Here we present measurements that provide comparative estimates of soil organic carbon in grassland and forestry sites at steady state. We develop a new approach to interpret these values based on simulation of organic carbon turnover in soils that are accumulating carbon and use this to determine losses due to management operations associated with afforestation of grassland and deforestation/reforestation of forest stands. Soil organic carbon stock changes were studied in a >120 year-old Scots pine chronosequence and adjacent grassland sites on podzolic soils. Significant carbon accumulation was measured in the top organic soil horizons with forest age, while no changes were noted in the deeper mineral soil horizons. The simulations with the RothC-26.3 model revealed that pine forests on sandy soils could lose a significant amount of soil organic carbon through management operations. The lowest modeled stocks of soil organic carbon were not in the young sites (0–25 years old), but at 43 years since reforestation. Using measured data from our study site, the simulations of grassland afforestation suggested that accumulation of organic carbon under forest occurs mainly in the organic horizons, while the deeper sandy mineral soil horizons are likely to become depleted in organic carbon compared to grasslands. Our simulations suggest that afforestation of grasslands would increase overall soil carbon stocks but may deplete the more stable carbon pools in the deeper mineral horizons of the podzols. © Copyright © 2020 Ražauskaitė, Vanguelova, Cornulier, Smith, Randle and Smith.","afforestation; forest; pine; RothC model; sandy acidic soils; Scotland; soil organic carbon (SOC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096907126

Recently, the Nordic councils of ministers suggested enhancing cooperation and harmonization within the use of LCA in the built environment in order to accelerate climate change mitigation in the building sector. To this end, it is important to identify in which areas harmonization and cooperation is especially needed. This paper presents the results of a survey on the LCA practice among Nordic design professionals in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. The aim is to analyse the survey results, and to reflect on the implications for further harmonization of method and industry practice within the Nordic region. Method: Survey results for the Nordic countries represent a subset of a larger survey conducted as part of the IEA Annex 72 project about assessing life cycle related environmental impacts caused by buildings. The web-based survey, targeting design practitioners, was carried out from late 2018 to late 2019 within 24 participating countries. From the Nordic countries, 223 respondents accessed the survey and answered one or more questions. Results and conclusions: The survey shows that Nordic building designers, in general, feel personally or professionally committed to applying LCA. However, a main barrier for including LCA in the building design is the perceived lack of incentive as well as a lack of sufficient data and information. Respondents perceive a moderate drive from the public sector and property developers/investors for integrating assessments of environmental performance. Concerning development needs, respondents point towards harmonization efforts within LCA for use within BIM. Results of this survey furthermore reveal the dilemma for the designers between, on the one hand, needing to know all the details of the environmental assessment to learn what drives and controls the results of a project, and on the other hand, needing to convert the results of a project into easily communicable information for the client. This 'translation' of results is an additional area of potential harmonization within the Nordic region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Climate change; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Building designers; Climate change mitigation; Data and information; Design practitioners; Design professionals; Environmental assessment; Environmental performance; Industry practices; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097189606

There are several approaches to feature selection, from filter techniques to meta-heuristics wrapper methods. In this paper, we propose a compilation of tools to optimize the fitting of black-box linear models. The proposed AnTSbe algorithm combines Ant Colony Optimization and Tabu Search memory list for the selection of features and uses l1 and l2 regularization norms to fit the linear models. In addition, a polynomial combination of input features was introduced to further explore the information contained in the original data. As a case study, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence data were used as the primary measurements to predict total sulfur concentration in diesel fuel samples. The sample dataset was divided into S10 (less than 10 ​ppm of total sulfur), and S100 (mean sulfur content of 100 ​ppm) groups and local linear models were fit with AnTSbe. For the Diesel S100 local models, using only 5 out of the original 1467 fluorescence pairs, combined with bases expansion, we were able to satisfactorily predict total sulfur content in samples with MAPE of less than 4% and RMSE of 4.68 ​ppm, for the test subset. For the Diesel S10 local models, the use of 4 Ex/Em pairs was sufficient to predict sulfur content with MAPE 0.24%, and RMSE of 0.015 ​ppm, for the test subset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology was able to satisfactorily optimize the fitting of linear models to predict sulfur content in diesel fuel samples without need of chemical of physical pre-treatment, and was superior to classic PLS regression methods and also to our previous results with ant colony optimization studies in the same dataset. The proposed AnTSbe can be directly applied to data from other sources without need for adaptations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ant colony optimization; Diesel; EEM Fluorescence; Polynomial combination; Sulfur; Tabu search","diesel; fuel; sulfur; unclassified drug; algorithm; ant colony optimization; Article; controlled study; data analysis; data processing; desulfurization; hybrid; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; spectrofluorometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091226311

In this paper, a modelling framework is developed to explore how PES negotiations between forestry and fishery-based communities may be affected when warming reduces the stock of fish as well as forest biomass growth rates. Under a PES arrangement, forestry-based communities afforest the lake's catchment region, which helps improve fish stock abundance through reduced sediment loading. When climate warming adversely impacts fish yields, the value of restoring degraded lands in the catchment region increases, making the negotiating powers of the fishing and forestry dependent communities dynamic. Results suggest that the prospect of a climate-driven negotiating power in the future calls for higher PES payments by the fishing community in order to incentivize early restoration. Warming could also affect forest biomass growth rates in the long run. However, findings from this study suggest that warming driven forest biomass growth rate decline may have a relatively lower impact on PES negotiations compared to the direct impact of warming on lake's fish productivity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"catchment; climate change; community dynamics; fishing community; growth rate; restoration ecology; sediment yield; stock assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088111195

It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level. © 2020","AOD, Satellite data; COVID-19; Mining, Indian territory; MODIS","Aerosols; Air pollution; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Health risks; Losses; Optical properties; Radiometers; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollution abatement; Metropolitan cities; Mining operations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Preventive measures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; aerosol formation; COVID-19; health impact; health risk; medical geography; optical depth; public health; respiratory disease; viral disease; aerosol optical depth; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; coal mining; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact assessment; human; India; mining; optical depth; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; urban area; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; India; SARS coronavirus; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088113110

Incineration depicted a sustainable profile with improved results for global warming potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Regular gasification revealed the best results for eutrophication, acidification, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity potential. Two-stage plasma gasification showed negative values for all impact categories i.e. achieving environmental credits.

With data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), we spatially interpolated maternal exposures to total and speciated PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) over the 12-week preconception period and trimesters 1 and 2. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between pre-conception and pregnancy exposures to total and speciated PM2.5 and odds of GDM, adjusted for temperature and maternal covariates. We also evaluated confounding from NO2 and O3 exposures in multi-pollutant models. Results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in total PM2.5 exposure was associated with elevated odds for developing GDM over the preconception (adjusted OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.12), first trimester (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.17) and second trimester (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.17) periods. Effect estimates increased with adjustment for NO2 and O3. We observed modest increases in odds of GDM for IQR increases in first trimester ammonium ion PM2.5 (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) and sulfate PM2.5 (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) exposures, as well as preconception Cr PM2.5 exposures (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07). Conclusion: Exposures to PM2.5, before and during pregnancy were associated with elevated odds of GDM. Mitigating air pollution exposures may reduce the risk of GDM and its long-term implications for maternal and child health. © 2020","Air pollution; Gestational diabetes mellitus; Metals; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Particulate matter","ammonia; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfate; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; child health; cohort analysis; diabetes; environmental quality; maternal health; Neotropic Ecozone; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pregnancy; adult; air pollution; Article; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; female; first trimester pregnancy; human; live birth; major clinical study; maternal exposure; particulate matter; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; second trimester pregnancy; Texas; adverse event; air pollutant; analysis; child; particulate matter; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; toxicity; Harris County [Texas]; Texas; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088930325

Urban waterbody plays a multidimensional role in the well-being of the city by catering to its economical, ecological, and socio-cultural needs. It can offer a potential solution for urban heat attenuation, but its effect on outdoor thermal comfort is contentious in humid subtropical climate. This study investigates the thermal impact of waterbody on its surroundings in humid subtropical climate by adopting a human centric approach. Waterbody impact on ambient air temperature, PET, and UTCI are evaluated and compared for a better understanding of its thermal impact on nearby surroundings. This study employs a CFD-based simulation model Envi-met for microclimate analysis. The results show that a dynamic waterbody lowers the ambient air temperature during daytime in summer of its nearby surroundings in humid subtropical climate. Maximum cooling is observed in open mid-rise LCZ where the cooling impact range is 140 m with the amplitude of 2.59 °C and compact low-rise LCZ exhibits minimum cooling of the identified LCZs with the cooling impact ending 24 m from waterbody edge with amplitude being 0.131 °C in the study area. Air temperature, UTCI, and PET do reflect the same trend when moving away from the waterbody in large low-rise LCZ, but it decreases drastically in open mid-rise LCZ and is non-existent in compact low-rise. This result provides an insight on the impact of waterbody on thermal comfort in its surroundings in humid subtropical climate, thus assisting urban planners and designers in making context-specific holistic decision. © 2020, ISB.","CFD analysis; Thermal comfort indices; Urban heat stress; Urban waterbody","city; climate; human; India; microclimate; temperature; temperature sense; Cities; Climate; Humans; India; Microclimate; Temperature; Thermosensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089565662

Lately, the pneumonia was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At the end of January 2020, the infection spread all over Italy, but with high infection rates and mortality in the northern part, especially in Lombardy, the most industrialized and polluted region of the country. It is noteworthy that a strong association between severe viral respiratory disease and air pollution has been described. Air pollutant could be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and can be of natural origin (such as ash from a volcanic eruption) or released from motor vehicle depletes (carbon monoxide gas) or factories (sulfur dioxide). Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. Pulmunary diseases spread by means of small droplets in the breath, also called aerosols, and air pollution may facilitate the outside survival of viruses. We suppose that ash and gases emitted from the Mount Etna contributed to air pollution, potentially favouring the major contagion of COVID-19 in the eastern flank of the mountain, as in Catania city. In fact, ash and gases (with regard to radon) are usually particularly intense in winter, with a reduction of emission of specific metals with warmer weather. This is the first paper that elaborates the hypothesis of a potential role of volcanic gases and heavy metals-related air pollution, combined to specific climatic conditions and regional topography, in favouring severe COVID-19 diffusion in Sicily. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to support the hypothesis and plan the due prevention and awareness-raising campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"carbon monoxide; heavy metal; hydrochloric acid; hydrogen sulfide; sulfur dioxide; sulfuric acid; trace element; trace element; water; air pollution; Article; awareness; carbon footprint; China; climate change; combustion; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; health promotion; human; industrialization; infection prevention; mortality rate; particle size; particulate matter; pneumonia; seasonal variation; Sicily; social distance; topography; urbanization; volcanic ash; weather; adverse event; air pollutant; city; epidemiology; gas; Italy; soil; theoretical model; volcano; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Gases; Humans; Hydrochloric Acid; Hydrogen Sulfide; Italy; Metals, Heavy; Models, Theoretical; Sicily; Soil; Sulfuric Acids; Trace Elements; Volcanic Eruptions; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087288024

To eliminate the effects of interannual and seasonal meteorological variation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of emission abatement policies, we applied a boosted regression tree model to remove confounding meteorological factors. Results showed that the annual average PM2.5 concentration normalized by meteorology for the “2 + 26” region declined by 38% during 2014–2019 (i.e., from 96 to 60 μg/m3); however, the BTH region exhibited the most remarkable decrease in PM2.5 concentration (i.e., a 60% reduction). Certain seasonal trend in normalized PM2.5 level remained for four target subregions owing to the effects of anthropogenic emissions in autumn and winter. Although strong interannual variations of meteorological conditions were unfavorable for pollutant dispersion during the heating seasons of 2016–2018, the aggressive abatement policies were estimated to have contributed to reductions in normalized PM2.5 concentration of 19%, 10%, 19%, and 17% in the BTH, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi subregions, respectively.

The potential of Neoproterozoic exploration in other parts of the Yangtze Block remains a question. Defining the development and distribution rules of Neoproterozoic source and reservoir strata is an important reference for the next step of deep-zone oil and gas explorations in the Yangtze Block. Based on field surveys and sample collections, the analyses of many predecessor field sections and drilling logging data of the Neoproterozoic in the Yangtze Block, source-rock series tests and analyses, as well as analyses of reservoir thin sections, and the distribution rules of the source and reservoir strata were determined by industrial mapping methods. Three sets of source rocks are found in the Neoproterozoic in Yangtze Block, namely, the Datangpo Formation, Doushantuo Formation, and the third member of the Dengying Formation. From top to bottom, the thermal evolutions in the three sets of source rocks show an increasing trend, with the Dengying Formation reaching the stage of over-maturation, while that of Doushantuo and Datangpo formations enter thermal metamorphism stages. The source rocks of the Datangpo Formation are relatively limited in distribution, displaying a northeastward rift style, whereas those of the Doushantuo Formation are distributed widely with two thickness centers. The Neoproterozoic reservoirs in the Yangtze Block developed in the Dengying Formation, with the carbonate reservoir spaces mainly comprising caves, dissolved bores, or pores and cracks. The thickness center of the dolomite reservoirs in Dengying Formation are mainly located in the Middle and Upper Yangtze carbonate platform marginal zones, which are distributed in the eastern Sichuan Basin, and in the Mianyang–Changning rifting platform margin belts in the central Sichuan Basin and the northern Hubei areas.

Theoretical analysis shows that financial agglomeration can influence energy efficiency through scale economy effect, innovation driving effect, information spillover effect and structural adjustment effect. Dynamic spatial econometric results show that, from a national perspective, financial agglomeration has a positive impact on energy efficiency. However, from the perspective of different regions and different city sizes, it is found that financial agglomeration can have different effects on energy efficiency. Financial agglomeration has a significant positive impact on energy efficiency in eastern and central regions, megacities and big cities.

To date, the majority of research has focused on snapshots of ecosystem services, and their spatial–temporal variability has seldom been studied. Objectives: We aimed to address: (i) How is variability in ecosystem services partitioned among ‘space’ and ‘time’ components? (ii) Which ecosystem services are spatially/temporally coherent, and which are space–time incoherent? (iii) Are there consistent patterns in ecosystem service variability between urban- and rural-dominated landscapes? Methods: Biophysical modeling was used to quantify food, water, and biogeochemical-related services from 2011 to 2070 under future scenarios. Linear mixed-effects models and variance partitioning were used to analyze spatial and temporal variability. Results: Food production, water quality and flood regulation services were overall more variable than climate regulation and freshwater supply. ‘Space’ contributed to a majority of variations across most services, highlighting dominant importance of location-specific factors for service supply. Significant space–time interactions existed for water quality and soil carbon storage, indicating interactive effects between location- and time-specific factors. Variation in the relative controls of ‘space’ vs. ‘time’ factors between urban- and rural-dominated subwatersheds suggests that targeting different key drivers is needed for successful management of ecosystem services in urban vs. rural landscapes. Conclusions: Our research reveals relative importance of underlying ‘space’ and ‘time’ controls for diverse ecosystem services. Our study presents a framework to investigate spatial–temporal variability of ecosystem services, and provides theoretical and practical implications for anticipating and managing the dynamics of future ecosystem services at the watershed scale. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agricultural landscape; Biophysical modeling; Landscape sustainability; Scale; Spatial–temporal dynamics; Variance partitioning","agricultural land; ecosystem service; future prospect; regulatory framework; rural area; soil carbon; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085988871

However, the conversion mechanism between Ag and AgCl remains unclear as a result of the lack of appropriate electron microscopy evidence. Herein, systematic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the surface and cross-sectional views were carried out during the anodic formation and reduction of the AgCl layer. To avoid the thermal decomposition of AgCl and the destruction of the cross-sectional morphology, Ar ion polishing at −140 °C under the cooling of liquid N2 was adopted.

Research methods include analysis of experts' opinions on the introduction of solar and wind energy, and evaluation of the impact of RES on the development of energy system in Russia. The analysis of the practice of solar and wind energy development in other countries allows to conclude that this process goes through the certain stages. It stars with pilot projects, and then solar and wind energy generation partially replace traditional technologies. In some cases it leads to decreasing the reliability of energy systems. Findings: Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that all types of intermittent generation are appropriate to use in the energy system of Russia only as supplemental, until advanced development of energy storage technologies happens. At the same time, all types of managed renewable energy, both conventional and non-conventional, could positively contribute to the energy system taking into account economic and environmental feasibility. In addition, Russia has many reasons to diversify energy industry, including related to climate strategy and current economic course of the country.

Ventilation, shading and evaporative cooling are methods for controlling air temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouse. Ventilation and shading can be not sufficient to remove the excess heat, while evaporative cooling is based on the exploitation of huge amounts of water. In order to enhance the sustainability of the greenhouse industry, renewable energy sources can be exploited. Solar absorption systems can be used for greenhouse cooling in areas with high outdoor temperatures and solar radiation levels. These systems take advantage of the simultaneity between the solar energy availability and the greenhouse cooling demand allowing the reduction of conventional electricity and water consumption. They can be used in remote areas where conventional cooling is difficult and where there is abundant solar energy. This paper presents the results of the application of a solar cooling plant for climate control of a greenhouse. The system is sited at the University of Bari, Italy. The experimental plant consists of a Mediterranean greenhouse, having a surface of 300 m2 and by a single effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller fed by evacuated-tube solar collectors. The application of two different localized distribution of cold inside the greenhouse was studied in order to evaluate the reduction of air temperature close to the cultivation area.

In this paper, we evaluate a broad range of scenarios that achieve 4.3 GtCO2,eq/year GHG mitigation in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector by 2100. Scenarios include varying mixes of three GHG mitigation policies: second-generation biofuel production, dietary change and reforestation of pasture. We find that focusing mitigation on a single policy can lead to positive results for a single indicator of food security or biodiversity conservation, but with significant negative side effects on others. A balanced portfolio of all three mitigation policies, while not optimal for any single criterion, minimizes trade-offs by avoiding large negative effects on food security and biodiversity conservation. At the regional scale, the trade-off seen globally between biodiversity and food security is nuanced by different regional contexts. © 2020 The Author(s).

The air pollution in cities is higher than other places. The pollutants causing air pollution are Carbon monoxide (CO), Oxides of nitrogen (NOx), Ozone (O3), lead (Pb), Hydrocarbon (CH), benzene, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter. The major contribution to air pollution is vehicle exhaust in cities. In order to find out the pollution caused by vehicles a traffic survey was conducted at three locations, namely Kattankulathur bus stop, Potheri bus stop and Guduvanchery traffic signal. The type and number of vehicles were analyzed after the survey and the amount of pollutants emitted by them were found. A proper analysis of Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) was done. The Exceeding factor for each pollutant was calculated according to their respective location. The exceeding factor for Sulphur dioxide is medium, Nitrogen oxide is high and SPM is critical in all three locations.

By its nature, however, this option is limited only to paddy fields where farmers have sustained access to irrigation water. In addition, large amounts of rainfall often make it difficult to drain water from paddy fields. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the specific conditions and suitability of an area in which AWD is foreseen to be applied before its CH4 mitigation potential can be assessed in view of planning regional and national mitigation actions. In this study, we applied a methodology developed for assessing the climatic suitability of AWD to paddy fields in the central plain of Thailand in order to determine the potential spatial and temporal boundaries given by climatic and soil parameters that could impact on the applicability of AWD. Related to this, we also assessed the CH4 mitigation potential in the target provinces. Results showed that the entire area of the six target provinces was climatically suitable for AWD in both the major (wet) and second (dry) rice seasons. A sensitivity analysis accounting for uncertainties in soil percolation and suitability classification indicated that these settings did not affect the results of the suitability assessment, although they changed to some extent the distribution of moderate and high climatic suitability areas in the major rice season. Following the methodologies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines, we estimated that the AWD scenario could reduce annual CH4 emissions by 32% compared with the emissions in the baseline (continuously flooded) scenario. The potential of AWD for annual CH4 emission reduction was estimated to be 57,600 t CH4 year−1, equivalent to 1.61 Mt CO2-eq year−1, in the target provinces. However, we recognize the possibility that other parameters not included in our current approach may significantly influence the suitability of AWD and thus propose areas for further improvement derived from these limitations. All in all, our results will be instrumental in guiding practitioners at all levels involved in water management for rice cultivation. © Copyright © 2020 Prangbang, Yagi, Aunario, Sander, Wassmann, Jäkel, Buddaboon, Chidthaisong and Towprayoon.","alternate wetting and drying; GIS; low-emission farming; methane emissions; mitigation measures; rice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096061515

With the current focus on climate change mitigation, emissions reduction has also come to the forefront of this discussion. Retrofitting is an option to improve the energy and emissions performance of buildings. However, in the residential building stock, retrofit planning for existing buildings faces many complexities due to variations in climatic conditions and macro-environment as well as the presence of multiple stakeholder groups. Thus, in identifying solutions, it is necessary to take a holistic perspective that covers these different dimensions. In this paper, commonly used building energy retrofits were evaluated through a life cycle thinking approach. The performance of various retrofit options applicable for single family detached housing were evaluated using the HOT2000 energy simulation software package under the varying climatic conditions and energy supply scenarios across Canada. The retrofits were evaluated in terms of the additional investment, energy use and cost reduction achieved over the life cycle, and life cycle emissions reduction.

Three typical sites with different landscapes and topsoil profiles were chosen for the field study. Field work consisted of pit development and soil sample collection for laboratory study using the centrifuge method. Soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by the RETC code using the observed values of volumetric water content vs. pressure head. HYDRUS-1D code was used to estimate groundwater recharge based on a 70-year (1945–2015) meteorological dataset with daily resolution (including values of precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, and humidity). This dataset was preprocessed using our SURFBAL code to calculate the surface and topsoil water and energy balance. Retrospective historical simulation results showed that there was a considerable variation in the mean annual groundwater recharge values (49–104 mm/year) for the three studied profiles. The temporal change in groundwater recharge occurred relatively synchronously at all sites and was governed by the change in the current annual aridity index. The results of this historical simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30–40 years. To predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century, the LARSWG forecast weather generator with the climate projections of the 5th General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) family was used. On average in the case of climate development under the maximum greenhouse gas emissions RCP8.5 scenario, there will be a reduction in groundwater recharge in the studied region in 2060–2080, caused by two factors: change of aridity index, which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season and the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Black soil; Climate change; General Circulation Models; Historical simulation; Projected simulation; Recharge","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Recharging (underground waters); Soil surveys; Soils; Weather forecasting; Wind; Climate variability; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; General circulation model; Ground water recharge; Historical simulation; Laboratory studies; Soil hydraulic parameters; Volumetric water content; Climate change; climate change; evapotranspiration; greenhouse gas; groundwater; hydrological modeling; infiltration; parameter estimation; recharge; simulation; soil profile; soil type; spatiotemporal analysis; topsoil; water content; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087505890

Alteration to the urban micro-climate due to global climate change impacts may also exacerbate the situation in future. Sustainable urban stormwater management using low impact development (LID) techniques, along with conventional urban stormwater management systems, can be implemented to mitigate climate-change-induced flood impacts. In this study, the effectiveness of LIDs in the mitigation of urban flood are analyzed to identify their limitations. Further research on the success of these techniques in urban flood mitigation planning is also recommended. The results revealed that LIDs can be an efficient method for mitigating urban flood impacts. Most of the LID methods developed so far, however, are found to be effective only for small flood peaks. They also often fail due to non-optimization of the site-specific and time-varying climatic conditions. Major challenges include identification of the best LID practices for the region of interest, efficiency improvements in technical areas, and site-specific optimization of LID parameters. Improvements in these areas will allow better mitigation of climate-change-induced urban floods in a cost-effective manner and will also assist in the achievement of sustainable development goals for cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Low impact development; Stormwater management; Urban floods","Cost effectiveness; Engineering geology; Flood control; Floods; Image segmentation; Storm sewers; Storms; Urban planning; Climatic conditions; Efficiency improvement; Global climate change impact; Issues and challenges; Low impact development; Region of interest; Short durations; Urban stormwater management; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087711342

However, in spite of the European Union's ambition to involve local communities for co-driving the low-carbon energy transition, there is no comprehensive analysis quantifying citizens' potential to co-finance and participate in community renewable energy initiatives across Europe. We address this knowledge gap through a representative choice experiment survey that collected responses from 16,235 participants to different hypothetical investment options on renewable energy schemes across all European Union Member States, and estimate the social potential of European citizens to participate and invest in community-administered wind farms. Results from a novel survey-based social simulation indicate that €176 billion could be obtained from citizen-led finance in community-administered wind farm developments, enough to halve the investment gap to achieve a 32% renewable energy share in final energy consumption by 2030.

There is no unified infrastructure for RW utilization in the far North of Russia.

We compare alternative policies with an upper-bound base scenario, in which people use their own cars for their sole use. Most of these scenarios are based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, while others serve to underlie our reflections on the feasibility of using minimal spanning trees to solve the problem. The zone selected to illustrate this study is the coastal area of Espinho, a city in Portugal.

Among the different directives of IMO, currently especially the sulphur emission regulations pose challenges for the shipping industry. Related to this are the established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and the introduced global sulphur cap. To comply with the sulphur restrictions, according to the present technological state of the art, ship-owners have three options for their existing fleet: the installation of emission abatement technologies, the switch to low sulphur fuels, or retrofitting for the usage of alternative fuels. Regardless which option is favoured, most often selected solutions still depend on fossil fuels. The reasons for this can be traced back to the fact that supply of biofuels is not ensured in ports and generally seen as no profitable solution. This paper develops and examines an innovative business model with a special focus on liquefied biogas (LBG). The study bases on collected qualitative and quantitative data, which was used by applying the Business Model Canvas. The results will highlight that the business model bears the potential to promote LBG supply.

Vietnam's energy development strategy determines to build some renewable energy centers, of which Ninh Thuan is the first province designated to become a national renewable energy center. This is based on Ninh Thuan's endowment as a province having the largest renewable energy potential in Vietnam. Development of a large renewable energy center allows power system planners to overcome the mismatch in timescales associated with developing transmission power grid and renewable energy generation. Besides, renewable energy center can facilitate a significant pipeline of large-scale renewable energy and storage projects. However, Ninh Thuan province is far away from the major load centers of Vietnam so the calculation and analysis of economic indicators need to be studied. This paper will present the results of the analysis of economic indicators of major renewable electricity sources in Ninh Thuan (onshore wind power, offshore wind power, solar power) to provide scientific arguments for developing a renewable energy center in Vietnam. Also the paper addresses the problem of the large-scale penetration of renewable energy into the power system of Vietnam. The proposed approach presents the optimization of operational decisions in different power generation technologies as a Markov decision process. It uses a stochastic base model that optimizes a deterministic lookahead model. The first model applies the stochastic search to optimize the operation of power sources. The second model captures hourly variations of renewable energy over a year. The approach helps to find the optimal generation configuration under different market conditions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Economic analysis; Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Markov processes; Offshore oil well production; Offshore power plants; Planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Wind power; Fossil energy sources; Markov Decision Processes; Operational decisions; Power generation technology; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy potentials; Renewable energy source; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097643397

We evaluate the diversity of response of rice varieties to a reduction of radiation during grain filling stage yield and yield components were measured in field experiments (two consecutive years). Shade during grain filling significantly reduced grain yield, spikelet fertility and 1000-grain weight in both experiments (dry and wet season). Phenotypic plasticity (GxE) was only observed in both experiments for spikelet filling and 1000-grain weight, suggesting differential genotypic response for these traits under low radiation. Two tolerant genotypes VANDANA and NORUNKAN and three susceptible genotypes SWARNA, ZALCHA and RAY NABJA were selected from the field experiments and studied under controlled growth chamber conditions for low radiation tolerance during the vegetative stage. Shade increased the maximum photosynthesis (Amax) for VANDANA, suggesting a shade adapted behavior maximizing carbon gain under low radiation. However; NORUNKAN showed high Amax and the lowest light compensation point (LCP) and respiration under control and shade conditions suggesting a double strategy to maintain carbon (maximize gain and reduce carbon loss under low radiation conditions). This study demonstrates that targeting photosynthetic traits to maximize carbon gain and reduce carbon loss under low radiation conditions is a strategy that should be explored to increase rice tolerance to low radiation conditions during grain filling stage. © 2020 IEEE.","grain filling; low radiation tolerance; shade","Carbon; Grain (agricultural product); Radiation; Carbon loss; Field experiment; Filling stage; Grain filling; Grain weights; Low radiation; Low radiation tolerance; Radiation condition; Radiation tolerances; Shade; Filling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115933990

The very creation and evolution of human civilizations depended on living along shorelines, serving as the source of food, water, and security. However, fear of water is just as deeply grained and cross-cultural as love of water. The unpredictable river and ocean landscapes have been domesticated along history with a special impact on ecosystems since the industrial era. Newcastle's waterfront, including the Hunter river estuary and the ocean shoreline are unique landscapes, which have been strongly modified due to land reclamation leading to the destruction of such a vulnerable ecosystem. As a consequence, city resilience is under threat due to the effects of unpredictable events, dynamics, forces of climate change, amplified without the natural protection of these water ecosystems. The methodology to present this research includes two primary steps. The first step was the creation of a data and map database to study the historic and current conditions, combined with future predictions, on urban, environmental, and flooding conditions in the Newcastle waterfront areas. All predictions are to identify and catalogue the worst scenarios in the event of a dramatic climate change evolution. The second step, which is still under development and contingent on funding, is the compilation of urban and architectonic adaptative strategies and evidence-based design guidelines that can be implemented and integrated with other environmental, urban and social sustainable strategies. The ultimate result will be a data and map catalogue linked with a set of design principles, strategies, and guidelines aligned with sustainable and achievable goals, to ensure coastal and riverbank adaptation and mitigation. The strategies will not only improve resilience, reduce vulnerability and risk, but enhance liveability in urbanised delta throughout an interdisciplinary approach, and also to ensure a more sustainable future. The problem of dynamic forces acting in estuary cities and its conflict with human habitation needs to be faced in an interdisciplinary manner, integrating different perspectives and approaches that consider current capacities, past events, and future predictions. The results of this project aim to meet those goals and is one step to help achieve a sustainable future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Estuaries; Forecasting; Hydrogeology; Land reclamation; Maps; Sustainable development; Current capacity; Design Principles; Evidence-based designs; Future predictions; Human civilization; Human habitation; Sustainable strategies; Vulnerable ecosystems; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097226978

We aimed to determine if an alkalinized lidocaine solution is more effective than lidocaine only. Methods: Patients of both genders aged 18 or above enlisted for intradetrusor BoNTA injection (idiopathic, neurogenic, and bladder pain syndrome) were included in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial after obtaining their informed consent. All participants filled a bladder diary and a urine culture was performed. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to Protocol A (20 ml 2% lidocaine + 10 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate) or Protocol B (20 ml 2% lidocaine + 10 ml 0.9% saline solution). A Numeric Rating Scale (0–10) was used to assess the level of pain immediately after the procedure (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included pain after 1 h, urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention, and hematuria related to the procedure. Results: A total of 116 patients were randomized. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, indication, and bladder diary parameters) of patients in Group A and B were similar. Pain scores at the end of the procedure were significantly lower with the alkalinized solution (Protocol A and B, respectively, 2.37 ± 0.31 vs. 4.44 ± 0.36, p <.01). No differences were observed 1 h after treatment (Protocol A and B, respectively, 0.54 ± 0.17 vs. 0.69 ± 0.19, p =.487). The only adverse event reported was mild-to-moderate self-limited hematuria in 15.4% of patients. Conclusions: The use of an alkalinized lidocaine solution has proven to be significantly superior to lidocaine only as local anesthesia before intradetrusor BoNTA injection, suggesting that this may be considered a first-line option. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","administration, intravesical; anesthesia, local; botulinum toxins, type A; double-blind method; lidocaine; randomized controlled trial; sodium bicarbonate; urinary bladder, overactive","alkalinizing agent; bicarbonate; botulinum toxin A; lidocaine; sodium chloride; botulinum toxin A; lidocaine; local anesthetic agent; urinary tract agent; aged; Article; controlled study; cystalgia; demography; double blind procedure; drug tolerability; female; hematuria; human; idiopathic disease; major clinical study; male; neurologic disease; numeric rating scale; patient satisfaction; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; urinary tract infection; urine culture; urine retention; adult; intravesical drug administration; middle aged; neurogenic bladder; pain; pain measurement; very elderly; Administration, Intravesical; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anesthetics, Local; Botulinum Toxins, Type A; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Lidocaine; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pain Measurement; Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic; Urological Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091148503

PCDD/F is mainly produced during combustion and incineration processes. This review focuses on the formation, measurement, and control of dioxins in municipal solid waste incineration. Typical PCDD/F emission concentrations and air pollutant control devices are introduced in the work. The formation mechanisms of PCDD/F are divided into homogeneous synthesis and heterogeneous synthesis, and some previous reviews and the latest work are introduced. Considering the complexity, high cost, and time lag of traditional offline detection methods based on high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, fast and indirect measurement techniques have been recently developed, among which resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a good option. The study of online/at-line in situ measurements and the correlation between PCDD/F and the indicator are reviewed in detail. Due to the strict policies regarding pollutants' emissions, state-of-the-art remediation technologies are used to reduce dioxin formation and emission from incineration.

Natural gas (NG) is a fuel that enables mariners to meet regulations; however, emissions data from maritime operations with natural gas is limited. We measured emissions of criteria, toxic and greenhouse pollutants from a dual-fuel marine engine running either on diesel fuel or NG as well as engine activity and analyzed the impacts on pollutants, health, and climate change. Results showed that particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), nitric oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were reduced by about 93%, 97%, 92%, and 18%, respectively when switching from diesel to NG. Reductions of this magnitude provide a valuable tool for the many port communities struggling with meeting air quality standards. While these pollutants were reduced, formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) increased several-fold. A health risk assessment of exhaust plume focused on when the vessel was stationary, and at-berth showed the diesel plume increased long-term health risk and the NG plume increased short-term health risk. An analysis of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and BC was performed and revealed that, on a hundred year basis, the whole fuel cycle global warming potential (GWP) per kWh including well-to-tank and exhaust was 50% to few times higher than that of diesel at lower engine loads, but that it was similar at 75% load and lower at higher loads. Mitigation strategies for further reducing pollutants from NG exhaust are discussed and showed potential for reducing short-term health risks and climate impacts. © 2020","Air pollution; Climate change; Health effects; Natural gas; Ship emissions","Air quality; Air quality standards; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Environmental regulations; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Health; Health risks; Marine pollution; Natural gas; Nitric oxide; Quality control; Risk assessment; Air quality impacts; Comprehensive analysis; Global warming potential; Lower emissions; Maritime operation; Mitigation strategy; Particulate Matter; Port communities; Gas fuel analysis; black carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; formaldehyde; methane; natural gas; nitric oxide; gasoline; natural gas; air quality; black carbon; carbon dioxide; climate effect; diesel; emission; environmental policy; global warming; health risk; natural gas; nitric oxide; particulate matter; risk assessment; vessel; air pollution control; air quality; Article; climate change; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; health hazard; human; particulate matter; plume; risk assessment; ship; air pollutant; air pollution; exhaust gas; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Gasoline; Natural Gas; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089469318

By combining 1.5D reactor modelling with flowsheet simulation of a complete full-scale cogeneration plant, this study assesses the applicability and potential of an advanced CO2 capture technology, namely chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU), for CO2 capture from a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant generating electricity, district heat (DH) at 75–90 °C supply and 45 °C return temperatures, and process steam at 10 and 4.5 bar(a) pressures. Nordic wood (50% wet-basis moisture) is used as fuel. The key performance indicators of the CLOU-integrated CHP plant were quantified and compared with those of a non-CCS reference plant. Part-load operation at reduced DH loads was considered. At 100% fuel load, the CLOU plant captured 99.0% of the CO2 from the combustion of biomass and still achieved a net efficiency of 80.1%LHV, a value very close to that of the reference plant without CO2 capture or flue gas condensation (81.1%LHV). Depending on the fuel load, the specific negative CO2 emissions from the CLOU plant ranged from 439 to 504 kgCO2/MWh. © 2020 The Author(s)","Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; Chemical looping combustion; Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling; Combined heat and power; Process integration; Simulation","Benchmarking; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fuels; Oxygen supply; Steam power plants; Chemical looping combustion; Combined heat and power; Emission technology; Flow sheet simulation; Key performance indicators; Part load operation; Process integration; Reactor modelling; Cogeneration plants; bioenergy; biomass power; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; cogeneration; combined heat and power; combustion; energy efficiency; high temperature; oxygen; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089381252

Challenges that have arisen with the adoption of NT include soil compaction, weed management, and stratification of organic matter and nutrients. As an attempt to overcome these challenges, occasional tillage (OT) has been used as a soil management practice in NT systems. However, little is known about the impacts of OT on agronomic and environmental factors. For this reason, the objectives of this meta-analysis were: 1) to summarize the effects of OT on crop productivity, soil physical, chemical and biological properties, soil erosion and weed control; 2) to discuss the main aspects of NT management to optimize the use of OT; 3) to point out shortcomings in the diagnosis of soil compaction in NT systems, which may lead to erroneous decision-making processes regarding the use of OT. Overall, OT did not affect crops yields, although increased crop yields were observed in regions under water restriction and in soils with low retention capacity and water availability; OT improved soil physical properties (penetration resistance, soil bulk density, macroporosity, and total porosity), with persistence, generally, greater than 24 months, and decreased the soil aggregates stability; total organic carbon was reduced, particularly when plow/harrow was used and NT was already consolidated, and there was no effect on pH and available P; OT increased microbial biomass carbon, but had no effect on total microbial activity; soil erosion was reduced due to increased soil-water infiltration and reduced runoff, and finally, weed management was also improved by OT. It is suggested that suitable NT implementation and management, with the correct application of NT principles, will overcome problems associated with NT. As soil compaction is the main justification for the use of OT, methods of diagnosis and monitoring of soil compaction should be improved to assist in decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chiseling; Conservation agriculture; One-time tillage; Strategic tillage; Subsoiling","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Chemical analysis; Compaction; Crops; Erosion; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Weed control; Chemical and biologicals; Decision making process; Environmental factors; Microbial biomass carbon; Penetration resistances; Soil management practices; Soil physical property; Total Organic Carbon; Decision making; organic carbon; water; agronomy; compaction; crop yield; environmental factor; farming system; management practice; meta-analysis; organic matter; soil management; soil nutrient; weed control; zero tillage; Article; bulk density; crop production; environmental decision making; harvest; microbial biomass; no tillage; nonhuman; occasional tillage; physical chemistry; porosity; priority journal; runoff; soil acidity; soil compaction; soil erosion; soil infiltration; tillage; total organic carbon; water availability; water deprivation; weed control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088392052

However, it has few limitations such as low N2 adsorption, selectivity (competitive HER reactions), low yield rate etc. Since it is at the early stage, tremendous efforts have been devoted in understanding the reaction mechanism and screening of the electrocatalysts and electrolytes. In this review, the electrocatalysts are classified based on the periodic table with heat maps of Faraday efficiency and yield rate of NH3 in NRR and their electrocatalytic properties toward NRR are discussed. Also, the activity of each element is discussed and short tables and concise graphs are provided to enable the researchers to understand recent progress on each element.

Solutions are being sought to support Polish, medium-sized cities, that is, cities with about 140,000 inhabitants, to implement and develop low-carbon energy in their public transport systems. This paper proposes and explores a sustainable urban development card for a Polish city, namely, Zielona Góra, the use of which will enable the effects of a public transport system using low-carbon energy to be monitored. This research was based on the two main areas of analysis of a system of low-carbon energy and public transport and were formulated as: (1) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and (2) Indicators of the Satisfaction Rate of Public Transport Passengers (SPTP). This paper used literature studies to determine SDGs as well a questionnaire-cum-survey, which was conducted on a sample of 1022 public transport passengers in Zielona Góra, Poland, to determine SPTP. The results were verified by a real case study of a Polish city, which, in 2019, had the largest fleet of electric buses in Poland; a statistical analysis was also conducted using correlation coefficients. It was determined that the proposed approach allows for low carbon energy public transport to be constantly monitored and analyzed. In the long run, this could be a good benchmark as to how cities might improve their level of sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet levels of oil production and consumption remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry volatility and public opposition – rather than state regulations – that have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state climate goals. As California pursues a goal of ‘managing the decline’ of domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including: a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects; a 2,500 ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such changes – particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the growing problem of well decommissioning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","California; Climate change; Enhanced oil extraction; Environmental justice; Just transition",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089456486

Trees provide shade; absorb and store atmospheric carbon and other pollutants; reduce local temperature fluctuations; provide essential inner-city fauna habitat; assist in reducing over-land stormwater flow; provide amenity; and provide many more social, environmental, and economic benefits. To secure these benefits, tree canopy cover targets are commonly employed by land managers; however, such targets are rarely quantified against the characteristics and limitations of individual urban centers. Through the generation and interrogation of qualitative and quantitative data, this case study of Perth, Western Australia presents a new conceptual tool that integrates eleven factors found to influence the capacity and opportunity for a city to support urban tree canopy cover. This tool is designed to capture and causally weigh urban tree canopy considerations based on individual city characteristics, collective values, and identifiable constraints. The output of the tool provides an “optimum” tree canopy cover result (as a percentage of the urban fabric) to better inform canopy cover targets and recommendations for urban tree strategic planning and management. This tool is valuable for urban land managers, city planners, urban designers, and communities in effective planning, management, valuation, and investment regarding urban trees as a sub-set of urban green infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors.","Green infrastructure; Nature-based solutions; Urban forest management; Urban greening; Urban resilience","Atmospheric movements; Economics; Forestry; Investments; Managers; Atmospheric carbon; Effective planning; Green infrastructure; Perth , Western Australia; Quantitative data; Real world constraints; Tree canopy covers; Urban tree canopies; Trees (mathematics); canopy; forest cover; forest management; strategic approach; urban development; urban forestry; urban planning; Coverings; Economics; Forestry; Land; Management; Planning; Restraints; Trees; Australia; Perth [Western Australia]; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094183665

This may result in higher fruit sugar concentrations at harvest and/or earlier compressed harvests and changes in the synchrony of sugar with other fruit metabolites. One adaptation strategy that growers may use to maintain typicity of wine style is to change cultivars. This approach may enable fruit to develop under temperature conditions similar to those typically associated with that wine style. We demonstrate that Grapevine Flowering Véraison (GFV) and the Grapevine Sugar Ripeness (GSR) models can be implemented as a means of testing the suitability of alternative cultivars as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Previous viticulture temperature-based models were reviewed and compared with the GFV and GSR models. The results from the original GFV and GSR models were combined to evaluate the classification of the 20 most represented cultivars. The GFV and GSR models were tested for three new historic and contrasting datasets: 31 cultivars in the VitAdapt collection, Bordeaux; Chardonnay, Champagne; and Sauvignon blanc, Marlborough. Errors of predictions were less than a week for flowering and véraison, and within 7-10 days for the time to reach relevant target sugar concentrations for these datasets. Future GFV and GSR projections for Chardonnay resulted in an advance at a rate of one to two days per decade for flowering and véraison, and two to five days per decade for time to 170 g/L sugar concentration for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 respectively. Therefore, the GFV and GSR models are highly accurate and easy-to-use temperature-based phenological models for predicting flowering, véraison and time to target sugar concentrations when tested under new conditions. The models can be applied for characterising new cultivars, and assessing thermal time to flowering, véraison and different sugar targets. They can be used to assess cultivar performance in winegrowing areas worldwide under current or future climate conditions. The classifications therefore enable growers and researchers to compare the phenology of cultivars in a region today and to consider adaptation options: selecting later ripening cultivars or choosing alternative sites in the context of climate change. © 2020 Vigne et Vin Publications Internationales.

In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

Implementation of renewable energy sources in buildings to reduce their energy consumption and thus the fossil fuel consumption is a priority measure to reduce energy bill costs and greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Although the initial cost of purchasing and installing renewable energy systems remains high, the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of these systems are negligible. This study aimed to analyse the integration of renewable energy sources in the building sector, namely the solar air heating system (SAHS), to assess the techno-economic-environmental performance of this system on reducing building energy consumption, economic benefits, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The paper analyses the annual efficiency of the SAHS integration into the building envelope, in a temperate-continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Finally, the proposed SAHS system was evaluated against the natural gas boiler heating system. The results of the financial analysis showed that the simple payback period of SAHS investment will recover in a period between 14 years to 5 years when the subsidies granted by the state are between 0% and 50%. The SAHS proposed here is economically feasible for the weather conditions and the building geographical orientation analysed and system implementation is a good solution to reduce buildings’ energy consumption by using renewable energy. The results show that the implementation of SAHS efficiently reduces, depending on weather conditions, the dependence on fossil fuels by reducing the thermal energy need to heat the building by a minimum of 15.53% in 2011 and a maximum of 24, 68% in 2007. Installing SAHS on the building wall, it will reduce the building heat loss through the wall, achieving a lost heat recovery at a rate ranging between 9.8% and 12.51%. Besides the economic benefits, the paper also highlights the environmental benefits of reducing CO2 emissions. Thus, the use of this system will reduce yearly CO2 emissions, depending on weather conditions, between 38 t CO2/year (2014) and 44 t CO2/year (2007). © 2020 The Author(s)","Air thermal insulation; Building energy efficiency; Economic analysis; Environmental analysis; Renewable energy; Solar air heating system; Solar energy","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Meteorology; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar buildings; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Waste heat; Building energy consumption; Environmental performance; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Integration of renewable energies; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Solar air heating system; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096853114

These measures reduce energy consumption in buildings, save resources and money and at the same time reduce pollution and CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, as the severity of the climate increases. The paper describes the analytical method used to analyse the one-dimensional, steady-state heat transfer through homogeneous walls and composite walls of buildings (wall structure may contain different construction materials, air spaces, insulation, etc.). The web application allows users to analyse one-dimensional and steady-state heat transfer through the building walls and calculate the heat flux density, total heat flux, overall heat transfer coefficient of the building wall, thermal resistance, temperature profile through the wall, the specific thermal resistances and the temperatures at the interface between wall layers. The user can analyse the one-dimensional, steady-state heat transfer through homogeneous and multilayer walls of buildings, being able to analyse a wall composed of a single layer, or one with a maximum of seven layers. The application allows the user, after defining the cross section's geometry, materials properties, and boundary conditions, to determine the optimal insulation thickness, depending on its placement, on the inner or outer wall surface. © 2020 The Authors","Building envelopes; Energy efficiency; Heat transfer; Overall heat transfer coefficient; Thermal insulation; Thermal resistances; Web application","Building materials; Composite structures; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat flux; Heat resistance; Heat transfer; Insulation; Interface states; Multilayers; Analytical method; Heat flux densities; Insulation thickness; Overall heat transfer coefficient; Reduce energy consumption; Steady-state heat transfer; Temperature profiles; Through the wall; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096831085

Besides timber products from harvests, forests offer multiple nontimber and intrinsic benefits, which could be important sources of income for landowners. In summer 2019, we organized four region-specific educational workshops all across North Carolina to educate landowners, Extension agents, and natural resource professionals about these alternative forest-based income streams. In this article, we cover the topics included in those workshops, postworkshop evaluation, and lessons learned from those events, which provide useful insights for Extension and outreach professionals in program design and delivery in forest-based payments for ecosystem service markets. Study Implications: This article presents the details of a program, postworkshop evaluation, and lessons learned, which serve as useful guidelines for Extension and outreach educators in designing and delivering similar programs in forest-based alternative income streams. Although markets for ecosystem services are improving worldwide along with increasing research and outreach efforts in forest-based intrinsic benefits, results from evaluation surveys suggest that attendees had limited knowledge in forest carbon markets, wetland mitigation banking, and conservation easements in North Carolina. More region-specific Extension and outreach programs highlighting the locally available nontimber market options are recommended all across the country. Similarly, partnerships with other state agencies and institutions in program planning, advertisement, and delivery would improve effectiveness of similar Extension and outreach programs. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The array consists of about 60 tracking detectors, sparse on Italian territory and at CERN. The MRPCs are flowed with a gas mixture based on C2H2F4 and SF6, both of which are fluorinated greenhouse gases with a high environmental impact on the atmosphere. Due to the restrictions imposed by the European Union, these gases are being phased out of production and their cost is largely increasing. The EEE Collaboration started a campaign to reduce the gas emission from its array with the aim of containing costs and decreasing the experiment global warming impact. One method is to reduce the gas rate in each EEE detector. Another is to develop a gas recirculation system, whose prototype has been installed at one of the EEE stations located at CERN. Jointly a parallel strategy is focused on searching for environmental friendly gas mixtures which are able to substitute the standard mixture without affecting the MRPC performance.

Understanding whether the ongoing increase in temperatures and changes in precipitation regimes in the Himalayan region can stimulate or limit tree growth is of particular importance to predict the local treeline dynamics. Location: Altitudinal treeline (~4000 m a.s.l.) in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park (Central Himalaya, Eastern Nepal). Methods: We assessed the relationships between ring widths and monthly precipitations and mean temperatures, and analysed cellulose stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) and their derived C discrimination (Δ13C), and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) in Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis at the Himalayan treeline. Results: Growth of A. spectabilis strongly depended on summer temperatures, whereas that of B. utilis on spring precipitation. δ13C and iWUE increased with time in both species, especially in A. spectabilis. The long-term decrease in Δ13C was accompanied by an increase in δ18O in both species, thus suggesting an increase in photosynthetic efficiency rather than a stronger stomatal control of transpiration. Conclusions: Climate change is progressively reducing the physiological limitations due to low temperatures and low spring precipitations at the Central Himalayan treeline, thus potentially facilitating a further altitudinal forest advance. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","Abies spectabilis; Betula utilis; climate change; stable isotopes; tree growth; treeline","climate change; climate effect; monsoon; seasonality; treeline; Himalayas; Khumbu Himal; Mount Everest; Nepal; Abies spectabilis; Betula utilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090064303

Ecological theories based on the economics of trading partnership predict that nutrient enrichment would suppress AMF. Experimental results from nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions, however, were highly variable, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show distinct AMF responses to soil N:P stoichiometry manipulations via gradients of long-term N and P additions in a Mongolian steppe. A complementary experiment with an acid addition gradient was designed to help tease apart the effect of N-induced acidification from N nutrient. AMF root colonization and extraradical fungal biomass progressively decreased along the P gradient under two distinct host plant species, suggesting a carbon (C)-P tradeoff. In contrast, low to moderate N inputs increased both AMF parameters, corresponding to the increasing N:P ratio. Yet, high N inputs reduced AMF colonization and biomass, and the magnitudes of N-led inhibition were similar to those under acid additions that induced comparable changes in soil pH. Structural equation modeling further showed that while soil N:P stoichiometry primarily controlled the effect of P addition on AMF, N-induced soil acidity overtook the N:P stoichiometry under high N inputs and dominated the effects of reactive N on AMF. In addition, AMF community composition in roots was more dependent on host plants and unresponsive to changes in soil nutrients. We further proposed a comprehensive framework that integrates biological and geochemical effects of reactive N and P inputs on AMF. Together, these results indicate that while the C-P tradeoff controls P suppression of AMF, N-induced acidification dominates the N inhibition. Our findings suggest that incorporation of geochemical impacts of N and P inputs would facilitate modeling efforts to project mycorrhizal impact on plant interactions and soil C balance under future nutrient enrichment scenarios. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; extraradical hyphae; Mongolian steppe; N and P enrichment; root colonization; soil N:P","acidification; arbuscular mycorrhiza; fertilizer application; fungus; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; root colonization; soil nutrient; Mongolia; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091165516

There has been burgeoning research on the technical aspects of ZCBs. However, the aspect of stakeholder engagement, albeit imperative for zero carbon development, has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper examines stakeholder knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with regard to ZCBs in a systems manner, employing a new KAP model that integrates ontology, axiology and epistemology as the theoretical lens. The research was carried out through a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions with multiple stakeholders in the building industry in Hong Kong, which is a typical example of a high-density city. The results indicate the generally ambiguous and inconsistent knowledge, relatively negative attitude, and poor practice of stakeholders towards ZCBs. The statistical analysis findings reveal that differentiation exists between different stakeholder groups as to their knowledge, and this highlights the significant role that explicit ZCB knowledge plays in creating a knowledge-induced attitude that favours changes in practice leading to zero carbon developments. The applicability of the developed KAP model is verified using the case of Hong Kong, enabling the dialectics and complexities of stakeholder KAP towards ZCBs to be further clarified. Practical implications are provided to enhance the knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the practices of building towards zero carbon in future cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Energy efficiency; Hong Kong; Stakeholder; Sustainable practice; Zero carbon building","Climate change; Construction industry; Emission control; Surveys; Building industry; High-density cities; Innovative strategies; Low-carbon societies; Multiple stakeholders; Questionnaire surveys; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder groups; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088092940

Moreover, the inhalation of particulate can be more harmful with decreasing particles diameter. Vegetation can provide many ecosystem services to the citizens, including the removal of many different pollutants in the air, but while the effect on many gaseous compounds has already been widely proved, the capability of particulate matter (PM) sequestration driven by vegetation and its resulting benefit on air quality has not been deeply investigated yet at larger spatial scale, especially in Mediterranean environment. This study was conducted in the Real Bosco di Capodimonte, a green area of about 125 ha located inside the urban area of Naples (Italy) containing different species typical of the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. To better understand the interaction between PM and the park area, we measured fluxes of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 with a fast acquisition analyser, according to the Eddy Covariance technique.

Climate adaptation strategies are therefore needed, since mitigation strategies alone are not sufficient to avoid serious impacts of climate change. However, adaptation to climate change is not straightforward, as it is highly influenced by diverse and conflicting interests as well as epistemological (or scientific) uncertainties. Therefore, a minimum requirement for its success is the active participation of stakeholders and citizens in the adaptation policy cycle. This paper presents a case study on a participatory process involving civil servants from different municipalities in Malaysia, in Southeast Asia, with a view to considering the optimal level of engagement that is required for climate adaptation planning. The exercise consisted of a Focus Group session, where participants were asked to discuss the level of stakeholder and citizen participation that should be adopted within the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative. Contrary to authors' expectations, the participants tended to suggest medium to high levels of participation in the planning process. During the dialogues, a walking activity through the city, aimed at identifying hotspots of climate risks and defined as “safety walks”, was one of the ideas proposed as a high-potential participatory method, spreading in the adaptation framework. Safety walks could complement climate modelling and enhance the robustness of climate risk assessments. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Focus groups; Global Covenant of Mayors (GCoM); Stakeholder and citizen participation","climate change; climate modeling; environmental planning; participatory approach; risk assessment; stakeholder; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088946615

This work develops an instrument concept with the aim to maximise sensitivity to pulsed fusion neutron fields and, using a data-rejection algorithm combined with backwards extrapolation, enable neutron fluence estimates to be made over a large dynamic range. Through high-fidelity modelling of residual temporal emissions, and a parameterised approach, we study the sensitivity to neutrons of a plastic scintillator–Ag foil layer detector concept. For an optimal design we apply paralysable and non-paralysable deadtime models to the predicted response to D–D fusion neutron fields at various neutron field intensities. In high neutron fluence irradiation scenarios, where deadtime effects are strongly evident, we use our approach to make estimates of the fluence from instrument response data. We discuss the practical applications of such diagnostics used for plasma focus (PF) fusion experiments, such as at the PF-1000U facility in IPPLM, Poland, inertial confinement fusion and pulsed tokamak experiments, for example at MAST-U, where such diagnostics could complement fission counter-based neutron diagnostics in the future.

Simultaneously, in some countries heating is based on the burning of biomass in individual stoves, which can be considered renewable but results in both inefficient heating and high contamination. In such countries, air pollution or decontamination is a more urgent problem. This paper presents the application of a methodology to analyse how district heating could be used as an important technology for coordinated decontamination and decarbonisation purposes looking towards 2050, based on an energy system analysis using hourly simulations, and using data based on spatial analysis to be able to explicitly include a Chile-specific cost for district heating.

Since climatic conditions could be different among locations, we need to record the phenology of forest plants growing under various climate types. Here, we report seasonal changes in leaf abundance of deciduous trees during a 13-year period in the Sambe Forest of Shimane University located in northern Chugoku mountain range, western Japan (35°9′N, 132°37′–40′E, 300–628 m above sea level [asl]). Northern Chugoku mountain range is situated in the west end of Japan Sea side climate. Our study would provide the first record of tree phenology in this region. We examined eight species belonging to eight genera common in a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest in western Japan. Habitats of native trees ranged from canopy to understory in the forest and pioneers in an open site. Some of trees were exceptionally planted in an arboretum in the Sambe Forest. Leaf types included single leaf (i.e., Carpinus tschonoskii, Swida macrophylla, etc.) and pinnate leaves (i.e., Aesculus turbinata and Phellodendron amurense). We observed changes in the relative leaf abundance caused by budburst, leaf expansion and leaf shedding of the fixed shoots of targeted trees during 3-day to 3-week intervals from March to December each year from 2004 to 2016. Over the 13-year period, we used a digital camera to take photographs of the shoots that were processed to estimate the leaf abundance. Our data was obtained from common tree species that have a wide habitat range and are distributed nationwide. Therefore, comparison of our data with those data in other climate types may significantly contribute to understand the effect of climate change across Japan on forest plants.

However, the rising levels of pollutant emissions hamper air quality, hence, affecting health outcomes. Previous studies have assessed the case-by-case effect of ambient air pollution on mortality and morbidity, however, the impact on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and welfare cost have not been investigated entirely. Here, we conduct an empirical analysis of the 28-Year trend to analyze the nexus between ambient particulate matter and ozone, mortality, DALYs, and welfare cost across 195 countries and territories by employing novel dynamic panel estimation methods. We find that none of the 195 countries and territories studied between 1990 and 2017 meet WHO guideline for air quality, thus, mitigating ambient air pollution is at risk.

Among the countries (China, the US, Russia, India, Germany and Japan) with the highest welfare cost of premature death associated with the exposure to outdoor PM2.5 and ozone, China is the most vulnerable to economic burden – spending US$1.58 trillion (constant 2010) in 2017.

To achieve a carbon-neutral energy cycle, advanced carbon sequestration technologies are urgently needed, but because CO2 is a thermodynamically stable molecule with the highest carbon valence state of +4, this process faces many challenges. In recent years, electrochemical CO2 reduction has become a promising approach to fix and convert CO2 into high-value-added fuels and chemical feedstock. However, the large-scale commercial use of electrochemical CO2 reduction systems is hindered by poor electrocatalyst activity, large overpotential, low energy conversion efficiency, and product selectivity in reducing CO2. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rationally design highly efficient, stable, and scalable electrocatalysts to alleviate these problems. This minireview also aims to classify heterogeneous nanostructured electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CDRR). © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","activity; electrocatalysis; electrochemical CO2 reduction; nanostructured catalysts; selectivity","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Global warming; Reduction; Carbon sequestration; Chemical feedstocks; Clean energy sources; Electrocatalytic; Energy shortages; Nanostructured electrocatalysts; Product selectivities; Thermodynamically stable; Conversion efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091014901

Climate change is expected to increase cryoturbation in these polar deserts, including frost boils and diapirs. Diapirism—cryoturbic intrusion into the overlying horizon—creates subsurface nutrient patches with low biodegradability and is thought to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including the potent nitrous oxide. Although nitrous oxide emissions have been observed in polar deserts at a rate comparable to vegetated tundra ecosystems, the underlying mechanism by which nitrous oxide is produced in these environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated ammonia-oxidizing archaea, which were detected in a previous study, and used stable isotope techniques to characterize the pattern of nitrous oxide emissions from frost boils. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea would be tightly linked to nitrous oxide emissions under aerobic condition whereas low degradable diapiric nutrient would limit denitirification under wet conditions. We hypothesized that (1) diapirism (i.e. diapiric frost boil) would not primarily drive nitrous oxide emissions and therefore abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea would be linked to the increase in nitrous oxide emissions under dry conditions favouring nitrification, and (2) diapirism decreases nitrous oxide emissions relative to non-diapiric frost boil under wet conditions that favour denitrification because of the recalcitrant nature of diapiric organic carbon. We used soil samples collected from two High Arctic polar deserts (dolomite and granite) near Alexandra Fjord (78°51′N, 75°54′W), Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada from July–august 2013. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea did not differ in abundance between diapiric and non-diapiric frost boils within the dolomitic desert; however, within the granitic desert amoA abundance was 22% higher in diapiric frost boils. In both deserts, the increased abundance of archaeal amoA genes was linked to increased nitrous oxide emissions under dry conditions. Under higher soil moisture conditions favouring denitrification, diapiric frost boils emit N2O with higher probability, but at a lower rate, than non-diapiric frost boils. For example, in the dolomitic desert, diaprism increased the probability of N2O emissions by 104% but decreased the LS mean value of the emission rate by 36%. Similarly, diapirism increased the emission probability by 26% but decreased the LS mean value by 68% within the granitic desert. Under wet conditions, site preference values suggested that fungal and bacterial denitrification were important nitrous oxide emission processes. Our study shows that diapirism is a key cryoturbation process for nitrous oxide emissions in polar deserts primarily through diapirism's alteration of emission probability and the magnitude of the emissions. © 2020","Cryoturbation (frost boils and diapirism); Feedbacks to climate change; Nitrous oxide emissions; Permafrost degradation; Polar desert","Ammonia; Arid regions; Biodegradability; Climate change; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Landforms; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Probability; Soil moisture; Aerobic condition; Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Emission probabilities; Emission rates; Moisture conditions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Site preferences; Stable isotopes; Gas emissions; ammonia; cryoturbation; denitrification; diapirism; frost; frozen ground; nitrogen oxides; nitrous oxide; polar region; soil emission; soil moisture; stable isotope; tundra; Alexandra Fiord; Arctic; Canada; Ellesmere Island; Nunavut; Queen Elizabeth Islands; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090576801

A feature of symmetrical electrodes is their stability to reduction–oxidation (redox) cycling, which can be useful in the case of carbon or sulphur deposition on a fuel electrode. The results of studies of a double-layer symmetrical electrode, where the functional layer consist of 50 wt.% Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ + 50 wt.% Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-δ and the collector is Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ are presented for the first time. It was shown that the introduction of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-δ into the electrode functional layer, as well as the use of the current layer, does not lead to a change in the mechanism of oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions. An analysis of the fuel cell impedance spectra by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method and comparison of the DRT functions with the results of the analysis of symmetric cells made it possible to conclude that during redox cycling the resistance of the oxygen exchange stage increases. It has been suggested that the cause of this is the formation of iron under reducing conditions, followed by its oxidation to oxide in an oxidizing atmosphere. © 2020","Distribution of relaxation times; Double–layer electrode; Redox cycling; Solid oxide fuel cell; Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ; Symmetrical electrode","Cerium compounds; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Iron compounds; Molybdenum compounds; Oxidation; Oxygen; Samarium compounds; Strontium compounds; Electrochemical applications; Functional layer; Hydrogen oxidation reaction; Oxidizing atmosphere; Oxygen Reduction; Reducing conditions; Sulphur deposition; Symmetrical electrodes; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090348104

The mechanism of dioxin action requires an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), but the downstream mechanisms are not yet precisely clear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of all available transcriptome datasets taken from human cell cultures exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Differentially expressed genes from different experiments overlapped partially, but there were a number of those genes that were systematically affected by TCDD. Some of them have been linked to toxic dioxin effects, but we also identified other attractive targets. Among the genes that were affected by TCDD, there are functionally related gene groups that suggest an interplay between retinoic acid, AhR, and Wnt signaling pathways. Next, we analyzed the upstream regions of differentially expressed genes and identified potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites overrepresented in the genes responding to TCDD. Intriguingly, the dioxin-responsive element (DRE), the binding site of AhR, was not overrepresented as much as other cis-elements were. Bioinformatics analysis of the AhR binding profile unveils potential cooperation of AhR with E2F2, CTCFL, and ZBT14 TFs in the dioxin response. We discuss the potential implication of these predictions for further dioxin studies. © 2020 by the authors.

We apply an environmentally extended economic model for Danish municipalities known as the Local “INterregional” Economic (LINE) model, together with a multi-regional input-output model for the world economy (EXIOBASE v3.4). We find that Denmark's Capital region accounts for 41% (28 MtCO2e) and 31% (27 MtCO2e) of Denmark's production and consumption-based emissions respectively. By disaggregating regional emissions into industry and product categories, we provide relevant information to producers and consumers in each region concerning areas where the most significant differences towards reducing their carbon footprint can be realised. Mobility, services, food and shelter were the main drivers of emissions in all Danish regions. The Central, North and South Denmark accounted for more than half (9.56 MtCO2e) of Denmark's food production emissions. The Capital region was the largest source of emissions (3.79 MtCO2e) related to food consumption. We suggest that dietary changes towards less red meat and dairy products can potentially reduce regional food-related emissions of Danish households. Our results indicate that modest changes in consumer lifestyles are pivotal for local climate mitigation policies, especially in Denmark's biggest cities, Copenhagen, Århus, Aalborg and Odense. © 2020","Consumption-Based Emissions; LINE; Local Climate Policy; Multi-Regional Input-Output Model; Production-Based Emissions","Rhus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087920740

They are a key part of the communication process, shaping peoples’ attitudes and policy preferences on climate change. Images which have come to dominate visual portrayals of climate change (and conversely, those that are marginalised or excluded) influence how we interact with climate change in our everyday lives. This paper presents the first in-depth, cross-cultural and longitudinal study of climate change visual discourse. It examines over a thousand images associated with articles about climate change in UK and US newspapers between 2001 and 2009, a pivotal decade for climate change engagement. Content, frame and iconographic analyses reveal a remarkably consistent visual discourse in the UK and US newspapers. The longitudinal analysis shows how the visual representation of climate changed mid-decade. Before 2005, a distancing frame was common. Imagery of polar landscapes acted as a visual synecdoche for distant climate risk. After 2005, there was a rapid increase in visual coverage, an increase in use of the contested visual frame, alongside an increase in climate cartoons, protest imagery and visual synecdoches. These synecdoches began to be subverted and parodied, particularly in the right-leaning press. These results illustrate the rise of climate change scepticism during the mid-2000s. This study has implications for public engagement with climate change. It shows that the contested and distancing visual frames are deeply and historically embedded in the meaning-making of climate change.

This study, therefore characterized and quantified artisanal refineries’ gaseous emissions for possible air pollutants based on various unit operations involved and evaluated their impacts. It measured the emissions directly from source using E8500 Portable Combustion Analyzer. It also categorized oven sizes/processing capacity of the refineries into various ranges in order to estimate emissions according to processing capacity. The result revealed that; pollutants emission varied significantly between the unit operations and increased with increase in processing capacity. When the emissions were compared with daily limits set by the Environmental Guidelines and Standard for Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN) 2002, the emissions (CO, NOx, and SO2) breached the available set limits. While with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), 1991 set limits for emissions from stationary source; HC and CO breached their limits. SO2 and H2S breached their lower limits but were below the upper limit, while NOx emissions were found within its set limit. The study concluded that, Nigeria Artisanal Petroleum Refineries are sources of air pollution, as they impact the host environment. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollutants; Air quality; Artisanal refineries; Atmosphere modelling; Characterisation; Chemical engineering; Crude oil; Environmental chemical engineering; Environmental chemistry; Environmental hazard; Environmental pollution; Environmental science; Niger-Delta",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097382288

Afghanistan, a South Asian country, is affected by climate change, extreme weather events and losses accompanying its poor adaptation status. Therefore, the present study intends to evaluate the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers based on primary data collected through pre-tested questionnaire from 260 households distributed in 26 villages across both plain and mountain regions of Yangi Qala district, Afghanistan. The questionnaire contained questions about the general household information and farm-level adaptation strategies by smallholders. Logistic regression models were applied to four major adaptation strategies practiced by the farmers in form of scientific techniques applied during crop cultivation; cultivation of drought-resistant varieties; cultivation of new crop and migration of family members with household characteristics for each region considered separately as well as jointly. The results confirmed that household characteristics like house type, LPG usage, livestock population, irrigated land area, education, secondary profession and male population determined the strategies to abate climate risks by the peasant smallholders of the region. The study highlights the need to identify the in-situ barriers and enablers of adaptation to facilitate an expanded uptake of adaptation practices by smallholders. Therefore, the government must employ policies addressing the challenges by applying a community-inclusive approach for climate adaptation in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Climate Impact; Coping strategies; Farm adjustment; Migration","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Developing countries; Drought; Logistic regression; Surveys; Adaptation strategies; Crop cultivation; Extreme weather events; Farm-level adaptation; Least-developed countries; Logistic regression models; Mountain regions; Smallholder farmers; Climate change; adaptation; adaptive management; climate change; cultivation; government; poverty; smallholder; strategic approach; Afghanistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089076946

Nowadays, the industry is seeking for environmentally friendly alternatives to power supply those facilities, such as by means of marine renewable energy. Motivated by economic and environmental aspects, this paper addresses the value proposition and investigates the feasibility of implementing combined wave and solar systems for power supplying offshore oil and gas platforms. Three locations where relevant offshore petroleum activities are currently ongoing were selected as case studies and a reference oil and gas platform was assumed. At each case study location, four wave energy converters and one photovoltaic technology were analysed for three scenarios: wave power only, solar power only and both resources combined. The methodology applied, generalizable to other regions with petroleum activities and relevant wave and solar energy resources, consists in scaling the wave energy converters to match wave climate at site, maximizing their energy production, followed by an economic feasibility analysis. Results show that for all sites the combination of both renewable resources increases electricity production, reduces the intra-annual variability of energy production and intermittency issues, increases capacity factors up to 24% and consequently avoids overdesign. The obtained levelized cost of energy is in the range 131–263 €/MWh and the reduction in emissions was estimated at circa 281,915 ton/year at each site, which demonstrates the feasibility and interest of providing electricity from these combined systems to offshore oil and gas platforms. The proposed solution provides benefits that could lead to further decreases in the levelized cost of energy, enabling the entrance to new markets for both wave and solar energy, while facilitating the transition to a more sustainable energy mix. Hence, the further technology development is advocated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Co-location of renewable energy systems; Intra-annual variability; Levelized cost of energy; Marine renewable energy; Reduction in emissions; Scaling of wave energy converters","Drilling platforms; Electric power systems; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Green manufacturing; Marine industry; Offshore oil well production; Offshore power plants; Petroleum analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Wave power; Economic feasibility analysis; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Intra-annual variability; Marine renewable energy; Offshore oil and gas platforms; Photovoltaic technology; Technology development; Wave energy converters; Wave energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089554823

The rising quantity of these distributed energy resources (DER) and their fluctuating energy production makes it challenging for the grid operators to manage the grids. This in turn leads to an increase in retail electricity prices due to the rising grid fee. Local electricity markets (LEMs) have proven to be an effective and efficient tool to manage the local generated electricity and ensure that electricity is traded and consumed close to its point of production. The market design factors influencing the performance of an LEM are analysed using a decentralized autonomous area agent (D3A) simulation framework. The market design factors investigated are prosumers-to-consumers ratio (nPC), pricing scenarios and bidding strategies. The results were compared using performance indicators such as self sufficiency, share of individual savings (SIS) of the participants, share of market savings (SMS) and average buying rate. The simulation results show that the performance of an LEM on addition of new participant depends upon the type of participants added to the market. Furthermore, using intelligent bidding strategy like Q-learning increases the self sufficiency of the local community close to their threshold value without the addition of flexibility or storage options. © 2020 IEEE.","Bid; Bidding strategy; Energy trading; Intelligent agent; Trading agent","Costs; Earth atmosphere; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Bidding strategy; Commercial building; Distributed energy resource; Electricity prices; Fluctuating energy; Performance indicators; Simulation framework; Simulation-based analysis; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100849652

The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion.

Achieving this goal requires increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) such as solar and wind power. The gradual shrinking of conventional generation units in an energy map introduces new challenges to the stability of power systems as there is a considerable reduction of stored rotational energy in the synchronous generators (SGs) and the capability to control their power output, which has been taken for granted until today. Inertia and primary reserve reduction have a substantial effect on the ability of the power system to maintain its security and self-resilience during contingency events. Such issues become more evident in the case of non-interconnected islands (NII) as they have unique features associated with their small size and low inertia. The present study examines in depth the NII system of Madeira, which is composed of thermal, hydro, solid-waste, wind and solar generation units, and additional RES integration is planned for the near future. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are performed for both the current and future states of the system, including the installation of planned variable RES capacities. To alleviate the stability issues that occurred in the high-RES scenario, the introduction of a utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS), capable of mitigating the active power imbalance due to the power system’s disturbances resultant of RES penetration, is examined. In addition, a comparison between a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) and BESS is shortly investigated. The grid has been modeled and simulated utilizing the open-source, object-oriented modeling language Modelica. The dynamic simulation results proved that battery storage is a promising technology that can be a solution for transitioning to a sustainable power system, maintaining its self-resilience under severe disturbances such as rapid load changes, the tripping of generation units and short-circuits. © 2020 by the authors.

Knowing that m-Si's price is relatively higher than that of p-Si, the latter can further be considered as the most appropriate technology to the hot semi-arid climate of Safi region. Thereafter, the amount of CO2 emissions that could be avoided can reach 9.69 tons per year. Outcomes also indicate that grid connected PV plants are feasible in the hot semi-arid climate of Safi region for electricity generation and may contribute to the future energy mix of the country. © 2020 The Authors","Hot semi-arid climate; Performance parameters; PV system; Weather data","Amorphous silicon; Photovoltaic cells; Silicon; Appropriate technologies; Electricity generation; Environmental benefits; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Performance analysis; Performance parameters; Performance ratio; Semi-arid climate; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096826135

Background and Objectives: There is an urgent need to conserve genetic resources and to support resilience of conifer species facing expected changes and threats. Seed sourcing strategies have been proposed to maximize the future adaptation and resilience of our forests. However, these proposals are yet to be tested, especially in long-lived organisms as forest trees, due to methodological constraints. In addition, some methods rely on the transfer of material from populations matching the future conditions of the sites. However, at the rear edge of the species, some specific problems (high fragmentation, high genetic differentiation, role of genetic drift) challenge the theoretical expectations of some of these methods. Materials and Methods: We used a Scots pine multi-site provenance test, consisting of seventeen provenances covering the distribution range of the species in Spain tested in five representative sites. We measured height, diameter and survival at 5, 10 and 15 years after planting. We simulated populations of 50 trees by bootstrapping material of the provenance test after removing the intra-site environmental effects, simulating different seed sourcing strategies. Results: We found that local and predictive methods behaved better than methods based on the selection of future climate-matching strategies (predictive-climate and climate-adjusted) and those combining several seed sources (composite and admixture seed sourcing strategies). Conclusions: Despite the theoretical expectations, for Scots pine, a forest tree species at its rear edge of its distribution, seed-sourcing methods based on climate matching or a combination of seed sources do not perform better than traditional local or predictive methods or they are not feasible because of the lack of future climate-matching populations. © 2020 by the authors.

This study employs an integrated global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling approach to quantify the impacts on land-use change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and socioeconomic indicators, when reducing biomass conversion costs for global biochemical production by 1.5% annually until 2050. Global demand for crop- and forest-based feedstock by the chemical industry increases sharply in 2050, e.g. by 327% for wheat; driving up agro-food prices, e.g. by 3.5% for oilseeds and 3.9% for sugarcane in Brazil. Chemical output decreases in countries that rely on imported biomass for biochemical production, such as Germany, France or the United States; while it increases, for instance, in Brazil and Australia, which use mainly domestic feedstock. Increased biomass demand entails significant natural forest cover loss across South America and Asia, and, to a lesser extent, in North America. Subsequent GHG emissions from global losses in carbon stocks outweigh GHG savings from reduced fossil fuel consumption, resulting in a net increase in GHGs of 107 Mt in 2050 relative to the baseline.

Three ichnofabrics can be defined based on the ichnotaxonomy, ichnodiversities, individual abundances and overall bioturbation indices. The Balanoglossites ichnofabric represented medium to relatively high-energy sedimentary environments such as intertidal zone and subtidal shoals in the carbonate platform. The Planolites ichnofabric suggested relatively low-energy, protected sedimentary environments such as lagoons in a restricted carbonate platform, but also occurs in the deeper-water depressions in the open carbonate platform. The Chondrites ichnofabric characterized low-energy and reduced oxygen conditions, with burrows penetrating below a shallow redox interface in deeper-water settings that include the distal slope as well as local depressions in the open carbonate platform. Our analysis suggests that the modifications of petrophysical parameters are controlled or influenced by the ichnofabric characteristics (burrow architecture, burrow cross-cutting relationship, degree of bioturbation and burrow connectivity), the permeability contrast between burrow-fills and matrix, and the dolomitization of burrow-fills. The micritic host sediments have negligible porosity and permeability. The bioturbated sediments have significant differences in fabric, texture, porosity and permeability. The burrow-fills are very commonly dolomitised. Each of the burrow-types can enhance reservoir properties, but the greatest differences are associated with the Balanoglossites ichnofabric, in which porosity and permeability can reach over 2% and 70 mD. Preliminary stratigraphic studies indicate that reservoir potential in the subsurface will be linked to an understanding of the distribution of shoal and intertidal facies as well as their associated Balanoglossites ichnofabrics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioturbation; Carbonate reservoir analogue; Ichnofabric; Ordovician; Sedimentary environment","Carbonation; Low permeability reservoirs; Petrophysics; Porosity; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy; Textures; Carbonate platforms; Carbonate reservoir; Permeability contrasts; Petrophysical parameters; Petrophysical properties; Reservoir potential; Reservoir property; Sedimentary environment; Petroleum reservoir engineering; bioturbation; carbonate platform; carbonate rock; hydrocarbon reservoir; ichnofabric; Ordovician; physical property; sedimentary structure; trace fossil; China; Henan; Chondrites; Planolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096219867

For offshore CO2 storage, it is necessary to monitor concentrations associated with CO2 in seawater to ensure safe storage. To do so, it is also necessary to know the baseline concentrations in the target seas. However, such concentrations have large regional and seasonal variations, mainly because of biological activity. In this study, we compared various indicators of CO2 dissolved in seawater, using the seawater off Tomakomai, Japan, observed between 2013 and 2018. Among the indicators, we found very strong correlations between [nDIC + kDO] and T and between [DIC − 0.5TA + kDO] and T. These indicators are thought to be effective for investigating the possibility of unexpected leakage of CO2 stored in sub-seabed geological formations. However, data always contain a degree of scattering, even when their correlation is very high. In the case of the seawater off Tomakomai, the data that exceeded a criteria based on the residual standard deviation of some indicators were not necessarily the same as those of the other indicators. Therefore, it is suggested that two or more, different types of indicators should be used, such as pCO2-[DO saturation] and [nDIC + kDO]-T or [DIC − 0.5TA + kDO]-T. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkalinity; CO2 concentration in seawater; CO2 leakage; DIC; DO; Offshore storage of CO2","Bioactivity; Carbon capture; Coal storage; Digital storage; Offshore oil well production; Seawater; Base-line concentrations; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Coal power plants; Geological formation; Large amounts; Seasonal variation; Standard deviation; Strong correlation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; comparative study; concentration (composition); marine pollution; pollution monitoring; seasonal variation; seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090706558

O3 is sensitive to atmospheric conditions, but its modulations by changing synoptic systems and climate are unclear, especially in mountain-basin areas such as the Sichuan Basin (SCB). This study examines the impacts of typical synoptic systems and their secular changes on O3 pollution and its health risks in mountain-basin areas, by taking SCB as an example. Seven dominant synoptic patterns are identified and three typical synoptic patterns with high- (low-) pressure are associated with high (low) O3 concentrations over entire SCB, while the pattern with uniform-pressure is accompanied by heavy (light) pollution in western (eastern) SCB. Under the synoptic patterns with high-pressure, clear weather with fewer clouds, strong solar radiation, weak convection, and hot and dry atmosphere enhances the photochemical reactions of O3 precursors and weakens the vertical mixing of O3 and its precursors, thus favoring heavy O3 pollution and posing higher health risks; whereas, the synoptic patterns with low-pressure induce the opposite changes in O3 concentration and health risks. The uniform-pressure pattern is accompanied by district spatial variations of O3 via favoring O3-related physical and chemical processes in eastern SCB and inhibiting that in the west. Under climatic changes, increasing synoptic pattern with high-pressure and decreasing synoptic pattern with low-pressure over SCB significantly increased O3 concentration and the resultant health risks over the past 40 years. Our findings provide scientific evidence from synoptic and climatic views for forecasting O3 and its health risks and for mitigating O3 pollution in mountain-basin areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climatic changes; Health risks; Ozone pollution; Sichuan Basin; Synoptic patterns","Emission control; Health; Health risks; Landforms; Modulation; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Atmospheric conditions; Chemical process; Climatic changes; Emission reduction; Scientific evidence; Spatial variations; Synoptic systems; Uniform pressure; Air pollution; ozone; atmospheric pollution; climate change; climate conditions; health risk; mountain region; ozone; pollution exposure; public health; spatial variation; air quality; Article; atmosphere; cardiovascular mortality; chemical reaction; circadian rhythm; climate change; cloud; health hazard; human; humidity; meteorology; pollution; priority journal; solar radiation; weather; China; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089512975

Moreover, lactic acid addition promoted the relative abundance of Lactobacillales, while the microbial community of the blank was dominated by Bacillales.

However, studies have questioned the potential of NT soils to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields. No-till experiments are relatively recent (&lt;50 years) and very few studies were able to assess SOC dynamics in high-yield agroecosystems. We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to predict long-term SOC (0–30 cm) using datasets from two experiments assessing tillage and nitrogen (N) sources in a Mollisol from the midwest United States (28 years) and tillage and crop rotations in an Oxisol from southern Brazil (33 years). The conversion of prairie and grassland soils to conventional agriculture decreased SOC by 61 and 12% in the Mollisol and Oxisol, respectively. Soil organic C accrual in NT soils was &gt;0.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1 under medium-low-yield maize in the Mollisol and negligible in the Oxisol under soybean/wheat rotation. Organic fertilization and crop rotation increased SOC accrual at both sites. Simulated SOC had good agreement with observations for NT soils but overestimated SOC in tilled soils. The model's parameters were then modified for tilled soils. Long-term simulations (100 years) revealed that SOC accrual in NT soils (0–15 cm) is partially offset by losses at 15–30 cm under low C inputs. Simulations with best crop management practices (BP; irrigation, high-yield cultivars, higher plant density and improved N fertilization) augmented C inputs and SOC stocks, ultimately recovering SOC to the levels of prairie soils. Our results suggest that the adoption of NT, recycling of organic fertilizers and the use of BP should be further promoted for recovery and permanence of SOC in agricultural soils. Highlights: Studies have questioned the potential of conservation agriculture (CA) to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields. We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to simulate SOC dynamics in temperate and subtropical soils. No-till under moderate C/N inputs recovered topsoil SOC, but subsurface losses offset SOC accrual. Use of CA, organic amendments and best practice crop management (BP) is crucial for long-term SOC storage and permanence. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","best crop management practices; conservation agriculture; modelling; soil organic matter","agricultural ecosystem; carbon sequestration; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; high yielding variety; model; organic carbon; Oxisol; soil carbon; Brazil; United States; Embryophyta; Glycine max; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079057206

Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency.

Moreover, proper understanding of flood risks and their potential impacts on climate change appears to be a communication challenge. In climate change communication, the effect of framing congruency on perception of risk, efficacy and behavioural intentions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation has received limited attention. Messages have not been congruent in framing risks associated with climate change. We define congruency as the coherent alignment of several aspects of message content. Messages are considered congruent when they provide recipients with consistent contents such as giving concrete and actionable advice, or by providing more abstract and general background information. This research focuses on climate change communication in fostering mitigation behaviours among adolescents in vulnerable locations in the global South. Based on Construal Level Theory, this paper investigates how message congruency affects the link between perceptions of climate change risk and efficacy and two predictors of behavioural change: perceived responsibility and mitigation intentions. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of congruent vs. incongruent risk communication among adolescents in highly vulnerable coastal communities in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (N = 348). Multiple regression analysis found strong effects of congruency in message framing; when messages were congruent in the content, communicative interventions changed adolescents’ perceptions and attitudes toward climate change mitigation more consistently. This research contributes both theoretically and practically to risk communication among adolescents and toward climate change mitigation behaviour. © 2020 by the authors.

A trend analysis to investigate the rainfall pattern can detect changes over temporal and spatial scales for a rainfall series. In this study, trend analysis using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator was conducted in the Kelantan River Basin, Malaysia. The Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test was applied to evaluate the stationarity of the rainfall series. This basin annually faces onslaughts of varying year-end flooding conditions. The trend analysis was applied for monthly, seasonal and yearly rainfall series between 1989 and 2018. The temporal analysis results showed that both increasing and decreasing trends were detected for all rainfall series. The spatial analysis results indicated that the northern region of the Kelantan River Basin showed an increasing trend, whilst the southwest region showed a decreasing trend. It was found that almost all the rainfall series were stationary except at two rainfall stations during the Inter Monsoon 1, Inter Monsoon 2 and yearly rainfall series.

Researchers have used hydrological models integrated with climate models in order to predict the streamflow behaviour in different hydrographic basins. This work aimed to analyse future climate scenarios for the Ribeirão do Lobo River Basin, located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The stochastic generator PGECLIMA_R was used in the simulation of climate data, which were used as input data in the hydrological model SMAP, after it was calibrated and validated for the study site. In all, five future scenarios were generated, with scenarios A, B, C and D projected based on the 5th report of the IPCC and scenario E based on the trend of climate data in the region. Among the scenarios generated, scenario D, which considers an increase of 4.8 °C in air temperature and a reduction of 10% in rainfall, is responsible for the worst water condition in the basin and can reduce up to 72.41% of the average flow and up to 55.50%, 54.18% and 38.17% of the low flow parameters Q90%, Q95% and Q7,10, respectively, until the end of the twenty-first century. However, the E scenario also becomes a matter of concern, since it was responsible for greater increases in temperature and greater reductions in rainfall and, consequently, more drastic monthly reductions in streamflow, which may negatively impact water resources and affect the various uses of water in the Ribeirão do Lobo River Basin. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Streamflow","Climate models; Rain; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Air temperature; Future climate scenarios; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological models; Hydrological simulations; Southeastern Brazil; Water availability; Water conditions; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; downscaling; hydrological response; streamflow; watershed; Article; Brazil; climate change; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; hydrography; hydrology; mathematical computing; mathematical model; stream (river); validation study; water availability; water flow; water supply; watershed; Brazil; hydrology; theoretical model; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Brazil; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092621344

The objective of the current study was to determine the magnitude of soybean yield and yield gaps (Yg) in the main producing regions in Iran, the main causes and possible solutions to reduce these gaps and improve yields. This study uses an integrated approach of crop simulation and on-farm information. The SSM-iCrop2 model was used to calculate the potential yield (Yp). Furthermore, management information of soybean farms (the number of monitored farms was 224) was collected and analysed with two methods, including stepwise regression (a production model was created and based on it, the yield-limiting factors were determined) and boundary line analysis (show the optimum level of crop management and simultaneously the percentage of farms that were out of the optimal range of a specific management procedure). The results showed a Yp of 4681 kg/ha while actual yield (Ya) was around 2257 kg/ha. The main factors causing Yg of soybean in Iran were irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus fertilizer and sowing date. Altering soybean sowing date to late June or early July, irrigating at least five times during the growing season, applying at least 50 kg/ha nitrogen and 45 kg/ha phosphorus base application are foremost management practices that could shrink the soybean yield gap in Iran. The results presented in this study can bring relevant transferable information to other soybean production areas sharing the same latitudes and climate, and the approach can be used for other crops worldwide. &copy; 2021 The Author(s).

It is shown that for the territories of the Russian Arctic with isolated energy supply, the development of energy-efficient systems and renewable energy will reduce climate risks for sustainable growth. Not only of this power sector but the whole economic complex of the region due to both their better adaptation to the effects of climate change and the reduction of technogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which are one of the main factors of these changes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Adaptation to climate changes; Complex infrastructures; Energy efficient systems; Energy infrastructures; Energy transportation; Global climate change impact; Global climate changes; Socio-economic effects; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097523268

This paper takes a cultural lens to the topic of climate change, in which climate-relevant understandings are grounded in wider cultural, political and material contexts. We approach climate-relevant accounts at the level of the everyday, understood as a theoretically problematic and politically contested space This is in contrast to simply being the backdrop to mundane, repetitive actions contributing to environmental degradation and the site of mitigative actions. Taking discourse as a form of practice in which fragments of cultural knowledge are drawn on to construct our environmental problems, we investigate citizens’ accounts of climate-relevant issues in three culturally diverse emerging economies: Brazil, South Africa and China. These settings are important because greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are predicted to significantly increase in these countries in the future. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a range of citizens in each country using a narrative approach to contextualise climate-relevant issues as part of people’s lifestyle narratives. Participants overwhelmingly framed their accounts in the context of locally-salient issues, and few accounts explicitly referred to the phenomenon of climate change. Instead, elements of climate changes were conflated with other environmental issues and related to a wide range of cultural assumptions that influenced understandings and implied particular ways of responding to environmental problems. We conclude that climate change scholars should address locally relevant understandings and develop dialogues that can wider meanings that construct climate-relevant issues in vernacular ways at the local level. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Cultural knowledge; Emerging economies; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Semi structured interviews; South Africa; Climate change; climate change; emission; environmental degradation; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; lifestyle; participatory approach; public attitude; Brazil; China; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069628772

Naser reviews the range of solutions offered to address climate-related mobility problems, such as extending the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, adopting an additional protocol to the UNFCCC or creating a new international treaty to support those facing climate-related migration and displacement problems. He examines the accumulating stock of international policies and initiatives relevant to climate-related mobility using a framework of six policy areas: human rights, refugees, climate change, disaster risk reduction, migration,and sustainable development. He uses this framework to define and summarise the main UN actions and milestones on climate-related mobility. Despite the difficult context affecting the global community of worsening climate change impacts and human rights under threat, Naser asserts that the foundations of global consensus on climate-related mobility have been built, particularly in the last decade.

Therefore, to improve agricultural sustainability and crop productivity the farming system needs to be modified in the region. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of maize–alfalfa intercropping on the physiological characteristics, nitrogen (N) uptake and yield of the maize crops in northeast China in 2017–2018. The study findings showed that intercropping under N fertilization progressively improved the physio-agronomic indices of the maize crop as compared to mono-cropping. The grain yield, 100 seed weight and biomass dry matter of maize crop improved in intercropping when it was practiced with N fertilizer. Furthermore, intercropping with N fertilization increased the chlorophyll content of the maize crop at bell-mouthed, silking, filing and mature stages by 19%, 44%, 12%, and 9% in 2017 and by 23%, 43%, 15%, and 11% in 2018, respectively, as compared with the monocropping system. Unlike monocropping, intercropping with N fertilization increased the photosynthesis rate (14% and 15%), stomatal conductance (74% and 98%) and transpiration rate (74% and 75%) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, intercropping reduced intercellular CO2 (Ci). Moreover, intercropping with N fertilization increased the maize N content of grain and leaves as well as total N uptake by 49%, 31% and 93% in 2017 and 53%, 34% and 132%, respectively, in 2018 as compared to monocropping. In conclusion, our results suggest that maize–alfalfa intercropping with optimal N fertilization provides a practical method for improving growth, yield and N accumulation in the maize crop. © 2020 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","chlorophyll content; intracellular CO2; photosynthetic activity; stomatal conductance; transpiration rate","agricultural development; alfalfa; alternative agriculture; crop yield; intercropping; maize; photosynthesis; physiological response; sustainability; China; Medicago sativa; Zea mays; fertilizer; nitrogen; alfalfa; China; crop production; growth, development and aging; maize; metabolism; procedures; China; Crop Production; Fertilizers; Medicago sativa; Nitrogen; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091362340

We used the eddy-covariance method to examine the behaviour of the net ecosystem exchange as influenced by tidal flooding in daytime conditions in a coastal salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora in Georgia, USA. Two different analyses both found that the net ecosystem exchange was ~ 60% greater during neap high tides than during spring high tides; the largest differences occurred early in the growing season. The effect of tidal flooding varied continuously with the degree to which plants were inundated versus emergent. The total monthly reduction (less negative) in daytime net ecosystem exchange due to flooding was 7-38% and 1-64% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The highest CO2 flux reductions were observed early and during the peak growing season (February, March, April and May) and the lowest during the summer season in both years. Our findings suggest that daytime CO2 flux was reduced (less negative) 20-60% during the peak growing season due to tidal flooding. A better understanding of the impact of seasonal tidal flooding on net ecosystem exchange may allow more sophisticated predictions of how sea level rise will affect marsh function and survival over the coming century. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 exchange; Eddy-covariance; Net ecosystem exchange; Salt marsh; Spartina alterniflora; Tidal inundation","carbon flux; environmental conditions; flooding; growing season; intertidal environment; net ecosystem exchange; saltmarsh; seagrass; Georgia; United States; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089432778

The scenario results until 2050 are compared against the reduction targets set by the Swiss government and with each other. The results indicate that while the current state of Swiss climate policy is effective in reducing energy demand and GHG emissions, it will not be enough to reach the ambitious emission-reduction targets. These targets can be reached only through an almost complete phase-out of fossil-fuel heating systems by 2050, which can be achieved through the introduction of further financial and/or regulatory measures. The results indicate that while financial measures such as an increase in the CO2 tax as well as subsidies are effective in speeding up the transition in the beginning, a complete phase-out of oil and gas by 2050 is reached only through additional regulatory measures such as a CO2 limit for new and existing buildings. © 2020 The Authors","Agent-based modeling; Bottom-up model; Building stock modeling; Climate policy; Scenario assessment","Carbon dioxide; Computer aided software engineering; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Housing; Building stocks; Emission reduction targets; Financial measures; Policy measures; Policy scenario; Reduction targets; Residential building; Residential building stocks; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; energy policy; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; local government; multistorey building; pollution tax; regulatory approach; residential location; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089595730

Diesel combustion was simulated in a constant-volume chamber combined with a rapid compression machine. Two types of injection rate profile, namely rectangular and ramp-down, were tested in our experimental trials. To eliminate the significant effect of the maximum injection rate on mixture formation, we compared the results for the two types of injection rate profile under a given rail pressure. The time histories of the heat release rate demonstrated that the ramp-down fuel injection profile shortened the late combustion period by 0.2 ms. As a result, combustion was maintained despite the longer injection duration. The non-dimensional fuel consumption rate, defined in terms of the heat release rate and the fuel injection rate, revealed that high fuel consumption in the injection period reduced the quantity of fuel carried over to the late combustion period, resulting in a short duration of late combustion. When the ramp-down injection profile was employed, the temporal variation of total soot (spatially integrated KL factor) exhibited a rapid decrease after the end of injection. This is due to the abundant oxygen in soot regions that originated from the significant quantity of ambient air entrained into the spray during the injection period. This result indicates that ramp-down injection may reduce engine-out soot emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel combustion; Inversed-delta injection rate; Late combustion; Ramp-down injection; Soot emission","Diesel engines; Dust; Fuel injection; Fuels; Soot; Constant volume chamber; Experimental trials; Fuel consumption rates; Fuel injection rate; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Injection durations; Rapid compression machine; Temporal variation; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086705099

We investigated the effects on population exposure to particles &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5) from shipping and estimated related morbidity and mortality in Sweden’s 21 counties at different spatial resolutions. We used a regional model to estimate exposure in Sweden and a city-scale model for Gothenburg. Effects of PM2.5 exposure on total mortality, ischemic heart disease, and stroke were estimated using exposure–response functions from the literature and combining them into disability-adjusted life years (DALYS). PM2.5 exposure from shipping in Gothenburg decreased by 7% (1.6 to 1.5 µg/m3) using the city-scale model, and 35% (0.5 to 0.3 µg/m3) using the regional model. Different population resolutions had no effects on population exposures. In the city-scale model, annual premature deaths due to shipping PM2.5 dropped from 97 with the high-sulfur scenario to 90 in the low-sulfur scenario, and in the regional model from 32 to 21. In Sweden, DALYs lost due to PM2.5 from Baltic Sea shipping decreased from approximately 5700 to 4200.

In this study the energy requirements for four regions in Piedmont were examined. Such communities have diverse geomorphologic locations, population density and energy needs. The energy analysis was combined with the development and assessment of sustainability criteria for encouraging a real integration of the energy efficiency to environmental quality parameters. Such assessment includes a variety of criteria and reward points in order to incentivize the achievement of sustainable energy solutions in each region.

This study focuses on Northern Iraq, Kurdistan. This area suffers from a shortage of electricity production, alongside a high and growing demand due to the rapid expansion in the residential building sector over the last few decades through investment projects. The cooling energy performance of a typical house in Kurdistan was simulated, using DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus software. The study identified the most effective parameters of the building fabrications to be applied for enhancing the energy performance of residential buildings such as insulation, suspended ceiling, window glazing, overhang, and block type. The study found the parameters with the most impact on energy consumption to be suspended ceiling and insulation that could save a high rate of energy consumption. The impact of the clear double glazing and overhang of the windows are generally low, due to the low window/wall ratio and the availability of the internal curtain in the building. Finally, the optimum parameter values are identified and used in energy demand simulations, it showed that by using the optimum parameters of the building fabrications, 28.35% of the annual energy used could be saved from cooling in the house module. © 2020 The Authors","Building modelling; Building thermal comfort; Cooling energy; Kurdistan; Residential building; Thermal performance","Ceilings; Cooling; Energy efficiency; Glazes; Housing; Investments; Effective parameters; Electricity production; Energy performance; Investment projects; Optimum parameter values; Optimum parameters; Residential building; Suspended ceilings; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096837856

A direct way to achieve this goal is to reduce fuel consumption. Reference trajectory optimization contributes to this goal by guiding aircraft to zones where meteorological conditions are favorable to execute their required missions and thereby to reduce flight costs. In this article, the reference trajectory was optimized in terms of geographical position, altitude, and speed, by taking into account a Required Time of Arrival (RTA) constraint and weather conditions. The algorithm assumes that there is no traffic and that the aircraft can fly anywhere in the search space. The search space was modeled in the form of a unidirectional weighted graph, fuel burn was computed using a numerical model, and the weather forecast was taken into account. The methodology utilized in this article to determine the most economical combinations of parameters that delivered the optimal trajectory was inspired by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Results showed that the algorithm provided acceptable solutions under traffic management constraints. It was observed that the developed algorithm was able to save up to 9.1% (6,800 kg) of fuel burn when there was no RTA constraint for flight trajectories and up to 1.8% (600 kg) of fuel against real, as-flown trajectories with an RTA constraint of ±30 seconds. Because of the nature of the PSO Algorithm, the local best trajectories are extracted and provided as a Trajectory Option Set (TOS), which is similar in cost as the optimal trajectory. ©","4D; Algorithm; Commercial Aircraft; Emissions; Fuel Burn; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Particle Swarm Optimization; Trajectory; Weather","Aircraft; Fuels; Global warming; Navigation; Rapid thermal annealing; Time of arrival; Trajectories; Weather forecasting; Aircraft trajectory; Geographical positions; Meteorological condition; Optimal trajectories; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Reference trajectories; Required time of arrivals; Traffic management; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110018310

Religious systems often attribute climate crises to the behavior of invisible spirits. They devise rituals to influence the spirits, and do so under the guidance of religious specialists. They devise two types of problem-solving rituals: Anticipatory climate maintenance rituals, to request adequate rainfall in the forthcoming planting season, and climate crisis rituals for drought or inundations. The paper compares rainfall rituals in three different settings: Israel (Judaism), Northwest China (ethnic village religion), and Haiti (Vodou). Each author has done anthropological fieldwork in one or more of these settings. In terms of the guiding conceptual paradigm, the analysis applies three sequentially organized analytic operations common in anthropology: (1) detailed description of individual ethnographic systems; (2) comparison and contrast of specific elements in different systems; and (3) attempts at explanation of causal forces shaping similarities and differences. Judaism has paradoxically maintained obligatory daily prayers for rain in Israel during centuries when most Jews lived as urban minorities in the diaspora, before the founding of Israel in 1948. The Tu of Northwest China maintain separate ethnic temples for rainfall rituals not available in the Buddhist temples that all attend. The slave ancestors of Haiti, who incorporated West African rituals into Vodou, nonetheless excluded African rainfall rituals. We attribute this exclusion to slavery itself; slaves have little interest in performing rituals for the fertility of the fields of their masters. At the end of the paper, we identify the causal factors that propelled each systems into a climate-management trajectory different from that of the others. We conclude by identifying a common causal factor that exerts a power over religion in general and that has specifically influenced the climate responses of all three religious systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Citizen assemblies have been proposed as a viable and effective way of boosting public support for ambitious climate policies. This study examines the varying effects of climate change communication on citizen support for the speaker’s policy proposals, in the framework of the most consequential citizen-centred experimentation in environmental policymaking to date–the Irish Citizens’ Assembly. Drawing on the six-principle framework for authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we test whether effective communication contributes to explaining outcomes of deliberation on climate change. Methodologically, we take a set-theoretic approach, using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to operationalise conditions and analyse the data. Our findings show that effective communication does explain why certain policy proposals were adopted by the Irish Citizens’ Assembly over others, in conjunction with other conditions, such as having a high proportion of proposals being repeated by other speakers. Key policy insights Citizen assemblies and other deliberative fora can boost public support and provide legitimacy for ambitious climate policy. The information presented to participants in such fora has an effect upon engagement with, and support for, policy proposals. It is not climate change information per se, but how it is communicated that matters for participants’ uptake of ambitious climate measures. Speakers who communicate effectively see greater uptake of their policy proposals. Differences exist in the paths to success for expert and non-expert speakers. While the former were successful when they presented a high number of proposals, the latter were successful when they presented a simple, unique message. Organisers of citizens’ assemblies should encourage the participation of such non-expert speakers who can connect with audiences on ‘real-life’ climate action. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","citizen participation; climate change communication; Climate policy; IPCC; Irish Citizens’ assembly; QCA","climate change; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; local participation; policy making; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087006143

To achieve the agreed climate targets, efficient urban planning is a must. Tools and methods have risen to model different aspects of the energy performance of urban areas. Nevertheless, addressing the complexity of a city energy system is a great challenge and new integrated tools and methods are still needed. This paper presents a methodology for integrated city energy modelling and assessment, from the characterization of the city's current energy performance to the development and assessment of future scenarios. Energy characterization is based on the combination of bottom-up approaches with top-down data to establish the city's energy baseline. This baseline integrates bottom-up results from a GIS based model which is used to characterize the city's building stock energy performance, while available information on the vehicle stock is used to model the mobility sector. Scenarios are developed from this baseline and assessed through a multi-criteria impact assessment model. A simplified case study is carried out for the city of Valencia (Spain) to demonstrate the suggested methodology, and results are shown for three different scenarios: one focused on the building sector, one on transport, and one combining measures in both sectors. The transport-focused scenario demonstrates to be the most favourable in terms of energy savings and emissions reductions. The application of the proposed method is intended to support the development of strategies and plans for energy transition at city level. The main challenges for its application in cities are data availability at urban level, the uncertainty related to modelling the transport sector, and the unavailability of adapted I/O tables at city scale to assess socioeconomic impacts. © 2020",,"Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Bottom up approach; Emissions reduction; Energy characterization; Impact assessments; Integrated modelling; Low-carbon societies; Primary energy consumption; Socio-economic impacts; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091917062

To do this, closed cycle combustion simulations have been performed. Gasoline has been supplied through port injection and early direct and late direct injection to achieve fuel stratification and emission reduction. Simulations have been done for various start of injection (SOI) timings of diesel fuel. A detailed discussion on a low temperature heat release (LTHR) mechanism has been done. Results revealed that the maximum gross indicated thermal efficiency (GITE) of 39% is obtained for port injection of gasoline mode. Direct dual fuel combustion (type 2) (DDC2) mode shows approximately 2% and 38% less GITE and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), respectively, and 40% more soot as compared to the port injection gasoline mode. DDC2 mode shows lower oxides of carbon and hydrocarbon emissions as compared to other dual fuel modes. More than 99% of combustion efficiency and less maximum pressure rise rate have been noticed in the DDC2 case. Strong LTHR and high temperature premixed combustion region have been found in advanced SOI timing cases (in DDC2). In-cylinder contours for the DDC2 case show that diesel and gasoline fuels combusted successively cause less in-cylinder temperature than that for the conventional dual fuel combustion case. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Optimally sized BESS can excel the fiscal benefits and thus can be economically sensible. An optimization problem, which targets to minimize the total annual cost including both energy and battery degradation-based costs, is formulated to investigate the added benefits of operational optimization of a BESS over the baseline operation of BESS based on self-consumption maximization (SCM). A case study is conducted considering a Victorian electricity customer in Australia. Results revealed that installation of residential BESSs are fiscally beneficial at current market prices only if adequate rebates are available. A fiscally beneficial upper limit of BESS capacity that can be installed with the prevailing government incentives depending on the PV system capacity is also found. For a given installed cost of BESS (AU$/kWh), optimal BESS capacity is larger when operational optimization of BESS is considered. However, with a time-of-use (TOU) tariff scheme, BESSs based on operational optimization outperforms BESSs based on SCM in terms of the minimum total annual cost, return on investment and PV curtailment avoidance which excels the fiscal benefits of a BESS and results in indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Operational optimization; Optimal battery capacity; Return on investment; Self-consumption maximization","Commerce; Costs; Electric batteries; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Electricity customers; Government incentive; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Operational optimization; Optimization problems; Time of use (TOU) tariffs; Battery storage; alternative energy; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy storage; greenhouse gas; household energy; installation; operations technology; photovoltaic system; residential energy; state role; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088666809

One of those RE is photovoltaic solar energy, which has great potential in Colombia, as average radiation in the country is 4.5 KWh/m2day. Research therefore needs to be conducted in the country to enhance the use of photovoltaic solar systems in specific climate conditions, and according to the installation parameters of the photovoltaic systems. Moreover, the integration of the photovoltaic solar systems in the city of Manizales-Colombia is at an early stage, mainly because of the belief that they are not feasible due to the cold city's climate and cloud cover. This paper presents the results of the energy performance assessment of two solar photovoltaic systems installed at the National Learning Service — SENA, in Manizales-Colombia. The mean focus in this research was to study the performance of the monocrystalline and polycrystalline photovoltaic solar modules, in the climate conditions of Manizales-Colombia. The solar systems in question are monocrystalline and polycrystalline photovoltaic solar systems, both connected to the grid. The test variables were the room temperature, module temperature, inverter temperature, solar radiation at the testing site, input and output voltages and currents of the inverter. The data was gathered every 10 min for each one of the variables, and the experiment was conducted over a four-season period. In general, Manizales has favourable climate conditions for the installation of photovoltaic solar systems, regardless of whether polycrystalline or mono-silicon is used. This is supported mainly by the temperature losses analysis, as these values were equal to or under 3%. The main cause for the optimal performance of the photovoltaic generation modules is due to the fact that the ambient temperature of the city rarely rises above 25 °C. There is no significant difference between the performance of each generator, depending on the winter or summer seasons. One possible reason is that seasonal differences are not as extreme in Colombia due to its latitudinal location. © 2020 The Author(s)","Connected to the grid; Monocrystalline; Off-grid; Performance ratio; Photovoltaic solar energy; Polycrystalline","Electric inverters; Energy efficiency; Photovoltaic cells; Tropics; Energy performance assessments; Photovoltaic generation; Photovoltaic solar energy; Photovoltaic solar systems; Photovoltaic systems; Seasonal differences; Solar photovoltaic system; Use of renewable energies; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092765494

Landsat 8 satellite data was used to evaluate the effects of urban heat island based on land surface temperature (LST) in the affluent suburb of Rosebank in the north and the previously marginalized township of Soweto south of Johannesburg. It was found that the LST of Soweto was 2.58 °C hotter than Rosebank, suggesting that high-density areas with less street trees and parks are hotter than low-density suburbs. The Pearson's correlation coefficient computed between the LST and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the two areas, Rosebank and Soweto showed a positive correlation of 0.92 and 0.98) and a negative correlation of −0.91 and −0.99 respectively. The correlation between the NDVI and NDBI also showed negative values of −0.90 and −0.85, respectively. Based on the global bench mark for safe solar UVI, the residents of Soweto are likely to be at risk of skin and eye damage due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation than the residents of Rosebank.

This essay focuses on unusual extreme summer heat extremes occurring in Germany at higher frequency, longer duration, and with new temperature records. Large areas of the country are affected, particularly urban settlements, where about 77% of the population lives, which are exposed to multiple inner-city threats, such as urban heat islands. Because harm to public health is directly released by high ambient air temperatures, local and national studies on heat-related morbidity and mortality indicate that vulnerable groups such as the elderly population are predominantly threatened with heat-related health problems. After the severe mortality impacts of the extreme summer heat 2003 in Europe, in 2008, Germany took up the National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change to tackle and manage the impacts of weather extremes, for example to protect people’s health against heat. Public health systems and services need to be better prepared to improve resilience to the effects of extreme heat events, e.g., by implementing heat health action plans. Both climate protection as well as adaptation are necessary in order to be able to respond as adequate as possible to the challenges posed by climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

Toward this goal, the realizable k-ɛ turbulence model, GRI. 2.11 reaction mechanism, and the discrete ordinates radiation model are incorporated into a computational modeling of the reactive flow. The numerical results are, first, favorably compared against the existing experimental data. Subsequently, a number of swirl co-flows are implemented, and structures of the resultant reactive flows are investigated systematically. The outcomes indicate that increasing the swirl velocity leads to the reduction of ignition delay and significantly enhances the reaction completion. The analysis of the spatial distribution of hydroxyl and formyl (OH and HCO) radicals reveals that swirling MILD combustion radially extends the reaction zone in comparison with the conventional MILD combustion. Yet, it reduces the length of the reactive region and allows for the occurrence of heat release in a shorter axial distance from the outlet fuel nozzle. Further, the addition of swirl reduces the production of carbon monoxide through its influences upon flow temperature and generation of formyl radical. However, it is found that swirling hot co-flow intensifies NOx emissions by strengthening of prompt and thermal mechanisms of NOx production. Reducing the temperature of the recycled flue gas is deemed to be an effective way of resolving this issue. © 2020 by ASME.","hydrogen–methane blend; jet-in-hot co-flow burner; MILD combustion; NOx and CO emissions; swirl MILD combustion","Carbon monoxide; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Turbulence models; Combustion behavior; Computational model; Discrete ordinates; Hydrogen methane blends; Numerical investigations; Radiation modeling; Reaction mechanism; Thermal mechanisms; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089911291

Yet, attention toward fungal interactions with plants and the environment is dedicated to free-floating (planktonic) cells. Fungal biofilms are generally thought to configure interactions across and among plant populations. Despite this, plant fungal biofilm research lags far behind the research on biofilms of medically important fungi. The deficit in noticing and exploring this research avenue could limit disease management and plant improvement programs. Here, we provide the current state of knowledge of fungal biofilms and the different pivotal ecological roles they impart in the context of disease, through leveraging evidence across medically important fungi, secondary metabolite production, plant beneficial functions and climate change. We also provide views on several important information gaps potentially hampering plant fungal biofilm research, and propose a way forward to address these gaps. © The Author(s) 2020.

The Danube River basin in the Galati-Braila region, SE Romania, is a transboundary area of community and international importance, increasingly affected by drought, water, and wind erosion. Consequently, the aim of this study is to evaluate the main physical and hydro-physical parameters of soils, implied in water storage and with a defining role in erosion intensity, nutrients and toxicants cycle and availability, and crops yield. Soil samples were collected both in the disturbed and undisturbed state, from Smardan, Sendreni, and Vadeni agricultural lands and riparian areas of semiaquatic ecosystems, located in the vicinity of the steel platform of the Galati industrial area. Specific laboratory methods of investigation and formulas were used. Chernozems (CZ), Fluvisols (AS), and Gleysols (GS) of different subtypes and various physico-chemical parameters were identified. The results suggested that CZ are of coarse and medium texture, while AS and GS are medium–fine and fine textured. In correlation with this, bulk density values range from extremely low–low to low–high classes. In relation to soil physical parameters and the content of organic matter, hydro-physical indices show water supply imbalances. Through the approached theme, the study is of practical importance for sustainable management of the soil, agricultural projects, and landscaping. This study provides government authorities and non-governmental organizations an overview of the local and regional soil conditions, so that new measures can be regulated to protect it against irrational use. © 2020 by the authors.

The studied areas are located in ungauged catchments with high erosion rates where torrents deposit slackwater sediments near the outlet of the basins. Such deposits and erosive morphologies allow us to analyse sub-daily extreme hydrological events by combining standard techniques in paleohydrology, the kinematic wave method and remote-sensed paleostage indicators. The formulation was correctly verified in extreme events through reliable gauge measurements and a high-resolution distributed hydrological model showing the accuracy of our calculations (10% ≤relative error ≤ 22%). In catchments of the European Mediterranean region where the frequency and magnitude of short-rain floods are increasing (e.g. the Guadalquivir Basin), the main hydrological variables can thus be quantified post-event using the proposed approach. The outputs may serve to construct a new database for this kind of events complementary to the existing daily database for long-rain floods (&gt; 24 h). The need is evident for safety designs of civil infrastructures and flood risk mitigation strategies in the current climate change scenario. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Flood monitoring; Guadalquivir basin; Paleohydrology; Satellite imagery; Short-rain flood","Catchments; Climate change; Deposits; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Rain; Remote sensing; Risk perception; Runoff; Civil infrastructures; Climate change scenarios; Distributed hydrological model; Extreme hydrological events; Hydrological variables; Kinematic wave method; Mediterranean catchment; Mediterranean region; Floods; catchment; climate change; flooding; fluvial deposit; hydrological response; paleohydrology; rainfall; river basin; river discharge; satellite imagery; Andalucia; Guadalquivir Basin; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085971955

However, some motivations and requirements for doing laundry can increase the environmental burden, which suggests that the laundry machine (LM) sharing is not necessarily sustainable. This study clarifies consumer motivations for laundry usage and assesses the feasibility of environmentally sustainable laundry behavior through LM-sharing. Consumer surveys were conducted in Tokyo and Bangkok with different LM-ownership proportions. Single-person households were targeted, reflecting Tokyo’s demographic situation. A scenario analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of routine laundry behavior changes on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Three main results emerged. First, Tokyo respondents used a coin-operated laundry machine (CL) for convenience, which private washers cannot provide, while Bangkok respondents used it for basic laundry needs. Consequentially, the Tokyo respondents, who used CLs, were responsible for more than three times the GHG emissions of Bangkok respondents. Second, the group using both private LM and CL was the least GHG-efficient group, regardless of region. Third, laundry behavior can reduce GHG emissions if consumer requirements are decreased. The results show that there is environmental significance in adopting LM-sharing for sustainable consumption and production systems that reflect regional characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.

In the small region of Cantabria, in northern Spain, the production of alcoholic beverages as an economic sector has been growing in importance in recent years. Thus, there is a new flow of waste for which specific management plans have yet to be developed. The result is an increase in the total amount of urban waste to be disposed. Anaerobic digestion can be a suitable in-situ solution for the treatment of the generated wastes providing a source of renewable energy which can be a supply for the processes in these industries, reducing the emission of greenhouse gases associated to the use of fossil fuels, all of this benefitting both environment and economy. In this work the authors present the information gathered about waste generation and the biomethanogenic potential of the most important wastes generated in the industries. As a result, specific strategies could be designed for the industrial sector in the region, of which other small agro-industries can benefit. © 2020 by the authors.

An important strategy that alpine plants use to escape this change consists in seed dispersal and the ability of seeds to germinate and establish in new sites at higher elevation. Little is known about the environmental factors that can affect the regeneration of plants above the elevational limit of growth. We present the first field evidence of recruitment success and plant performance in consequence of upward shift from the alpine to the nival life zone. Seeds of four alpine grassland species were sown at the current elevational limit of growth (site A) and 200 m upward, in a nival environment (site N) located in the Italian Alps. At site N part of the seeds were subjected to experimental manipulation of temperature (using an Open Top Chamber, OTC) or soil (using soil from site A). Recruitment success, soil surface temperature and water potential were monitored for five consecutive years. At the end of the experiment, vegetative growth and foliar traits were measured on individuals from all treatments. Mean annual soil surface temperature and length of the growing season at site A were ca. 2°C higher and ca. 44 days longer than at site N. Seedling emergence and seedling establishment generally were higher at N (with or without OTC) on local soil than at site A or at site N with soil originating from site A. Conversely, production was higher at site A and at site N with soil originating from site A. Recruitment success above the elevational leading edge was enhanced by coarser and nutrient-poor soil, which promoted seedling emergence and establishment but constrained plant growth. This trade-off between seedling recruitment and plant production underlines adaptive consequence and environmental filtering, both critical to forecast community assembly and responses of alpine species to climate warming. © Copyright © 2020 Mondoni, Orsenigo, Abeli, Rossi, Brancaleoni, Corli, Iacumin, Tonin, Marchesini and Gerdol.","alpine plants; ecological niche; foliar traits; germination; global warming; soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096699884

Nowadays, many countries are faced with the trouble of the deficiency of energy resources and the incapability of saving them. Most of this energy is consumed in the cooling, heating, and artificial ventilation of buildings. For this reason, the development of an integrated strategy like a green facade is essential to transform buildings into structures that consume less energy and to improve the occupants’ comfort conditions. From the perspective of the urban landscape, the green facade can influence the quality of life in cities due to its positive effects such as the purification of air, the absorption of carbon dioxide, and the mitigation of dust, as well as the aesthetic and psychological aspects. Such criteria are based on the adoption of suitable orientation for the green facade, which is the second layer of the facade in an office building with a curtain wall as the main facade. Since the most important factor in the implementation of a green facade is the building’s orientation, the optimum orientation could be the key factor in regards to the reduction of energy consumption and cost and the improvement of overall energy efficiency. We used software that helped simulate the total energy consumption, the cost, and the energy use intensity annually and monthly. Consequently, after testing was carried out, it was proven that a green facade as a second layer with a southeast and/or a southwest orientation results in the maximum energy saving in a coastal city with a Mediterranean climate like Barcelona. © 2020 by the authors.

However, we currently lack spatially-resolved national-level assessments of the relationships among services in agricultural landscapes over time. This limits our ability to make decisions and predict how environmental changes or agricultural management actions will impact multiple services. How do multiple ecosystem services vary across both space and time, at regional-to-national scales? To address this question, we quantified eight indicators of four ecosystem services across 290 Canadian agricultural landscapes in 1996, 2001, and 2006. We observed consistent correlations between pairs of services across the 290 ecodistricts in each of the 3 years of our study. In particular, ecodistricts with high livestock production had low provision of most regulating services, while ecodistricts with high air quality (ammonia retention) also had high soil and water quality regulation services. However, these ‘snapshot’ correlations poorly predicted how pairs of services changed through time. Ecosystem service change from 1996–2001 to 2001–2006 (as measured by pairwise correlations) showed markedly different patterns than snapshot correlations. In particular, where livestock production increased between years, so did most regulating services. Ecosystem service bundles also showed similar divergent patterns. The distribution of ecosystem service “snapshot” bundles—sets of ecodistricts with similar levels of provision across multiple ecosystem services in a single year—was generally stable between 1996 and 2006; only 15% of ecodistricts changed bundle types in this time period. However, ecosystem service “change” bundles—sets of ecodistricts with similar changes in ecosystem service provision through time—were much more dynamic. Nearly 60% of ecodistricts exhibited a different set of ecosystem service changes from 2001 to 2006 compared to 1996 to 2001. Our results add to the growing evidence that relationships between services across space do not necessarily predict service change through time. Improved understanding of the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services, and better understanding of underlying processes, is crucial to improve agricultural landscape management for multifunctionality and sustainability. © Copyright © 2020 Mitchell, Chan, Ramankutty, and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.","agricultural landscapes; air quality regulation; Canada; ecosystem service bundles; ecosystem services; soil quality regulation; temporal correlations; water quality regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098085434

The effects of land use change (e.g. forest harvest) on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences. DOC is typically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors. In this paper, we investigated high frequency measurements of DOC concentration in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia. We found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear-cut stream (Clear cut: 2.26 ± 0.43 mg/L; Forested: 4.30 ± 0.83 mg/L). This may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, although the difference in drainage area, slope, and the presence of a bog lake in the forested catchment may also account for some of the observed difference. We found the DOC response to storms to be larger and faster at the clear-cut site (mean increase DOC: Clear-cut: 2.42 mg/L, Forested: 1.99 mg/L; mean rate of change DOC: Clear-cut: 0.16 mg/L/h, Forested: 0.11 mg/L/h). Elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting. We found low antecedent flow and greater storm intensity to significantly predict elevated DOC storm response. This is important in the context of future climate scenarios, which predict lower summer flows and more intense storms in this region. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the intersection between effects of land use change and climate on water quality, with a focus on drinking water treatment implications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved organic carbon; Forest harvest; Hysteresis; Land use change; Storm response","Aquatic ecosystems; Catchments; Climate change; Harvesting; Land use; Organic carbon; Potable water; Rivers; Storms; Stream flow; Water quality; Water treatment; Dissolved organic carbon; DOC concentrations; Forested catchments; Future climate scenarios; High frequency analysis; High frequency measurements; Regional differences; Time resolved measurement; Forestry; baseflow; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; drinking water; frequency analysis; headwater; land use change; water treatment; water use; British Columbia; Canada; Acer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089088919

The Nordic and Baltic energy systems in particular are benefiting from wind energy to reach the greenhouse gas emissions reduction objectives set by the EU. The wind energy production varies with time, and this intermittent characteristic imposes a challenge for full utilization of renewable energy potential. The power system operator needs to ensure timely power supply of demand. An accurate estimation of power output from a non-dispatchable generation resource such as a wind farm is essential for the operator to ensure the supply–demand balance and adequate sizing of reserve power capacity. Existing methods of feature extraction and prediction such as linear regression often overlook the significant variations or do not utilize in the model building. However, this method misinterprets the trend in data. Understanding the properties of the variations in more details would reduce the uncertainty and significantly improve the feature extraction to aid in decision making. Furthermore, as the volume, shape and type of dataset start to increase and new methods are required to extract meaningful information from the patterns in the big data. The objective of the paper is to present a novel Ramping BehaviourAnalysis (RBAθ) model that identifies and quantifies the variations in a time-varying dataset. The variations are classified into significant and stationary events. The former refers to the significant swings beyond a set threshold range and the latter refers to the swings that are relatively within the threshold limits. The features associated to each event include start time, end time, change in magnitude, persistence of an event, angle at which the event took place and frequency of occurrences of the features. In addition, the rain-flow cycles count is extracted from the original data for each event as a sum of half cycles and full cycles. The model is validated using simulated wind power production data from a virtual wind park spread across Estonia and the results are elaborated. The spatial dynamics of the virtual windfarm are captured through localized spatial autocorrelation of the events with the geospatial locations of the turbines. The results demonstrate that RBAθ precisely and accurately identify and quantify the time varying power generation into events with subsequent features. The volume of the data is significantly reduced in the process of summarizing time series data into a series of events. Thereby RBAθ can be also used for data compression and reconstruction with minor losses. The system operators can use the proposed algorithm in operational scheduling, maintenance and investment-capacity building decisions. © 2020 The Authors","Data science; Feature extraction; Rainflow counting; Ramp events; Renewable energy; Time series variations; Wind power production","Data mining; Decision making; Emission control; Extraction; Feature extraction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Large dataset; Wind power; Generation resources; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Power system operators; Renewable energy potentials; Spatial autocorrelations; Time-varying dataset; Wind energy production; Wind power production; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096844900

This substantially improved the activity of the catalysts, lowering the onset temperature of activity by about 50 °C. Ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) was used to investigate in situ the electronic state of cobalt and gold during CO oxidation. APXPS results show that while Au remains in the metallic state during the reaction, it enhances the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+. Au NPs adsorb CO molecules from the gas phase and supply them to the neighbor cobalt oxide particles. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","APXPS; Au nanoparticles; Chemical vapor deposition; Cobalt oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096905154

In this study, various climatic zones of Iran were investigated to assess the relationship between the trend and the stationarity of the climatic variables. The Mann-Kendall test was considered to identify the trend, while the trend free pre-whitening approach was applied for eliminating serial correlation from the time-series. Meanwhile, time series stationarity was tested by Dickey-Fuller and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests. The results indicated an increasing trend for mean air temperature series at most of the stations over various climatic zones, however, after eliminating the serial correlation factor, this increasing trend changes to an insignificant decreasing trend at a 95% confidence level. The seasonal mean air temperature trend suggested a significant increase in the majority of the stations. The mean air temperature increased more in northwest towards central parts of Iran that mostly located in arid and semiarid climatic zones. Precipitation trend reveals an insignificant downward trend in most of the series over various climatic zones; furthermore, most of the stations follow a decreasing trend for seasonal precipitation. Furthermore, spatial patterns of trend and seasonality of precipitation and mean air temperature showed that the northwest parts of Iran and margin areas of the Caspian Sea are more vulnerable to the changing climate with respect to the precipitation shortfalls and warming. Stationarity analysis indicated that the stationarity of climatic series influences on their trend; so that, the series which have significant trends are not static. The findings of this investigation can help planners and policy-makers in various fields related to climatic issues, implementing better management and planning strategies to adapt to climate change and variability over Iran. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","arid and semi-arid regions; climate change; seasonality; serial correlation; stationarity tests; trend analysis","air temperature; arid region; autocorrelation; climate change; precipitation intensity; seasonality; semiarid region; temporal analysis; trend analysis; Caspian Sea; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098870558

We address this task by means of adaptive neural networks, which re-adjust their weights when transferred to new conditions. Such an adaptive account for computational models is typical of the field of developmental robotics, which investigates learning of motor control in artificial systems inspired on infants’ development. Similarly, to robots, greenhouses are complex systems comprising technical and biological elements, whose state can be measured and modified through control actions. We present an adaptive model architecture to perform online learning. This learning process makes use of an episodic memory and of online re-training, which modify the plasticity of the model according to the prediction error. This allows for adaptation without the need for a complete new training, which might be prohibitive if the data under the new conditions is scarce (in comparison to a research facility). Current experiments focus on how a model of tomato photosynthesis, developed in a research facility, can adapt itself to a new environment in a production greenhouse. The models presented as a proof-of-concept estimate the transpiration and photosynthesis of a hydroponic tomato crop by using measurements of the climate and the state of the actuators as inputs. In the thought experiment, the models are trained and tested using data from a greenhouse in Berlin, Germany. Thereafter, the adaptive architecture is fed with data from a production greenhouse in southern Germany, where other tomato cultivars were grown under different irrigation and climate strategies. The proposed adaptive architecture represents a promising tool for spreading the use of models produced by high-tech research centres to the greenhouse production sector. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

It has been shown that transitioning from fossil fuel to electric propulsion of transportation can help realize this goal. However, the current market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) remains very small. This paper proposes a framework to address this problem over a long-term analysis period. The paper accounts for consumers' vehicle-purchasing propensities and their route choices, locations of EV-charging and ICEV-refueling stations. In the proposed framework, new EV charging stations are provided at selected locations and/or existing gas stations are repurposed by the transport agency's decision-maker (through policy) in conjunction with the private sector (through investment). The paper presents a bi-level mathematical model to capture the decision-making processes of the transport agency and the travelers. Underlying the framework is a solid theoretical foundation for the EV charging network design. The design problem is solved using an active-set algorithm. The study results can serve as guidance for metropolitan transport agencies to establish specific locations and capacities for EV stations and thereby to contribute to long-term reduction of emissions. © 2020 IEEE.","Charging stations; Diffusion model; Electric vehicles; Network design","Charging (batteries); Decision making; Fossil fuels; Location; Active-Set algorithms; Decision making process; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Ev charging stations; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Market penetration; Reduction of emissions; Theoretical foundations; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099529913

Although many approaches for optimizing the number and location of air quality monitoring stations are described in the literature, these are usually focused on dense networks. However, there are small and medium-size urban areas that only require one monitoring station but also suffer from severe air pollution. Given that target pollutants are usually measured at the same sampling points; it is necessary to develop a methodology to determine the optimal location of the single station. In this paper, such a methodology is proposed based on maximizing an objective function, that balances between different pollutants measured in the network. The methodology is applied to a set of data available for the city of Cartagena, in southeast Spain. A sensitivity analysis reveals that 2 small areas of the studied city account for 80% of the optimal potential locations, which makes them ideal candidates for setting up the monitoring station. The methodology is easy to implement, robust and supports the decision-making process regarding the siting of fixed sampling sites. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThis paper describes an easy-to-use methodology to find out the optimum location for setting up a single air quality monitoring station, especially useful for small and medium-size urban areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Medium-size urban areas; Monitoring stations; Optimization; Small urban areas","Air quality; Decision making; Location; Monitoring; Quality management; Sensitivity analysis; Air quality monitoring stations; Continuous measurements; Decision making process; Monitoring stations; Objective functions; Optimal locations; Optimum location; Target pollutants; Pollution detection; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); decision making; environmental monitoring; pollution monitoring; sensitivity analysis; urban area; air quality; article; decision making; pollutant; sensitivity analysis; siting; Spain; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; Cartagena [Murcia]; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089392978

The international EbA South project implemented EbA interventions across three countries (Mauritania, Nepal, the Seychelles), piloting the restoration of mountain, desert and coastal ecosystems to enhance the climate resilience of local communities. The experiences of the EbA South project across these distinct ecosystems and socio-economic environments provide unique insights into the adaptive management invariably required within EbA initiatives. This analysis also provides lessons on how to share knowledge among different stakeholders and countries to advance South-South cooperation. Summary: Climate change is having an increasingly negative impact on the world's most vulnerable societies. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services to help local communities adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. This approach, which has the potential to be implemented across a wide range of ecosystem types and scales, is increasingly being adopted by governments and international donors within climate change adaptation initiatives. The objective of the EbA South project was to enhance the climate resilience of communities in Mauritania, Nepal, and the Seychelles by building institutional capacity, mobilizing knowledge and transferring EbA technologies based on China's experience in successfully implementing restoration. The project implemented EbA interventions in the drylands of Mauritania, Himalayan forests in Nepal, and the coastal zone of the Seychelles. All interventions were carefully monitored by researchers to generate scientific evidence of the impacts of EbA. Here, we provide implementers of EbA with the major lessons learned from the EbA South project, namely: (a) quantifying the full suite of ecosystem goods and services generated through EbA at a landscape scale; (b) budgeting in advance for management of time-consuming complexities related to socioeconomics and ecology such as land-use conflict, ineffective government structures, disagreements regarding intervention options, and challenging environmental conditions; (c) undertaking long-term research for adaptive management and documenting the project's successes; (d) providing platforms for effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders with different first languages; and (e) regularly adjusting exit strategies for maintenance of the EbA landscapes after closure of the project. © 2020 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust","climate change; EbA South; exit strategy; long-term research; project management; restoration; South-South cooperation; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103993397

In the UK, heating and hot water accounts for around 40% of energy consumption and 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Heating is typically produced onsite, making widescale carbon or energetic improvements challenging. District heating networks (DHNs) can offer significant carbon reduction for many users but can only be implemented if the end user buildings have good thermal energy efficiency. This greatly limits the ability to implement advancing 4th and 5th generation DHNs, which are the most advanced systems available. We elucidate the current state of thermal efficiency in buildings in the UK and provide recommendations for necessary building requirements and modifications in order to accommodate 4th and 5th generation district heating. We conclude that key sectors must be addressed including creating a skilled workforce, producing relevant metrics and benchmarks, and providing financial support for early stage design exploration. © 2020 by the authors.

Large amounts of earth observations from space have been collected over the last five decades and while most of the measurements have not been designed specifically for monitoring urban areas, an increasing number of these observations is being used for understanding the growth rates of cities and their environmental impacts. Here we reviewed the existing tools available from satellite remote sensing to study urban contribution to climate change, which could be used for monitoring the progress of climate change mitigation strategies at the city level. We described earth observations that are suitable for measuring and monitoring urban population, extent, and structure; urban emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants; urban energy consumption; and extent, intensity, and effects on surrounding regions, including nearby water bodies, of urban heat islands. We compared the observations available and obtainable from space with the measurements desirable for monitoring. Despite considerable progress in monitoring urban extent, structure, heat island intensity, and air pollution from space, many limitations and uncertainties still need to be resolved. We emphasize that some important variables, such as population density and urban energy consumption, cannot be suitably measured from space with available observations. © 2020 by the authors.

In the temperate forests of the western United States, proposed changes to Forest Plans would significantly weaken protections for a large portion of trees greater than 53 cm (21 inches) in diameter (herein referred to as “large-diameter trees”) across 11.5 million acres (∼4.7 million ha) of National Forest lands. This study is among the first to report how carbon storage in large trees and forest ecosystems would be affected by a proposed policy. We examined the proportion of large-diameter trees on National Forest lands east of the Cascade Mountains crest in Oregon and Washington, their contribution to overall aboveground carbon (AGC) storage, and the potential reduction in carbon stocks resulting from widespread harvest. We analyzed forest inventory data collected on 3,335 plots and found that large trees play a major role in the accumulated carbon stock of these forests. Tree AGC (kg) increases sharply with tree diameter at breast height (DBH; cm) among five dominant tree species. Large trees accounted for 2.0 to 3.7% of all stems (DBH ≥ 1” or 2.54 cm) among five tree species; but held 33 to 46% of the total AGC stored by each species. Pooled across the five dominant species, large trees accounted for 3% of the 636,520 trees occurring on the inventory plots but stored 42% of the total AGC. A recently proposed large-scale vegetation management project that involved widespread harvest of large trees, mostly grand fir, would have removed ∼44% of the AGC stored in these large-diameter trees, and released a large amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Given the urgency of keeping additional carbon out of the atmosphere and continuing carbon accumulation from the atmosphere to protect the climate system, it would be prudent to continue protecting ecosystems with large trees for their carbon stores, and also for their co-benefits of habitat for biodiversity, resilience to drought and fire, and microclimate buffering under future climate extremes. © Copyright © 2020 Mildrexler, Berner, Law, Birdsey and Moomaw.","21-inch rule; carbon; climate mitigation; eastside screens; forests; global change; large-diameter trees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105290767

The underlying study adopts a multisited, institutional ethnography to critically analyze an adaptation project in São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) implemented jointly by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government. The article presents evidence for how agents of development (re)produce an imaginative geography of the country’s vulnerability and engage in a discursive violence that renders project beneficiaries vulnerable on the one hand, and seeks to transform them into model adaptation subjects on the other. It discusses how local residents have been effectively excluded from the project based on their perceived vulnerabilities and points to critical political theory and “imaginative countergeographies” as ways in which the disempowering representations of the Global South as vulnerable and the discursive violence committed against its residents can be counteracted. © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.","adaptation; Africa; development; discursive violence; imaginative geography","adaptation; climate change; political development; political discourse; political power; political violence; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084087558

Climate-induced rural–urban migration is a profound concern, and Dhaka’s political leaders have embraced technology-based innovation as one solution pathway. This article explores the societal impact of Dhaka’s innovation environment strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Employing a case study qualitative methodology, our three findings expand knowledge about innovation for urban climate adaptation and mitigation as understood by Dhaka-based entrepreneurs. First, the most effective innovations were not the most technologically advanced, but those with the highest degree of participant ownership. Second, gaps between recipient, corporate and governmental understandings of effective mitigation and adaptation harmed projects were driven by different definitions of risk and competing understandings of vulnerability. Third, even the most technical climate adaptation measures were inherently political in their application. We discuss how to better position urban climate innovation infrastructures in Bangladesh and beyond, including developing a better recognition of innovation lifecycles for urban climate adaptation and widening our definitions of “innovation” to better incorporate more effective and inclusive climate adaptation solutions. © 2020 by the authors.

An important property of ceria related to these applications is its high oxygen storage capacity. Indeed, in some reaction steps, cerium switches its oxidation state between 3+ and 4 + . To design new and effective cerium-based DeNOx catalysts, it is necessary to know in details the interaction between CeO2-x and nitrogen oxides. One of the most informative techniques in this respect is IR spectroscopy. There are many IR studies devoted to this problem. However, as a rule, the efforts are concentrated on investigation of the oxidized forms of ceria and there are few works dealing with reduced oxide. There are also many contradictory assignments and few works use isotopic labelling for better interpretation of the spectra. Here we report a summary of our IR studies on the interaction of nitrogen oxides with ceria paying equal attention to the reduced and non-reduced oxide form. To strengthen the assignments we have used isotopically labelled molecules and DFT calculation. It was found that the initial stages of interaction of NO with oxidized ceria comprise NO disproportionation to symmetric nitrites (formal oxidation state of nitrogen 3+) and hyponitrites (formal oxidation state of nitrogen 1+). At further stages non-symmetric nitrites and N2O are also formed. In presence of oxygen all these species are converted into surface nitrates. Adsorption of N2O on reduced ceria is dissociative and leads to formation of N2 with simultaneous filling the oxygen vacancies and oxidation of Ce3+. Initial stages of interaction of reduced ceria with NO includes (i) formation of surface azides (N3−, showing remarkable similarity with NCO− species) and NO2−. The latter species interact with additional NO molecule being thus converted into hyponitrites. Further stages are associated with formation of nitrites, and, in presence of O2, nitrates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Azides; Ceria; FTIR spectroscopy; Hyponitrites; Nitrites; Nitrogen monoxide","Catalysts; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Design for testability; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molecules; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Oxygen vacancies; Azides; FTIR spectroscopy; Hyponitrites; Nitrites; Nitrogen monoxide; Cerium oxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065530919

NOx emissions and exhaust gas temperatures were recorded before and after the SCR system during real-world driving tests. The results showed that engine-out NOx emissions were positively correlated with vehicle specific power (VSP). The average NOx reductions (deNOx) of the SCR were 82.8%, 91.7%, and 85.5% for SCR-inlet gas temperatures below, within, and above the thermal window of 220–340 °C, respectively. The 92% of the tailpipe NOx peaks appeared under high power (VSP ≥ 10 W kg−1) and an insufficient deNOx level. Urban driving and long downhill sections in rural conditions caused cooling down of the SCR-inlet gas to below 200 °C, where the deNOx efficiency decreased and became dependent on the exhaust mass flow rate. To estimate the NOx benefit and CO₂ penalty via electrical heating of the SCR-inlet exhaust gas, the vehicle, the real driving dynamics, and the heating were simulated in Passenger car and heavy-duty emission model (PHEM). The minimum threshold of 200 °C resulted in the best NOx/CO₂ trade-off, reducing on average 4.7 mg of NOx per gram of CO₂. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aftertreatment heating; CO₂ emissions; Diesel passenger cars; NOx emissions; Real driving emissions; Selective catalytic reduction (SCR)","Automobiles; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicle performance; Diesel passenger cars; Electrical heating; Exhaust gas temperatures; Inlet gas temperature; Real-world drivings; Selective catalytic reduction systems; Thermal windows; Vehicle specific power; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091644134

An investigation was conducted by us over a period of 5 years from 2015-2018 (cycle 1 (2015 - 16); cycle 2 (2017 - 18) looking into the incidence of rainfall effects, pH and global warming on the soil profile of Kerala. The study is based on secondary data collected from soil health card and ENVIS Centre: Kerala state of environment and related issues. From the assessment of data, we observed major elements such as phosphorus, potassium, and organic carbon have been drastically reduced specially in the rainfall afflicted Northern districts of Kerala. These major elements are the key players involved in driving agricultural productivity. Availability of Nitrogen was drastically reduced in both cycles. Minor elements on the other hand zinc, iron, copper, boron and manganese were more abundant in the soil. Studies such as this, aims towards understanding the global warming pattern and its predictable changes in the soil profile, driving elemental availability for agriculture. Hence in this measure, to sustain Kerala's agricultural production, an integrated institutional system for element substitution and recharging measures need to be promoted to boost agriculture output. Crop production is threatened in complex ways due to global warming as it introduces incidence of newer pests and pathogens, increasing water scarcity, increases in the frequency of extreme weather conditions. Globally crop yields have diminished and therefore to achieve SDG 2 and hunger by 2030 is a challenging task. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096634910

This data is practically the same recorded in the previous year, suggesting that the country’s trajectory of CO2 emissions is stabilized. Methods: This study presents an overview of environmental protection and climate change mitigation policies adopted in Brazil, as well as makes use the multilevel regression modeling technique to investigate the relationship between economic activities variables in relation to CO2 emissions over the years of 1970 to 2018 in all Brazilian states. Results: The results show that the CO2 emissions in the states have the same behavior as the timeline of the change in land use. Conclusions: The public policies and actions by society and the private sector were fundamental to the reduction verified from the year of 2004 that followed until 2010, both in CO2 emissions and in the change in land use and forests. As of this year, there has been a trend towards stability in CO2 emissions. Another important characteristic is that even with a drop in the number of deforestation, the production variables continued to grow, which shows that there may be an increase in production activities, while there is a reduction in deforestation and in CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we comprehensively assess relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in carbon ion therapy and associated models toward the modernization of current clinical practice in effective dose calculation. Methods: Using 2 human (A549, H460) and 2 mouse (B16, Renca) tumor cell lines, clonogenic cell survival assay was performed for examination of changes in RBE along the full range of clinical-like spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) fields. Prediction power of the local effect model (LEM1 and LEM4) and the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) was assessed. Experimentation and analysis were carried out in the frame of a multidimensional end point study for clinically relevant ranges of physical dose (D), dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd), and base-line photon radio-sensitivity (α/β)x. Additionally, predictions were compared against previously reported RBE measurements in vivo and surveyed in patient cases. Results: RBE model prediction performance varied among the investigated perspectives, with mMKM prediction exhibiting superior agreement with measurements both in vitro and in vivo across the 3 investigated end points. LEM1 and LEM4 performed their best in the highest LET conditions but yielded overestimations and underestimations in low/midrange LET conditions, respectively, as demonstrated by comparison with measurements. Additionally, the analysis of patient treatment plans revealed substantial variability across the investigated models (±20%-30% uncertainty), largely dependent on the selected model and absolute values for input tissue parameters αx and βx. Conclusion: RBE dependencies in vitro, in vivo, and in silico were investigated with respect to various clinically relevant end points in the context of tumor-specific tissue radio-sensitivity assignment and accurate RBE modeling.

Microbe-based manure additives treatments are marketed and used by farmers for mitigation of emissions. However, their performance is difficult to assess objectively. Thus, comprehensive, practical, and low-cost treatments are still in demand. We have been advancing such treatments based on physicochemical principles. The objective of this research was to test the effect of the surficial application of a thin layer (14 inches; 6.3 mm) of biochar on the mitigation of gaseous emissions (as the percent reduction, % R) from swine manure. Two types of biochar were tested: highly alkaline and porous (HAP) biochar made from corn stover and red oak (RO), both with different pH and morphology. Three 30-day trials were conducted with a layer of HAP and RO (2.0 &amp; 1.65 kg·m−2, respectively) applied on manure surface, and emissions of ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), greenhouse gases (GHG), and odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured. The manure and biochar type and properties had an impact on the mitigation effect and its duration. RO significantly reduced NH3 (19–39%) and p-cresol (66–78%). H2 S was mitigated (16~23%), but not significantly for all trials. The phenolic VOCs had relatively high % R in most trials but not significantly for all trials. HAP reduced NH3 (4~21%) and H2 S (2~22%), but not significantly for all trials. Significant % R for p-cresol (91~97%) and skatole (74~95%) were observed for all trials. The % R for phenol and indole ranged from (60~99%) and (29~94%) but was not significant for all trials. The impact on GHGs, isobutyric acid, and the odor was mixed with some mitigation and generation effects. However, larger-scale experiments are needed to understand how biochar properties and the dose and frequency of application can be optimized to mitigate odor and gaseous emissions from swine manure. The lessons learned can also be applicable to surficial biochar treatment of gaseous emissions from other waste and area sources. © 2020 by the authors.

Many studies have been carried out to determine the grapevine response to environmental changes and to identify key genetic traits to be used in grapevine breeding. However, in order to better manage climate-related risks, novel viticultural practices are urgently needed. A promising solution for a more sustainable model of viticulture involves the use of biostimulants. In this study, the effectiveness of a novel biostimulant (APR®) belonging to the group of protein thermal hydrolysates was tested on grapevine plants subjected to progressive water deficit conditions. Our results showed that this compound applied to roots before imposing water deprivation mitigates the consequences of stress by sustaining the growth of the younger vegetative organs and limiting the extent of cell dehydration; this positive impact on the plant's physiological state persisted during the recovery phase. Furthermore, at the end of the growing season, plants treated with the biostimulant, both in optimal water conditions and under water stress, exhibited a greater accumulation of biomass in the aerial part (6.8% and 21.3 %, respectively) and a higher berry diameter (3.4 % and 9.5 %, respectively). Additional work through field trials will be necessary to further substantiate these results and to translate this knowledge into specific practices that grape growers can easily adopt. © 2020 by the authors.

The extensive and increasing usage of conventional concrete, mortar, plasters and various cement-based materials is only one of the many factors contributing towards urban thermal discomfort caused by urban heat island phenomena and the poor thermal insulation of ordinary cement mortar. Not only this, the wide use of concrete and mortar in construction increases the consumption of their primary components mainly -Portland cement-requiring a large consumption of energy and causing a significant rise in CO2 emissions. Embedding natural and artificial cementitious/pozzolana materials in today's cement-based building materials has become a common practice. Cementitious and Pozzolanic materials are known to provide an added value to mortar/concrete not only in terms of mechanical and durability properties but also in energy efficiency and enhancing sustainability. Sarooj is a local term describing an artificial cementitious and pozzolana material obtained by traditional calcining of the raw clayey soil. Although its usage is nowadays very limited, Sarooj has been used in Oman and other neighboring countries for centuries, in various buildings and defense structures. The main objective of this research is to transform the traditionally produced Sarooj into an engineered binding material and hence investigating its physico-mechanical and thermal properties. The raw soil used to produce the traditional Sarooj was employed to engineer a modern “Sarooj” under controlled energy processing (grinding and calcination) conditions. The raw clay minded from specific location was ground first to a fine powdered material and then subjected to full characterization. The physical and chemical characterization indicated that the raw soil is suitable for producing a cementitious/pozzolanic calcined clay. The thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis of the clay used reveal that only a moderate temperature of around 800 °C is required for its calcination which preserves energy and reduces CO2 emissions compared to 1600 °C to produce clinker cement. The strength development showed a slow early-age reactivity but an appreciable enhancement in long-term which demonstrates a remarkable latent hydraulic potential of the clay used. It was also found that adding an optimum amount of the calcined clay enhances the thermal properties. The annual energy performance of a typical housing in the hot climate of Muscat, Oman, was evaluated using DesignBuilder software, a whole-building simulation tool. The simulation results showed insignificant savings in annual energy consumption when the developed mixes are used as plastering materials. The clay alkali-activated with NaOH has, however, showed great potential to enhance the mortar's long-term strength. Using locally engineered cementitious material in a partial replacement of Portland cement can further enhance durability and sustainability by reducing the manufacturing energy of the produced building material such as mortars and plasters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Calcination; Chemical composition; Clay; Compressive strength; Energy; Portland cement; Sarooj; Thermal properties","Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Computer software; Concretes; Differential thermal analysis; Durability; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Mortar; Plaster; Portland cement; Sodium hydroxide; Soils; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Thermodynamic properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; Annual energy consumption; Cement based material; Cementitious materials; Chemical characterization; Consumption of energy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mechanical and durability properties; Mechanical and thermal properties; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091623225

Global climate models (GCMs) are invaluable tools both for understanding the drivers of these changes and predicting future Arctic climate evolution. While GCMs are continually improving, there remain difficulties in representing cloud processes which occur on scales smaller than GCM resolution. Since clouds influence the Arctic energy and water cycles, their accurate representation in models is critical for robust future projections. In this work, we examine the representation of Arctic clouds and precipitation in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), comparing the newly released version (CESM2 with CAM6) with its predecessor (CESM1 with CAM5). To isolate changes in the Arctic mean state, we compare preindustrial control runs. Arctic cloud ice has decreased slightly, while cloud water has increased dramatically in CESM2. Annual mean liquid-containing cloud (LCC) frequency has increased from 19% in CESM1 to 51% in CESM2. Since LCCs strongly modulate downwelling radiation at the surface, their increase has led to an increase in mean downwelling longwave (+22 W m−2) and corresponding decrease in downwelling shortwave (−23 W m−2) radiation. The mean Arctic surface temperature increased from 257 K in CESM1 to 260 K in CESM2, with the largest seasonal difference in winter (+6 K). Annual average snowfall has decreased slightly (−1 mm month−1), while rainfall has increased (+5 mm month−1). ©2020.

Yet there has been very little analysis of the impacts of such developments on the performance of urban transport systems. These impacts are potentially complex. On the positive side, automation has the potential to increase road capacity, make driving available to more people, and reduce accidents and emissions. On the negative side, it could attract users away from public transport, walking and cycling, substantially increase traffic levels and stimulate urban sprawl. These impacts cannot currently be measured empirically and, by the time that they can, it will be too late to change the implementation model to rectify any resulting problems. Predictive assessments are therefore needed. This paper considers the possible impacts of automated vehicles, predicts their effects on the urban land use and transport system, and discusses the policy implications. We focus on automation of the car fleet, and do not consider the potential of automation of public transport or freight. Methods: We consider the literature on the range of attributes of automated vehicles which might affect transport and land use patterns, and suggest potential outcomes for each over the period to 2050. These include the proportion of automated vehicles in the car fleet, whether automated vehicles are privately purchased or publicly shared, the impacts on network capacity, the reduced need to pay for and walk from parking places, the potential reduction in the value of in-vehicle time and the potential use by current non-drivers. We represent these attributes in an expanded causal link diagram of the urban land use and transport system and import those causal links into the MARS system dynamics model. We determine from the literature a level for each attribute, and test the impacts in a set of ten scenarios using an updated MARS model of Leeds. Results: Based on our input assumptions, we find that car-km in 2050 could be over 50% higher than in the business as usual scenario. Public transport use could fall by 18%, threatening accessibility for those dependent on it, while walking and cycling could fall by 13%, reducing their health benefits. Overall person-km would rise, suggesting a reduction in sustainability. A requirement that all automated cars are shared vehicles could reduce these adverse impacts somewhat, but the effects are sensitive to the charge per km. Discussion: Our use of a single value for each attribute means that our analysis is exploratory, but the size of the resulting impacts demonstrates the importance of understanding the scale of systems response to each of the attributes which we have considered. It will be important to manage the way in which automated cars are introduced into urban areas, if they are not to lead to a worsening of the urban environment, accessibility and health. A requirement to make all such vehicles part of shared fleets offers one way forward, but more work is needed to understand the way in which use of such fleets should be charged. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Land use; Modal choice; Urban transport","automation; land use; parking; public transport; transport vehicle; transportation policy; transportation system; urban transport; walking; England; Leeds [England]; Leeds [Leeds (DST)]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087488254

One option is the implementation of operational measures that aim to avoid those atmospheric regions that are in particular sensitive to non-CO2 aviation effects, e.g., where persistent contrails form. The quantitative estimates of mitigation potentials of such climate-optimized aircraft trajectories are required, when working towards sustainable aviation. The results are presented from a comprehensive modelling approach when aiming to identify such climate-optimized aircraft trajectories. The overall concept relies on a multi-dimensional environmental change function concept, which is capable of providing climate impact information to air traffic management (ATM). Estimates on overall climate impact reduction from a one-day case study are presented that rely on the best estimate for climate impact information. Specific weather situation that day, containing regions with high contrail impact, results in a potential reduction of total climate impact, by more than 40%, when considering CO2 and non-CO2 effects, associated with an increase of fuel by about 0.5%. The climate impact reduction per individual alternative trajectory shows a strong variation and, hence, also the mitigation potential for an analyzed city pair, depending on atmospheric characteristics along the flight corridor as well as flight altitude. The robustness of proposed climate-optimized trajectories is assessed by using a range of different climate metrics. A more sustainable ATM needs to integrate comprehensive environmental impacts and associated forecast uncertainties into route optimization in order to identify robust eco-efficient trajectories. © 2020 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to clarify mycorrhizal dependency and heterotrophy level in various phenotypes of mixotrophic Pyrola japonica (Ericaceae), encompassing green individuals, rare achlorophyllous variants (albinos) and a form with minute leaves, P. japonica f. subaphylla. These three phenotypes were collected in two Japanese forests. Phylogenetic analysis of both plants and mycorrhizal fungi was conducted based on DNA barcoding. Enrichment in 13C among organs (leaves, stems and roots) of the phenotypes with reference plants and fungal fruitbodies were compared by measuring stable carbon isotopic ratio. All plants were placed in the same clade, with f. subaphylla as a separate subclade. Leaf 13C abundances of albinos were congruent with a fully mycoheterotrophic nutrition, suggesting that green P. japonica leaves are 36.8% heterotrophic, while rhizomes are 74.0% heterotrophic. There were no significant differences in δ13C values among organs in both albino P. japonica and P. japonica f. subaphylla, suggesting full and high mycoheterotrophic nutrition, respectively. Among 55 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected as symbionts, the genus Russula was the most abundant in each phenotype and its dominance was significantly higher in albino P. japonica and P. japonica f. subaphylla. Russula spp. detected in P. japonica f. subaphylla showed higher dissimilarity with other phenotypes. These results suggest that P. japonica sensu lato is prone to evolve mycoheterotrophic variants, in a process that changes its mycorrhizal preferences, especially towards the genus Russula for which this species has a marked preference. © 2020, The Botanical Society of Japan.","Albino; DNA barcoding; Evolution; Mixotrophy; Russula; Stable isotope","DNA barcoding; heterotrophy; Japan; microbiology; mycorrhiza; phylogeny; plant leaf; Pyrola; rhizome; symbiosis; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Heterotrophic Processes; Japan; Mycorrhizae; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Pyrola; Rhizome; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093976127

To contribute to this, we have performed an evidence map of roadmaps for zero and low energy and carbon buildings (ZLECB) worldwide, including a list and classification of documents in an on-line geographical map, a description of gaps, and a narrative review of the knowledge gluts. We have retrieved 1219 scientific documents from Scopus, extracted metadata from 274 documents, and identified 117 roadmaps, policies or plans from 27 countries worldwide. We find that there is a coverage bias towards more developed regions. The identified scientific studies are mostly recommendations to policy makers, different types of case studies, and demonstration projects. The geographical inequalities found in the coverage of the scientific literature are even more extreme in the coverage of the roadmaps. These underexplored world regions represent an area for further investigation and increased research/policy attention. Our review of the more substantial amount of literature and roadmaps for developed regions shows differences in target metrics and enforcement mechanisms but that all regions dedicate some efforts at national and local levels. Roadmaps generally focus more on new and public buildings than existing buildings, despite the fact that the latter are naturally larger in number and total floor area, and perform less energy efficiently. A combination of efficiency, technical upgrades, and renewable generation is generally proposed in the roadmaps, with behavioral measures only reflected in the use of information and communication technologies, and minimal focus being placed on lifecycle perspectives. We conclude that insufficient progress is being made in the implementation of ZLECB. More work is needed to couple the existing climate goals, with realistic, enforceable policies to make the carbon savings a reality for different contexts and stakeholders worldwide. © 2020 The Author(s).

Any landslides consist of different top-down slope zones: removal, transit-depletion, and accumulation zones. These slope parts can demonstrate different successional behavior of plant community and carbon (C) cycling during post-sliding seral stages. To address this issue, soil respiration (SR), hydrothermal conditions (mineral soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm (ST5, °C), and gravimetric soil water content at a depth of 0–5 cm in mineral soil horizon (SWC5, %)), total soil C (TC) and nitrogen (TN) contents, and soil microbial activity at the middle (depletion zone) and lower (accumulation zone) slope parts of the landslides with different history have been studied. The most significant differences between the middle and lower slope positions were found at the ground microsites (or G-plots) of the L2001 landslide. Thus, here, a midslope part occurred to be a high source of C compared to the lower part. Midslope of L2001 was characterized by significantly higher SR at G-plots as well because of better hydrothermal conditions and more intensive vegetation regeneration. The accumulation zone of L2001 characterized by the lower SR despite significantly higher microbial activity due to the high nutrient level of the soil moved from the top, likely favored to promotion of the soil C stabilization processes. Despite the registered ST5 differences in the E-plots and the G-plots between middle and lower slope positions of the L1972 landslide, SR, TC, TN, and soil microbial activity did not differ significantly. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boreal ecosystems; Landslides; Permafrost; Soil C and N contents; Soil microorganisms; Soil respiration","Landslides; Permafrost; Soil conditioners; Soil moisture; Comparative studies; Hydrothermal conditions; Microbial activities; Permafrost degradation; Soil microbial activities; Soil water content; Stabilization process; Vegetation regeneration; Stabilization; comparative study; hydrothermal system; landslide; microbial activity; microbial community; permafrost; slope; soil nutrient; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092411153

This ignores other risk components, exposure and vulnerability, of which a major contributor is urbanization. We develop simplified analyses that can be applied to other PICs. By dividing climate risks into hazard and exposure components we determine how urbanization contributed to present-day risks and then predict how growing climate change hazards may increase future risk, using the Republic of Palau as a case study. Results show that urbanization was responsible for 94% of the buildings exposed to coastal flooding today. Projected sea level rise, 30.2 cm by 2050, only increased exposure of today’s buildings by 0.5%. In both present and future scenarios exposure resultant from urbanization was more significant than sea level rise. Our water scarcity index showed urbanization caused 3 of the 7 recorded water shortages from 1980–2018. From 2041–2079, analysis of projected rainfall showed mean reductions between 1.6–16.6% and increased variance between 0.3–3.4%. This led to three times as many water shortages under present population levels. In historical and future scenarios exposure from increased population was just as significant in causing water shortages as rainfall variation. These findings suggest that urban management is an important tool to lower exposure to coastal flooding and water shortage and we recommend that decision makers prioritize urbanization within climate risk policy in Pacific Island Countries. © 2020 The Author(s).

Her actions sparked a historically large youth movement, leading to a series of school strikes across the world. Over the course of one week in September 2019, striking school children, students and other grassroots movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, called for everyone to participate in a global Climate Strike. This paper is based on comparative research with climate protesters in six cities: Brighton and London (United Kingdom), Montreal (Canada), New Haven and New York (USA), and Stavanger (Norway). Based on original interviews with 64 protesters, the study examines their knowledge, emotions, motivations, and actions in relation to climate change, including any lifestyle changes they have undertaken before or after their protests. Our findings show that protesters have varying degrees of knowledge about climate change, and have taken a range of actions in their own lives to address climate change. They also manifest a wide spectrum of emotions about climate change, and different motivations for taking part in climate strikes. These features are under-studied and dynamically evolving at the present conjuncture. On this basis, we call for expanded academic attention to human, emotional, epistemic, and seemingly mundane aspects of climate protests, their structural tendencies and relational expressions, and the implications for our ability to address underlying drivers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate protests; Climate strikes; Fridays for Future; Greta Thunberg; Social activism; Social movements","action plan; climate change; environmental justice; knowledge; lifestyle; psychology; Brighton; Brighton and Hove; Canada; Connecticut; England; London; London [England]; Montreal; New Haven; New York; Norway; Quebec [Canada]; Rogaland; Stavanger; United Kingdom; United States; Greta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092083633

These measures are generally associated with technical and mainly economic difficulties. This paper aims to show the technical and economic feasibility of achieving Passivhaus standard house in Chile, considering the budget of the maximum state subsidy currently available (Chilean Unidad de Fomento (CLF) 2000 ≈ 81,000 USD). The design was simulated in the Passive House Planning Package software to determine if the house could be certified with the selected standard. At the same time, the value of all the items was quantified in order not to exceed the stipulated maximum budget for a house considered as affordable. It was shown that in terms of design it is possible to implement the Passivhaus standard given the current housing subsidy. The designed housing ensures a reduction of 85% in heating demand and a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions during the operation, compared to an average typical Chilean house. © 2020 by the authors.

Their effects have been extensively studied individually, but we know less about their combined effect. This study analyzes the population changes in the plant community of the high mountain legume shrub habitat of Tenerife over 10 years (between 2009 and 2018), using alien herbivore exclusion plots distributed over two sectors with different patterns of climate. Our outcomes show contrasting effects of herbivory and climate in plant communities, with significant shifts in community composition. The dominant species, Teide broom (Spartocytisus supranubius), is negatively affected by both climate and alien herbivores, leading to a regression of its abundance. In contrast, a formerly rare species, Pterocephalus lasiospermus, is benefiting from warmer temperatures and from herbivore presence owing to its low palatability. Simultaneously, some thermal native species from the neighboring pine forest are invading the alpine ecosystem. We conclude that the alpine habitat is changing very quickly and differently according to whether it is in warmer or colder sectors of the summit of Tenerife.

Established in 1965, the network delivers 3.6 TWh to more than 20 million square meters of households industries and businesses, by means of a 1460km-long network. The system has been continuously upgraded and adapted to new technologies and already operates at relatively low temperature, with modernized substations. However, the delivered heat is still produced mainly by means of carbon intensive technologies. Conscious of the need to de-carbonise the city, a multi-year transition plan was established, where large investments have been secured, comprising greater interconnection levels, installation of large solar thermal plants and waste incineration plants, and the conversion of a power plant into CHP, among others. In this paper, the criteria for the selection of the technologies, the identification of enabling investments, interaction with stakeholders, securing of financing, and status of the plan are presented. After the execution of the de-carbonisation roadmap, it is expected that the DH system will reduce its carbon intensity by 50%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Carbonization; Cogeneration plants; District heating; Solar power plants; Sustainable development; Temperature; Waste incineration; Carbon intensity; Carbonisation; DH systems; District heating networks; Low temperatures; Solar thermal plants; Transition plan; Waste incineration plants; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097245004

However, organisations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office spaces by ensuring their bio-safety. While symptomatic employees can be screened out from buildings, asymptomatic employees can be handled mainly through social distancing. Using rules of thumb and being conservative (aggressive) in social distancing can lead to poor office space/energy utilisation (compromised bio-safety). Thus, there is a need for informed decision making about occupancy to ensure bio-safety. To this end, we consider the problem of maximising the office space utilisation while ensuring occupant bio-safety and comfort. Specifically, we algorithmically identify the maximum allowable occupancy and corresponding occupant placement in open-plan office space while bounding their likelihood of infection from the office. As a secondary objective, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, we consider the problem of minimising HVAC energy through the joint control of multiple actuators that serve the space. In addition to the temperature and humidity dynamics, we account for the spatial and temporal evolution of infection transmission in the office space. To the best of our knowledge, there is little prior work on joint bio-safety and comfort optimization. The optimization problem is computationally hard due to the underlying non-linear system dynamics. We present two greedy heuristics to solve the problems of maximising space utilisation and minimising the HVAC energy when feasible. We evaluate our approach using simulations for varying community infection rates, occupant exposure duration, and virus emission rate. Our approach performs better than standard regular placements that ensure a minimum separation between neighbours. For the range of parameters considered, our approach improves space utilization by at least 10% for the same new infection rate. Further, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, HVAC energy can reduce by up to 15% even while ensuring bio-safety. © 2020 ACM.","bio-safety; HVAC; model-driven; optimisation; simulation","Decision making; HVAC; Intelligent buildings; Linear systems; Office buildings; Optimization; Personnel; Viruses; Exposure durations; Greedy heuristics; Infection transmission; Non-linear system dynamics; Open-plan offices; Optimization problems; Temperature and humidities; Temporal evolution; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097200817

The present work moves from the systematic review of the documents, laws, and scientific studies concerning energy and climate initiatives to the analysis of the role of the Strategic Energy and Technology Plan (SET Plan) in the energy transition. Thus, the principal research question addresses the influence of the SET Plan on multi-level energy policies. To answer this, firstly, the juridical framework in which the SET Plan was instituted is provided; secondly, its correlation to the upcoming EDG is described and the targets identified by each Implementation Working Group (IWG) are discussed. Such a dissertation is followed by the investigation of the activities at various levels from the IWG on Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy. The study has confirmed that the SET Plan contributed to shaping the energy and climate policy at European, national, and regional levels by implementing synergies among different levels of governance, different sectors, and various stakeholders (both public and private). Furthermore, it eased the sharing of data on flagship projects by periodically monitoring the achieved results. © 2020 by the authors.

Generating projections using multiple climate scenarios can provide valuable insights for fisheries stakeholders regarding uncertainty arising from future climate data. Using a range of climate projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, we modelled abundance of eight commercially important bottom dwelling fish species across the Celtic Sea, English Channel and southern North Sea through the 21st century. This region spans a faunal boundary between cooler northern waters and warmer southern waters, where mean sea surface temperatures are projected to rise by 2 to 4°C by 2098. For each species, Generalized Additive Models were trained on spatially explicit abundance data from six surveys between 2001 and 2010. Annual and seasonal temperatures were key drivers of species abundance patterns. Models were used to project species abundance for each decade through to 2090. Projections suggest important future changes in the availability and catchability of fish species, with projected increases in abundance of red mullet Mullus surmuletus L., Dover sole Solea solea L., John dory Zeus faber L. and lemon sole Microstomus kitt L. and decreases in abundance of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L., anglerfish Lophius piscatorius L. and megrim Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis L. European plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. appeared less affected by projected temperature changes. Most projected abundance responses were comparable among climate projections, but uncertainty in the rate and magnitude of changes often increased substantially beyond 2040. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate potential risks as well as some opportunities for demersal fisheries under climate change. These changes will challenge current management systems, with implications for decisions on target fishing mortality rates, fishing effort and allowable catches. Increasingly flexible and adaptive approaches that reduce climate impacts on species while also supporting industry adaptation are required. © 2020 The Authors.

However, only few technologies, such as solar PV, LEDs, and electric vehicles, are currently on track to meet these targets. In contrast, many other technologies, such as nuclear power, biomass power, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are not on track. In this perspective, we conduct a thorough review of experience rates of low-carbon technologies that have been reported in the existing literature. We also draw on complexity theory, evolutionary economics, and cybernetic theory to develop a technology typology that helps explain systematic differences in technologies’ experience rates by distinguishing between technologies on the basis of (1) their design complexity and (2) the extent to which they need to be customized. Based on this typology, we derive implications for policy makers and climate and energy modelers. We argue that the Paris Agreement's reliance on the nationally driven green industrial policy only suits innovation in certain types of technologies, and thus, should be complemented by top-down measures to coordinate R&D, demonstration, deployment, and regulations across countries. We suggest that integrated assessment modelers and policy scholars concerned with the political feasibility and dynamics of interventions should take caution with respect to technologies with high design complexity and need for customization, where global experience rates might be substantially lower than what can be expected from the diffusion in current localized niche markets. Finally, while several approaches for measuring the design complexity and need for customization of technologies exist in the literature, innovation scholars should direct their efforts toward improving our understanding of how these approaches differ and toward characterizing different technologies along the two dimensions in a systematic and replicable manner. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Accelerating innovation in low-carbon technologies is fundamental in order to achieve global climate targets.

This study aims to propose a new miniaturized, low cost and portable no dispersive infrared (NDIR) system for detecting CO2 gas. Design/methodology/approach: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based channels with Au coating because of its high reflection properties in IR region were used in this work. The optical windows were fabricated using PDMS polymer which is cost effective and novel in comparison to other conventional methods. The effects of channel dimensions, lengths and entrance angle of light on optical path length and losses were analyzed with four types of channel using both simulation and experimental tests. Findings: The simulation results indicate that the 0 degree light entrance angle is the most efficient angle among different investigated conditions. The experimental data are in agreement with the simulation results regarding the loss and optical path length in different types of channel. The experimental tests were performed for the 0.5% up to 20% of CO2 concentration under constant temperature and humidity condition. The results show that the device with 5 and 2 cm channels length were saturated in 4% and 8% concentration of CO2 gas, respectively. Response and recovery times were depending on gas concentration and channels specifications that in average found to be 10 S and 14 S, respectively, for the largest size channel. Moreover, the environment humidity effect on detection system performance was investigated which had no considerable influence. Also, the saturation fraction absorbance value for devices with various dimensions were 0.62 and 0.8, respectively. Practical implications: According to the performed curve fitting for practical situation and selected CO2 concentration range for experimental tests, the device is useful for medical and environmental applications. Originality/value: PMMA with Au deposition layer was used as a basic material for this NDIR system. Besides, a novel PDMS optical window helps to have a low cost device. The effects of channel dimensions, lengths and entrance angle of light on optical path length and losses were analyzed using both simulation and experimental tests. Using narrowband optical filter (100 nm bandwidth) helps to have a system with good CO2 selectivity. In addition, experimental tests with different channel dimensions and lengths covered a considerable range of CO2 concentration useful for medical and environmental applications.

To evaluate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electric power sector, an extended Kaya identity equation and the Logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method are applied to Northwest China from 1998 to 2017. Six explaining factors are analyzed, including carbon intensity, energy mixes, generating efficiency, electrification, economy and population. The results show that driving forces of CO2 emissions from electricity system varied greatly among provinces. Generally, economic growth has mainly contributed to increase CO2 emission, while the improvement in the power-generating efficiency has crucially decreased CO2 emission. In 2017, Promoting electrification directly increased CO2 emissions from electric system, but indirectly reduced CO2 emissions from the whole region by 5.10% through the estimation of a clean development mechanism method. Therefore, local governments are suggested continuing to promote electrification to guide future emission reduction, while enterprises and individuals need to make their own contributions to low-carbon development. Recommendations for Resource Managers: Variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of all five provinces in Northwest China are analyzed. Logarithmic mean Divisia index analysis is used to study the main drivers of CO2 emission change. Improvements in the generating efficiency significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Due to electrification effects, CO2 emissions from electric power increased, but CO2 emissions from the region decreased. Economy effects were still the biggest drivers affecting CO2 emission. © 2020 The Authors.

First of all, these problems were caused by the need to strengthen the energy independence of the Baltic States, since historically its power systems worked in synchronous mode with the United power system of Russia, depending on its mode of operation. It was the Baltic States' desire to eliminate energy dependence on a single energy supplier that determined their desire to integrate their transmission networks into the electrical system of continental Europe. The solution to this problem allows the Baltic States to strengthen their energy independence and become a full participant in the electricity market of continental Europe. Aspects of integration of the Baltic power systems with the power systems of continental Europe are considered. There are made the analysis of the current state and development of the infrastructure for the Baltic States electric systems, the development of electricity trade between the Baltic States and continental Europe, the problems of shortage and increase of base capacity in the region. The characteristics of the energy and climate national plans published by the Baltic States are given, which consider their intentions to develop renewable energy production for the period up to 2030, which provide for a significant increase in electricity production due to wind farms.

Social vulnerability in 2030, 2040 and 2050 is predicted based on the RCP8.5 climate change scenario that projects drought intensities and rising sea levels. Social vulnerability was based on the three dimensions of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity using 18 socio-economic and five climate indicators identified by experts. All but one indicator related very strongly to the dimension it sought to represent. Despite improvements in adaptive capacity over time, social vulnerability increased between 1988 and 2017 and rates of change accelerated after change point years that occurred between 1998 and 2002 in most counties. Extrapolating past changes of each indicator over time enabled forecasts of social vulnerability in the future. While social variability decreased between 2017 and 2030, it increased again between 2030 and 2050. The lowest future social vulnerability is expected along the eastern PG coast, the greatest along the western PG and the GO. The worsening of socio-economic indicators contributed to increased sensitivity, and increased drought intensities plus the expected rise in sea levels will lead to social vulnerabilities in 2050 comparable to present levels. Between 1.4 and 1.7 M people will live in areas that are likely submerged by water in the future. About 80% of these people live in six counties with variable social vulnerabilities. While counties with lower social variabilities might be better able to cope with the challenges posed by climate change, adaptation programs to enhance the resilience of the residents in these and the remaining counties along the PG and the GO need to be implemented soon to avoid uncontrolled mass migration of millions of people from the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Coastal hazard; Demographic indicators, RCP 8.5; Vulnerability","Drought; Economics; Sea level; Adaptive capacity; Climate change scenarios; Climate indicators; Coastal communities; Drought intensities; Social vulnerability; Socio-economic conditions; Socio-economic indicators; Climate change; climate change; coastal zone; environmental assessment; prediction; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic indicator; trend analysis; vulnerability; adaptation; Article; climate change; coastal waters; drought; environmental exposure; environmental impact; geographic distribution; Gulf of Oman; Persian Gulf; population density; prediction; priority journal; sea level rise; sensitivity analysis; social aspect; social vulnerability; socioeconomics; trend study; Arabian Sea; Gulf of Oman; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087001059

Most researchers focus on the joint management of the IT and electrical infrastructures, few integrate cooling explicitly in their studies. One path that has been mostly forgotten so far is the potential for pre-cooling the data center when renewable energies are available. Recent works address this potential from an economical perspective to avoid peak prices, but none from an ecological perspective to reduce CO2 emissions. In our work, we fill the gap by investigating to which extent reducing the temperature when renewable energies are available has a potential interest, and how it compares to other temperature control strategies. We build on a strong physical model of heat dispersion and a MILP formulation of the problem at hand, and we propose heuristics to handle the cooling device at best with renewable energy. Finally, we run experiments on real data traces (IT and renewable energy) to derive the conclusions that pre-cooling has indeed an interest for reducing carbon emissions. © 2020 IEEE.","Cooling; Green data center; Pre-cooling; Renewable energy","Cooling; Data integration; Integer programming; Internet of things; Social networking (online); Carbon emissions; Cooling devices; Electrical infrastructure; Heat dispersions; MILP formulation; Physical model; Renewable energies; Research communities; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099460960

Thus, it is vital to develop effective energy and carbon policies for buildings in developing countries. Developing such effective policies in turn, needs well-structured policy networks consisting of efficiently connected key actors in policy implementation. A database search revealed significantly less progress in implementing the building energy and carbon policies in developing countries, compared with developed countries. Previous literature suggested Policy Network Analysis (PNA) as a powerful tool to assess current policy level actor coalitions, determine structural holes in stakeholder integration and decide on future policy improvements. Subsequently, a database search was carried out through the “Web of Science” publications repository to identify the previous PNA approaches and to identify a potential way forward. Among the available methods, Social Network Analysis (SNA) was identified as the most suitable and frequently used method which provides extensive analytical capabilities for policy network visualization and analysis. The preliminary findings lead to the novel SNA model that is proposed to map and assess required building energy and carbon policy networks which integrate both policy actors and constraints. This proposed model can be effectively utilized to identify the significance, centrality and relational structures of policy actors and policy constraints. This paper will benefit future researchers and relevant policy makers by providing an effective platform on which to further develop more effective energy and carbon policies for the building sector by strengthening stakeholder collaboration and integration. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

There have been some reports that species’ traits may be related to resistance and resilience. We sought to determine whether guild membership, ecological versatility or life-history traits of woodland birds were related to species’ resistance and resilience in the face of high-amplitude climatic fluctuations over two decades. There were four extensive survey programmes in temperate woodlands in Victoria, Australia, spanning the longest, most intense drought on record in the region (Big Dry: 1996–2010), a short, intense wet period (Big Wet: 2010–2012) and a return to very dry conditions (post-Big Wet: 2012–2016). We used species-specific reporting rates (RRs) to identify species having low resistance to the Big Dry, high resilience (recovery) during the Big Wet and low resistance over the whole survey period (1996–2016). Species falling into these three groups were compared with species not showing those responses, and the contrasting groups evaluated for systematic differences in ecological and life-history traits. Neither ecological nor life-history traits accounted for much variation in the three contrasts, suggesting that Big Dry- and overall-resistant species and Big Wet-resilient species were not coherent subsets of the terrestrial avifaunas. Given that species’ traits were not related to vulnerability or to immunity from climatic pressures, we probably need to concentrate on species directly rather than groups defined by common life-history or ecological traits. Moreover, it almost certainly will be more useful to focus conservation management on reducing pervasive, manageable pressures (e.g. natural resource extraction, land-use change, reductions of greenhouse gas emissions), which is likely to provide assemblage-wide benefits for birds and other taxa. © 2020 Ecological Society of Australia","climate change; degradation; extreme events; species recovery; species traits","amplitude; avifauna; bird; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; ecological approach; life history trait; long-term change; vulnerability; woodland; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085012119

Photo-thermo-catalysis (PTC) has presented a novel strategy that could utilize the full-spectrum sunlight to stimulate the synergy between photocatalysis (PC) and thermocatalysis (TC), which not only achieves high utilization efficiency of solar energy but also minimizes the energy consumption compared to sole PC and TC. This review strives to give a comprehensive overview of major advances of PTC. It starts with the fundamental mechanisms of PTC categorized by either heating mode (local and global) or photo-thermal synergic mode (thermal-assisted photocatalysis, photo-assisted thermocatalysis, photo-driven thermocatalysis and photo-thermal co-catalysis). Then, various photo-thermal materials are illustrated, including metals, semiconductors, carbon materials, etc. After that, we focus on the diverse applications of PTC, specifically in the fields of energy (CO2 reduction and H2 evolution), environment (VOCs and 4-NP degradations) and organic synthesis (Suzuki coupling and cyclocondensation reactions). Special emphasis is placed on the synergism of photo and thermal effect that leads to enhanced catalytic performances in PTC. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of PTC are discussed. We hope this review could shed some light on the fundamental mechanisms of PTC reactions and serve as a clearer guidance for synergistically high-efficient solar energy utilization systems in the future. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Full-spectrum; Photo-thermo-catalysis (PTC); Photocatalysis (PC); Solar energy; Synergism; Thermocatalysis (TC)","Energy utilization; Image enhancement; Organic semiconductor materials; Photocatalysis; Thermal conductivity; Catalytic performance; Cyclocondensation reactions; Diverse applications; Fundamental mechanisms; High utilizations; Organic synthesis; Renewable energies; Scale utilization; Solar energy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090719472

As the major source of air pollution, enterprises in the industrial and energy sectors are the most difficult to regulate in terms of polluting emissions. This paper aims to investigate what factors influence the intensity of environmental regulations on polluting enterprises based on environmental regulation theory and an empirical test. Firstly, this article builds a theoretic model of optimal regulation supply for local governments in order to examine the relationship between factors influencing the intensity of environmental regulation. Secondly, we use provincial panel data from 2008 to 2015 to test the theoretical hypothesis and use the generalized method of moments (GMM), the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method to address the endogeneity issue. The main finding of the study is that, in regions with a high concentration of polluting enterprises, not only is there more air pollution than in other regions, but the local governments might show partiality towards the polluting enterprises, which could impede the implementation of environmental regulation. © 2020 by the authors.

In many brittle faults, graphitic carbon is often associated with gouge or low-grade metamorphic rocks whereas in ductile faults, graphitic carbon commonly occurs in marble, schist or gneiss. Carbonaceous material gradually transforms from an amorphous into an ordered crystalline structure by increasing thermal metamorphism. The degree of graphitization is believed to be a reliable indicator of peak temperature conditions in the metamorphic rock. In this contribution, based on detailed field observations, the variably deformed and metamorphosed graphitic gneisses to phyllites, located within the footwall and hangingwall unit of the Cenozoic Ailaoshan-Red River strike-slip shear zone are studied. According to lithological features and temperatures determined by Raman spectra of carbonaceous material, these graphitic rocks and deformation fabrics are divided into three types. Type I is represented by medium-grade metamorphism and strongly deformed rocks with an average temperature of 509 °C and a maximum temperature of 604 °C. Type II is affected by low-grade metamorphism and deformed rocks with an average temperature of 420 °C. Type III is affected by lower-grade metamorphism and occurs in weakly deformed/undeformed rocks with an average temperature of 350 °C. Slip-localized micro-shear zones and laterally continuous or discontinuous slip-planes constituted by graphitic carbon aggregates are developed in Types I and II. The electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) lattice preferred orientation (LPO) patterns of graphitic carbon grains were firstly observed in comparison with LPO patterns of quartz and switch from basal <a>, rhomb <a> to prism<a> slip systems, which indicate increasing deformation temperatures. Comparison of quartz and graphite LPOs indicates that graphite LPOs show higher temperature conditions. According to the graphitic slip-planes, micro-shear zones with grain-size reduction and mylonitic foliation constituted by graphitic carbon minerals, we also propose that the development of fine-grained amorphous carbon plays an important role in rheological weakening of the whole rock during progressive ductile shearing. © 2020 The Authors","Graphitic carbon; Graphitic thermometry; Rheological weakening; Slip-localized micro-shear zone; Strain localization","Amorphous carbon; Deformation; Graphite; Lithology; Nanocrystalline materials; Quartz; Strike-slip faults; Deformation temperatures; Discontinuous slip plane; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Lattice preferred orientation; Low grade metamorphic rocks; Low-grade metamorphism; Strike-slip shear zones; Temperature conditions; Metamorphic rocks; carbon; deformation; gneiss; graphite; phyllite; rheology; rock mechanics; shear zone; strain analysis; thermometry; Ailao Mountains; China; Red River [Asia]; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091236208

Recent studies indicate a shift toward increased precipitation falling as rain, which is consistent with a warming climate. An approach is presented to estimate precipitation-phase partitioning across landscapes from 1948 to the present by combining fine-scale gridded precipitation data with coarse-scale freezing level and precipitation data from an atmospheric reanalysis. A marriage of these data sets allows for a new approach to estimate spatial patterns and trends in precipitation partitioning over elevational and latitudinal gradients in major water supply basins. This product is used in California as a diagnostic indicator of changing precipitation phase across mountain watersheds. Results show the largest increases in precipitation falling as rain during the past 70 years in lower elevation watersheds located within the climatological rain-snow transition regions of northern California during spring. Further development of the indicator can inform adaptive water management strategy development and implementation in the face of a changing climate. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Snow; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Adaptive water managements; Atmospheric reanalysis; Diagnostic indicators; Latitudinal gradients; Precipitation data; Precipitation phase; Transition regions; Western United States; Rain; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; regional climate; river basin; strategic approach; warming; water planning; water supply; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096210640

Studies of the subsurface flow mechanisms of CO2–brine are important for evaluation of sequestration potential and security. However, this process is complicated by the intrinsic heterogeneity of reservoir rocks. The main objective of this study was to identify CO2 distribution and saturation related to changing injection conditions, and to comprehensively compare the characteristics of different drainage processes, under small scale heterogeneous condition. An X-ray computed tomography machine and a micromodel were introduced to investigate the CO2/brine drainage process from pore to core scale in a wide range of injection rates at static and transient states, respectively. Four types of drainage experiments were conducted. Horizontal and vertical (upward) flow directions in a micromodel setup at ambient conditions and vertical (upward and downward) flow directions in a core-flood setup at in-situ conditions. Based on experimental results, it is found that, a higher injection rate gives rise to a higher displacement efficiency but a lower sweep efficiency. The stability of CO2 displacing front become weak with drainage development. The difference in pore structure leads to different CO2 saturation variation with CO2 injection rates change. Even the sand pack is almost homogenous at core scale, the impact of heterogeneous porosity is enhanced with increasing flow rates in upward drainage, while it weakens in downward drainage. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon dioxide; Drainage; Heterogeneity; Micromodel; X-ray computed tomography","Aquifers; Computerized tomography; Efficiency; Hydrogeology; Pore size; Pore structure; Reservoirs (water); Ambient conditions; Climate mitigations; Displacement efficiency; Drainage experiments; Heterogeneous conditions; Injection conditions; Saturated porous media; X-ray computed tomography; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087408380

The co-firing of biomass with coal can save coal resources and realize effective utilization of biomass. In this paper, brewery wastewater sludge (SD) and bituminous coal (BC) were blended for an experimental study which aimed to provide basic experimental data and operational guidance as a reference for practical application in power plants. The co-firing characteristics of sludge and bituminous coal were studied. The results show that the burnout temperature and ignition temperature decrease with an increase in the sludge blending ratio. The Comprehensive Combustion Index (CCI) first rises, then decreases, reaching a maximum at about 15%. Compared with the atmosphere with 79% N2 /21% O2, under the 79% CO2/21% O2 atmosphere, ignition is delayed and the burnout temperature is higher. Under an O2/CO2 atmosphere, as the O2 concentration improves, the thermo-gravimetric (TG) curve shifts to the low-temperature region, the burnout temperature drops significantly, and the comprehensive combustion characteristics are improved. With an increment of the heating rate, the curve of TG analysis shifts to the high-temperature region and the CCI increases. This study could provide helpful information on practical blending in coal-fired power plants for energy savings and emission reductions. © 2020 by the authors.

This results in a larger household storage losses in China than developed countries. Limited by resources, reducing postharvest losses has become an important measure to increase the food supply in China. This study used survey data from 1608 households in 28 provinces of China to measure the household storage by farmers and storage losses in 2015, then we simulated the effects of loss reduction. The results show that, first, amongst the four main crops, corn has the largest storage quantity and the highest storage loss rate in the households of Chinese farmers. The corn storage quantities reach 3220.15 kgs (kg), and the storage loss rate is 2.41%. Therefore, corn storage losses (in calories) are also the highest, at 271,317.1 kcal. Second, the household storage quantities and storage loss rates are different in various regions. The northeast experiences the highest storage loss (in calories), at 505,212.5 kcal, and the comprehensive loss rate is highest in the southwest, at 2.57%. Third, farmers generally use warehouses and bags to store grains in China. For japonica rice, wheat, and corn, storage in bags is associated with the lowest loss rate. Grains stored in cabinets are subject to more serious losses. Fourth, the loss reduction simulation under different standards shows that reducing farm storage losses has great effects that would aid in ensuring China's food security and saving resources. If the household storage loss rate falls to the advanced rate (1.00%), this can save 379,000 hectares of land, 140,600 tons of fertilizer, and 2.66 billion m3 of water, reduce carbon emissions by 510,600 tons, and meet the food consumption needs of 5.87 million people for one year. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Food security; Loss reduction effects; On farm storage; Storage losses","Digital storage; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Carbon emissions; Developed countries; Food consumption; Food security; Japonica rice; Loss reduction; Post-harvest loss; Saving resources; Food storage; farm; food security; food storage; food supply; household survey; maize; quantitative analysis; rice; wheat; agricultural management; Article; China; crop production; descriptive research; environmental factor; exhaust gas; fertilizer application; food intake; food security; food storage; geography; human; Japonica rice; land use; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; China; Japonica; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088393058

In this study, we examine the manageable portion of ground-level ozone using two simulations of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for the year 2010 and a probabilistic analysis approach involving 29 years (1990–2018) of historical ozone observations. The modeling results reveal that the reduction in the peak ozone levels from total elimination of anthropogenic emissions within the model domain is around 13–21 ppb for the 90th−100th percentile range of the daily maximum 8-hr ozone concentrations across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Large reductions in the 4th highest 8-hr ozone are seen in the regions of West (interquartile range (IQR) of 17–33%), South (IQR 22–34%), Central (IQR 19–31%), Southeast (IQR 25–34%), and Northeast (IQR 24–37%). However, sites in the western portion of the domain generally show smaller reductions even when all anthropogenic emissions are removed, possibly due to the strong influence of global background ozone, including sources such as intercontinental ozone transport, stratospheric ozone intrusions, wildfires, and biogenic precursor emissions. Probabilistic estimates of the exceedances for several hypothetical thresholds of the 4th highest 8-hr ozone indicate that, in some areas, exceedances of such hypothetical thresholds may occur even with no anthropogenic emissions due to the ever-present atmospheric stochasticity and the current global tropospheric ozone burden. Implications: Because air pollution is intricately linked to adverse health effects, National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for criteria pollutants to safeguard human health and the environment. Areas not in compliance with the relevant standards are required to develop plans and policies to reduce their air pollution levels. Regional-scale air quality models are currently being used routinely to inform policies to identify the emissions reduction required to meet and maintain the NAAQS throughout the country. This paper examines the feasibility of the 4th highest ozone, which is used to derive the ozone design value for NAAQS, complying with various current and hypothetical 8-hr ozone thresholds over CONUS based on the information embedded in 29 years of historical ozone observations and two modeling scenarios with and without anthropogenic emissions loading. © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Emission control; Ozone layer; Quality control; Regulatory compliance; Adverse health effects; Anthropogenic emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Inter quartile ranges; National ambient air quality standards; Probabilistic analysis; Probabilistic estimates; Regional air quality models; Ozone; ground level ozone; ozone; unclassified drug; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; decomposition; environmental monitoring; human; ozone layer; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); simulation; stochastic model; United States; wildfire; air pollutant; air pollution; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094913313

Implementation of respective policies addressing these targets mainly occur at sectoral and regional levels, and designing efficient mitigation strategies therefore relies on detailed knowledge about the mix of emissions from individual sources and their subsequent climate impact. Here we present a comprehensive dataset of near- and long-term global temperature responses to emissions of CO2 and individual short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) from 7 sectors and 13 regions - for both present-day emissions and their continued evolution as projected under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).We demonstrate the key role of CO2 in driving both near- and long-term warming and highlight the importance of mitigating methane emissions from agriculture, waste management, and energy production as the primary strategy to further limit near-term warming. Due to high current emissions of cooling SLCFs, policies targeting end-of-pipe energy sector emissions may result in net added warming unless accompanied by simultaneous methane and/or CO2 reductions. We find that SLCFs are projected to play a continued role in many regions, particularly those including lowto medium-income countries, under most of the SSPs considered here. East Asia, North America, and Europe will remain the largest contributors to total net warming until 2100, regardless of scenario, while South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara overtake Europe by the end of the century in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5.

Gibbs free energy minimisation is used to predict the synthesis gas composition. A detailed analysis of the different gas treatment processes that lead to either gasoline and diesel production, along with energy recovery as electricity, or hydrogen in either compressed or liquefied form is conducted.

To accommodate this unprecedented growth, adding more than 230 billion m2 of new floor area to the global building stock by 2060 is expected. As embodied emissions are responsible for 11% of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, an increase in embodied emissions from new construction will put tremendous additional pressure on the natural environment. To investigate the environmental impact of timber and potential of mitigating the increase in embodied GHG emissions from new residential constructions, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for the production stage of three low-energy modular buildings. The results suggested that by substituting reinforced concrete (RC) and masonry (M) with cross-laminated timber (CLT) in the building structure, 14.62% and 12.94% of emissions could be avoided on a building level, respectively. However, the substitution leads to a significant increase in land use impact. In order to get a sense of mitigation potential on the larger scale, the mitigation potential of embodied GHG emissions is investigated for an expected residential building stock new floor area growth predictions depending on the regional residential building structural material choice in the world key regions for periods from 2017 to 2060. Under the assumptions made, the preliminary results suggest that by 2060 a certain amount of emissions could be avoided if conventional structural materials were substituted with CLT, however, emissions from new floor area additions are still substantial. Moreover, global GHG mitigation potential raises new concerns and questions that need to be further investigated. In addition, the importance of considering the land use impact in the LCA studies of bio-based construction materials is highlighted. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Not much is known about temperature and precipitation trends along the different bioclimatic zones nor how changes in these parameters might impact the whole natural process, including biodiversity and ecosystems, in the CHAL. Analysis of daily temperature and precipitation time series data (1970–2019) was carried out in seven bioclimatic zones extending from lowland Terai to the higher Himalayas. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied to determine the trends, which were quantified by Sen’s slope. Annual and decade interval average temperature, precipitation trends, and lapse rate were analyzed in each bioclimatic zone. In the seven bioclimatic zones, precipitation showed a mixed pattern of decreasing and increasing trends (four bioclimatic zones showed a decreasing and three bioclimatic zones an increasing trend). Precipitation did not show any particular trend at decade intervals but the pattern of rainfall decreases after 2000AD. The average annual temperature at different bioclimatic zones clearly indicates that temperature at higher elevations is increasing significantly more than at lower elevations. In lower tropical bioclimatic zone (LTBZ), upper tropical bioclimatic zone (UTBZ), lower subtropical bioclimatic zone (LSBZ), upper subtropical bioclimatic zone (USBZ), and temperate bioclimatic zone (TBZ), the average temperature increased by 0.022, 0.030, 0.036, 0.042 and 0.051◦C/year, respectively. The decade level temperature scenario revealed that the hottest decade was from 1999–2009 and average decade level increases of temperature at different bioclimatic zones ranges from 0.2 to 0.27◦C /decade. The average temperature and precipitation was found clearly different from one bioclimatic zone to other. This is the first time that bioclimatic zone level precipitation and temperature trends have been analyzed for the CHAL. The rate of additional temperature rise at higher altitudes compared to lower elevations meets the requirements to mitigate climate change in different bioclimatic zones in a different ways. This information would be fundamental to safeguarding vulnerable communities, ecosystem and relevant climate-sensitive sectors from the impact of climate change through formulation of sector-wise climate change adaptation strategies and improving the livelihood of rural communities. © 2020 by the authors.

We investigate the effects of cations at the aqueous electrolyte-Cu(211) interface on adsorbate binding energies and the electrolyte structure using density functional theory (DFT). Charging the interface via explicit Na+ has systematic effects on adsorbate-electrolyte interactions and conformations. We describe specific local adsorbate-ion interactions, including direct alkali ion-adsorbate coordination and hydrogen bonding via ion-coordinated water molecules. The relative importance of these specific interactions and purely electrostatic field-adsorbate interactions is investigated by comparing the DFT-calculated ion effects to those predicted by purely electrostatic models of the interface and the adsorbates. We find that the trend in ion effects among different adsorbates at constant surface charge density is well explained by a purely electrostatic interaction model. The binding energy of OCCHO is found to depend strongly on the surface charge density as well as the spatial distribution of ions at constant surface charge density. These effects are also explained by a purely electrostatic local electrostatic field-adsorbate model. This indicates that alkali ion effects can be mainly attributed to purely electrostatic field interactions and that the local field at ion-stabilized active sites can depend significantly on both the overall charge density and on the spatial distribution of ions at constant charge density. This work provides new insight on alkali ion effects on a variety of adsorbates relevant to the CO2 and CO reduction reactions by describing specific local ion-adsorbate interactions, systematic changes in adsorbate-electrolyte interactions induced by explicit surface charge, and comparisons of the calculated effects on binding energies to simple electrostatic field-adsorbate models to explain trends among various adsorbates and at varying surface charge densities and supercell configurations. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Charge density; Copper compounds; Density functional theory; Electrolytes; Electrostatic separators; Electrostatics; Hydrogen bonds; Molecules; Pollution control; Positive ions; Reduction; Spatial distribution; Surface charge; Adsorbate interactions; Aqueous electrolyte; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrolyte properties; Electrostatic models; Specific interaction; Systematic changes; Systematic effects; Binding energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096844146

Polyploidy has often been considered to confer adaptation to cold stress in plants. However, the mechanisms by which abscisic acid (ABA) regulates non-structural carbon (NSC) in polyploids, yielding an advantage in various ecological contexts, are largely unknown. Here, we have compared transcriptomic data from two Fragaria species in response to cold stress to assess ABA-regulated cold tolerance mechanisms. Endogenous ABA and proline content as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase activities of tetraploid Fragaria moupinensis were higher than those of diploid F.pentaphylla under control conditions. Cold stress significantly increased proline content and SOD activity in both Fragaria species. We found that accumulation of soluble sugar and non-structural carbon under cold stress are key factors underlying cold resistance in F. moupinensis. Under cold stress, compared to F. pentaphylla, ABA-related genes exhibited significant differences in regulation. In contrast, in F. moupinensis, some anti-oxidation genes and transcription factors were up-regulated relative to F. pentaphylla under cold stress. In total, 1274 genes were associated with ABA. Our results revealed up-regulated ABA-related genes, anti-oxidant genes, and transcription factors and the consequent accumulation of NSC to likely underlie cold tolerance in tetraploid F. moupinensis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ABA pathway; Bioinformatics; Carbohydrates; Cold response; Polyploidy; Transcriptome","abscisic acid; antioxidant; cold tolerance; ecophysiology; environmental stress; gene expression; genomics; local adaptation; ploidy; Fragaria; Fragaria pentaphylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089799283

In the particular case of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes, there is a clear need for data sets related to the (carbon dioxide + oxygen) mixtures that this work aims to address. This work provides new experimental (p, ρ, T) data for three binary (CO2 + O2) mixtures with mole fractions of oxygen x(O2) = (0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) mol·mol−1, in the temperature range T = (250 to 375) K and pressure range p = (0.5 to 13) MPa. The measurements were performed with a high-precision single-sinker densimeter with magnetic suspension coupling. The density data were obtained with estimated expanded relative uncertainties of 0.02% for the highest densities and up to 0.3% for the lowest ones.The results were compared to the corresponding results calculated by the current reference equations of state for this kind of mixtures, namely the EOS-CG (combustion gases) and the GERG-2008 equation of state, respectively. The EOS-CG yields better estimations in density than the GERG-2008 equation of state. The results from the EOS-GC model show no systematic temperature dependence.

In the last 3 decades, the Caribbean region has undergone frequent and intense heat waves, storms, floods, and droughts. This has had a detrimental impact on population health and well-being, including an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. Recent advances in climate science have enhanced our ability to anticipate hydrometeorological hazards and associated public health challenges. Here, we discuss progress towards bridging the gap between climate science and public health decision-making in the Caribbean to build health system resilience to extreme climatic events. We focus on the development of climate services to help manage mosquito-transmitted disease epidemics. There are numerous areas of ongoing biological research aimed at better understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we emphasise additional factors that affect our ability to operationalise this biological understanding. We highlight a lack of financial resources, technical expertise, data sharing, and formalised partnerships between climate and health communities as major limiting factors to developing sustainable climate services for health. Recommendations include investing in integrated climate, health and mosquito surveillance systems, building regional and local human resource capacities, and designing national and regional cross-sectoral policies and national action plans. This will contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and maximising regional development partnerships and co-benefits for improved health and well-being in the Caribbean. © 2020 Lowe et al.

Even if huge steps forward have been done worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for the release of NOx and SOx, while the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for the emission of NH3 deriving from the barn, the manure storage, management and final field application. In this study, the emission of PM2.5, NOx and NH3 is analyzed in the main provinces of the Lombardy region in which livestock activities are carried out, comparing emissions of 2016-2019 and those of 2020 during the lockdown determined by the spread of Covid-19 disease. The aim is to understand if and how a change in air emissions can be identified. The results show that PM2.5 and NOx reduced, most of all in urban areas, whereas NH3 maintained the same trend of previous years.

Rather than being politically and economically neutral activities, climate change mitigation projects tend to objectify the value of carbon, land and labour, contributing to a process of commodification of nature and social relations. In this specific case study, a set of values – equality and autonomy – central to the Ngaju people, the indigenous population in Central Kalimantan, become contested in the course of the climate change mitigation project. These central values are produced in everyday activities that include mobility and the productive base – subsistence and market-based production – among the Ngaju people. On the other hand, the climate change mitigation project-related environmental practices and actions produce values that point to individual (material) benefit and stratification of the society. The aim of the paper is to draw attention to and create understanding of value production and related tensions in the efforts to ‘fix’ environmental degradation problems through the climate change mitigation pilot project in Central Kalimantan. © 2020 The Authors.

It is often assumed that snow hydrology will change in proportion to climate warming, but this oversimplifies the complex non-linear physical processes that drive precipitation phases and snowmelt. In this study, snow hydrology predictions made using a physical process snow hydrology model for 44 mountains areas worldwide enabled analysis of how snow and hydrological regimes will respond and interact under climate warming. The results show a generalized decoupling of mountain river hydrology from headwater snowpack regimes. Consequently, most river hydrological regimes shifted from reflecting the seasonal snowmelt freshet to responding rapidly to winter and spring precipitation. Similar to that already observed in particular regions, this study confirms that the worldwide decline in snow accumulation and snow cover duration with climate warming is substantial and spatially variable, yet highly predictable from air temperature and humidity data. Hydrological regimes showed less sensitivity, and less variability in their sensitivity to warming than did snowpack regimes. The sensitivity of the snowpack to warming provides crucial information for estimating shifts in the timing and contribution of snowmelt to runoff. However, no link was found between the magnitude of changes in the snowpack and changes in annual runoff. © 2020 The Author(s).

Five 210Pb dated sediment cores, collected from seagrass meadows dominated by Thalassia testudinum in the northern Mexican Caribbean touristic corridor Cancun-Riviera Maya, were used to establish temporal trends of organic carbon (Corg) content, burial rates and stock variation over the past 100 years. Corg contents (0.17–1.94%) and burial rates (2.0–252 g m−2 yr−1) were generally within the lower end range reported for seagrass meadow sediments worldwide. Corg stock gradually increased over the past decades, associated with increasing sediment accumulation, possibly caused by inland erosion promoted by agricultural and forestry activities and, in the recent decades, by a rapid increase of urban development due to a fast growth of the tourist industry and population, likely causing fertilization of coastal waters. Seagrass meadow sediments in the northern Mexican Caribbean coastline showed long-term Corg storage and preservation, since ~ 40 to ~ 100 years depending on the core, which emphasizes the need to protect these ecosystems against impacts of global change, and their incorporation into climate change mitigation strategies should be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","210Pb dating; Cancun-Riviera Maya; Caribbean Sea; Land-use change; Sediment accumulation rates","carbon storage; climate change; coastal water; global change; organic carbon; seagrass meadow; temporal variation; urban development; Cancun; Mexico [North America]; Quintana Roo; Riviera Maya; Thalassia testudinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087033713

We implemented a survey across several regions with varying policy experience, using representative samples from Canada (n=1,552) and the US state of California (n=484). The survey evaluated respondents’: (1) awareness of each policy, (2) support and opposition for these policies, and (3) associations with personal characteristics. We find that policy awareness is similarly low in all regions, with fewer than 5% mentioning any of the policies in an open-ended question. Once prompted with multiple-choice style questions, stated awareness is higher for a VES (33–53%), followed by a LCFS (19–38%), and then a ZEV mandate (6–17%). In some cases, awareness is higher in regions that actually had a given policy in place, or for a longer period. Support for strong VES and LCFS is similarly high across regions (around 60–80% support) and support for a strong ZEV mandate is lower (34–55% support) – though all have higher support than strong carbon pricing (22–30%). Regression analyses indicate that policy support is most strongly associated with respondent values and trust in government, with only a minor role for demographic factors. Interaction effects indicate that policy support in the province of Quebec and California is associated with a lack of trust in the federal government but greater trust in provincial or state governments. Conclusions indicate that policymakers may want to focus on policies that are both effective and acceptable to the public. © 2020 The Authors","Climate policy; Low-carbon fuel standard; Public support; Survey; Vehicle emissions standard; ZEV mandate","Carbon; Regression analysis; Surveys; User experience; Vehicles; Demographic factors; Federal governments; Interaction effect; Open-ended questions; Personal characteristics; Representative sample; State governments; Vehicle emission; Public policy; environmental policy; fuel; marketing; public attitude; standard (regulation); supply chain management; survey; traffic emission; transportation policy; California; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091734238

The results show that continuous rainfall with small-magnitude rainfall (0.3–0.5 mm h−1) has an obvious effect in reducing the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 except for O3. There is an upper limit of the impact of continuous rainfall on air pollutants. The reduction of concentrations of particulate pollutants at the level of 300–2500 m is due to its participation in the nucleation process. When rainfall occurs and vertical diffusion is not restricted, the concentration of pollutants on the ground are reduced more quickly by being transported to high altitude. In urban areas with near-surface inversion, there is an anti-correlation between concentrations and wind speed. The correlation coefficients for the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 with the wind speed are −0.85, −0.86, −0.77 and −0.82, respectively. In suburban stations with the small initial concentrations, the decrease of concentrations is mainly due to the increase of rainfall intensity, but has little relationship with the height of PBL and the wind speed. The small gradient of sea level pressure (less than 1 hPa) and the near-surface inversion in the Chengdu Plain are conducive to the accumulation of air pollutants. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollutants; Circulations; Rainfall; Scavenging; WRF-Chem model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089562963

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of both climate change and wildfires on water budget, sediment, and organic carbon by simulating the response of sub-catchments and in-stream processes to changes in future climate and wildfire scenarios. To achieve this, we applied a physical process-based hydrologic model, where an in-stream Organic Carbon Simulation Module was embedded within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT-OCSM), to the Elbow River watershed in Alberta, Canada. Post-wildfire conditions of both moderate and high burn severities were replicated in the model within two burn perimeters to assess in-stream organic carbon processes related to particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as state variables under changing climate. Results of the climate change scenarios indicated lower streamflow relative to the baseline period (1995–2014), particularly between May–August, with 25.3–46.9% less water in the near future (2015–2034) compared to 9.9–31.8% less water in the distant future (2043–2062). Sediment concentrations generally decreased, whereas TOC concentrations increased, in both the near future and distant future scenarios reflecting uncertainty in climate effects on water quality. Wildfire simulations compounded with climate change significantly changed local hydrology, increasing surface runoff, sediment, and TOC transport by over 500% in some study sub-catchments. However, at the watershed outlet, sediment yields only increased up to 6.5% and TOC yields increased up to 13.1%. Burn severity invoked a stronger watershed response than burn area, and greater relative changes were observed for wildfires occurring with the worst-case climate change scenarios. This study provided a strong basis for analyzing watershed responses to potential future wildfires. However, recommendations are provided for further model developments to account for wildfire consequences and feedbacks with hydrological and biogeochemical processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemical processes; Dissolved organic carbon; Hydrological processes; Particulate organic carbon; SWAT-OSCM","Aquatic ecosystems; Budget control; Catchments; Climate models; Fires; Organic carbon; Potable water; Rivers; Runoff; Sediments; Stream flow; Water quality; Water treatment; Watersheds; Biogeochemical process; Climate change scenarios; Dissolved organic carbon; Increasing temperatures; Particulate organic carbon; Sediment concentration; Soil and Water assessment tools; Total Organic Carbon; Climate change; aquatic ecosystem; climate change; dissolved organic carbon; drinking water; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem structure; forested catchment; organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; sediment transport; streamflow; total organic carbon; water quality; wildfire; Alberta; Canada; Canada; Elbow River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089808092

Little is known about whether short-term seasonal drought and rewetting events influence the dominant microbes involved in C-and N-cycles. Here, we applied metaproteomics at different subsurface sites in winter, summer and autumn from surface litter layer, seepage water at increasing subsoil depths and remote located groundwater from two wells within the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory, Germany. We observed changes in the dominance of microbial families at subsurface sampling sites with increasing distances, i.e., Microcoleaceae dominated in topsoil seepage, while Candidatus Brocadiaceae dominated at deeper and more distant groundwater wells. Nitrifying bacteria showed a shift in dominance from drought to rewetting events from summer by Nitrosomandaceae to autumn by Candidatus Brocadiaceae. We further observed that the reductive pentose phosphate pathway was a prominent CO2-fixation strategy, dominated by Woeseiaceae in wet early winter, which decreased under drought conditions and changed to a dominance of Sphingobacteriaceae under rewetting conditions. This study shows that increasing subsurface sites and rewetting event after drought alter the dominances of key subsurface microbes. This helps to predict the consequences of annual seasonal dynamics on the nutrient cycling microbes that contribute to ecosystem functioning. © 2020 by the authors.

From glovebox-protected X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and in situ PICTS measurements we determined that the reduction of CO2 is associated with heterolytic dissociation of H2 into In-H§- and HO-H§+ centres accompanied by an increase in average carrier trap energies; increased carbonate formation in a photo/thermal reactor state of H2 + CO2, and an average trap energy decrease of 0.11 eV from H2 to a CO2 + H2 mixture, which correlates with binding energy shifts of the OH shoulder of the O1s spectra.

Previous studies aiming to quantify this risk have suggested a wide range of results, from minimal to disastrous capacity loss. In this analysis, we used a power plant modeling tool to study how a variety of power plant configurations respond to varying meteorological conditions. We developed tools that enable the analysis of the climate impacts on power plant operations for a spectrum of geographic situations and technological configurations. We also used these tools to conduct a case study for US coal and natural gas power plants in 2050, under climate change scenario representative concentration pathway 4.5. Our study indicates that rising air temperatures are unlikely to seriously threaten capacity and efficiency at power plants at most locations, provided that wet recirculating and dry cooling systems are designed adequately. Our results allow for simpler modeling of power plant capacity deratings given ambient conditions, highlight potential regions of risk, and underscore the importance of incorporating climate factors into the electric power system’s design and planning. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Electricity generation; Meteorological shifts; Power plants","Cooling systems; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Natural gasoline plants; Climate change scenarios; Design and planning; Dry cooling systems; Meteorological condition; Natural gas power plants; Power plant capacities; Power plant modeling; Power plant operations; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; cooling; fossil fuel; natural gas; operations technology; power plant; thermodynamics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091528869

In Chile, regulations and initiatives for their protection have been created, which are conditioned by the influences, interests and interrelationships of the players involved in the governance system. This research analyzed the case of the wetland located in Pichicuy, currently administrated by the Municipality of La Ligua. It researches in greater depth the role of local governments in the governance of wetland protection, considering the participation of the network of players from different spheres and territorial scales. Mixed methods of social research were used to analyze the influence, interests, types of relationship and centrality measures using the Analysis of Social Networks and the UCINET 6 platform. The local government of La Ligua performs, through its Environment Department, roles that are relevant for the governance of the wetland: (1) gaining political support to manage and implement actions about the wetland, (2) acting as an intermediary between the players from different spheres of society, and (3) leading alliances with higher-scale players. These roles are strengthened by the support and resources provided by the players of the network with high interest and influence in the protection of the wetland. However, there are challenges in municipal dynamics, for example, the need to more strongly attract and involve the Municipal Council, since it has a great influence on local government decisions. It is relevant to strengthen governance for the protection of wetlands in small and rural locations, for which the local government must play a very important role, for example, through institutional recognition of the wetland and facilitating the participation of players at a local scale. © 2019 Universidad del BÃ­o BÃ­o.

In the Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) context, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) addresses routing techniques for building an efficient transportation system in an urban environment. In order to improve traffic management, CAVs use real-time traffic data to disseminate faster routes for vehicles. Meanwhile, Cloud Computing is used to manage the traffic congestion situation, but it is not a suitable option for low-latency requirements of autonomous vehicles. Fog-based approaches dealing with traffic congestion found in the literature do not consider the use of caching for a routing scheme. Therefore, we propose a reliable caching mechanism for autonomous vehicle path planning based on Fog Computing, which is called ReCall. ReCall caches real-time traffic information from different regions to dynamically perform route recommendations. The results have shown that ReCall is able to reduce travel time and emissions. © 2020 IEEE.","Cache; CAVs; Fog; ITS","Autonomous vehicles; Fog computing; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Travel time; Urban transportation; Intelligent transportation systems; Real-time traffic datum; Real-time traffic information; Routing techniques; Social and economic impacts; Transportation system; Urban environments; Vehicle path planning; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101320329

Surely, they often overcome multiple challenges, including natural hazards exacerbated by climate change. Yet their actions are increasingly examined through the framework of resilience, a notion developed in the North, and increasingly adopted in the South. To what extent eliminate’ do these initiatives correspond to the concepts that scholars and authorities place under the resilience framework? Design/methodology/approach: Three longitudinal case studies in Yumbo, Salgar and San Andrés (Colombia) serve to investigate narratives of disaster risks and responses to them. Methods include narrative analysis from policy and project documents, presentations, five workshops, six focus groups and 24 interviews. Findings: The discourse adopted by most international scholars and local authorities differs greatly from that used by citizens to explain risk and masks the politics involved in disaster reduction and the search for social justice. Besides, narratives of social change, aspirations and social status are increasingly masked in disaster risk explanations. Tensions are also concealed, including those regarding the winners and losers of interventions and the responsibilities for disaster risk reduction. Originality/value: Our findings confirm previous results that have shown that the resilience framework contributes to “depoliticize” the analysis of risk and serves to mask and dilute the responsibility of political and economic elites in disaster risk creation. But they also show that resilience fails to explain the type of socioeconomic change that is required to reduce vulnerabilities in Latin America. © 2020, Gonzalo Lizarralde, Holmes Páez, Adriana Lopez, Oswaldo Lopez, Lisa Bornstein, Kevin Gould, Benjamin Herazo and Lissette Muñoz.","Adaptation; Climate change; Informality; Narrative; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088239622

In this work, amorphous carbon films (a-C), NiCo2O4 (NCO) and NCO/a-C bilayer films as protective layers were prepared on the surface of silicon, respectively. By comparing these protective layers of Si photoanode, we find that the NCO film can effectively protect Si from corrosion. It can not only lower initial potential but also increase photocurrent density. The NCO films were found to have the best catalytic performance. The photocurrent density of the NCO (60 nm)/Si photoanode is 185.6 mA/cm2 and that of the NCO (60 nm)/a-C (14 nm)/Si photoanode reaches high to 586.4 mA/cm2 at a voltage of 6 V vs SCE. The carbon interlayer reduces the width of depletion region built with n-Si, which further improves the current density of the NCO/Si photoanode. The photocurrent density of the NCO/a-C/Si photoanode is more than three times higher than that of the NCO/Si photoanode.

However, in the context of China, the life cycle energy-saving and emission-reduction effects of extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and the optimal applicable vehicle size and driving conditions for EREVs have been rarely studied. In this study, based on the life cycle assessment theory, the resource consumption, energy exhaustion, and environmental impact of EREVs were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, a differential evaluation model of ecological benefits was established for comparing EREVs with other vehicles with different power sources. Finally, scenario analysis was performed in terms of different vehicle sizes and driving conditions. The results have shown that EREV has great advantages in reducing mineral resource consumption and fossil energy consumption. The consumption of mineral resources of EREV is 14.68% lower than that of HEV, and the consumption of fossil energy is 34.72% lower than that of ICEV. In terms of environmental impact, EREV lies in the middle position. The scenario analysis has revealed that, for EREV in China, the optimal vehicle size is the passenger car and the optimal driving condition is the suburban condition.

This article addresses the matter of how to plan urban wind corridors more efficiently by proposing a “ventilation potential coefficient” (VPC) as well as providing an index for natural cold sources. The study additionally proposes a surface urban heat island (SUHI) index as a means of evaluating the severity of the heat island effect. Based on these three indexes, a new method of categorizing urban climatic zones, called “Climatopes”, is developed. Using the above methods, data from 2016 meteorological observation stations and Landsat8 satellites, as well as urban planning materials and basic geographical information on a scale of 1:2000 are used to create an Urban Climate Analysis Map (UCAnMap) and formulate a plan for the construction of wind corridors in the urban centre of Ji’nan. The results reveal that the intensity of urban heat islands in Ji’nan is closely related to a lack of natural cold sources, the specific layout of different types of land use as well as poor planning of urban “function zones”. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the VPC and other factors such as surface roughness length, building height, the density of building frontal area and floor area ratios. The potential wind corridors could also be determined based on the VPC. Based on an UCAnMap composed of 11 Climatopes and background wind environments, this article ascertains that it would be possible to construct a network of 3 Level One corridors (each over 500 m wide) and 11 Level Two corridors (each over 80-m wide). Additionally, regulatory measures and protective legislation are proposed for the corridors, as well as for the city’s overall development. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate modeling; cold air; detection method; Landsat; satellite imagery; urban planning; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089454522

An emerging pathway is leveraging vertical data to advance three-dimensional (3-D) spatial metrics to interpret landscape attributes and quantify 3-D patterns. Objectives: We introduced a suite of spatial metrics to recognize 3-D morphological characteristics of residential communities and examine their temporal changes. Methods: Seventeen 3-D spatial metrics were designed and computed at patch-, class-, and landscape-levels based on building footprints and height information in geographic information system (GIS). These metrics characterized 3-D forms of residential communities, including number, area, height, shape, and diversity. These 3-D features were further used to recognize five typical built types based on the scheme of local climate zone (LCZ) and quantify their 3-D morphological changes with rapid urbanization. Results: The 3-D spatial metrics performed well in describing vertical and volumetric characteristics of residential communities and distinguishing five typical built types in Xiamen, China. Our results indicated that architectural styles of residential communities changed from homo- to mixed-rise buildings and from compact to open arrangement with rapid urbanization. Conclusions: Both 2-D and 3-D features are key attributes of the landscape. Our results showed that 3-D spatial metrics were not only useful tools for quantifying surface patterns but also key complements to vertical feature characterization, offering advantages in representing urbanization over the existing indexes. Growing 3-D datasets have great potential to develop more valuable metrics for characterizing spatial features, capturing ecological processes, and understanding drivers in various landscape contexts. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","High-resolution urban grids (HUGs); Industrial ecology; Local climate zones (LCZs); Remote sensing; Spatial metric; Spatial pattern; Urban form; Urban sustainability","GIS; landscape; spatial analysis; temporal variation; three-dimensional modeling; urban population; urbanization; China; Fujian; Xiamen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089077894

By injecting the fuel through a small tube within the combustion chamber, a leaner air-fuel mixture is generated compared to the conventional free spray approach, which significantly inhibits the soot formation and helps to reduce the dependence of the engine on after-treatment systems. However, the soot reduction mechanism is still not fully understood. Therefore, in this work, a three-dimensional computational investigation was performed to explain the experimental results. Four different reduced chemical mechanisms were used to simulate the reacting spray A (n-dodecane) data from both the Engine Combustion Network group and literature. An improved post-processing method was also proposed to investigate the detailed combustion feature. The results revealed that the ignition processes using different mechanisms were all dominated by the same reaction CH2O + OH = HCO + H2O. Of the four reduced mechanisms, Yao mech demonstrated the best-predicted performance. Compared to the free-spray case, the DFI case generated a longer ignition delay and lift-off length and lower soot concentration owing to the significant reduction of air entrainment and longer core jet velocity from the duct exit to the lift-off length location. In addition, the DFI case had a significantly longer low-temperature heat release region but a shorter high-temperature heat release region and a smaller core between these two regions, which helps to reduce the sooting tendency. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Air; Air entrainment; Damage detection; Diesel engines; Fuels; Soot; Temperature; Compression ignition; Computational investigation; High temperature heat release; Injection compression ignition engine; Low temperature heat release; Numerical investigations; Postprocessing methods; Predicted performance; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096022739

While converting the majority of organic carbon to biogas (mainly consisting 60%CH4 + 40%CO2), the high-strength anaerobic digestion liquor consists of a high level of nitrogen concentration. The feasibility of utilizing biogas produced in-situ to achieve satisfactory nitrogen removal performance from partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor was examined in this study. To this end, a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was used to couple nitrite- or nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO) and anammox microorganisms, which was supplied with synthetic biogas and partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor (470 mg NH4+-N/L + 560 mg NO2−-N/L). The MBfR achieved not only nearly complete nitrogen removal (~99%), but also a practically useful nitrogen removal rate above 1 kg N/m3/d. Due to the acidification caused by excessive CO2 supply from biogas, pH dropping was observed. Two corresponding strategies, i.e., intermittent alkali dosing and intermittent nitrogen gas flushing, were developed to control the pH at neutral. Mass balance based on batch tests and microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing both showed the joint contribution of anammox bacteria and anaerobic methane oxidizers to the nitrogen removal. This study proved the potential and capacity of MBfR to access complete nitrogen removal from high-strength wastewater by using biogas produced in-situ, thus leading to a significant reduction of external carbon addition in practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anammox; Biogas; Membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR); Nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO); Partial nitritation; Side-stream","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Microorganisms; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; RNA; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic methane oxidations; External carbon addition; High strength wastewater; Membrane biofilm reactor; Microbial community analysis; Nitrogen concentrations; Nitrogen removal rates; Wastewater treatment plants; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; biogas; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; RNA 16S; ammonium derivative; biofuel; nitrogen; RNA 16S; anaerobic digestion; biofilm; biogas; membrane; microbial community; nitrogen; organic carbon; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; acidification; amplicon; anaerobic digestion; anammox bacterium; Article; biofuel production; carbon source; controlled study; gene sequence; liquid; microbial community; nitrification; nitritation; oxidation; pH; priority journal; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; denitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; river; sewage; waste water; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Rivers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088655503

Here, we show that emission reduction is the major driving force for the PM2.5change, contributing to a PM2.5decrease by 37% to 55% in the four YRD major cities (i.e., Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Hefei), but the MDA8 O3increase is driven by both emission reduction (29%-52%) and variation in meteorological conditions (17%-49%). Among all pollutants, reduction in emissions mainly of primary PM contributes to a PM2.5decrease by 28% to 46%, and NOx emission reduction contributes 7% to 10%. Although NOx emission reduction dominates the MDA8 O3increase (38%-59%), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission reduction lead to a 5% to 9% MDA8 O3decrease. Increased O3promotes secondary aerosol formation and partially offsets the decrease of PM2.5caused by the primary PM emission reductions. The results demonstrate that more coordinated air pollution control strategies are needed in YRD. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Here, we carried out a 62-day laboratory experiment to see if density-dependent addition of macroalgal biomass can influence the seagrass decomposition process, including seagrass detritus carbon chemistry, greenhouse emissions, and bacterial communities. We found that higher density macroalgal addition stimulated microbes to decompose ∼20% more of the seagrass biomass compared to other treatments, which was also reflected in enhanced (∼twofold) greenhouse gas emissions. Although the composition of the seagrass-associated microbiome communities was unaffected by the addition of macroalgae, we showed that high macroalgal addition caused a relative depletion in the ROC as lignin and lipid compounds, as well as δ13C depletion and δ15N enrichment of the seagrass detritus. These results suggest that macroalgal blooms may stimulate the remineralization of recalcitrant components of seagrass detritus via cometabolism, possibly through providing available energy or resources for the synthesis of ROC-degrading enzymes within the resident microbial population. This study provides evidence that cometabolism can be a mechanism for leading to reduced seagrass blue carbon sequestration and preservation. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Blooms (metal); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Bacterial community; Carbon sequestration; Decomposition process; Degrading enzymes; Greenhouse emissions; Laboratory experiments; Macroalgal blooms; Microbial populations; Plants (botany); carbon; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; lignin; lipid; nitrogen 15; algal bloom; carbon emission; carbon fixation; carbon flux; decomposition; lignin; lipid; macroalga; organic carbon; seagrass; algal bloom; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; controlled study; decomposition; macroalga; measurement; nonhuman; seagrass; thermogravimetry; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; seaweed; Bacteria; Biomass; Breakdown; Carbon; Chelation; Density; Ecosystems; Processes; Bacteria (microorganisms); Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Seaweed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095808145

To examine the impact of four ambient air pollutants on the COVID-19 mortality rate in the United States of America. Methods. Using publicly accessible data collected by the United States Census Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, county-level mortality rates were regressed on concentration values of ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Four confounder variables were included in the regression analysis: median household income, rate of hospital beds, population density, and days since first confirmed case. Results. Regression analysis showed that ground-level ozone is positively correlated with county-level mortality rates regardless of whether confounders are controlled for. Nitrogen dioxide is also shown to have a direct relationship with county-level mortality rates, except when all confounders are included in the analysis. Conclusions. High ground-level ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations contribute to a greater COVID-19 mortality rate. To limit further losses, it is important to reflect research findings in public policies. In the case of air pollution, environmental restrictions should be reinforced, and extra precautions should be taken as facilities start reopening. © 2020 Pan American Health Organization.

Thus, evaluating and quantifying the effects of these policies are important for improving their efficacy and prioritizing them. In this paper, a projection of the long-term CO2 emissions from city-scale urban buildings whose energy use and construction are governed by multiple diverse policies is presented. A system dynamics (SD) model is established to simulate the causal path through which different policies directly and indirectly affect the energy use of and CO2 emissions from buildings in the urban building stock, and the model is applied to Beijing, China. The results show that under the existing set of policies, the primary energy use by urban buildings in Beijing will peak around 2025 and that energy-related CO2 emissions will peak around 2022. The model also reveals interference between the policy for promoting green building construction and the policy limiting the urban building stock area. Targeted measures for improving and prioritizing these policies are suggested, and implications for policy design and implementations are proposed. The framework developed in this study can be used not only to project long-term energy-related emissions from building sectors but also to evaluate the effects of policies on emissions.

Particular interest has been focused on liquid products because of the easier separation process and higher value comparing to traditional gaseous products. Formic acid (or formate) can be one of the most economically viable reduction products. Nevertheless, few catalysts can meet the requirement for commercial-viable production, especially the current density. Herein, a hierarchical-Sn3O4 nanosheet (H–Sn3O4 NS) electrocatalyst is synthesized and applied into a three-compartment CO2 flow cell electrolyzer with ultra-high current density. The as-synthesized H–Sn3O4 NS electrocatalyst enables electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with the selectivity of 91.1% at −1.02 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as well as a partial current density of 421 mA cm−2, whose performance is among the best that has been reported for CO2 electrocatalysts. The superior performance is due to the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure, which supplies a large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) to facilitate mass and charge transfer. And the stability study with in-situ Raman spectroscopy and XRD characterization exhibited that the Sn3O4 materials could still maintain its original oxidation state under the maximum formate Faradaic efficiency of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The further theoretical calculation shows that the catalyst surface is beneficial for the formation of OCHO* (the intermediate of formate) than COOH* (the intermediate of CO) or H* (the intermediate of H2), which is in favor of the high activity and selectivity for formate in the experiments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrochemical; Nanosheet; Sn3O4; Three-dimensional","Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Current density; Electrocatalysts; Electron emission; Reduction; Electrochemical surface area; Environmental concerns; Faradaic efficiencies; Hierarchical structures; In-situ Raman spectroscopy; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Theoretical calculations; Threedimensional (3-d); Tin compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089892811

Optimizing urban spatial morphology to create a climate-friendly urban space is important for constructing human settlements that are environmentally suitable and consume low energy. This study focuses on local-scale city blocks, applying the local climate zone (LCZ) concept to quantify these city blocks and developing an urban canopy layer (UCL) model to calculate city block climatic conditions. A visualization-based spatial morphology optimization strategy is proposed by integrating the LCZ parameterization, UCL model, and geographic information system technology. This proposed strategy provides a thorough climate suitability optimization design road map for urban planners from a theoretical perspective. An efficient and easily useable integrated software is also developed from the technical operation perspective and verified using field-measured climatic data. The comparison results show that there are software-related errors when handling vegetation areas. This study contributes to developing a systematic approach to realize a climate-conscious and optimized urban spatial morphology. In future research, this proposed strategy can be applied in case studies in urban areas. Additional theoretical analysis of the heat/moisture transfer processes in different underlying surfaces can be further studied and embedded into the software calculation modules. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy balance; Local climate zone; Spatial morphology; Urban canopy layer; Urban climate","Highway planning; Morphology; Climate suitability; Integrated software; Optimization design; Optimization strategy; Software calculations; Spatial morphologies; Technical operations; Urban canopy layers; Climate models; conceptual framework; energy balance; GIS; optimization; parameterization; quantitative analysis; software; urban climate; urban morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091561267

Understanding the change of nitrogen deposition and its socioeconomic drivers in China is crucial for the function and sustainability of regional and global ecosystems. Here we presented satellite-derived nitrogen deposition constrained with the national ground-based measurements over China. We found that oxidized nitrogen deposition peaked at 7.0 kg N ha−1 in 2012, then decreased to 6.2 kg N ha−1 in 2017. In contrast, reduced nitrogen deposition increased continuously, and reached 12.6 kg N ha−1 in 2017. The Chinese Clean Air Act is responsible for the reduction of oxidized nitrogen emissions, while there is no current effective control policy for ammonia emissions in place resulting in reduced nitrogen deposition reaching levels of approximately twice that of oxidized nitrogen in 2017. The ratio of reduced to oxidized nitrogen deposition decreased from 1.30 in 2008 to 1.08 in 2011, while this ratio began to increase from 1.08 in 2011 to 1.56 in 2017. This suggests reduced nitrogen deposition would become more important in the air quality and their ecological consequences in the future. The total nitrogen deposition in China was about 3–4 times that in the US and Europe. The policy of controlling nitrogen pollution is urgent, especially for reducing ammonia emissions, while ensuring the sustainable production of agriculture and maintaining food security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dry and wet deposition; Nitrogen deposition; Oxidized nitrogen; Reduced nitrogen; Satellite observation","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Ammonia; Food supply; Oxidation; Sustainable development; Ammonia emissions; Ecological consequences; Ground based measurement; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen pollution; Reactive nitrogen; Sustainable production; Total nitrogen deposition; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087937784

Hydrological processes and the corresponding emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) during rainfall events are optimized by GI when the latter is compared with a traditional urban drainage system. This study establishes an city-scale quantitative analysis, based on hydrological processes, with which to assess the contribution of GIs to low-carbon urban drainage systems and cities. The emission factor method is applied to measure GHG emissions. Attributable sources of emissions are wastewater treatment plants and wastewater and rainwater pumps. The amount and rate of change in GHG emissions were selected as indicators of the impacts of GI-based urban drainage systems and a case study was conducted in Dongying, China, based on 48 hydrological scenarios from 1970 to 2017. The amount of annual GHG emissions decreased by 3752.5 to 26238.9 tons of CO2 equivalent at an average of 10677.3 tons/a. The rate of annual GHG emissions decreased by 25.9–68.7% with an average reduction of 45.9%. An S-shaped logistic curve fit the data, indicated that annual rainfall is non-linearly and positively correlated with both the amount and rate of annual GHG emissions mitigated. The probability of benefits to GHG emissions in the 48 hydrological scenarios is analyzed based on a Pearson type III distribution curve. These findings can provide information that local authorities can use to guide policies towards their goals of applying GIs to mitigate GHG emissions in the urban drainage system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Green infrastructure; Greenhouse gas mitigation effect; Rainwater management; Sponge city; Urban drainage system","Carbon; Drainage; Gas emissions; Probability distributions; Rain; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Distribution curves; Green infrastructure; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hydrological process; Hydrological scenarios; Rainwater management; Urban drainage systems; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; assessment method; emission control; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; mitigation; urban drainage; wastewater treatment plant; China; Dongying; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089844779

Therefore, this article conducts a more comprehensive and in-depth study of China’s carbon emissions from the perspective of the development of national economic sectors and taps the potential for emission reduction in various sectors. Taking into account the adjustment of the national economic sector and the current status of carbon emissions, the study period was from 2003 to 2017. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method was used to measure and analyze the impact of seven factors, including urban construction conditions, on the carbon emissions of various sectors. According to the commonalities and differences of the impacts, 42 sectors were aggregated into four categories. At the same time, the input–output structure decomposition analysis (IO–SDA) model was used to analyze the spillover effects of intersectoral carbon emissions. According to the research results, based on the characteristics of the four types of sectors, and fully considering the spillover effects, the improvement of life cycle management to control energy consumption in the entire supply chain was taken as the leading idea. Moreover, combined with the actual development situation, four types of sectoral carbon emission reduction paths and optimization strategies are proposed to establish a more sustainable demand structure in order to achieve emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors.

This study elaborated on the specific measures of OPCAP and the subject of implementation of the said measures, and based on the localization of CMAQ parameters, conducted scientific evaluation on the achievement of OPCAP implementation. The research findings are set forth as follows: OPCAP made pollutants reduced to a large extent, for example, the industrial emissions of VOCs and NOx were reduced by 8600 tons and 2150 tons, respectively. Compared to the corresponding period of last year, in August 2017, meteorological change made O3max, PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and CO reduced by 34.9%, 24.2%, 23.9%, 16.6% and 6.0%, respectively. After a series of measures including OPCAP were taken, O3_8h max was reduced by 6~10µg/m3 in most areas of Chengdu. Under equal meteorological conditions in August 2017, OPCAP made O3_8h max in the downtown of Chengdu reduced by 3.67% on average, and the concentration of NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5 and CO was reduced by 25.00%, 11.11%, 19.59%, 19.63% and 5.32% on a monthly average basis.

How to accurately estimate corporate carbon emissions in real-time directly affects this task. Therefore, a real-time estimation framework of corporate carbon emissions based on load identification is proposed in this paper. In the proposed framework, the total carbon emission consists of two parts: direct carbon emission and indirect carbon emission. First, a Convolutional Neural Network - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM) model is presented and employed to monitor the states of devices in a factory in real-time. Then, the direct carbon emission is estimated according to the state and related carbon emission intensity. Meanwhile, the indirect carbon emission can be obtained through multiplying the marginal carbon emission factor by the electricity consumption in the factory.

The issue of urban greenhouse gas emissions has become a global focus and a research hotspot. This paper analysed the causality of driving factors and identified the key elements such as urban population, economy, energy and motor vehicles through system dynamics (SD) and econometric model. Then, it conducted empirical analysis and explored the impact of factors on urban transportation carbon emissions taking Beijing as an example. The research results showed that in addition to energy consumption, other factors were positively correlated with traffic carbon emissions. It believed that in order to control urban traffic carbon emissions, we must control the urban population, economy and the number of vehicles rationally. With the optimization of energy structure, the structural adjustment of traffic energy consumption is conducive to energy conservation and emission reduction in the transportation industry, and the decoupling of the total energy consumption of traffic and the carbon emissions from transportation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Econometric model; Empirical analysis; Empirical studies; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy structures; Number of vehicles; Total energy consumption; Transportation industry; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097652506

However, the porosity and rock matrix may interfere with the fluid effect. The brine-saturated rock may have a similar response with the hydrocarbon reservoir, which cause misinterpretation. A new method, the ‘advanced fluid indicator’ method, is proposed to reduce the uncertainty in reservoir detection and characterisation by the rotation of the P-wave and shear moduli. This advanced fluid indicator exhibits the ability to identify the fluid type. The local empirical relationships are extracted from the well log data. Then the Monte Carlo forward modelling is constructed using the relationships. The advanced fluid indicator is calculated using the relative parameters. The correlation coefficient between the advanced fluid indicator and bulk modulus of the pore fluid reaches 0.9935 in the forward modelling, which indicates that the new method can be used to detect the fluid type directly. Deep learning is then applied to train a regression model using the rock physics dataset derived in the forward modelling. The advanced fluid indicator is calculated by the trained regression model using well log data. This method has been applied in S field in Malay Basin, South China Sea. It successfully detects all the reservoirs that are identified in the well log section. Furthermore, the advanced fluid indicator values indicate the fluid type of each reservoir. While the three currently used crossplot methods can also detect the three gas reservoirs, they are unable to separate the two oil reservoirs from non-hydrocarbon-bearing rocks clearly. Therefore, the proposed advanced fluid indicator method outlines an effective approach that combines hydrocarbon prediction and deep learning to detect and characterise hydrocarbon reservoirs with higher accuracy and lower ambiguity than current methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Elastic moduli; Hydrocarbons; Learning systems; Offshore gas fields; Oil bearing formations; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Regression analysis; Rocks; Seismic waves; Shear flow; Well logging; Correlation coefficient; Effective approaches; Elastic properties; Empirical relationships; Forward modelling; Hydrocarbon predictions; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Indicator methods; Deep learning; computer simulation; detection method; empirical analysis; forward modeling; hydrocarbon reservoir; machine learning; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; P-wave; regression analysis; reservoir characterization; shear modulus; uncertainty analysis; well logging; Malay Basin; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090244608

This paper considers the CO2 diffusion with the case of steady flow in heterogeneous porous media. The partial differential equations of CO2 diffusion in random velocity field are established based on the mass conservation equations of CO2- brine two-phase flow with the change of time scale and spatial scale under the influence of heterogeneity such as permeability and porosity. The random travel process of CO2 is quantified by joint probability distributions and joint statistical moments (mean and variance), and the diffusion model of CO2 particle in random velocity field is established under the condition of non-linear and immiscibility in heterogeneous porous media. The micro mechanism of diffusion in heterogeneous porous media is revealed by numerical simulation. The general conclusion of steady state flow of CO2 diffusion in heterogeneous porous media was verified by simulating Sleipner CO2-brine storage in Norway. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Diffusion; Geology; Partial differential equations; Porous materials; Probability distributions; Steady flow; Stochastic systems; Velocity; Heterogeneous porous media; Joint probability distributions; Mass conservation equations; Permeability and porosities; Random velocity fields; Statistical moments; Steady-state flows; Stochastic partial differential equation; Two phase flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096622999

The experiments were conducted at 240 ○C and 90 min with a 1:12 solid/liquid ratio, where blending ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1 with waste textile were investigated. As expected, the increase of fixed carbon and carbon content improved the fuel potential of hydrochar. The synergistic index (SI) analysis clearly indicated that significant synergistic effects occurred during co-HTC process. Specifically, all the SI values of hydrochar yield from co-HTC of waste textile with wood and paper were negative, while all SI values of hydrochar yield for waste textile with food were positive. Particularly, the SI values of fuel ratio for all hydrochars were positive which suggested co-HTC could promote to enhance the coalification degree of hydrochars. However, the undesirable increment of O content for hydrochars (derived from 75%waste textile-25% waste food and 50%waste textile-50% waste food) decreased the high heating value. The combustion behavior and nth-order kinetic model analysis showed that hydrochars derived from co-HTC rendered a more stable and lasting combustion profile. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrothermal co-carbonization; Physicochemical characteristics; Synergistic analysis; Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; Typical municipal solid wastes","Blending; Carbon; Carbonization; Textiles; Thermal processing (foods); Waste incineration; Co-carbonization; Combustion behavior; High heating values; Hydrothermal carbonization; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Nth order kinetics; Solid/liquid ratios; Synergistic effect; Municipal solid waste; hydrothermal activity; industrial waste; municipal solid waste; textile industry; wood; Carbonization; Food; Mixing; Paper; Solid Wastes; Textiles; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089670974

Herein, we demonstrate that oxygen-deficient ZnO/carbon dot (OD-ZnO/C) hybrid, rationally engineered with synergistically enhanced CO2/H2O activation ability and increased light utilization efficiency, showed excellent full spectrum (UV, visible and NIR light)-driven CO2 photoreduction. Under UV–Vis-NIR, Vis-NIR and NIR light separately, the optimized sample demonstrated high quantum yields of 0.26%, 0.13% and 0.05% for CO production, yields which are considerably superior to the reported values in the literature. The synergistic effects between OD-ZnO and carbon dots for visible- and NIR-driven CO2 reduction were systematically investigated. Experimental results showed that both the defect-induced sub-band in OD-ZnO and the upconverting emission from the carbon dots effectively increased the light utilization efficiency within the UV–Vis to NIR region, and the heterojunctions formed between OD-ZnO and carbon dots promoted the efficient separation of charge carriers. Meanwhile, the defect-rich surface ensures the efficient adsorption and activation of CO2/H2O into the key intermediate CO2–, formate, and hydroxyl species, which are effectively converted under light illumination from UV–Vis to NIR region.

In response, the signatories of the Paris Agreement (2015) have committed to limit the increase in global mean temperature to < 1.5 °C from pre-industry period, which is defined as 1950-1890. Considering that the protection of human life is a central focus in the Paris Agreement, the naturally endowed properties of the human body to protect itself from environmental extremes should form the core of an integrated and multifaceted solution against global warming. Scholars believe that heat and thermoregulation played important roles in the evolution of life and continue to be a central mechanism that allows humans to explore, labor and live in extreme conditions. However, the international effort against global warming has focused primarily on protecting the environment and on the reduction of greenhouse gases by changing human behavior, industrial practices and government policies, with limited consideration given to the nature and design of the human thermoregulatory system. Global warming is projected to challenge the limits of human thermoregulation, which can be enhanced by complementing innate human thermo-plasticity with the appropriate behavioral changes and technological innovations. Therefore, the primary aim of this review is to discuss the fundamental concepts and physiology of human thermoregulation as the underlying bases for human adaptation to global warming. Potential strategies to extend human tolerance against environmental heat through behavioral adaptations and technological innovations will also be discussed. An important behavioral adaptation postulated by this review is that sleep/wake cycles would gravitate towards a sub-nocturnal pattern, especially for outdoor activities, to avoid the heat in the day. Technologically, the current concept of air conditioning the space in the room would likely steer towards the concept of targeted body surface cooling.

Tackling this issue requires an accurate understanding of its trends and drivers. In this study, global risk regions of PM2.5 concentrations during 1998–2016 were spatiotemporally derived. Time series analysis was conducted in the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and three socio-environmental drivers: population, urban ratio, and vegetation greenness that can cause changes in the concentration of PM2.5. “High Risk” areas were widely distributed in India and China. In India and sub-Saharan Africa, the increased overall population was strongly correlated with PM2.5 concentrations. Urban ratio increased in both developed and developing countries. A “decoupling” phenomenon occurred in developed countries, where urban expansion continued while PM2.5 concentrations decreased. Vegetation greenness and PM2.5 were strongly correlated in High Risk zones. Although urban expansion and population growth generally reduce vegetation greenness, developed countries reduced PM2.5 while maintaining greenness, whereas developing countries increased PM2.5 with decreasing greenness significantly in High Risk regions. Ultimately, economic and national growth should occur without increasing PM2.5 concentrations. Recent cases from Europe and the eastern United States demonstrate that this is possible, depending on the development pathway. © 2020 The Author(s)","Global correlation analysis; Global trend analysis; PM2.5; Risk assessment; Socio-environmental drivers","Developing countries; Expansion; Population statistics; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Developed countries; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High-risk zones; PM2.5 concentration; Population growth; Spatial relationships; Sub-saharan africa; Vegetation greenness; Urban growth; concentration (composition); developing world; particulate matter; population growth; time series analysis; vegetation dynamics; Africa south of the Sahara; article; China; developing country; Europe; human; India; population growth; risk assessment; time series analysis; United States; vegetation; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; India; Sub-Saharan Africa; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; India; Particulate Matter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089242716

Despite policy and management recommendations to create pollinator habitat, the habitat requirements for at-risk bumble bees remains unclear. Most studies on bumble bee habitat are descriptive, focus on floral resources, occur at one spatial scale, or do not examine at-risk species. We provide the first thorough habitat description for two North American bumblebee species (Bombus terricola and Bombus pensylvanicus) at-risk of extinction. We asked the following questions: (i) What characterises B. terricola and B. pensylvanicus habitat? (ii) Are landscape variables, local variables, or flowering plant species more important determinants of habitat? (iii) do important variables change throughout the season? Surveys were conducted at 25 sites with a recent occurrence of either B. terricola, B. pensylvanicus, or both species across southern Ontario, Canada. Landscape variables were extracted from a 1-km buffer around each site. Local variables related to bumble bee resource requirements (floral, nesting and overwintering) and flowering species cover were measured in spring, mid-summer, and late-summer. We found that the proportion of different land cover classes at 1 km was a more important predictor of B. terricola and B. pennsylvanicus presence than local transect based variables such as floral richness or the patchiness of floral cover. We did not find any evidence of important variables changing temporally, but floral resources were consistently important throughout the season. Our results highlight that management of at-risk pollinator species requires consideration of species-specific habitat requirements. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society","Bombus; forage; habitat suitability; nesting; overwintering; pollinators; resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085118626

The control objective is to minimize cumulative NOx and hydrocarbon emissions while limiting visible smoke production and without compromising fuel economy or torque response. This is accomplished by using a supervisory model predictive controller (SMPC) and nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) in tandem. The SMPC controller coordinates the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate target and fuel supplied to the engine in real time to satisfy combustion quality constraints, while the NMPC controller tracks the EGR rate target by manipulating the EGR throttle, EGR valve, and variable geometry turbine. The NMPC controller uses MPC for feedforward and feedback in a novel configuration to simultaneously achieve fast tracking performance, disturbance rejection, and robustness. We demonstrate that the proposed diesel engine MPC controller is able to reduce cumulative emissions by 10% to 15% relative to a state of the art benchmark strategy when placed in closed loop with an engine on a transient dynamometer. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","automotive applications; constrained control; diesel; experimental validation; nonlinear model predictive control","Diesel engines; Disturbance rejection; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel economy; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Smoke; Smoke abatement; Combustion qualities; Cumulative emissions; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Experimental evaluation; Experimental validations; Hydrocarbon emission; Model predictive controllers; Variable geometry turbines; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091027852

Improving upon the commonly used Process-Based Life-Cycle Analysis (PLCA) and Environmentally-Extended Life-Cycle Analysis (EIO-LCA) models, we construct a Hybrid Life Cycle Analysis (HLCA) model and quantify both direct and indirect GHG emissions at the operational stage of WWTPs in Shenzhen, one of the fastest urbanizing cities in the world. Data are collected from 26 wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen, out of all 32, covering 5 commonly used wastewater treatment technologies in China, i.e. Sequencing Batch Reactor, Oxidation Ditch, Biological Filter, AAO-MBR and AAO. The results show that WWTPs using AAO-MBR technology have the highest GHG emission intensity, averaging 0.79 tons per m3, primarily due to its large electricity intensity required. WWTPs using other technologies emit 0.27 to 0.39 tons of GHGs per m3 of wastewater treated. GHG emissions associated with electricity use occupy the largest share, ranging from 65 to 75%. Therefore, transforming the energy structure of the electric power sector to low-carbon sources can reduce WWTPs operational GHG emissions. In total, GHG emissions from Shenzhen's urban wastewater sector have increased from below 0.5 million tons in 2012 to over 0.6 million tons in 2017. Inter-model comparison shows that EIO-LCA substantially underestimates the urban wastewater sector's GHG emissions using the water sector's average parameters while PLCA also results in minor underestimations due the omission of indirect emissions in the production stage of chemicals and other material inputs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid life cycle analysis; Urban wastewater treatment; Wastewater treatment technologies","Activated sludge process; Batch reactors; Biological water treatment; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Electric power sector; Electricity intensities; Life cycle analysis; Operational stages; Sequencing batch reactors; Urban wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment technologies; Greenhouse gases; emission; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; urban area; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; China; environmental impact; environmental management; hybrid life cycle analysis method; life cycle assessment; methodology; physical chemistry; priority journal; urban area; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water analysis; water quality; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088831302

However, the spatial resolution of existing global land use projections (e.g., 0.25°×0.25° in the Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2) datasets) is still too coarse to drive regional climate models and assess mitigation effectiveness at regional and local scales. To generate a high-resolution land use product with the newest integrated scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the representative concentration pathways (SSPs-RCPs) for various regional climate studies in China, here we first conduct land use simulations with a newly developed Future Land Uses Simulation (FLUS) model based on the trajectories of land use demands extracted from the LUH2 datasets. On this basis, a new set of land use projections under the plant functional type (PFT) classification, with a temporal resolution of 5 years and a spatial resolution of 5 km, in eight SSP-RCP scenarios from 2015 to 2100 in China is produced. The results show that differences in land use dynamics under different SSP-RCP scenarios are jointly affected by global assumptions and national policies. Furthermore, with improved spatial resolution, the data produced in this study can sufficiently describe the details of land use distribution and better capture the spatial heterogeneity of different land use types at the regional scale. We highlight that these new land use projections at the PFT level have a strong potential for reducing uncertainty in the simulation of regional climate models with finer spatial resolutions. © 2020 Science China Press","Future Land Uses Simulation (FLUS); Land use change; Land use simulation; Plant functional type; SSP-RCP scenarios","Climate models; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Image resolution; Different land use types; Land use dynamics; National policies; Plant functional type; Regional climate models; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial resolution; Temporal resolution; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088792878

It is critical for estimating various land use changes and their ecological effects, but the previous studies have failed to decouple the respective and the combined effects of different land use changes on ecosystem services. Net primary productivity (NPP) could be used to indicate many ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we employed a light use efficiency model to estimate the spatial and temporal dynamics of NPP in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area from 2000 to 2015, and designed four scenarios to analyze the relative roles of afforestation, urbanization and storing water on NPP dynamics. Our results documented that terrestrial NPP of the TGR area increased from 547.40 gC•m−2 to 629.96 gC•m−2, and carbon sequestration capacities were 31.66 TgC (1Tg = 1012g) and 36.79 TgC in 2000 and 2015, respectively. Climate change and land use change both could contribute to carbon sequestration with 4.08 TgC and 1.05 TgC. Among these land use changes, only afforestation could sequester carbon with 2.04 TgC, while urbanization-induced and impoundment-induced emissions were 0.12 TgC and 0.32 TgC, respectively, and other land use changes also could release 0.55 TgC of carbon. This finding suggested that although positive and negative environmental effects happened simultaneously over the past decades, green infrastructure could effectively offset the carbon emissions from urbanization and storing water in the TGR area, which provides some fundamental supports for further ecological restoration and contributes to empowering land use policies towards carbon sequestration and storage at the regional scale. © 2020 by the authors.

Three monitoring programs in Hong Kong report concentrations of ambient PAHs, namely (1) respirable suspending particle (RSP) speciation program that monitored benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) (1997 to March 2000), (2) total suspended particle speciation program that monitored BaP (1997–1999), and (3) toxic air pollutant monitoring program that monitors BaP and 16 other PAHs in the combined gas and particulate phases at two general urban stations once or twice a month since January 1998. In this work, we review all the available PAH measurements in Hong Kong during 1997–2016, with emphasis on the temporal trends of BaP and the other 16 PAHs. PAHs of 5–6 rings exhibit an ambiguous decline trend since 1998, with a negative Sen's slope that is statistically significant. Specifically, BaP was reduced by 78% from 1998 to 2016, with a Sen's slope of −0.013 ng m-3 year−1. Correlations of BaP with RSP major species of high source specificity and PAH diagnostic ratios are employed to explore the source origins of PAHs. Our analysis reveals that PAHs mainly come from a combination of vehicular emissions and biomass/coal combustion. The decline trend of PAHs is further found in consistence with the declined particulate matter emissions from vehicular exhaust and biomass/coal combustion. This study fills the data vacancy in the long-term trends of ambient PAHs for the Pearl River Delta region, one of the economically more advanced regions in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benzo[a]pyrene; Diagnostic ratio; Hong Kong; Long-term trend; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Sen's slope","Combustion; Pyrene; Environmental concerns; Monitoring programs; Pah diagnostic ratios; Particulate matter emissions; Pearl River Delta region; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Total suspended particles; Toxic air pollutants; Barium compounds; acenaphthene; acenaphthylene; anthracene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[e]pyrene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; chrysene; coal; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; fluoranthene; fluorene; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; naphthalene; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; benzo[a]pyrene; coal; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; biomass; China; combustion; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Hong Kong; particulate matter; seasonal variation; Hong Kong; procedures; Air Pollutants; Benzo(a)pyrene; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Hong Kong; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087485872

The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015 to 2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 36.9% and remained the main pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) showed the largest decrease of approximately 53.3%, and ozone (O3) increased by 116.6%. The proportions of fixed-source emissions and transported external-source emissions in this area increased. After the lockdown, O3 pollution was highly negatively correlated with the NO2 concentration, and the radiation increase caused by the PM2.5 reduction was not the main reason for the increase in O3. This indicates that the generation of secondary pollutants is influenced by multiple factors and is not only governed by emission reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AQI; COVID-19; Lockdown; NO2; O3; PM2.5","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality indices; Disease spreading; Emission reduction; External sources; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Multiple factors; Nitrogen dioxides; Traffic pollution; Air quality; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; particulate matter; viral disease; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; China; comparative study; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; human; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; virus virulence; air pollutant; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087332438

One of the keys to improving the photocatalytic activity of PCN is modifying the bridging N atoms. Herein, dicyandiamide was hydrothermally treated in triethanolamine aqueous solution; then, bridging N-modified PCN was obtained via condensation polymerization. The optimal bridging N-modified PCN sample, HCN-0.4, exhibited a negative shift of the conduction band, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime in comparison with the pristine PCN (BCN). According to the theoretical calculations, after methyl modification of the bridging N atoms in HCN-0.4, the carrier migration rate increased owing to the electron rearrangement. The hydrogen evolution rate of HCN-0.4 was 31.38 mmol/(h × g), which was 56.04 times higher than that of the pristine PCN (0.56 mmol/(h × g)) under visible light irradiation.

Strong solar cycle and solar zenith angle variations in peak emission intensity and altitude were revealed by the data: (1) Both the peak intensity and altitude increase with increasing solar activity, and (2) the peak intensity decreases, whereas the peak altitude increases, with increasing solar zenith angle. These observations can be favorably interpreted by the solar-driven scenario combined with the fact that photoionization and photoelectron impact ionization are the two most important processes responsible for the production of excited-state (Formula presented.) and consequently the intensity of (Formula presented.)

Cross-sectional analysis reveals that imports and exports exhibit opposite effects on manufacturing and high-tech industries, but demonstrate the same pollution-generating effect for the heavy industry sector. At the regional level, the effects are similar to those at the aggregate level. We also examine the impacts of other factors on PM2.5 pollution. Our empirical evidence shows that PM2.5 pollution is positively correlated with domestic sales, population density, economic growth, urbanization rate, and transportation, but negatively correlated with energy efficiency and industry structure.

Although positive relationships between biodiversity and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage have been found in experimental grasslands, biodiversity effects on SOC storage in natural forests remain debated. Based on a large dataset from 523 forest inventory plots across subtropical forests in China, we tested the relationship between biodiversity and SOC storage and examined whether environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, soil properties) and litter quantity (leaf litter and root biomass) and quality (leaf litter carbon to nitrogen ratio [leaf litter C/N]) had effects on SOC storage. Furthermore, we used linear mixed-effects models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, environmental conditions, and litter quantity and quality on SOC storage. We used structural equation models to test how these variables directly or indirectly affected SOC storage. We found that species diversity, together with climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation), leaf litter C/N and root biomass determined SOC storage in subtropical forests at a large spatial scale. SOC storage was most strongly affected by climatic factors, followed by leaf litter C/N. Species diversity had both direct and indirect (through root biomass and leaf litter C/N) effects on SOC storage after accounting for environmental conditions. We also found that the positive diversity–SOC storage relationships were stronger in low and medium mean annual precipitation. Our findings highlight that higher species diversity can lead to higher SOC storage and therefore the conservation of biodiversity could play an important role in climate change mitigation. © 2020","Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Environmental conditions; Litter quantity and quality; Soil organic carbon storage; Subtropical forests","Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Large dataset; Organic carbon; Soil testing; Soils; Tropics; Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio; Climate change mitigation; Environmental conditions; Linear mixed-effects model; Mean annual precipitation; Mean annual temperatures; Soil organic carbon storages; Structural equation models; Forestry; biodiversity; carbon storage; climate change; environmental conditions; environmental factor; forest ecosystem; forest soil; grassland; organic carbon; soil carbon; subtropical region; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Tropics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089103925

Using PM2.5 data simulated by an observation-fused air quality model and an integrated exposure-response model for the full range of PM2.5, we determined the premature mortality attributable to ambient PM2.5 across mainland China in 2016. Overall, the total number of PM2.5-related deaths nationwide was 1.31 million, of which lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke represented 0.13, 0.13, 0.42, and 0.62 million, respectively. Per capita PM2.5-related mortality in China was 95 per 100,000 person-years, and that of elderly people aged ≥75 years (1166 deaths per 100,000) was much higher than that of young people aged 25–44 years (11 deaths per 100,000). Additionally, there were significant spatial differences in premature deaths, which mainly occurred in regions with high PM2.5 levels or/and population density. Halving deaths across mainland China required an average of 63% reduction of PM2.5 nationwide and a decrease by 73% in high concentration regions exceeding 70 μg/m3 and 19% in low concentration locales below 10 μg/m3. Moreover, reducing PM2.5 to the WHO interim target I (IT-1) of 35 μg/m3 would only result in a 12.6% reduction in premature mortality, while a more exacting standard (reducing PM2.5 to 10 μg/m3) would avoid 73.0% of mortality. In particular, there is a large potential for reducing the high PM2.5-related mortality in heavily polluted locales. In conclusion, to further reduce premature mortality across mainland China, targets stricter than the IT-1 and tight policies to improve air quality and protect public health are necessary, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and patients with cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, particularly in areas with high premature mortality. © 2020","China; PM2.5; Premature mortality; Responses to reductions; Specific differences","Population statistics; Public health; Pulmonary diseases; Air quality improvement; Air quality managers; Air quality modeling; Cerebrovascular disease; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; High-concentration regions; Ischemic heart disease; Population densities; Air quality; air quality; emission control; epidemiology; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution policy; spatial variation; adult; aged; air pollution control; air quality control; air quality standard; Article; cancer mortality; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental policy; female; health hazard; human; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; particulate matter; population density; population research; premature mortality; priority journal; public health service; simulation; World Health Organization; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; particulate matter; premature mortality; China; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087340180

However, as natural gas combustion does result in some carbon emissions, government policy and monitor are needed to improve natural gas use, and reduce CO2 emissions. Previous research has tended to focus on natural gas production efficiency and the relationships between natural gas and economic growth; however, there have been few papers focused on natural gas consumption efficiency evaluations in terms of urban and industrial energy consumption efficiency and CO2 emissions efficiency. To fill this research gap, this study examined the natural gas consumption efficiencies (Natural gas consumption efficiency refers to the efficiency of natural gas from production to final consumer purchase) in 30 provinces/municipalities/autonomous in China from 2007 to 2016 by collecting and analyzing the main natural gas industry input-output index data: labor, natural gas pipe length, fixed assets, natural gas sales volume, residential gas supply, gas losses, and CO2 emissions. An Undesirable DDF (directional distance function) Dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis model was then used to analyze and compare the efficiencies in each natural gas industry index (gas industry index indicates whole indicator used on efficiency evaluation in this paper, such as labor, natural gas pipe length, natural gas sales volume, residential natural gas supply, natural gas losses, CO2 emission) in each province. We also set carry over variable which can link each period, here fixed assets is set as carry over due to its character that accumulates over period. It was found that the overall efficiency in 16 provinces. had been declining year on year and there were significant improvements needed in natural gas pipe length and natural gas losses; however, it was also found that the natural gas industry in most provinces needed to place greater importance on improving CO2 emissions efficiency. The results indicated that to improve overall gas industry operating efficiency and CO2 emission efficiency, new technologies were needed in several key areas: pipeline design, construction and maintenance management to reduce the loss rate in the old pipeline infrastructure, natural gas facilities to improve energy use, and personnel training and management to improve construction capabilities. This study is an interdisciplinary survey. Natural gas is an energy issue, CO2 emission is an environmental issue, and the method used in this study is DEA which is widely used in management and economic research. Therefore, this study combines different issues and the empirical data of China to do an interdisciplinary research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions efficiency; Natural gas industry; Undesirable directional distance function DEA","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Collector efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas supply; Housing; Human resource management; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gas well production; Personnel training; Purchasing; Sales; Urban growth; Directional distance function; Industrial energy consumption; Interdisciplinary research; Maintenance management; Natural gas combustion; Natural gas consumption; Natural-gas production; Pipeline infrastructure; Gas industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089729071

How the biotic and abiotic factors directly or indirectly regulate AGB remains unclear. To fill this gap, from 2014 to 2017, we conducted a rotational grazing experiment to examine the response of AGB to biotic and abiotic factors in Nagqu, a typical alpine meadow community on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Six yaks were rotationally grazed among three plots from July to September, meanwhile, three plots were set up to exclude from livestock as control; climate, plant biomass, and soil nutrients were investigated during grazing experiment, and then structural equation modeling was used to analyze the regulation of environmental factors on AGB. The results showed that precipitation affected AGB via affecting soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), compensatory growth rate, and belowground biomass indirectly; temperature can directly and negatively affected AGB. In contrast grazing exclosure, rotational grazing increased both AGB and its temporal stability in alpine meadow community significantly (p &lt;.05). The temporal stability of the AGB was positively related to the asynchrony between high- and low-palatability herbages (p &lt;.05). In conclusion, rotational grazing should be recommendable for alpine meadow management due to its benefits for community productivity and stability while current stocking rate should be reduced to a reasonable level, especially in a warm and drought year, to sustain plant compensatory growth under grazing. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","belowground biomass; compensatory growth; precipitation; rotational yak grazing; temperature","Agriculture; Ecology; Environmental regulations; Nutrients; Soils; Stability; Aboveground biomass; Belowground biomass; Compensatory growth; Environmental factors; Grazing exclosures; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Structural equation modeling; Temporal stability; Biomass; aboveground biomass; alpine environment; belowground biomass; cattle; compensation; grassland; grazing; meadow; plant; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; temporal variation; weather; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086160997

However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8–310 mg CO2 m–2 h−1, 23.6–986 µg CH4 m–2 h−1 and 1.58–110 µg N2O m–2 h−1, respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28–67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 °C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70‰ of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions. © 2020","Chinese coastal marshes; Climatic gradient; Global warming; Greenhouse gases","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soils; Tropics; Wetlands; Atmospheric greenhouse; Dissolved organic carbon; Geographical patterns; Geographical variations; Greenhouse gases emissions; Latitudinal gradients; Microbial biomass carbon; Terrestrial ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; biogeochemical cycle; coastal zone; emission; geographical variation; global warming; greenhouse gas; latitudinal gradient; China; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089093548

The central and municipal governments have issued a series of laws, regulations, and strategies to improve ambient air quality. The “Clean Air Action” issued in 2013 and the “Comprehensive Action” issued in 2017 largely addressed this concern. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of the two action plans by environmental monitoring data and evaluated the influencing factors including meteorology, pollutant emissions, and energy structure. The spatial distributions of air pollutants were analyzed using the Kriging interpolation method. The Principal Component Analysis-Multiple Nonlinear Regression (PCA-MNLR) model was applied to estimate the effects of meteorological factors. The results have shown that Beijing's air quality had a measurable improvement over 2013–2019. “Good air quality” days had the highest increases, and “hazardous air quality” days had the most decreases. SO2 decreased most, followed by CO, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in descending order, but O3 showed a fluctuant increase. The “Comprehensive Action” was more effective than the “Clean Air Action” in reducing heavy pollution days during the heating period. The meteorological normalized values of the main pollutants were lower than the observation data during 2013–2016. However, the observed values became lower than the normalized values after 2017, which indicated beneficial weather conditions in 2017 and afterwards. The emissions of SO2 and dust significantly decreased while NOx had a slight decrease, and the energy structure changed with a dramatic decrease in coal consumption and an obvious increase in the use of natural gas and electricity.

With the increasing amount of inter-regional electricity trade in China, the emission transfer problem is more severe. By using Quasi-Input-Output model, which can consider the ripple effect of electricity trade network, this study analyzed embodied greenhouse gas emissions of electricity trade among 30 provinces in China. Results indicated that, in 2017, the national transfer volumes of CO2, CH4, and N2 O embodied in inter-provincial electricity trade were 603.25 Mt, 6803.81 t, and 9899.25 t, respectively. Emissions are mainly transferred from the eastern to the western regions, especially to those with high proportion of electricity generated from fossil fuels. The amount of emission transfer is not consistent with that of purchased electricity, since some regions are rich in clean energy. Although direct emission transfer plays the dominant role for most province, indirect emission transfer should also be noticed. Provinces with larger indirect emission transfer generally purchase electricity from provinces with a lot of electricity inflows. The findings could help policy makers coordinate regional energy utilization strategies and issue more effective emission reduction policies in the electricity industry. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper builds a spatial auto regression (SAR) model with provincial panel data from 2011 to 2017 to calculate the spatial spillover effect of China's LCTI on regional CO2 emission. The results show that regional LCTI can reduce the local CO2 emission, but will increase the CO2 emission of adjacent regions due to spatial spillover effect. This produces the uncertainty of the promotion effect of LCTI on China's low-carbon transformation. Therefore, this paper suggests innovation resources should be appropriately and evenly distributed among regions to avoid their agglomeration in few regions. © 2020 Li et al.

In this study, a new methodology named space-time ensemble machine-learning model was first applied to constrain the high-resolution NH4-N deposition fluxes over China based on the satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and various geographical covariates. A small gap between site-based cross-validation (CV) R2 value (0. 73) and 10-fold CV R2 value (0.76), along with remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy (0.76) compared with previous studies (0.61), demonstrated the strong prediction capability of the space-time ensemble model in data mining. The higher wet NH4-N deposition fluxes mainly occurred in North China Plain (NCP), Sichuan Basin, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, whereas other regions retained the lower values. In addition, the wet NH4-N deposition fluxes, removing the precipitation effect in some major developed regions (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) of China, displayed gradual increases from 2011 to 2014, while they suffered from dramatic decreases during 2014-2016, which was due to the strict implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP).

The majority of existing literature studying MCS activity over East Asia is based on specific case studies and more climatological investigations revealing the precipitation characteristics of MCSs over eastern China are keenly needed. In this study, we use an iterative rain cell tracking method to identify and track MCS precipitation during 2008-16 to investigate regional differences and seasonal variations of MCS precipitation characteristics. Our results show that the middle-to-lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (YRB-ML) receive the largest amount and exhibit the most pronounced seasonal cycle of MCS precipitation in eastern China. MCS precipitation over YRB-ML can exceed 2.6 mm day-1 in June, contributing over 30.0% of April-July total rainfall. Particularly long-lived MCSs occur over the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau (ETP), with 25% of MCSs over the ETP persisting for more than 18 h in spring. In addition, spring MCSs feature larger rainfall areas, longer durations, and faster propagation speeds. Summer MCSs have a higher precipitation intensity and a more pronounced diurnal cycle except for southeastern China, where MCSs have similar precipitation intensity in spring and summer. There is less MCS precipitation in autumn, but an MCS precipitation center over the ETP still persists. MCSs reach peak hourly rainfall intensities during the time of maximum growth (a few hours after genesis), reach their maximum size around 5 h after genesis, and start decaying thereafter. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.","Asia; Convective storms/systems; Mesoscale systems; Precipitation; Rainfall; Seasonal variability","Iterative methods; Rain; Global water cycle; Mesoscale Convective System; Precipitation characteristics; Precipitation intensity; Regional differences; Seasonal variation; Southeastern china; Yangtze River basin; Storms; convective system; mesoscale meteorology; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; seasonal variation; storm; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084204418

This scientific problem is still not fully understood, particularly in the Bumu region, Southwest China. The present paper analyses the occurrence characteristics and distribution of CBM based on the comprehensive analysis of CBM data. In combination with the analysis of the regional tectonics setting, geological structure features and tectonic evolution. The control action of multi-phase tectonic movements on CBM occurrence are further discussed. Results show that the Indosinian local deformation, Yanshanian intense deformation, and Himalayan secondary derived deformation formed the current tectonic framework of Enhong synclinorium. The intense tectonic compression and dextral shear action in the Yanshanian and Himalayan movements caused the complex geological structures in Bumu region, composed of the Enhong syncline, associated reverse faults and late derived normal fault. The CBM distribution is complex, which has the central and western NNE-trending high gas content zones along the syncline hinge zone and the reverse faults. The geological structure controls on CBM enrichment are definite and important. Based on geological structure features and responses of gas content, methane concentration, and gas content gradient, the gas controlling patterns of geological structure are determined and can be classified into five types: The reverse fault sealing, syncline sealing, monoclinal enrichment, normal fault dispersion, and buried floor fault dispersion types. The structural compression above the neutral surface plays an important role in the syncline sealing process, which is indicated by an increase in gas content gradient. The EW-trending tectonic intense compression and dextral shear action in the Himalayan movement avoided the negative inversion of NNE-trending Yanshanian compressive structure and its destruction of CBM reservoir. However, the chronic uplift and derived normal fault during Himalayan period caused the constant dissipation of CBM. © 2020 by the authors.

Regional air quality improvement and the health benefits can motivate efforts to achieve low-carbon goals. However, the health cobenefit per amount of carbon reduction may vary drastically across power plant units. The strategy of targeting more health cobenefits has been considered in designing an efficient carbon mitigation pathway, whereas this issue has not been analyzed at the unit level. In this study, an indicator called health benefit by carbon reduction (H/C) was constructed for each power unit to assess the relative potential of obtaining health cobenefits.

Taking the Maokou Formation in the Jiulongshan Gas Field as an example, tectonic fracture formation and distribution are quantitatively characterized by the outcrops, cores, Fullbore Formation MicroImager (FMI) imaging logging, acoustic emission experiments, fluid inclusion experiments, and burial-thermal evolution history analysis. The formation stage of the tectonic fractures in the study area can generally be divided into three stages: the Indosinian stage, the early middle Yanshanian stage, and the late Yanshanian-Himalayan stage. The key stages are the early middle Yanshanian stage and the late Yanshanian-Himalayan stage. According to the theory of tectonic geomechanics, the evolution pattern of different stages of tectonic fractures and faults in the Maokou Formation is established. The finite element method was used to simulate the three-dimensional paleotectonic stress field during the key stages of fracture formation, and a rock failure criterion (η) was used to quantitatively predict the development and distribution of the tectonic fracture. In the early middle Yanshanian stage, the fracture degree was relatively small, and the highly fractured areas were mainly concentrated in the areas near the northern fault zone and the high part of the anticline, with the highest rock failure proximity of 1.118. In the late Yanshanian-early Himalayan stage, the highly fractured areas are distributed in the northeast and northwest, near the E-W fault rupture zone, the high parts of the Jiulongshan and Tadongping areas, and the local tectonic high parts. The degree of rock failure mainly concentrated between 0.890 and 1.127. There is a good positive correlation between the fracture density and the degree of rock failure. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Benefiting from the scalpel-like regulation of the ratio between the catalyst and activator, ordered-disordered hybrid graphitic carbon anodes with abundant pores are achieved. Especially, the GCFs-3 sample delivers a plateau capacity of 285.3 mA h g-1 even at 0.1 A g-1 in Li-half cells, and possesses fast charge-discharge capability at high rates. Further, the self-activated mesoporous carbon with specific surface area as high as 1522.2 m2 g-1 exhibits a high specific capacity of 56.6 mA h g-1 (vs. 45.1 mA h g-1 of commercial activated carbon) at 0.05 A g-1. The superior-rate graphitic carbon negative electrode and high-specific-capacity mesoporous activated carbon positive electrode satisfy perfectly the demand for high-energy-density and superior-power-output dual-carbon lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). When assembled into LICs, high energy density (86.4 W h kg-1, 62.2 W kg-1), excellent power density (19.8 kW kg-1, 60.3 W h kg-1) and long-term cycling stability (98.1% after 20 000 times at 5.0 A g-1) are achieved, outperforming the state-of-the-art LIC configurations.

We examined vertical root distributions of different forest communities to determine how belowground strategies shift across different forest types and along edaphic gradients. Methods: Specific root length and diameter of fine roots as well as fine-root biomass, length and area densities were measured in sequential soil layers at 10 cm depth increments across 118 forest plots representing five subalpine forest types. Results: Evergreen forest types, including evergreen oaks, were more deeply rooted than birch forests. Differences in rooting depth were due to the dominant tree species identity, not to variations in shrub or herbaceous components. Within forest types, soil nutrients and physical properties contributed to shifts rooting depth but not root morphology. Conclusions: Vertical distributions of fine roots represent critical inputs of plant carbon into soils as well as different capacities for the acquisition of soil resources. Our findings identify consistent patterns of rooting distributions among forest types that may be predictable based on more easily measured root and soil properties and can improve efforts to model rooting depth profiles in forest communities. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Community structure; Forest ecosystems; Geographical location; Rooting depth; Soil properties","belowground biomass; data acquisition; deciduous tree; evergreen forest; plant community; root system; rooting; soil depth; soil profile; subalpine environment; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090779294

In flue gas circulation, NOx is eliminated mainly through the reduction reaction with C or CO, in which CaFe2O4 plays an important role as the catalyst. In this paper, CaFe2O4 was synthesized by the ceramic route, and the catalytic performance was investigated. The experimental results show that the reduced calcium ferrite (RCF) was superior to unreduced samples in catalytic activity and oxygen tolerance. The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculation and characterization showed that the RCF was in an electron-deficient state, which led to its higher catalytic activity. The electron-deficient state is more conducive to the complexation between the sample and oxygen under an oxygen-containing atmosphere, improving the O2 tolerance in the CO-NO reaction. The results suggest that decreasing the O2 content in the circulating flue gas will enhance the reducing atmosphere in the sintering bed and facilitate the catalytic reaction between CO and NO, which is beneficial for NOx removal. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Advanced understanding of the future long-term coevolution of coupled urban human-water systems is of considerable interest in this context. This study uses a previously developed sociohydrologic model to explore the coevolutionary trajectories of Beijing City's human-water system over the 2015–2099 period under possible climate changes. The effects of multiple human adaptive actions under alternative climate scenarios are investigated in particular. Results show that there might be a recurrent competition for water between humans and the natural environment (e.g., groundwater aquifer) in the long-term future, indicating that effective water management needs to ensure that this competition remains within a safe operating space. Three regimes of the human-environment competition are revealed, including a sustainable development regime in which human society and groundwater aquifer are both safe throughout their coevolutionary trajectories, a regime that may lead to severe population loss due to overaggressive population control actions, and a regime that may cause aquifer depletion due to under-perception of the drawdown of groundwater table. Results also show that relying too much on interbasin water diversion project might slacken human water conservation measures and eventually cause more severe aquifer depletion in the long run. Maintaining a high community sensitivity to drawdown of groundwater table and moderate measures to control population growth are keys to avoid unintended, negative consequences. ©2020.

The laboratory is set in line with the ""knowledge city""tactic by Pensando Meridiano Association (PM)[2]. The aim is to enhance local actions of climate change adaptation; therefore, global issues are locally framed through a multi-sectoral urban approach.

Although this method has been proven in the specific context shown above, it still needs to be investigated if an operative transition model can be extrapolated and recontextualized in other urban contexts. For this investigation, this paper evaluates the first social impacts of the methodology by monitoring the acquisition of knowledge and skills by makers.

In the literature, most EMSs proposed are based on the implementation of energy systems prediction which enable to run a specific optimization algorithm. Such strategy, known as Rolling Time Horizon (RTH), demonstrated very effective when the supporting prediction system performs well. However, it is featured by high operational times. In this work, different lightweight EMS models synthesized through machine learning algorithms have been compared considering six different simulation scenarios. Results shows that an RTH-based EMS owns the best overall performances. However, in some case studies, also other EMSs show competitive results, especially those based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) trained by clustering, which in one case outperform RTH EMSs, and in other 3 cases (out of 6) yields performances close to RTH EMSs within 5%. A second contribution concerns the RTH EMS implementation on a small micro-controller, highlighting the high computational effort which can range in the order of minutes. Conversely, the ANFIS EMS shows always almost negligible computational costs (less than one second) and therefore can be used in realistic scenarios on cheap devices at run time. The paper also proposed a novel graphic tool to better represent, observe and analyze microgrid energy flows in each time slot or along the overall considered dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ANFIS; Dynamic programming; Energy management systems; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Microgrids; Neural networks; Support vector machine","Automation; Energy management; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent computing; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Microgrids; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Computational costs; Computational effort; Computational intelligence techniques; Multi-energy systems; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy source; Rolling time horizons; Energy management systems; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy resource; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088965044

Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 μS cm−1) was higher compared to REF (360 μS cm−1), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5–11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15–35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad’s mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Lemmer, Rochefort and Strack.","fen restoration; fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane; mineral wetlands; oil sands disturbances; seasonal net ecosystem exchange modeling","Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Methane; Oil sands; Organic carbon; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Wetlands; Biogeochemical conditions; Dissolved organic carbon; Global warming potential; Organic matter content; Restoration methods; Restoration techniques; Restoration treatments; Seasonal carbon balances; Restoration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; fen; greenhouse gas; methane; net ecosystem exchange; oil sand; peatland; restoration ecology; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097560122

However, the trading of carbon credits may have socially unjust consequences. In this article, we explore some hitherto unrecognized disequities. One of these may be the creation of toxic hotspots as the trade of carbon may bring with it a transfer of air toxics, as well. We illustrate the argument by examining emissions from refineries participating in California’s cap-and-trade program. These considerations are a concern for the larger question of carbon mitigation as the global community strives to identify feasible, yet just, approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Contrary to the idea of alienable rights, the transfer of carbon affects people and place in ways not internalized by these market instruments. © Copyright © 2020 Lejano, Kan and Chau.","air toxics; cap-and-trade; carbon trading; environmental justice; ethics; public policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096683105

Although PM control could be achieved by using a variety of polymeric materials, identifying effective and green materials remains elusive in dust control technology. Here, we have employed environmentally friendly cellulose modified by methyl side groups, such as methylcellulose (MC)-based polymers, and evaluated their PM reduction efficiency when utilized in active and passive dust control methods, such as dust suppressants and air filters, respectively. When 25 m/s wind was applied on soil treated by MC-based polymers, PM emissions were reduced 95% or 85% lower than the soil treated by only water or the other cellulose without methyl side groups. The MC-based polymer was also effectively suppressed mineral dust from a local copper mine in Arizona with approximately 50 times lower amounts than a synthetic polymer containing methyl side groups. Furthermore, when MC-based polymers have deposited on filters of commercial face masks, the average filtration efficiency improved to greater than 99% while maintaining airflow resistance. Our results present that environmentally friendly MC-based polymers can act as dust binders that effectively agglomerate air pollutants, preventing the PM emission from dust sources and the inhalation after being suspended in the air; thus, labeling them as essential materials for advanced active and passive dust control technology. © 2020 ACS.

We estimate the global, regional, and national health burden associated with exposure to household air pollution. Methods: For the systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched four databases for studies published from database inception to April 2, 2020, that evaluated the risk of adverse cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal outcomes from exposure to household air pollution, compared with no exposure. We used a random-effects model to calculate disease-specific relative risk (RR) meta-estimates. Household air pollution exposure was defined as use of polluting fuels (coal, wood, charcoal, agricultural wastes, animal dung, or kerosene) for household cooking or heating. Temporal trends in mortality and disease burden associated with household air pollution, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), were estimated from 2000 to 2017 using exposure prevalence data from 183 of 193 UN member states. 95% CIs were estimated by propagating uncertainty from the RR meta-estimates, prevalence of household air pollution exposure, and disease-specific mortality and burden estimates using a simulation-based approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019125060. Findings: 476 studies (15·5 million participants) from 123 nations (99 [80%] of which were classified as low-income and middle-income) met the inclusion criteria. Household air pollution was positively associated with asthma (RR 1·23, 95% CI 1·11–1·36), acute respiratory infection in both adults (1·53, 1·22–1·93) and children (1·39, 1·29–1·49), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1·70, 1·47–1·97), lung cancer (1·69, 1·44–1·98), and tuberculosis (1·26, 1·08–1·48); cerebrovascular disease (1·09, 1·04–1·14) and ischaemic heart disease (1·10, 1·09–1·11); and low birthweight (1·36, 1·19–1·55) and stillbirth (1·22, 1·06–1·41); as well as with under-5 (1·25, 1·18–1·33), respiratory (1·19, 1·18–1·20), and cardiovascular (1·07, 1·04–1·11) mortality. Household air pollution was associated with 1·8 million (95% CI 1·1–2·7) deaths and 60·9 million (34·6–93·3) DALYs in 2017, with the burden overwhelmingly experienced in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs; 60·8 million [34·6–92·9] DALYs) compared with high-income countries (0·09 million [0·01–0·40] DALYs). From 2000, mortality associated with household air pollution had reduced by 36% (95% CI 29–43) and disease burden by 30% (25–36), with the greatest reductions observed in higher-income nations. Interpretation: The burden of cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal diseases associated with household air pollution has declined worldwide but remains high in the world's poorest regions. Urgent integrated health and energy strategies are needed to reduce the adverse health impact of household air pollution, especially in LMICs.

For example, the number of European shellfish restoration projects has quadrupled in the past 3 years. In line with the increasing focus on both restoration and climate change mitigation efforts, this study highlights how these two practices can complement each other. This experimental study quantifies the active and passive sediment deposition associated with the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) and the organic and inorganic carbon fractions of the deposits. Treatments included ‘dead’, ‘live’, and control to account for (i) passive deposition, (ii) biodeposition and passive deposition, and (iii) background deposition respectively. By utilizing these data, the expected carbon deposition associated with a restored flat oyster bed was investigated. The experiment was conducted ex situ, with natural seawater input. Covariate data on temperature, suspended particulate influx, salinity, and oxygen availability were recorded. Enhanced sedimentation (2.9 times) and organic carbon deposition (three times) were observed in the presence of living oysters, compared with the control. The shell structure of the oysters had no influence on passive sedimentation in this study. By developing a full understanding of the ecosystem services (functioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural) provided by a habitat, it becomes possible to quantify overall ecosystem function. This evidence is key in advising policymakers, restoration funders, and marine spatial planners on the connection between keystone species restoration, ecosystem service restoration, and conservation management. The enhancement of benthopelagic coupling by the European flat oyster, evidenced here for the first time, is contextualized from the perspective of quantification of ecosystem service provision for both restoration practices and blue carbon store management. The data produced in this study are discussed comparatively with work that has focused on other species from both Europe and the USA. © 2020 Crown Copyright.

A primary source of particulate matter is the operation of coal-fired power plants. Therefore, in South Korea, a fine dust seasonal management system (SMS) has been implemented to reduce PM2.5 emissions. The system uses intuitive measures that temporarily shut down a set of coal units or reduce their maximum power outputs. However, the effectiveness of these measures in controlling PM2.5 concentrations is unclear. That is, although these measures can reduce the total PM2.5 emissions, the ground-level air pollutant concentration (GLAPC) at specific locations may still exceed prescribed PM2.5 standards. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of the SMS and also construct a power generation scheduling model to explicitly limit PM2.5 concentrations at load centers. Case studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of the SMS is highly case-dependent and that the scheduling model is more effective at limiting the GLAPC and provides a better trade-off between cost and emissions control. © 2020 IEEE","Air pollutant dispersion; Fine dust seasonal management system; PM2.5 emissions; Unit commitment","Air quality; Coal; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuel power plants; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Smart power grids; Air pollutant concentrations; Coal-fired power plant; Environmental health; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Generation scheduling; Maximum power output; Power generation scheduling; Public health issues; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102776988

They have also been suffering from climate change and extreme events, along with a variety of weather and climate threats, which pose many challenges to herders. On the one hand, pastoralist communities have little influence on policy decisions; however, on the other hand, they suffer to a significant extent from such policies, which limit their options for sustainable development and poverty alleviation. Also, the socio-cultural legacy of herders, and their role in food security and provision of ecosystem services, as well as their efforts towards climate change adaptation, are little documented, particularly in Eastern and Southern African countries. There is a perceived need for international studies on the risks and impacts of climate change and extreme events on the sustainability of pastoralist communities in Africa, especially in eastern and southern Africa. Based on the need to address this research gap, this paper describes the climate change risks and challenges that climate threats pose to the sustainability and livelihoods of pastoralist communities in eastern and southern Africa. Also, it discusses the extent to which such problems affect their well-being and income. Additionally, the paper reports on the socioeconomic vulnerability indices at country-level; identifies specific problems pastoralists face, and a variety of climate adaptation strategies to extreme events through field survey among pastoralist communities in a sample of five countries, namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The study has shown that the long-term sustainability of the livelihoods of pastoral communities is currently endangered by climate change and the risks and hazards it brings about, which may worsen poverty among this social group. The study suggests that a more systematic and structured approach is needed when assessing the climate vulnerability of individual pastoral communities, since this may help in designing suitable disaster risk reduction strategies. Moreover, the paper shows that it is also necessary to understand better the socio-ecological systems (SES) of the various communities, and how their livelihoods are influenced by the changing conditions imposed by a changing climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","adaptation; environmental change; hazards-sustainable livelihoods; pastoralist communities; risks; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087701479

The reduced emission quantum yield (ϕf = 0.01-0.03) of the NDI derivative in various solvents indicates the perturbation of the electronic state of π-electron deficient NDI (A) by the peripheral naphthalene (D) units. The investigation of the influence of the alkyl chain and naphthalene substituent on the self-assembling properties of the NDI derivative reveals an isodesmic mode of self-assembly in a chloroform/methylcyclohexane (CHCl3/MCH, 1 : 9, v/v) mixture. The self-assembling nature of the NDI derivative also results in the formation of an organogel in the CHCl3/MCH (1 : 9, v/v) mixture, and gel formation is well-comprehended by techniques such as P-XRD, rheological studies, and FT-IR measurements.

Models that represent the energy use of the building stock at scale under various scenarios of technology deployment have become essential tools for the development and assessment of such strategies. Within the past decade, the capabilities of building stock energy models have improved considerably, while model transferability and sharing has increased. Given these advancements, a new scheme for classifying building stock energy models is needed to facilitate communication of modeling approaches and the handling of important model dimensions. In this article, we present a new building stock energy model classification framework that leverages international modeling expertise from the participants of the International Energy Agency's Annex 70 on Building Energy Epidemiology. Drawing from existing classification studies, we propose a multi-layer quadrant scheme that classifies modeling techniques by their design (top-down or bottom-up) and degree of transparency (black-box or white-box); hybrid techniques are also addressed. The quadrant scheme is unique from previous classification approaches in its non-hierarchical organization, coverage of and ability to incorporate emerging modeling techniques, and treatment of additional modeling dimensions. The new classification framework will be complemented by a reporting protocol and online registry of existing models as part of ongoing work in Annex 70 to increase the interpretability and utility of building stock energy models for energy policy making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock energy models; Energy epidemiology; IEA Annex 70; Model classification; Urban building energy modeling","Buildings; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Classification approach; Classification framework; Hierarchical organizations; International energy agency; International model; Model transferabilities; Modeling technique; Technology deployment; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090888395

Moreover, these islands face the problem of expensive and unreliable electricity supply. The large number of island communities further magnifies the difficulty of reaching universal sustainable electricity supply. Off-grid electrification technologies promise to tackle this challenge entailing high investments yet also market potential. Currently both aspects – electricity access and climate resilience - are barely linked in electrification planning. Energy planning in a region highly affected by climate change requires integrative planning considering these risks. Here, to enhance integrative planning, we study the status quo of energy access and risk exposure of non-electrified Southeast Asian islands. We identify 1932 islands with a population greater than 21 million having limited access to electricity. Our study reveals three risk-specific island archetypes, which need different technical measures to enhance climate resiliency of future electricity systems.

Our objective in this article is to examine the diverse social outcomes that have resulted from climate policies, in varying contexts worldwide, over the past few decades. We review 203 ex-post climate policy assessments that analyse social outcomes in the literature. We systematically and comprehensively map out this work, identifying articles on carbon, energy and transport taxes, feed-in-tariffs, subsidies, direct procurement policies, large renewable deployment projects, and other regulatory and market-based interventions. We code each article in terms of their studied social outcomes and effects, with a focus on electricity access, energy affordability, community cohesion, employment, distributional and equity issues, livelihoods and poverty, procedural justice, subjective well-being and drudgery. Our analysis finds that climate and energy policies often fall short of delivering positive social outcomes. Nonetheless, across country contexts and policy types there are manifold examples of climate policymaking that does deliver on both social and climate goals. This requires attending to distributive and procedural justice in policy design, and making use of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that policy costs and benefits are fairly shared.

The U.S. EPA recently implemented the Near-Road (monitoring) Network to measure NO2 concentrations by high-traffic roadways in urban centers throughout the U.S., as these locations were believed to characterize worst-case human exposures to traffic-related air pollutants. Many near-road sites also include PM2.5 and CO measurements, which along with the NO2 observations, were compared in a pairwise manner against non-near-road monitors located within the city-scale boundary. After controlling for primary emissions from the target highways, we found the PM2.5 concentration difference (i.e. near-road concentration minus non-near-road site concentration) between the near-road and non-near-road urban sites to be δ = 0.42 µg m-3( H0: µ diff = 0; Ha: µ diff > 0 (µ non-near-road > µ near-road); p = 0.051; α = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.08-0.90 µg m-3, n = 35 comparisons). NO2 and CO levels were on average higher at the near-road sites compared to the non-near-road urban sites by 5.0 (95% CI: 3.4-6.5) ppb (n = 44 comparisons) and 9.2 10-2( 95% CI: 0.04-0.14) ppm (n = 42 comparisons), respectively. The average PM2.5 difference found here is 5%, and at 14 of the 35 (∼40%) urban monitor comparisons and 28 of the 72 (∼39%) overall comparisons, PM2.5 is actually higher at the non-near-road site relative to its near-road pair. Cleaner vehicle fleets, formation of secondary PM from on-road emissions occurring downwind (i.e. away from the road), decreased secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation rates in the near-road environment, the prevalence of other low-volume vehicular and local, non-vehicular sources of emissions at the non-near-road sites (e.g. railyards, truck yards, ports, biomass-fueled heating, backyard barbecuing, and commercial cooking, etc) and local meteorology (e.g. wind speed and wind direction) explain this finding. The wintertime PM2.5 concentration difference was higher than the other seasons, likely a result of higher primary PM2.5 tailpipe emissions and lower temperatures that both reduced near-road PM volatility and decreased photochemical activity resulting in lower SOA production at the urban scale. Further, all near-road NO2 and CO concentrations were below the annual and hourly NAAQS, while eight (most of which were in wildfire-prone locations) of the 94 PM2.5 sites used in this study were above the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In addition, strong agreement with both annual average daily traffic and fleet-equivalent AADT were found for near-road NO2 and CO concentrations, while weaker, but still positive relationships were found for near-road PM2.5 levels. Lastly, same observational data was used to assess on-road mobile source emission estimates from the EPA National Emission Inventory, and analysis of the observations are in rough agreement with the current ratio of NOx to CO emissions from on-road mobile sources. © 2020 The Author(s).

The “4 per 1000” (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a “Healthy Soil Act” at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Global warming; Negative emission technologies; Societal value of soil carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil health","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Biospherics; Budget control; Carbon; Carbonization; Chemical contamination; Ecosystems; Food processing; Intelligent robots; Laws and legislation; Machinery; Remote sensing; Conservation agricultures; Economic incentive; Ecosystem services; Emission technology; Management practices; Nongovernmental organizations; Soil carbon sequestration; Terrestrial biosphere; Soils; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; emission control; government; industrial technology; nongovernmental organization; pollution policy; private sector; soil carbon; soil science; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088820034

The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events. © 2020 by the authors.

The solubility behavior of the functional groups formed on the PCNW, OCNW, and rOCNW surfaces in ketone- and alcohol-type organic solvents was demonstrated and investigated. When the surfaces of the samples reacted with acetone and methanol were magnified, OCNW showed very high solubility. This indicated that most of the functional groups existed on the surface of OCNW, and that these functional groups reacted the most with the organic solvents, forming H bonding. The dispersion analysis confirmed that the solubility was induced by the activity in the functional groups bonded with the molecules of acetone and methanol. The X-ray photoelectron spectra showed clear changes in hydroxyl and carbonyl, suggesting that hydroxyl and carbonyl are key groups. The ID/IG ratio in the Raman spectra after the reaction with the organic solvents slightly increased. Local dissociation is expected after absorption by the organic solvents into the weak points where the carbon branches were removed by the oxygen plasma. As in the experiment, the prepared CNW reacted with the organic solvents, which showed different results from the carbon-based materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanowall; Oxidized carbon nanowall; Reduced oxidized carbon nanowall; Solubility","Acetone; Carbon; Chemical bonds; Chemical vapor deposition; Methanol; Organic solvents; Oxygen; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Solubility; Carbon based materials; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Dispersion analysis; Hydrothermal reduction; Modified catalysts; Oxidized carbons; Solubility behavior; X ray photoelectron spectra; Organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087791081

These buildings contribute to about 60% of the total carbon emissions of Hong Kong, therefore in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2030+, existing building energy saving is one key focus where potential for energy saving is very significant. However, it is often difficult for existing building especially aged buildings to undergo green transformation due to the existing site constraint such as space and capital limitation and at the same time requiring continuous operation of the building. This paper presents a case study of a portfolio of high-rise buildings and comprehensive building development with buildings ranging from 60 to less than 5 years in operation, situated in the most densely populated commercial district in Hong Kong undergone a ""Green Body Check"", benchmarking using Hong Kong's Green Building accreditation - BEAM Plus for Existing Building and identified appropriate green measures to improve its performance. The aim of the developer is not only trying to reduce the carbon emission of its portfolio, but to lead by example and showcasing the impact to the portfolio but also to the tenants and beyond. This study aims to highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and benchmarking, adopting green building accreditation as a framework in evaluating the existing performance and effectively identify improvement measures.

In India, it is already reported more than 855 thousand cases and more than 22 thousands deaths due to COVID-19 till July 12, 2020. The role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. In contrast, for the previous many viral infections like influenza, it is well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017–2019) for March, April and May months and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to May 31. We found a positive association between daily COVID-19 cases and temperature and a mixed association with relative and absolute humidity over India. We have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the lockdown period (25 March-31 May) in India. During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and NO2 reduced sharply with a maximum percentage drop of about 60 and 45, respectively. We have also found the reduction in surface PM2.5 PM10 and NO2 for the six mega cities of India during the lockdown period. Our results suggest that COVID-19 still may spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon, therefore an effective public health intervention should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Absolute humidity; COVID-19; India; Novel Coronavirus; Pandemic; Summer","Aerosols; Air quality; Disease control; Meteorology; Transmissions; Absolute humidity; Health interventions; Medical emergency; Meteorological condition; Meteorological data; Meteorological parameters; Prevention and controls; Scientific basis; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; air temperature; COVID-19; disease incidence; disease spread; disease transmission; humidity; infectious disease; meteorology; viral disease; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; Article; city; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; human; humidity; incidence; India; infection control; lockdown; meteorology; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; rainy season; summer; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; virus pneumonia; India; Coronavirus; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088136373

In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53% (Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Coronavirus pandemic; Emission switch-off; Health and economic impacts; PM2.5 concentration; SARS-CoV-2 Virus","Air quality; Ambient air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); In-situ measurement; Mitigation measures; PM2.5 concentration; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089137747

However, to effectively operate the RE-based MEC system, a method for predicting the state of energy (SoE) in the battery is essential, not only to prevent the battery from over-charging or over-discharging, but also allowing the MEC applications to adjust their loads in advance based on the energy availability. In this work, we consider RE-powered MEC systems at the Road-side Unit (RSU) and focus on predicting its battery's SoE by using machine learning technique. We developed a real-world RE-powered RSU testbed consisting of edge computing devices, small cell base station, and solar as well as wind power generators. By operating RE-powered RSU for serving real-world computation task offloading demands, we collect the corresponding data sequences of battery's SoE and other observable parameters of the MEC systems that impact the SoE. Using a variant of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with additional convolutional layers, we form a CNN-LSTM model which can predict the SoE accurately with very low prediction error. Our results show that CNN-LSTM outperforms other Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based models for predicting intra-hour and hour-Ahead SoE. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Carbon footprint; Edge computing; Energy policy; Forecasting; Learning systems; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Wind power; Computing devices; Energy availability; Energy prediction; Machine learning techniques; Observable parameters; Prediction errors; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Renewable energies; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099332778

In particular, we focus on four distinct features characterized by the soft excess with respect to the adjacent fields. Those include the two regions located at kiloparsec distances from the nucleus to the west and east, the extended bow-shock structure to the south, and a fragment of a thin arc north of the center. The selected north, west, and south features coincide with the edges of the radio lobes, while the east structure is seemingly displaced from the radio-emitting plasma. Our X-ray spectral analysis reveals (i) a power-law emission component with photon index Γ ∼ 2 in the north, east, and south regions, and (ii) a dense (number density ∼0.3 cm-3) and relatively cold (temperature ∼ 0.2 keV) gas in the east and west regions. The power-law emission is consistent with the synchrotron continuum generated at the edges of the radio structure, and implies that the efficiency of the electron acceleration at the terminal bow shock does not vary dramatically over the inner lobes' extension. The presence of gaseous condensations, on the other hand, could possibly be understood in terms of a massive outflow from the central regions of the galaxy. © 2020.

The samples were analysed for the molecular and stable isotope compositions of carbon (δ13C in CH4, C2H6, C3H8, i-C4H10, n-C4H10 and CO2), hydrogen (δ2H in CH4, C2H6 and C3H8), nitrogen (δ15N in N2), and all stable isotopes of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe) in order to reveal the origin and migration pathway of these gases. Methane concentrations usually exceeded 90 vol%. Methane was mainly generated by microbial carbon dioxide reduction. The rhythmic and cyclic deposition of clays, muds and sands in the Miocene marine basin facilitated and intensified microbial processes. Microbial ethane can be produced by methanogenic Archaea from acetate via reduction. Ethane partly contains a minor component generated from early mature thermogenic process. Propane and butanes were also generated thermogenically. The hydrocarbon gases in the Miocene horizons IIA and IIIA of the Góra Ropczycka field were generated at higher maturity thermogenic process than the rest of the analysed Miocene gases probably from the Middle Jurassic type III kerogen. They migrated to the Miocene horizons from the underlying Upper Jurassic horizon IV of the same field along a fault. Carbon dioxide of the analysed Miocene gases was mainly generated by primary microbial processes. Moreover, the total carbon constrained in the analysed Miocene gases from 0.1 to 6 wt% contained mantle-derived carbon, and thus carbon dioxide mantle component. Molecular nitrogen was mainly generated during low-temperature thermal transformation of organic matter. It might also involve a relatively insignificant component released from NH4-rich illites of the clayey facies of Miocene strata and an atmospheric component delivered by recharge of air-saturated seawater to the reservoir. Inorganic fluid supply from greater lithospheric depth would not be responsible for the promotion of thermal transformation of organic matter. Molecular nitrogen from Miocene horizons in the Góra Ropczycka field was generated during the thermal transformation of organic matter of higher maturity than the rest of Miocene gases, and migrated from the Upper Jurassic horizon along a fault. Helium is dominated by its radiogenic component, with a minor contribution from the mantle. The almost constant mixing ratios of the two helium components in the natural gases from Miocene horizons of various depths suggest that He migrated from a common inorganic deep-seated source in the lithosphere. The other noble gases are dominated by atmospheric components delivered to the hydrocarbon reservoirs by recharge of air-saturated seawater, with minor nucleogenic 21Ne, radiogenic 40Ar, and sedimentary Kr and Xe contributions. The atmospheric component is isotopically fractionated for Ne, and elementally fractionated with various degrees. The ratios of radiogenic 4He to nucleogenic 21Ne or radiogenic 40Ar are higher than the crustal production ratios, suggesting fractionation during thermal release from their host minerals and/or phase related fractionation during their transport to the gas reservoirs. The striking similarity in noble gas isotopic/elemental ratios of the Góra Ropczycka gas from the Miocene horizon IIIA to the nearby reservoir in Mesozoic strata is consistent with gas migration along a fault system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Hydrocarbon gases; Molecular nitrogen; Natural gas origin; Noble gases; Polish Miocene Carpathian Foredeep; Stable isotopes of C, H, N, He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Ethane; Helium; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Krypton; Methane; Microorganisms; Mineral industry; Natural gas; Nitrogen; Petroleum reservoirs; Pollution control; Seawater; Temperature; Atmospheric components; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Methane concentrations; Methanogenic archaea; Microbial process; Migration pathway; Molecular nitrogen; Thermal transformations; Radiogenic gases; autochthon; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; fault plane; hydrocarbon reservoir; isotopic composition; low temperature; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; Miocene; molecular analysis; natural gas; nitrogen; noble gas; oil field; reduction; stable isotope; Carpathian Foredeep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091598855

Three climate zones were investigated in the research - South region, Far East region, Central region where average summer insolation is 5,76 kWh/m2; 5,88 kWh/m2; 5,35 kWh/m2 and average winter insolation is 1,93 kWh/m2; 0,75 kWh/m2; 1,03 kWh/m2, respectively. Output power values were similar in all investigated regions, however the main economic impact comes from social-economic factors - regional fuel price, transporting costs, assumed to be 75$US/month and size of photovoltaic system - higher solar activity needs fewer PV cells to satisfy required load. Using simulating software, hybrid photovoltaic-diesel systems demonstrated various costs of energy (LCOE): 0.257$/kWh in Krasnodar region, 0,378$/kWh in Orenburg region and 0,4$/kWh in Irkutsk region. Higher solar activity during winter season in Krasnodar region that allows to reduce fuel consumption as well as LCOE. Increased solar activity also allows to reduce the number of panels required to satisfy the demand. These results was compared to diesel only generators. Krasnodar region generators LCOE was 1,19$US/kWh, Orenburg region generators LCOE was 1,13$US/kWh, Irkutsk region generators LCOE was 1,31$US/kWh. The investigation also shows the influence of the ecological factor on the utilization of renewable energy sources - decrease in fuel consumption from 6000 liters per year to about 250 liters per year as well as reducing the carbon dioxide emissions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Fuels; Global warming; Incident solar radiation; Microgrids; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Ecological factors; Off-grid electrification; Output power values; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy source; Russian federation; Social economic factors; Solar cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096722119

These communities rely upon the delivery of stormwater and wastewater services which are often co-located underground in coastal areas. Due to sea-level rise and associated compounding climate-related hazards, managing these networks will progressively challenge local governments as climate change advances. Thus, responsible agencies must reconcile maintaining Levels of Service as the impacts of climate change worsen over the coming decades and beyond. A critical question is whether such networks can continue to be adapted/protected over time to retain Levels of Service, or whether eventual retreat may be the only viable adaptation option? If so, at what performance threshold? In this paper, we explore these questions for stormwater and wastewater, using a dynamic adaptive pathway planning (DAPP) approach designed to address thresholds and increasing risk over time. Involving key local stakeholders, we here use DAPP to identify thresholds for stormwater and wastewater services and retreat options, and for developing a comprehensive and area-specific retreat strategy comprising pathway portfolios, retreat phases, potential land use changes, and for exploring pathway conflicts and synergies. The result is a prototype for an area near Wellington, New Zealand, where a managed retreat of water infrastructure is being considered at some future juncture. Dynamic adaptive strategies for managed retreats can help to reduce future disruption from coastal flooding, signal land use changes early, inform maintenance, and allow for gradual budget adjustments by the agencies that can manage expenditure over time. We present this stepwise process in a pathway form that can be communicated spatially and visually, thereby making a retreat a more manageable, sequenced, adaptation option for water agencies, and the communities they serve. © 2020 by the authors.

Capacity development is a common disaster risk reduction (DRR) action and a climate change adaptation. There is a knowledge gap on what is involved in and what works in practice of bottom-up approaches to develop DRR capacity that incorporates local ownership, local knowledge and learning. The participatory research described in this paper applied Wenger's conceptual framework for social learning systems to establish a community of practice (CoP) for DRR between 2016 and 2017 in Maruleng Local Municipality, South Africa. Planning documents, event and reflection notes, office reports and artefacts were initially coded based on key concepts of the framework and further coded based on emerging sub-themes. The results showed that the framework provided a useful structure for designing capacity development that emphasises learning and organically integrates local knowledge. Structuring capacity development as a social learning system has the potential to make the CoP's learning effort self-sustaining and shift the focus of capacity development from a specific task to a long-term common interest shared by CoP members. The framework, however, did not provide adequate consideration for institutional challenges such as high leadership turnover and limited political power of the CoP, which impacted alignment, mutuality and membership – all of which are important to sustaining the CoP for capacity development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Community of practice; Disaster management; Local knowledge; Participatory research; Vulnerability assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087394647

A wide range of previous work has explored the climate of circumbinary planets with one-dimensional energy balance models, but studies utilizing three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) have only explored gaseous or ocean-covered planets. Recent GCM results from Wolf et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JE006576) determine the impact of the time-varying stellar forcing on the climate of Earth-like circumbinary planets in a broad range of 12 modeled systems with stellar spectral types from G2 to M0. The planets modeled are assumed to have the same continental and oceanic configuration as Earth and receive the same time-averaged stellar instellation as Earth. In all cases the climate variability has a low amplitude, with local maximum temperatures never exceeding the wet bulb threshold for human life. As a result, Earth-like life could persist on circumbinary planets that undergo large-amplitude orbital variations in instellation, and such planets remain viable targets to search for biosignatures and other key habitability indicators. © 2020.

Adsorption-desorption processes on the surface - which influence the emission current level - were investigated by tracking the individual emission sites under conditions of a sharp decrease and increase in the voltage level. An analysis of the transient process showed that emission sites with highest local currents almost do not participate in changing the overall level of emission current, but they became smaller with a decrease in the step voltage contribution of the dimmest sites.

It then develops a framework for diagnosing HSG, including indicators such as obligations, justification, precision, ‘blaming and shaming’ opportunities, the role of third party actors, bundling, enforcement by policy field coupling, and sanctions. The introduction then identifies driving factors of HSG, including the role of the EU Member States, a strong need for coordination, policy entrepreneurs and institutional opportunities.

Here, we develop and apply a single reservoir hydrologic model to a low-relief karst wetlandscape in southwest Florida (≈103 km2 of Big Cypress National Preserve) using precipitation P and potential evapotranspiration PET as climatic drivers. This simple approach captures the dynamics of storage for individual wetlands across the entire wetlandscape and accurately predicts landscape discharge. Key model insights are the importance of depth-dependent extinction of evapotranspiration ET and the negligible effects of depth-dependent specific yield, the effects of which are diluted by landscape relief. We identify three phases of the wetlandscape hydrological regime: dry, wet-stagnant, and wet-flowing. The model allowed a simple steady-state analysis, which demonstrated the sudden seasonal shift between wet-stagnant and wet-flowing states, indicating a consistent threshold at P ≈ PET. Notably, stage data from any single wetland appears sufficient for accurate whole-landscape discharge prediction because of the relative homogeneity in timing and duration of local wetland hydrologic connectivity in this landscape. We also show that this method will be transferable to other wetlandscapes, where individual storage elements respond hydrologically synchronously, whereas model performance is expected to deteriorate for hydrologically more heterogeneous wetlandscapes. ©2020.

The energy used for space conditioning can be reduced by utilizing thermal energy storage, such as phase change materials (PCMs), into building envelopes; however, the energy savings of PCM-integrated building envelopes reported in the literature vary widely. In the absence of established guidelines, thermophysical requirements of an optimal PCM, its method of application into the building envelope, and the corresponding energy savings under various climates remain unknown. In this study, we perform an extensive numerical investigation on the integration of PCM into building walls to establish the key conditions required for effective utilization of PCM in reducing heat gains in the cooling season and heat losses in the heating season. We also determine the optimal transition temperature, optimal PCM location in the wall, and the energy-saving potential of the PCM-integrated building walls in five U.S. cities located in different International Energy Conservation Code climate zones. Results show that employing PCMs in building walls does not always lead to an improvement; in fact, incorrect applications of PCMs can substantially increase energy use in the buildings. In the climates we studied, PCMs were found effective in reducing heat gains during the cooling season while mostly ineffective in managing heat losses during heating season. Depending on the climate, optimized PCMs in U.S. building walls can provide reduction in the annual heat gain in the range of 3.5%–47.2% and the annual heat loss in the range of −2.8%–8.3%. Future consideration of buildings with substantial solar gains in winter may lead to more reduction in heat losses by PCMs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling; Energy savings; Energy use; Envelope; Heating; HVAC; Optimization; Phase change materials","Energy conservation; Heat losses; Heat storage; Historic preservation; Optimal systems; Phase change materials; Potential energy; Solar buildings; Building envelopes; Building walls; Energy saving potential; Heating season; Integrated buildings; Numerical investigations; Space conditioning; Thermophysical; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089414722

The aim of the work is to construct several climate change schemes for the Bering Sea and the subarctic of the Pacific for the characteristic time slices of the last two glacier-ice cycles: the maximum of the last glaciation, the Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4), the maximum of the last interglacial glaciation (MIS 5.5), the maximum of the penultimate glaciation (Heinrich event 11, MIS 6.2) and the warmest possible MIS 6.5. The general characteristic patterns of orbital and millennial environmental, climate and ventilation changes in the Bering Sea and the Pacific subarctic that have occurred during global climate change over the last two glaciation-ice cycles (190-0 thousand years ago) will be established. Analysis of mutual influence of environment and climate parameters between the subarctic of the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea over the last 190 thousand years. The experiment is aimed at studying the distribution of chemical elements, markers of paleoclimatic changes along the core of bottom sediments in order to identify orbital and rapid climate changes in the last two cycles of glaciation-icing. And also to clarify the role of the region in changes in the palaeoceanology of the world's oceans and in the interaction of water and atmosphere that had occurred during orbital and millennial climate changes. As part of the work were obtained distributions of chemical elements (from K to Mo for K-series and U, Th, Pb for L-series) along the column under study in 1 cm steps. The conducted cluster analysis showed the presence of two large groups of elements. The first one reflects the terrigenous component of the sediment (K, Rb, Nb, Th, Y, Zr, Mo, Ti, Fe, etc.) and the second - biogenic (Ca, Sr, U, Ge, As, Br).

Unlike static shading, CABE systems include dynamic operations that significantly affect their performance; thus, well-informed strategies for scheduling dynamic operations should be integrated to analyze CABE performance. In this study, two conflicting objectives were pursued: minimizing cooling load and maximizing daylighting performance during the summer season in a hot and humid climate (Houston, Texas). Variables in the CABE performance optimization process were defined as dynamic operation schedules having either parametric linear or non-linear relationships between the degree of openness of the CABE model and certain weather stimuli (i.e., solar radiation). Two CABE models were tested with the PBM by integrating a parametric non-linear function that efficiently conducted the optimization process in a large search space. The outcomes of this optimization study included Pareto-front solutions such as optimal CABE performance and their dynamic operation scenarios. These optimal operation scenarios were determined based on the CABE design options available and user's desired objectives; in some cases, static scenarios were found to be superior. Ultimately, combining PBM with a MOO framework will contribute to the field of performance-based CABE design by supporting architects and engineers and facilitating better decisions through well-informed dynamic operation scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy; Climate-adaptive kinetic facade; Daylighting; Dynamic operations schedule; Multi objective optimization (MOO); Parametric behavior map (PBM)","Architectural design; Functions; Multiobjective optimization; Solar buildings; Building envelope design; Conflicting objectives; Design decision-making; Hot and humid climate; Non-linear relationships; Optimization studies; Performance optimizations; Scheduling dynamics; Structural design; building; cooling; daylight; decision making; design; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091204812

The catalyst is a Cu film sputtered onto the surface of a PTFE membrane, through which the products of CO2 reduction are sampled for analysis by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). To avoid changes in the catalyst morphology, the cathode potential is set at -0.8 V vs RHE and -1.15 V vs RHE. We find that the faradaic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) minimizes and that for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) maximizes when the durations at each potential are 10 s. Under these conditions, the FE for the HER decreases to 11%, relative to 22% for static electrolysis, at -1.15 V vs RHE, and the FE for the CO2RR increases to 89%, relative to 78% for static electrolysis. Pulsed electrolysis also increases the FE for C2+ products from 68% for static electrolysis to 81%. Temporal analysis of the products by DEMS reveals that while the variation in product concentrations near the cathode begins in synchrony at the start of pulsed electrolysis, the concentration of C2H4 increases and those of CO and H2 decrease with extended time. We attribute these trends to an increase in the ratio of adsorbed CO to H on the catalyst surface. Simulation of pulsed electrolysis also shows that during the period when the cathode is at -0.8 V vs RHE, the local concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte near the cathode builds up. This inventory then allows electrolysis during the period at -1.15 V vs RHE to occur with a higher CO2 concentration than could be achieved for static electrolysis. The net effect of alternating cathode potentials is to enhance the local concentration of CO2, which favors the progress of the CO2RR relative to the HER and in particular the formation of C2+ products. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","copper; electrochemical CO2reduction; electrochemistry; pulsed electrolysis; unsteady state","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cathodes; Copper; Copper metallography; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Mass spectrometry; Morphology; Pollution control; Carbon dioxide reduction; Catalyst morphology; CO2 concentration; Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopies; Faradaic efficiencies; Product concentration; Pulsed-electrochemical; Temporal evolution; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096233161

Assessing historical trends and potential socio-economic impacts is especially difficult in the Arctic given limitations on availability of weather observations and historical impacts. This study utilizes a novel interdisciplinary approach that integrates archival analysis, observational data, and climate model downscaling to synthesize information on historical and projected impacts of extreme weather events in Nome, Alaska. Over 300 impacts (1990–2018) are identified based on analyses of the Nome Nugget newspaper articles and Storm Data entries. Historical impacts centered on transportation, community activities, and utilities. Analysis of observed and ERA5 reanalysis data indicates that impacts are frequently associated with high wind, extreme low temperatures, heavy snowfall events, and winter days above freezing. Downscaled output (2020–2100) from two climate models suggests that there will be changes in the frequency and timing of these extreme weather events. For example, extreme cold temperature is projected to decrease through the 2040s and then rarely occurs afterwards, and extreme wind events show little change before the 2070s. Significantly, our findings also reveal that not all weather-related extremes will change monotonically throughout the twenty-first century, such as extreme snowfall events that will increase through the 2030s before declining in the 2040s. The dynamical nature of projected changes in extreme events has implications for climate adaptation planning. © 2020, The Author(s).","Alaska; Archival analysis; Climate; Extreme events; Socio-economic impacts; Weather","Climate models; Extreme weather; Snow; Weather information services; Archival analysis; Climate projection; Community activities; Extreme weather events; Historical trends; Observational data; Socio-economic impacts; Weather observations; Climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; mass media; severe weather; snowstorm; Alaska; Arctic; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095591059

This study focused on the institutional support systems and support types available to farmers in agro-ecological zones of Limpopo Province and assessed support types best suited to each area. Six hundred farmers were purposively sampled across the agro-ecological zones of Limpopo and interviewed. Support types looked at included monetary, machinery, seeds, educational support and others (irrigation scheme, animals, fertilizer, pesticides). Supporting institutions included Agro finance institutions, DAFF, Banks, and NGOs. Results showed that 70.01% of farmers received support from DAFF 25.60% from NGO's and 4.39% from Agro finance institutions. The most number of support received was two types 33.3% of the farmers. The result from the ANOVA showed that there were no significant differences in the level of difficulty experienced by farmers in accessing the various support institutions across the agro-ecological zones. In terms of the various support types received, there was a statistically significant difference in seeds (p = 0.002 < α = 0.05) and educational (p = 0.0001 < α = 0.05) support received between the different areas. Furthermore, the support needs varied across zones with farmers in arid-zone needing machinery, education, seeds and lastly monetary support while the semi-arid zone needed machinery, education, others, seeds, monetary and the humid, machinery, education, others, money and seeds. It is therefore recommended that support for farmers should be location-specific in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of an area and not be based only on the availability of certain support.

First, it speaks to what kind of Urban Political Ecology (UPE)—or generally what I call a “spatialized political ecology”—may be appropriate for urban society. In a second step, it historicizes and spatializes the narrative by introducing an urban political ecology of landscapes. For that, the paper mobilizes the concepts of boundaries, belts, and in-betweens. The third part illustrates the transformation of postsuburban political ecologies in three rather different world regions. The last part of this paper examines what the potential is and what need for action exists in an urban society threatened and conditioned by the climate emergency and the Capitalocene. Ultimately, the paper aspires to move the debate on UPE more into the direction of making it relevant for the urban affairs of a suburban planet. © 2020 Urban Affairs Association.",,"conceptual framework; social change; spatial analysis; urban politics; urban society; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090006531

To account for adaptation of production to different weather conditions, it is crucial to allow for both spatial and temporal variation in the production process mapping weather to crop yields. We present a new panel data estimation technique, called mean observation OLS (MO-OLS) that allows for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in all regression parameters (intercepts and slopes). Both forms of heterogeneity are important: We find strong evidence that production function parameters adapt to local climate, and also that sensitivity of yield to high temperature declined from 1950–89. We use our estimates to project corn yields to 2100 using 19 climate models and three greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We predict unmitigated climate change will greatly reduce yield. Our mean prediction (over climate models) is that adaptation alone can mitigate 36% of the damage, while emissions reductions consistent with the Paris targets would mitigate 76%.

However, the wide range of SCC estimates provides limited practical assistance to policymakers setting specific CO2 prices. Here we describe an alternate near-term to net zero (NT2NZ) approach, estimating CO2 prices needed in the near term for consistency with a net-zero CO2 emissions target. This approach dovetails with the emissions-target-focused approach that frames climate policy discussions around the world, avoids uncertainties in estimates of climate damages and long-term decarbonization costs, offers transparency about sensitivities and enables the consideration of CO2 prices alongside a portfolio of policies. We estimate illustrative NT2NZ CO2 prices for the United States; for a 2050 net-zero CO2 emission target, prices are US$34 to US$64 per metric ton in 2025 and US$77 to US$124 in 2030.

Cornell University instituted the ""climate action plan""to achieve carbon neutrality, of which geothermal heat extracted from deep rocks (Earth source heat) is a critical component. This paper proposes coupling baseload geothermal heating with energy from waste biomass from Cornell's dairy farms to meet the campus' peak heating demand. The envisioned biomass peaking system, consisting of a hybrid anaerobic digestion/hydrothermal liquefaction/biomethanation process, produces renewable natural gas (RNG) for injection and storage into the natural gas (NG) distribution grid and uses NG withdrawals at times of peak heating demand. We show that 97% of the total annual peak heating demand (9661 MW h) can be met using continuous RNG production using manure from Cornell's 600 dairy cows, which provides 910 × 106 l of RNG/year. The overall RNG system requires $8.9 million of capital investment and, assuming favorable policies, could achieve an effective levelized cost of heat (LCOH) of $32/GJ (minimum RNG selling price) and a net present value of $7.5 million after a 30-year project lifetime. Favorable policies were quantified by examining a range of incentivized prices for RNG injection ($47/MJ) and assuming wholesale utilities costs (NG withdrawals and electric imports). Selling RNG at the New York commercial NG price ($7/GJ) with utilities imports at commercial rates produces an LCOH ($70/GJ) in excess of the RNG selling price, highlighting the importance of carbon credits for financial profitability. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Earth (planet); Fertilizers; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heating; Investments; Natural gas; Sales; Capital investment; Carbon neutralities; Cornell University; Critical component; Distribution grid; Energy from wastes; Financial profitabilities; Renewable energy deployments; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099227022

Our purpose of this research is to study the improvement of air quality and human mortality rates in countries worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Worldwide air quality data were collected from &gt; 12,000 continuous air quality monitoring stations on six continents covering 1000 major cities from over 100 countries. Here, we discussed the implementation of the open-source data set of basic air pollutants such as PM 2.5, NO2, temperature, relative humidity, and Air Quality Index variation during the pre-lockdown and lockdown pandemic COVID-19 in India and described the global aspect. An average concentration of PM 2.5 (145.51 μg/m3), NO2 (21.64 μg/m3), and AQI index (55.58) continuously decreased. The variation of PM 2.5, NO2, normally shows more than 25 μg/m3 every year, but during the COVID-19 lockdown period (April 2020) continuously decreased below 20 μg/m3. Similarly, the AQI index and meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed variation decreased significantly in the many countries in the world. In Asian countries, air quality improved during the national lockdown especially in the most polluted cities globally such as Beijing, Delhi, and Nanjing and also in developed cities like Madrid, New York, Paris, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo. Furthermore, the reduction of particulate matter was in about 46%, and other gaseous pollutants during the lockdown period were observed in a 54% reduction. We are witnessing pollution reductions which add significantly to improvements in air quality. This is due to the massive decrease in the use of fossil fuel, which in turn reduces production and traffic in general. People nowadays are now willing to see a comparatively healthier world with bleached skies and natural ecosystems. This research finding demonstrates potential safety benefits associated with improving air quality and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in decreases in mortality rates in India and around the world. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality improvement; COVID-19 pandemic; Mortality rate; National lockdown; World Air Quality Index","air quality; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; epidemic; fossil fuel; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; relative humidity; research work; viral disease; wind velocity; Beijing [China]; China; Delhi; France; Honshu; Ile de France; India; Japan; Jiangsu; Kanto; Madrid [Spain]; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; New York [United States]; Paris; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Spain; Sydney [New South Wales]; Tokyo [Kanto]; United States; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089369301

The proximity of computing to end users leads to lower service time and bandwidth requirements. Energy consumption is a matter of concern in such a system with a large number of computing nodes. Renewable energy sources can be utilized to lessen the burden on the main power grid and reduce the carbon footprint, but due to fluctuations, the effective utilization of renewable energy sources needs proper resource management. In this article, we deal with properly managing the resources in a fog environment where the fog nodes are equipped with onsite renewable energy. This article aims to design an efficient mechanism to dynamically dispatch requests among computing nodes and scale frequency and modulation level, based on the current workload and the availability of renewable energy sources, to minimize the service time while keeping the renewable energy utilization and stability at a satisfactory level. We state the problem as the design of a controller for a system with time-varying nonlinear state equations. Accordingly, we borrow the Lyapunov optimization technique from the control theory to design the request dispatching mechanism and prove its asymptotic optimality. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the naive time-aware baseline scheme up to 26% and 39%, respectively, in terms of service time and renewable energy utilization. © 2014 IEEE.","Dynamic modulation scaling (DMS); dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS); fog computing (FC); Lyapunov optimization technique (LOT); renewable energy; request dispatching","Carbon footprint; Computation theory; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Equations of state; Fog; Fog computing; Frequency modulation; Green computing; Natural resources; Nonlinear equations; Asymptotic optimality; Bandwidth requirement; Computing environments; Distributed processing; Extensive simulations; Nonlinear state equations; Optimization techniques; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096241928

This study develops a framework for selecting near-optimal cropland sites to minimize the cost to produce a targeted quantity of an energy crop, considering soil properties, fertilizer management, and spatio-temporal trends in crop yield and soil emissions. DayCent, a biogeochemical model, simulates site-level crop yield, and soil emissions. As a case study, this framework is applied to a 2.08 × 108 L year−1 capacity barley-to-ethanol biorefinery that selects cultivation sites from winter fallow cropland in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA. The framework implements carbon crediting as per California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Our analysis finds the biorefinery's strategy on co-products significantly influences its life-cycle carbon intensity ranging between 0.74 gCO2e MJ−1 for all co-product use and 59 gCO2e MJ−1 for no co-product use. Coastal counties in Delaware show low soil emission and high yield, but higher transportation distances increase the carbon intensity of these distant croplands. When co-products are used, the least intensive fertilizer management with fertilizer applications in spring is identified as the cost-optimized choice for the biorefinery. It is also the option economically favored by growers, suggesting that detailed monitoring of these practices might not be needed to assure the adoption of low-emission cultivation practices. However, the framework might demonstrate different results for other biofuel-crop scenarios or different locations. The framework presented can assess the performance of a biorefinery prospectively and improve investors’ confidence in the biofuel industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","barley-to-ethanol; biofuel portfolio; LCFS; life cycle assessment; optimization; RFS2","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Carbon; Chemical industry; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Fertilizers; Refining; Soils; Biogeochemical modeling; Carbon intensity; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizer management; Low carbon fuels; Optimization framework; Spatio temporal; Transportation distance; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091187616

For a typical city only one third to half of their carbon footprint (CF) is emitted within the jurisdiction, while the majority is embodied in goods and services flowing into the city. To support well-informed mitigation efforts, administrators need robust inventories of both direct emissions as well as the supply chain emissions. Here we construct household CF inventories for 1172 Japanese cities using detailed consumer expenditure data and a Japanese domestic multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. We identify the consumption activities which city policymakers can target to reduce CF. We observe a strong concentration of household CF in a few cities in Japan: 40% of the total Japanese CF is driven by 143 cities. Understanding a city's consumption-based CF of households in addition to its direct emissions exposes additional policy options for each citizen to contribute to achieving national goals. © 2020 The Author(s).

They were analyzed for pinene and isoprene secondary organic aerosol (PSOA-ISOA) tracers, linear dicarboxylic acids (DCAs), hydroxyacids (HAs), aromatic acids (AAs), monocarboxylic acids (MCAs) and levoglucosan by GC/MS with prior 3-step derivatization. DCAs, AAs, MCAs and levoglucosan exhibited significantly higher concentrations (p < 0.05) in LIM, PSOAs and ISOAs in AGM (p < 0.05), whereas mixed trends were found for HAs. Among DCAs, succinic was the most abundant in both sites, accounting for 42.5% and 36.5% of the total DCAs in LIM and AGM respectively, followed by adipic in LIM (20.1%) and azelaic in AGM (22.4%). Malic, phthalic and palmitic acids were the dominant HA, AA and MCA, respectively. Regarding PSOAs, significant differences were observed between the two sites, with the first-generation products accounting for 59.8% of the total measured PSOAs in AGM, but were remarkably lowered (10.3%) in LIM indicating that they were highly oxidized. 2-Methylerythritol was the dominant ISOA tracer in both sites; nevertheless the elevated relative abundance of 2-methylglyceric acid in LIM implies the influences of higher NOx levels. The increased O3 levels observed in AGM appear to have a significant impact on SOA formation. Source apportionment tools employed revealed factors related to secondary formation processes including oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, pinene, isoprene and anthropogenic VOCs and factors associated with primary sources such as biomass burning, plant emissions and/or cooking and motor exhaust, with noteworthy differences observed between the two areas. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aerosols; Chloroacetic acid; Chromatographic analysis; Isoprene; Monoterpenes; Palmitic acid; Rural areas; Tracers; Unsaturated fatty acids; 2-methylglyceric acid; Atmospheric oxidants; Eastern Mediterranean; Monocarboxylic acids; Polar organic compounds; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Urban and rural areas; Urban growth; aromatic carboxylic acid; azelaic acid; carboxylic acid; dicarboxylic acid; hydroxyacid; isoprene; levoglucosan; malic acid; organic compound; oxidizing agent; palmitic acid derivative; phthalic acid; pinene; succinic acid; unsaturated fatty acid; oxidizing agent; Article; Cyprus; derivatization; oxidation; priority journal; rural area; secondary organic aerosol; summer; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; particulate matter; Southern Europe; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Mediterranean Region; Oxidants; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096456952

Box: 987-98135, Zahedan, Iran","Fluctuations of the climate variables have increased in the recent years. These fluctuations are different in each climatic region. Net primary production (NPP) indicating the plant growth and carbon stabilization over period of time is influenced by these fluctuations. Investigation of the variations in the NPP and analysis of its relationship with the climatic and environmental variables can play a key role in determining the effects of fluctuations of climatic variables on the NPP. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in the NPP and its correlation with precipitation rate and temperature during 2000–2014 based on the annual NPP estimates determined by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and precipitation and temperature data of the synoptic stations in eight climate regions in Iran. The slope of variations in the NPP was calculated in these climatic regions, and then, the changes in the NPP trend at two confidence levels of 95 and 99% were investigated based on the pixel-based method using the Mann–Kendall test. The sensitivity of NPP to climatic variables of temperature and precipitation was also estimated by calculating the correlation. The results showed the significant spatial distribution of NPP in the whole region under study indicating a declining trend from north to south and from west to east directions. The results also indicated the nonlinear variations in the temporal distribution of NPP. The annual mean NPP was found to follow the climatic boundaries in the climatic regions except for climate region 2, and region with the higher annual mean precipitation had higher annual mean NPP. Analysis of the trend by the Mann–Kendall method revealed that 3.2% of the pixels in the whole region followed a certain trend. Among the pixels, 70% of them followed a negative trend and the remaining 30% followed a positive trend. The greatest number of pixels with a certain trend was found in the Gulf of Oman coast climate region so that 93% of the pixels had a positive trend. The lowest number of pixels with a certain trend was observed in eastern Alborz foothills so that 87% of the pixels showed a negative trend. Slope variations of the NPP in the whole region varied from − 35 to 46 gC m2 year−1. The eastern plateau had the highest negative slope variations among the climate regions, and the highest positive slope variation of 42% was observed in the highlands climate region. In general, the precipitation rate and temperature showed a mean partial coefficient of 0.22 and 0.02, respectively, and the correlation between the NPP and temperature and precipitation was different in each climatic region. The temperature was negatively correlated with the NPP in four climatic regions with higher annual mean temperatures and in other climatic regions; it had a weak positive correlation. Therefore, the sensitivity of NPP to precipitation and temperature was different in each climatic region. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climatic variability; MODIS; Net primary production; Spatial–temporal analysis; Trend analysis","Radiometers; Annual mean precipitation; Annual mean temperatures; Environmental variables; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors; Net primary production; Positive correlations; Spatio-temporal changes; Temporal distribution; Pixels; annual variation; climate variation; MODIS; net primary production; pixel; precipitation assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Article; climate; correlational study; desert climate; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; humidity; Iran; net primary production; precipitation; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Oman; theoretical model; Iran; Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Oman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093122301

The first-ever long-term measurement of direct shortwave composite and black carbon aerosol radiative properties over a semi-arid region, Anantapur, in southern India is presented. Long-term variations in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration from December 2007 to November 2017 are discussed with specific emphasis on intra-seasonal variation in aerosol optical properties, meteorology, transport pathways, and their implications for direct short wave radiative forcing over Anantapur. The intra-seasonal mean AOD showed strong seasonal dependence with the highest (0.47 ± 0.03) during summer and lowest (0.28 ± 0.03) during the monsoon. Meanwhile, the intra-seasonal mean (±σ) BC mass concentration was about 3.57 ± 0.45, 2.60 ± 0.58, 1.22 ± 0.18 and 2.24 ± 0.28 μg m−3 during winter, summer, monsoon and post-monsoon respectively. Furthermore, there is an obvious temporal variation in intra-seasonal BC mass concentration during the dry season (winter and summer). To be more specific, the intra-seasonal mean (±σ) BC mass concentration before 2012 (after 2012) during the dry season was about 3.37 ± 0.7 μg m−3 (2.80 ± 0.58 μg m−3), respectively. Concentration weighted trajectory analyses (CWT) revealed that the air masses originated from the continental and polluted environments located in the central and northern parts of India (except monsoon), in regulating BC mass concentration over measurement location. Further, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) derived aerosol vertical extinction profiles (532 nm) showed that majority aerosols (&gt;250 Mm−1) are confined within 2 km from the surface during winter while in summer particles are distributed throughout the profile (~6 km) with extinction coefficient varying between 200 and 250 Mm−1. The Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model estimated intra-seasonal mean direct shortwave composite aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) in the atmosphere (ATM) was about 31.13 ± 3.36, 34.82 ± 3.89, 17.10 ± 1.15, and 17.44 ± 1.81 Wm-2 during winter, summer, monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. The positive signs of ATM forcing in all seasons indicate a warming of the atmosphere, and the corresponding heating rate was around a factor of two higher during the dry season (0.92 ± 0.12 Kday−1) than the wet season (monsoon and post-monsoon) (0.49 ± 0.04 Kday−1). The intra-seasonal mean BC forcing in ATM before 2012 (After 2012) during the dry season was about 24.14 ± 2.85Wm-2(20.09 ± 2.59Wm-2), respectively. The contribution of BC alone to the composite forcing during the study period over the station was ~68%. These findings would be helpful for regional climate studies and making air pollution control policy over the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosols; Climate change; Radiative forcing; Semi-arid region","Air pollution control; Arid regions; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Drought; Fog; Global warming; Optical properties; Optical radar; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol optical property; Aerosol radiative forcing; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Extinction coefficients; In-depth understanding; Long-term measurements; Measurement locations; Aerosols; black carbon; aerosol; atmospheric forcing; atmospheric modeling; black carbon; climate change; concentration (composition); ground-based measurement; long-term change; optical depth; semiarid region; shortwave radiation; aerosol; air pollution control; Article; climate change; cooling; dry season; India; infrared radiation; monsoon climate; priority journal; radiative forcing; rainy season; semiarid climate; summer; surface property; winter; Anantapur; Andhra Pradesh; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089505819

Within the last decade, cities together with other actors have initiated neighborhood-level climate change projects that build on the concept of experimentation using participation and coproduction. Common features in these initiatives are the limitation of the project to a geographically specific area within the city, inclusion of stakeholders from that physical location, and the use of different types of experimentation through participation in order to pursue climate objectives. This qualitative case study discusses the participatory experimentation and potential structural transformations by focusing on the Climate Street project of Helsinki and Vantaa, Finland. More specifically, we examine how learning, participation, and public visibility contribute toward the impact of the project. Our results show that existing urban governance structures restrict experiments in many ways and only certain types of change are feasible.

In order to meet the strengthened emission regulations, innovative combustion technologies that can maintain power and improve fuel efficiency are becoming important solutions for diesel engines. This study deals with the goal of homogeneous combustion formation through changes in injection angle of conventional diesel engines. The conventional diesel engines show local combustion and has the limitation of generating exhaust gas including wall wetting phenomena. On the other hand, the appropriate injection angle optimization for the piston bowl shape can reduce wall wetting and form a homogeneous mixture overall in combustion. This study used 1D thermodynamic simulation to validate the conventional 4-cylinder diesel engine and compared to the test results to obtain modeling accuracy. To describe combustion behavior under 1D environment, multi-injection was used to increase the mixing time between air and fuel, which increases the temperature inside the cylinder, evaporates the fuel and creates a in-cylinder mixture and combustion processes. Secondly, detailed combustion analysis was performed using 3D CFD for spray combustion by creating a homogeneous mixture with change in injection angle, and the detailed combustion behavior was visualized. As a result, the optimized injection can provide enhanced egg motion, and optimal Heat Release Rate (HRR) can cause the soot to oxidize. Also optimized injection angles that can reduce the wall wetting were predicted to prevent incomplete combustion by forming homogeneous mixture. The emission results from homogenous mixture confirmed that nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter(PM) were reduced after combustion, and the results of unburned hydrocarbon(UHC) and carbon monoxide(CO) were confirmed by varying injection angle with reduced wall wetting. This can meet the premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) by reducing emissions of NOx and PM. Furthermore, changing the injection angle for complete combustion can be an indicator for small diesel engines by connecting with early injection strategies, which is our future work scope. © 2020 SAE International.

Receptor models (RM) can identify major sources: transport, industry, residential, etc. However, RM results are typically available for short term periods, and there is a paucity of RM results for developing countries. We propose to combine a cluster analysis (CA) of air pollution and meteorological measurements with a short-term RM analysis to estimate a long-term, hourly source apportionment of ambient PM2.5 and PM10 . We have developed a proof of the concept for this proposed methodology in three case studies: a large metropolitan zone, a city with dominant residential wood burning (RWB) emissions, and a city in the middle of a desert region. We have found it feasible to identify the major sources in the CA results and obtain hourly time series of their contributions, effectively extending short-term RM results to the whole ambient monitoring period. This methodology adds value to existing ambient data.

This has sparked scientific debate on how to achieve natural climate solutions. Central to this debate is whether sustainably managing forests and protected areas will deliver global climate mitigation benefits, while ensuring local peoples’ health and well-being. Here, we evaluate the 10-y impact of a human-centered solution to achieve natural climate mitigation through reductions in illegal logging in rural Borneo: an intervention aimed at expanding health care access and use for communities living near a national park, with clinic discounts offsetting costs historically met through illegal logging. Conservation, education, and alternative livelihood programs were also offered. We hypothesized that this would lead to improved health and well-being, while also alleviating illegal logging activity within the protected forest. We estimated that 27.4 km2 of deforestation was averted in the national park over a decade (∼70% reduction in deforestation compared to a synthetic control, permuted P = 0.038). Concurrently, the intervention provided health care access to more than 28,400 unique patients, with clinic usage and patient visitation frequency highest in communities participating in the intervention. Finally, we observed a dose–response in forest change rate to intervention engagement (person-contacts with intervention activities) across communities bordering the park: The greatest logging reductions were adjacent to the most highly engaged villages. Results suggest that this community-derived solution simultaneously improved health care access for local and indigenous communities and sustainably conserved carbon stocks in a protected tropical forest. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This study examined the carbon emission reduction potential in the Finnish energy system with power-to-heat (P2H) coupling of the electricity and heat sectors with different housing renovation levels. The measures conducted in the energy system were conducted as follows. Wind power generation was increased in the Finnish power system with 10 increments. For each of these, the operation of hydropower was optimized to maximize the utilization of new wind generation. The excess wind generation was used to replace electricity and heat from combined heat and power production for district heating. The P2H conversion was performed by either 2000 m deep borehole heat exchangers coupled to heat pumps, with possible priming of heat, or with electrode boilers. The housing stock renovated to different levels affected both the electricity and district heating demands. The carbon emission reduction potential of the building renovation measures, and the energy system measures were determined over 25 years. Together with the required investment costs for the different measures, unit costs of emission reductions, €/t-CO2, were determined. The lowest unit cost solution of different measures was established, for which the unit cost of emission reductions was 241 €/t-CO2 and the reduced carbon emissions 11.3 Mt-CO2 annually. Moreover, the energy system measures were found to be less expensive compared to the building renovation measures, in terms of unit costs, and the P2H coupling a cost-efficient manner to increase the emission reductions. © 2020 by the authors.

Although platinum (Pt)-based materials are considered state-of-the-art ORR catalysts, their high cost and poor durability greatly impede their extensive application in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells. Here, we report a bimetallic M–Nx–C-class electrocatalyst comprising Co- and Fe-coordinated graphitic carbon nitride ((Co,Fe)–CN) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as an effective substitute for expensive Pt-based catalysts for the ORR in acidic media. The fabricated (Co,Fe)–CN/RGO catalyst exhibits a high surface area, high porosity, fast charge-transfer kinetics at the (Co,Fe)–CN/RGO 2D/2D interface, and abundant Co–Nx–C and Fe–Nx–C active sites. Because of these favorable properties, the optimized (Co,Fe)–CN/RGO catalyst displayed extraordinary electrocatalytic ORR activity, with an onset potential of 875 mV, which is only 41 mV more negative than that of a commercial Pt/C, and follows an efficient four-electron reaction pathway in acidic media. Notably, the fabricated catalyst demonstrated excellent methanol tolerance and long-term stability compared with the reference Pt/C. Therefore, this work provides a rational design approach to fabricating graphitic-C3N4-based nonprecious bimetallic electrocatalysts with M–Nx–C active sites for enhanced ORR activity in fuel-cell applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bimetallic; Electrocatalysis; g-C3N4; Nonprecious catalyst; Oxygen reduction reaction","Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Cobalt; Coordination reactions; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Graphene; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Iron compounds; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reduced Graphene Oxide; Bimetallic electrocatalysts; Charge transfer kinetics; Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction; Fuel cell application; Long term stability; Methanol tolerance; Reaction pathways; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); C (programming language)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088904242

Discriminating silicate versus carbonate weathering from sedimentary records is helpful to understand the coupling relationship between weathering and past climate. However, owing to the paucity of well-dated and continuous records of weathering and erosion, the relationship between silicate and carbonate weathering and their links with mountain uplift and glacial-interglacial climate remain elusive. Geochemical analysis of a 666 m core from the Heqing basin, a paleolake situated at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, demonstrates silicate versus carbonate weathering and erosion changes under Indian summer monsoon (ISM) conditions spanning the entire Pleistocene, via respective tracing between Rb/Sr and Al/Na ratios. The Rb/Sr record is interpreted as reflecting a competition between clayey silicate-origin Rb versus carbonate-origin Sr fluxes, whereas Al/Na ratio is a balance between weathering and erosion of silicate minerals, both pacing the glacial-interglacial cycles of the ISM. During interglacials, strong silicate weathering intensity reflected by low Al/Na values is mainly controlled by warmer temperatures, with the reduced variability during 1.82–0.92 Ma, recalling the pacing of the Arabian Sea surface temperature amplitudes. Within glacials, the weak carbonate leaching and clay erosion within the older and younger intervals are interrupted by strong clay erosion within the middle interval. In conclusion, the Heqing Rb/Sr and Al/Na records reveal the sensitivity of catchment weathering and erosion to ISM changes over glacial-interglacial timescales with warmer temperature enhancing silicate weathering and clay formation during interglacials and greater physical erosion during glacials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Erosion; Glacial-interglacial cycle; Heqing; Indian summer monsoon; The Pleistocene; Weathering; Yunnan","Analytical geochemistry; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbonation; Catchments; Climate change; Erosion; Glacial geology; Oceanography; Runoff; Silicate minerals; Weathering; Carbonate weathering; Coupling relationships; Geochemical analysis; Glacial-interglacial cycles; Indian summer monsoon; Interglacial climate; Sedimentary records; Silicate weathering; Rubidium compounds; catchment; chemical weathering; climate change; glacial-interglacial cycle; monsoon; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; summer; Arabian Sea; China; Heqing; Howard County [Indiana]; India; Indian Ocean; Indiana; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; United States; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091985774

This study’s aim is to determine what kinds of spatial structures and morphologies of waterfront green spaces offer a good cooling effect, combined with three different typical patterns in Shanghai. A multidimensional spatial influence variable system based on the cooling effect was constructed to describe the spatial structural and morphological factors of the green space network. The ENVI-met 4.3 software, developed by Michael Bruse at Bochum, German, was used to simulate the microclimate distribution data, combined with the boosted regression tree (BRT) model and the correlation analysis method. The results showed that at the network level, the distance from the water body and the connectivity of green space had a stronger cooling correlation. The orientation of green corridors consistent with a summer monsoon had larger cooling effect ranges.

Correct handling of the relationship between economic development and environmental protection is of great significance to the implementation of green logistics, which is an important component of China’s strategy for strong transportation. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the carbon emissions efficiency of logistics industry from a new strong transportation strategy perspective. A super-efficiency slack-based measurement (Super-SBM) model and Malmquist index are combined to evaluate the static and dynamic carbon emissions efficiency of the logistics industry. The results indicate that compared with the SBM model, the Super-SBM model can more effectively measure the carbon emissions efficiency of the logistics industry. Pilot regions for the strong transportation strategy were divided into two categories, namely regions with slow carbon emission growth rates but high efficiency, and regions with high carbon emission growth rates but low efficiency. Some policy recommendations from the strong transportation strategy perspective were proposed to improve the carbon emissions efficiency of the logistics industry, especially for the second category of pilot regions. This study is expected to provide a basis for decision-making for efficient emissions reduction measures and policies, and to encourage the pilot regions to take the lead in achieving the goal of China’s strategy for transportation. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Employing the ArcSWAT model, an attempt was made to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the Nicolet River watershed's seasonal and annual streamflow, particularly that portion affected by snowmelt. Calibrated and validated against observed streamflow data for the periods of 1986–1990 and 1991–2000, respectively, the model reliably predicted daily streamflow (e.g., percent bias within ±15%, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency >0.50, and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation ≤0.70). In an effort to investigate the impacts of climate change on streamflow, future climate datasets were generated for 2053–2067 by implementing the eleven sets of existing Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations produced for the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) in the ArcSWAT model. The ArcSWAT model's hydrological responses were closely tied to changes of climate variables: a strong correlation existed between simulated runoff and precipitation, and between temperature and predicted evapotranspiration, snowfall, and winter snowmelt. Projected future climate data showed increases in both average temperature (+2.5 °C) and precipitation (+21%). Significant greater total precipitation was forecasted for the winter season, while total snowfall was projected to decrease by 6%. However, the snowmelt showed an increasing trend for the late winter and earlier spring period. Streamflow was expected to increase annually and in most seasons except spring. Annual peak flows volumes would increase by 13% in the future and the occurrence of peak flows would shift to the winter (vs. the spring), indicating a greater risk of winter flooding in the future. The individual impact of temperature and precipitation on peak flows showed that increases in peak flows were mainly tied to increased precipitation, while the shift in their timing was mostly tied to warming temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ArcSWAT; Climate change; Peak flows; Snowmelt; Streamflow","Climate models; Floods; Mean square error; Rivers; Snow; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Watersheds; Climate change impact; Hydrological response; Impact of temperatures; Regional climate changes; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Root mean square errors; Strong correlation; Total precipitation; Climate change; calibration; climate change; climate effect; data set; flooding; hydrological modeling; model validation; peak flow; snowmelt; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; watershed; Canada; Nicolet River; Quebec [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090405445

In addition, nanowire thermal expansion caused by prepulse heating is considered. We find that after expansion, the target becomes relativistically transparent to the main pulse. The average value of particle energy density decreases slightly and its distribution tends to resemble that of solid targets. Furthermore, energy density scaling with laser intensities is given.

Meanwhile, the role of ship emissions on air quality is becoming increasingly important with the growing maritime transport and less strict regulations. In this study, we modeled the air quality in Europe between 1990 and 2030 with ten-year intervals, using the regional air quality model CAMx version 6.50, to investigate the changes in the past (1990–2010) as well as the effects of different land and ship emission scenarios in the future (2020,2030). The modeled mean ozone levels decreased slightly during the first decade but then started increasing again especially in polluted areas. Results from the future scenarios suggest that by 2030 the peak ozone would decrease, leading to a decrease in the days exceeding the maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8) limit values (60 ppb) by 51% in southern Europe relative to 1990. The model results show a decrease of 56% (6.3 μg m−3) in PM2.5 concentrations from 1990 to 2030 under current legislation, mostly due to a large drop in sulfate (representing up to 44% of the total PM2.5 decrease during 1990–2000) while nitrate concentrations were predicted to go down with an increasing rate (10% of total PM2.5 decrease during 1990–2000 while 36% during 2020–2030). The ship emissions if reduced according to the maximum technically feasible reduction (MTFR) scenario were predicted to contribute up to 19% of the decrease in the PM2.5 concentrations over land between 2010 and 2030. Ship emission reductions according to the MTFR scenario would lead to a decrease in the days with MDA8 exceeding EU limits by 24–28% (10–14 days) around the coastal regions. The results obtained in our study show the increasing importance of ship emission reductions, after a relatively large decrease in land emissions was achieved in Europe. © 2020 The Authors","CAMx; Europe; Ozone; PM2.5; Ship emissions","Air quality; Emission control; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Sulfur compounds; Anthropogenic emissions; Coastal regions; Maritime transport; Nitrate concentration; PM2.5 concentration; Regional air quality modeling; Ship emissions; Southern Europe; Ships; isoprene; monoterpene; nitrate; organic carbon; ozone; sesquiterpene; volatile organic compound; air quality; coastal zone; concentration (composition); emission control; legislative implementation; maritime transportation; ozone; particulate matter; traffic emission; air and air related phenomena; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution indicator; air quality; Article; combustion; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; Europe; exhaust gas; law; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; sea; seasonal variation; ship emission; simulation; summer; traffic; urban area; winter; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087107002

However, the well-known proximity-dependent selectivity observed in several high-profile experiments is yet to be understood. Here, we reveal that such dependence is closely associated with the kinetics involved. Based on reaction-diffusion dynamics together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulation on a coarse-grained model, one famous example, namely, the proximity-dependent selectivity from carbon dioxide to liquid fuels on a bifunctional catalyst composed of HZSM-5 and In2O3, has been systematically examined. It is found that the diffusion kinetics of the intermediate methanol generated on In2O3 plays a decisive role for the selectivity. For different In2O3/HZSM-5 proximities, the local methanol concentration induces a shift of the dominant process for subsequent methanol-to-hydrocarbon reactions inside HZSM-5, resulting in a preferred reaction window to generate favorable liquid fuels with profound high selectivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of kinetic effects in the design of multifunctional catalysts. ©","bifunctional catalyst; carbon dioxide reduction; kinetic; methanol-to-hydrocarbon reaction; proximity","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Indium compounds; Kinetics; Liquid fuels; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Monte Carlo methods; Pollution control; Bi-functional catalysts; Carbon dioxide reduction; Functional components; Kinetic monte carlo simulation; Methanol concentration; Methanol-to-hydrocarbons; Multifunctional catalysts; Reaction-diffusion dynamics; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096923894

However, it generally possesses unique physicochemical properties and complex organics, which could affect soil methanogenesis. In this study，straw-based biochars obtained at 300 °C (BC300), 500 °C (BC500) and 700 °C (BC700) were added to the paddy soil. Compared with the blank group, BC300 significantly increased paddy soil methane emissions by about 38%. However, this promoting effect gradually disappeared with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, and the inhibition even appeared in the BC700 group with the methane reduction by 18.2%. This might be related to the organics released from biochar. Van Krevelen (VK) diagram showed that the aromaticity of BC700 and BC500 were significantly higher than BC300. Fluorescent analysis further revealed that BC300 increased the amount of degradable fluorescent organics in the soil, which could provide more substrate for methane production. Moreover, as pyrolysis temperature increased, the fluorescent organics released were more likely to be non-biodegradable humus. In addition, it was shown that BC700 could adsorb some inherent organics in the soil, and thus reduced the total organic content and inhibited soil methane emissions. Microbial analysis showed that methanogenesis had a positive correlation with the abundance of syntrophic bacteria (e.g. Desulfobacca and Clostridium) which had ability to further degrade various types of organics and provided substrates to the methanogens.

However, the full life cycle environmental and economic implications of biomass heat are currently unknown and are therefore explored herein. The results indicate that heat from solid biomass can reduce global warming potential as well as depletion of fossil resources and the ozone layer by &gt;90% compared to fossil fuels. However, acidification, eutrophication, and human and eco-toxicities are much higher than for heat from natural gas. Biomass heat is also 23% more expensive than heat from gas boilers. However, with the subsidies available in the UK, it is 52% cheaper. Using the waste wood and energy crops available in the UK, it can meet 5% of the national heat demand and save 7.3 Mt CO2 eq. year−1 or 1.5% of UK emissions. Increasing cultivation of energy crops can provide 20% of heat demand by 2030 and save 5.1% of national emissions. Therefore, the government should continue to incentivize biomass heat while tightening regulations to prevent an increase in other impacts. However, increasing biomass heat provision will be challenging due to a large number of installations needed (27 000–85 000) and lack of district heating networks in the UK. © 2019 The Authors.

API is calculated by taking air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and socio-economic and biological aspects into account. In the present work, API of four current deciduous tree species in urban areas of Iran was evaluated. The seedlings were soil-dusted by a dust simulator in plastic chambers at levels of 0, 300, 750, and 1500 μg/m3 at intervals of 1 week for 70 days. At 750 and 1500 μg/m3 dust concentrations (DCs), greatest dust collection capacity was observed with Morus alba and the lowest one with Melia azedarach. Increasing DC declined APTI of all species. At 750 μg/m3 DC, only Morus was tolerant, but at 1500 μg/m3 DC, this species and Melia were categorized as intermediate, and Celtis caucasica and Fraxinus rotundifolia as sensitive. Morus was assessed as a good performer under two higher DC. Celtis was recognized as a moderate under 750 μg/m3 DC and poor performer under 1500 μg/m3 DC. Thus, Celtis can be considered as a biomonitor for air quality or as sink for dust in high dusty areas because of its high capacity of dust deposition. At two higher DCs, Fraxinus and Melia showed very poor and poor performance; planting these species in high dust areas is not recommended. In contrast, Morus is the most suitable tree species for urban green spaces in dusty regions, due to its high dust collection capacity and high APTI and API values. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","API; APTI; Dust concentration; Dust-tolerant species; Green belt; Urban forests","air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); deciduous tree; performance assessment; pollution tolerance; urban area; urban pollution; Iran; Celtis; Celtis caucasica; Fraxinus; Melia; Melia azedarach; Morus (plant); Morus alba; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; dust; environmental monitoring; Iran; plant leaf; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Plant Leaves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087656659

Following deposition, subsequent aeolian remobilisation of ash can potentially exacerbate primary impacts on timescales of months to millennia. Recent ash remobilisation events (e.g., following eruptions of Cordón Caulle 2011; Chile, and Eyjafjallajökull 2010, Iceland) have highlighted this to be a recurring phenomenon with consequences for human health, economic sectors, and critical infrastructure. Consequently, scientists from observatories and Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs), as well as researchers from fields including volcanology, aeolian processes and soil sciences, convened at the San Carlos de Bariloche headquarters of the Argentinian National Institute of Agricultural Technology to discuss the “state of the art” for field studies of remobilised deposits as well as monitoring, modeling and understanding ash remobilisation. In this article, we identify practices for field characterisation of deposits and active processes, including mapping, particle characterisation and sediment traps. Furthermore, since forecast models currently rely on poorly-constrained dust emission schemes, we call for laboratory and field measurements to better parameterise the flux of volcanic ash as a function of friction velocity. While source area location and extent are currently the primary inputs for dispersion models, once emission schemes become more sophisticated and better constrained, other parameters will also become important (e.g., source material volume and properties, effective precipitation, type and distribution of vegetation cover, friction velocity). Thus, aeolian ash remobilisation hazard and associated impact assessment require systematic monitoring, including the development of a regularly-updated spatial database of resuspension source areas. © Copyright © 2020 Jarvis, Bonadonna, Dominguez, Forte, Frischknecht, Bran, Aguilar, Beckett, Elissondo, Gillies, Kueppers, Merrison, Varley and Wallace.","aeolian processes; ash remobilisation; ash resuspension; field geology; hazard monitoring; modeling; volcanic ash","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Deposits; Friction; Agricultural technologies; Dispersion models; Field measurement; Friction velocity; Impact assessments; State of the art; Vegetation cover; Volcanic eruptions; Volcanoes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104142941

This is a major challenge, as 90% of all households must be disconnected from the gas grid. The responsibilities and roles of homeowners and tenants in this transition may differ, which makes it interesting to compare their perceptions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted four focus groups (n = 24) and a survey (n = 1245) in a subsidized and an unsubsidized neighbourhood to explore differences in perceptions of the transition between homeowners and tenants, and the influence of the local context in this regard. Our research shows that homeowners and tenants consider similar themes to be important in the transition towards sustainable heat (focus groups) and that their acceptance of the transition is related to similar predictors, including environmental concerns and trust in the municipality and the civil neighbourhood council (survey). However, the perceptions of these variables differ between homeowners and tenants (survey). Homeowners are less positive about becoming natural gas free, have a stronger wish to be engaged in the transition, are more interested in its various aspects, and have more knowledge about the transition than tenants. Although both groups regard the municipality as the primarily responsible actor in the transition, tenants see the housing corporation as the responsible actor for adjusting their homes and homeowners feel responsible themselves, but doubt whether they have the ability to do so. © 2020 The Authors","Energy transition; Homeowners vs. tenants; Local initiatives; Natural gas free; Sustainable heat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088379988

Energy performance gaps are usually defined as the difference between energy demand as predicted during the planning phase and energy demand as measured during operation. It is assumed that the research strand, by reducing such gaps, contributes to the United Nations SDGs 7 (clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities) and 13 (climate action). However, in this conceptual article based on literature review we argue that blind spots in the current definition of energy performance gap research (embodied energy, gap between optimal and planned energy performance, greenhouse gas emissions, dynamic character) and weaknesses of frequently used scientific paradigms (techno-economic, psychological) may lead to the fact that the measures identified to eliminate energy-wasting and climate-damaging practices are of limited value. In fact, it is quite possible that conventional energy performance gap research even contributes to perpetuating such practices. The authors therefore call for a definition and paradigm shift in energy performance gap research, suggesting two broader definitions of the research subject (called life cycle energy performance gaps and climate performance gaps) and a promising alternative scientific paradigm (practice theory). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Current definition; Energy performance; Life cycle energies; Literature reviews; Practice theories; Research subjects; Scientific paradigm; Sustainable cities; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097222745

The performance of the economy is tracked using two composite indicators constructed especially for this study: an environmental burden index (EBI) which describes the environmental performance of the model; and a composite sustainable prosperity index (SPI) which is based on a weighted average of seven economic, social and environmental performance indicators. Contrary to the widely accepted view, the results suggest that ‘green growth’ (in the Carbon Reduction Scenario) may be slower than ‘brown growth’. More importantly, we show (in the Sustainable Prosperity Scenario) that improved environmental and social outcomes are possible even as the growth rate declines to zero. © 2020 The Authors","Canadian economy; Degrowth; Ecological macroeconomics; Post-growth economics; System dynamics","carbon emission; economic analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; future prospect; growth rate; local economy; sustainability; trend analysis; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088385801

Despite this, little work is being done to eradicate modern slavery from these sectors. Antislavery interventions have often been separate from the work of development providers despite sharing many congruent objectives. Here we outline one sector that could see the integration of antislavery and development interventions to support both at-risk environments and highly vulnerable communities. It is proposed that antislavery interventions are incorporated into the national strategies of the “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation” (REDD+) programme which targets vulnerable communities to prevent deforestation and forest degradation. It is within these communities that vulnerability factors to modern slavery persist and lead to the degradation of forests. It is posited that the incorporation of antislavery interventions with REDD+ would improve efficiencies, target more vulnerable populations, protect the environment and support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By combining these efforts we can combat the effects of the modern slavery-environmental degradation nexus within an ecosystem that has been shown to be vital in the fight against anthropogenic climate change. With the renewal of REDD+ due, now is the time to integrate these measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antislavery Interventions; Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation; Forest Degradation; Modern Slavery-Environmental Degradation Nexus; Tree Loss",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085962657

In this paper, we propose a residential demand response (DR) evaluation model that considers the degradation mechanism of the EV battery and examines the effective battery operation. We adopted the already-proposed NiMnCo battery degradation model to develop an EV DR evaluation model. In this model, the battery operation is optimized to minimize the electricity and degradation costs affected by ambient temperature, battery state of charge (SOC), and depth of discharge. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the relevant parameters on the economics of the DR of EV batteries for 10 all-electric detached houses with photovoltaic system assuming multiple EV driving patterns and battery (dis)charging constraints. The results indicated that the degradation costs are greatly affected by the SOC condition. If a low SOC can be managed with a DR strategy, the total cost can be reduced. This is because the sum of the reduction of purchased cost from the utility and calendar degradation costs are higher than the increase of the cycle degradation cost. In addition, an analysis was conducted considering different driving patterns. The results showed that the cost reduction was highest when a driving pattern was employed in which the mileage was low and the staying at home time was large. When degradation costs are included, the value of optimized charging and discharging operations is more apparent than when degradation costs are not considered. © 2020 by the authors.

A popular example is the series of reference regions used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Adaptation (SREX). The SREX regions were slightly modified for the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and used for reporting subcontinental observed and projected changes over a reduced number (33) of climatologically consistent regions encompassing a representative number of grid boxes. These regions are intended to allow analysis of atmospheric data over broad land or ocean regions and have been used as the basis for several popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the Seasonal Mean Temperature and Precipitation in IPCC Regions for CMIP5 dataset. We present an updated version of the reference regions for the analysis of new observed and simulated datasets (including CMIP6) which offer an opportunity for refinement due to the higher atmospheric model resolution. As a result, the number of land and ocean regions is increased to 46 and 15, respectively, better representing consistent regional climate features. The paper describes the rationale for the definition of the new regions and analyses their homogeneity. The regions are defined as polygons and are provided as coordinates and a shapefile together with companion R and Python notebooks to illustrate their use in practical problems (e.g. calculating regional averages).We also describe the generation of a new dataset with monthly temperature and precipitation, spatially aggregated in the new regions, currently for CMIP5 and CMIP6, to be extended to other datasets in the future (including observations). The use of these reference regions, dataset and code is illustrated through a worked example using scatter plots to offer guidance on the likely range of future climate change at the scale of the reference regions.

PM is strongly correlated with the severe air pollution that can lead to several health problems and early mortality. Other than continuous concentration monitoring, a good understanding of chemical characteristics and sources of PM is important for effective management and mitigation of air pollution. The aim of this study was to summarize the spatial distribution of the PM (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration level, chemical characteristics, and sources apportionment in several cities in Indonesia based on systematic Scopus and Google searches for the period of publication year between 2008 to 2019. The studies of 10 cities showed most of the cities' PM2.5 and PM10 average concentration have exceeded the annual average standard of both Indonesian regulation and WHO standards. Generally, traffic emissions were the majority sources, followed by biomass burning and dust emission. Forest and peat fires did contribute to high biomass burning emission in the downwind cities. The findings help to give the image of the status and the nature of particulate air pollution problems in Indonesia.

Due to its special physicochemical properties, TiO2 photocatalysts have been commonly used as a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen production. However, its wide bandgap energy, which can be only activated under UV-light and fast charge carriers recombination restricts their photocatalytic applications. Nevertheless, several approaches have been proposed to reduce its bandgap energy for visible light activity. Among them, the doping TiO2 with a dopant can be regarded as an effective method not only to cause a shift of the light absorption toward the visible region but also to diminish the charge recombination. This review concentrated on the influence of different types of dopants on the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Furthermore, the methods of synthesis and the characterization techniques used for doped-TiO2 were carefully checked. Importantly, this review examined that the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the doped-TiO2 depends heavily on the type and concentration of the dopants. Furthermore, a metal-like Cu, noble metals like Au and Pt are the most widely studied dopants for TiO2 due to their superior work function. In addition, nitrogen was also widely used as a nonmetal owing to its ability to reduce the bandgap energy of TiO2. The findings also showed that the sol-gel method is still widely used in the preparation of doped-TiO2 photocatalysts due to the high crystallinity and surface area of the obtained nanoparticles. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Hydrogen production; Photocatalysis; Solar energy; TiO2-doped photocatalysts","Carrier mobility; Crystallinity; Energy conversion; Energy gap; Hydrogen fuels; Light; Light absorption; Nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Photocatalytic activity; Physicochemical properties; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Solar energy; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Characterization techniques; Charge recombinations; Methods of synthesis; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic hydrogen production; Photocatalytic water splitting; Solar light irradiation; Visible-light activity; Hydrogen production; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; catalysis; catalyst; hydrogen; nanoparticle; performance assessment; physicochemical property; solar power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092271572

In addition to testing the EKC speculation, the authors also would like to understand the ways in which increases in renewable energy consumption and the international tourism receipt affect the CO2 emissions in G7 countries, because the energy and tourism sectors may have considerable direct impacts on CO2 emissions. In this investigation, a panel bootstrap cointegration test and an augmented mean group (AMG) estimator were applied. The empirical findings indicate that the tourism-induced EKC hypothesis is valid only for France. Additionally, it was detected that a rise in renewable energy consumption has a negative (reduction) impact on CO2 emissions in France, Italy, the UK, and the US. However, an increase in the receipt of international touristm has a positive (additional) impact on Italy’s CO2 emissions. Hence, this country’s decision-makers should re-review their tourism policy to adopt a renewable-inclusive one for sustainable tourism and the environment. © 2020 by the authors.

The GYGA project is unique in employing its original Climate Zonation Scheme (CZS) composed of three indexed factors, i.e. Growing Degree Days (GDD) related to temperature, Aridity Index (AI) related to available water and Temperature Seasonality (TS) related to annual temperature range, creating 300 Climate Zones (CZs) theoretically across the globe. In the present study, the GYGA CZs were identified for Japan on a municipality basis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on irrigated rice yield data sets, equating to actual yields (Ya) in the GYGA context, from long-term government statistics. The ANOVA was conducted for the data sets over two decades between 1994 and 2016 by assigning the GDD score of 6 levels and the TS score of 2 levels as fixed factors. Significant interactions with respect to Ya were observed between GDD score and TS score for 13 years out of 21 years implying the existence of favourable combinations of the GDD score and the TS score for rice cultivation. The implication was also supported by the observation with Yg. The lower values of coefficient of variance obtained from the CZs characterized by medium GDD scores indicated the stability over time of rice yields in these areas. These findings suggest a possibility that the GYGA-CZS can be recognized as a tool suitable to identify favourable CZs for growing crops. &copy; 2021 The Author(s). © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

However, studies related to the knowledge of future sustainability of this resource and its usage are limited. In this paper, projected future rainfall data for two distinct future set of periods (2020–39 and 2080–99) are used to calculate future water savings potentials using an earlier developed daily water balance model for five different regions in Sydney, the largest city in Australia. The rainfall data is collected from four different projection tools provided by the Australian government's climate data portal. With the assumptions of average household water demand as 400 L/day, a tank size of 5000 L and a roof catchment area of 200 m2, water savings and reliabilities of water availability are calculated for future scenarios for five different locations within a broader region of Sydney. Water savings and reliabilities are then compared with the same for current average rainfall condition based on historical data for the same locations. It is found that for most of the studied cases, both in the near (2020–39) and distant (2080–99) future, water savings as well as reliabilities are expected to be decreased compared to the current average scenario. However, in the distant future, both water savings and reliabilities are expected to be increased compared to the near future scenario. Also, it is predicted that spatial variability of water savings within the selected region will increase compared to the current scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Rainwater harvesting; Reliability; Spatial variability; Water savings","Catchments; Rain; Reliability; Tanks (containers); Alternative water sources; Daily water balances; Historical data; Potential impacts; Rain water harvesting; Rainfall condition; Spatial variability; Water availability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088502948

The average CF (kg CO2-eq/kg of ECM) was 0.84, being the highest in MED (0.98), intermediate in CEN (0.84), and the lowest in CAN (0.67). Two extreme farms were selected for further simulations: one with the highest non-enteric methane (MED1), and another with the highest enteric methane (CAN2). Changes in management scenarios (increase milk production, change manure collection systems, change manure-type storage method, change bedding type and installation of an anaerobic digester) in MED1 were evaluated with the IFSM model. Changes in feeding strategies (reduce the forage: concentrate ratio, improve forage quality, use of ionophores) in CAN2 were evaluated with the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System model.

The •OH scavenging factor represents the •OH scavenging rate of the background substances in the water matrix, and it is known to be one of the key parameters to predict the performance of the UV/H2O2 process. The •OH scavenging factor has been determined experimentally by using a probe compound such as pCBA and rhodamine B. The experimental method has been validated to accurately predict the micropollutants removal in the UV/H2O2 process, but there is a need for an easier and simple method of determining the OH scavenging factor. We evaluated the alternative method to analyze the •OH scavenging factor using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis (F-EEM/PARAFAC). The correlation between •OH scavenging factor and the spectroscopic characteristics and structure of different organic matter types was evaluated. Organic matter was characterized using a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix, parallel factor analysis, and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection. Second-order reaction rates of humic acid sodium salt, sodium alginate, Suwannee River humic acid and bovine serum albumin were calculated as 1.30 × 108 M−1 s−1, 1.39 × 108 M−1 s−1, 1.03 × 108 M−1 s−1, and 3.17 × 107 M−1 s−1, respectively.

This study aimed to establish the asphalt binder performance of Yemen so that the asphalt pavement can be designed to resist the distresses of rutting and cracking that occurred due to seasonal temperature changes and rainfall. The first step of determining the binder performance is to establish high and low temperatures, as well as rainfall because the asphalt binder is a temperature and rainfall sensitive viscoelastic material. To study the climatic zoning of asphalt pavement in Yemen, the data of temperature and rainfall in 19 provinces of Yemen in the past 10 years were collected and comprehensively analyzed, and the variations laws of them were analyzed. According to the Chinese approach, the climatic zoning of Yemen's asphalt pavement was divided. The moisture temperature coefficient was introduced, and its probability distribution state was also analyzed. The standard of the moisture temperature coefficient was suggested and the asphalt pavement climate zones based on the moisture temperature coefficient were determined. The results indicated that the main influencing factors of asphalt pavement in Yemen were the temperature rise and rainfall, and the climate zones of asphalt pavement were divided into different zones such as 1-2-1, 2-2-2, 1-2-2, and 3-1-2. According to the principle of equal probability, the moisture temperature coefficient was found to be 18, and the asphalt pavement climate zoning map was drawn. The findings of this study are highly significant and provide valuable decision support for pavement management and improve the transportation system. © 2020 by the authors.","Asphalt Pavement; Climate Division; Moisture Temperature Coefficient; Road Engineering; Yemen",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099470491

In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25◦ × 0.25◦) over a longer time domain (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain &gt; 50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon-climate system. © Author(s) 2020.

The study was conducted in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were made between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration [PNC] and black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Our results show that depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60–68% and 22–46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic conditions, and corresponding reductions in total on-road concentrations were 45-69% and 22-56%, respectively. A higher BC: PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period likely indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehicles in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. These results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales. Our results are useful for exposure analysis as well as city and regional planners evaluating mitigation strategies for traffic-related air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; COVID-19; Lockdown; Particle number concentration (PNC); Traffic-related air pollution; Ultrafine particles","Air quality; Automotive industry; Carbon; Fleet operations; Highway engineering; Plant shutdowns; Roads and streets; Air pollutant concentrations; Concentration ratio; Mitigation strategy; Monitoring network; Residential neighborhoods; Traffic-related air pollution; Ultrafine particle number; Vehicular emission; Drops; black carbon; carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); COVID-19; epidemic; neighborhood; reduction; traffic emission; viral disease; air pollutant; air quality; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; exhaust gas; highway; pandemic; particle size; pollution monitoring; priority journal; traffic pollution; United States; urban area; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; particulate matter; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Carbon; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088865138

To address the problem of fluorescence emission during the process of the ligand transformation of colloidal cluster CdSe QDs from nonpolar organic solvents to polar inorganic aqueous solutions, the surface ligand exchange with mercapto acetic acid (MAA) was proposed. It was attributed to the Cd-O bond breaking and the Cd-S bond formation. The intensity and wavelength of fluorescence emission spectra could be adjusted by controlling the concentration of MAA. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and UV-Vis absorption spectra of colloidal cluster CdSe QDs indicated that the electronic properties of the interface varied with the exchange of the surface ligands. Moreover, the band-edge emission quenching occurred and the maximum redshift of the PL spectrum could reach 28 nm. The enhancement of the deep trap emission peaks of CdSe QDs appeared in 600-900 nm region, and the maximum blue shift of the defect peak in PL spectrum could reach 80 nm with the increase concentration of MAA. The absorption spectra and PL spectra on the surface of porous alumina thin film were used to further analyze the charge separation and capture of charge carriers.

In order to estimate future climate change of Ganjiang river basin and explore its impact on runoff, the changes of precipitation and temperature under the three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were analyzed and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was established to simulate the corresponding runoff in the Basin. The statistical relationship between the factors and the predictor in the Ganjiang river basin was built based on Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). For three scenarios, the precipitation showed slight increase trends under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, but a significant increase under RCP8.5; and generally decreased from July to October while increased from January to April. The temperature exhibited a rising trend under three scenarios, of which the rank was RCP8.5>RCP4.5>RCP2.6. The runoff had an increasing trend and the rank for the three scenarios was RCP8.5>RCP4.5>RCP2.6. Generally, runoff had a strong positive correlation with precipitation while a weak correlation with temperature.

The performance of the swirl combustor with a rectangular microchannel embedded inside its walls are experimentally investigated for the coolant Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 600. Furthermore, an analytical model of the interactions between microchannel cooling heat transfer and the combustion is established. The corresponding Reynolds average numerical simulation is performed and the realisable k-epsilon turbulence mode where the eddy-dissipation concept is adopted for the turbulence chemistry interactions with a 14-species 19-step methane/air reaction mechanism. The results show that the heat exchange capacity of the microchannel coolant, flame temperature, and NOX distributions are all piecewise functions of the coolant Reynolds number that flows through the microchannels. The wall temperature can quickly decrease by 55% at low Reynolds numbers while the outlet flame temperature decreases gently. The combustion reaction regions determined by the CH* chemiluminescence images and gained from the simulation maintain a V-shape under the same equivalent ratio regardless of the inlet Reynolds number, indicating the microchannel cooling has little effect on the main combustion zone. The experiments show the NOx emissions have fallen by more than 35% while the combustion efficiencies are maintained above 98%.

However, the site occupation and associated spectral assignment of dopant Eu2+, and hence the mechanism behind the site-regulated emission tuning, still remain elusive. Herein, we perform a systematic first-principles study on Eu2+-doped Ca3(PO4)2, Ca10M(PO4)7 (M = Li, Na, K), and Ca3(PO4)2:Mg by combining density functional theory and multiconfigurational ab initio calculations. The results show that, among the isovalent EuCa substitutions in Ca3(PO4)2, the occurrence probability correlates positively with the size of the substituted site, which is, nevertheless, weakened by the incorporation of codopant Mg2+ ions. In the presence of aliovalent EuM substitutions as in Ca10M(PO4)7, the site-size-controlled preference is neutralized by the requirement for charge compensation, and the effect becomes more pronounced with an increase of the M+ ionic size. On this basis, the emission spectra of the phosphors are interpreted with respect to the substituted sites and the mechanism behind the composition dependence of the emission color is consistently elucidated, as is also verified by a comparison between the calculated 4f → 5d transition energies and experimental excitation spectra. Our results provide a new perspective on the site preference of Eu2+ in β-Ca3(PO4)2-type compounds and may also serve as a theoretical guideline on the structure-property relationship for the design of other Eu2+-activated phosphors. © 2020 ACS.

This paper proposes a bi-level multi-objective model for carbon emission quota allocation towards co-combustion of coal and sewage sludge under an uncertain environment. It considers the interactions between the authority and the coal-fired power plants in a leader-follower decision process, and seeks the trade-off among economic development, environmental protection and renewable energy utilization. Besides, fuzzy theory has been employed as an uncertainty modeling technique to characterize the vague and inaccurate decision-making environment. To solve the proposed complicated model, weighted sum method and KKT optimality conditions are applied to convert the model into a single-level single-objective model. A real case from Zhejiang Province, China is given to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization model. Based on the analyses and discussion, this model provides reasonable and practical carbon emission quota allocation strategies for the authority. It is indicated that allocating greater quotas to lower carbon intensity coal-fired power plants could effectively achieve reduction targets.

Nevertheless, increasing advocacy of environmental authoritarianism in the narratives of climate governance questions the need for and legitimacy of public participation. This study uncovers the emerging dynamics of climate participation in Chinese communities through a case of the implementation of solar energy. Our research challenges the general impression of nonparticipation in climate governance in China and argues that participation is taking a less visible form that we call “defensive participation.” Defensive participation occurs when communities mobilize to defend their interests. Just as other forms of public participation, defensive participation can play important roles in improving policy outcomes and accountability.

Technological progress is considered essential for controlling carbon emissions. However, previous literature has analyzed technological progress as a whole, largely ignoring its spatial spillovers. Therefore, our understanding of how technological progress influences carbon emissions is still limited. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the effect of technological progress regarding carbon emissions by introducing a new framework that combines the slacks-based measure of the Malmquist-Luenberger index and the spatial dynamic model. Employing a Chinese provincial panel dataset for 2000–2016 as a case study, the conventional analysis indicates that both technological progress and its components have not played a significant role in decreasing carbon emissions. A further analysis using the spatial dynamic model suggests that the technological progress of neighbouring regions plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions. Moreover, the effect of efficiency change is stronger than that of technical change, which provides new evidence on how technological progress influences carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Malmquist-Luenberger index; Slacks-based measure; Spatial dynamic model","carbon emission; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; technological development; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; decomposition; economic development; electricity; energy cost; foreign direct investment; government; industrialization; railway; spatial autocorrelation analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; technology; traffic and transport; China; productivity; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Efficiency; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089268067

However, previous studies examine R&D activities as a whole, and thus do not provide detailed information, such as the carbon intensity reduction of individual actors or stages. In addition, factors that affect regional capacity for absorbing technology (absorptive capacity) are important to influence the role of R&D in carbon intensity, but they have largely been ignored in the literature. In this study, we investigate the impacts of domestic R&D on carbon intensity by classifying R&D into three stages and three actors. The results derived from a Chinese provincial panel dataset from 2000 to 2016 indicate that domestic R&D is effective for improving carbon intensity. R&D at different stages and involving different actors have statistically different impacts on carbon intensity. Further analysis using the panel threshold model provides new evidence that the nexus between carbon intensity and domestic R&D is nonlinear. Technology absorptive capacity, which is denoted by the full-time equivalent of R&D personnel, can alleviate the negative role of R&D in increasing carbon intensity and strengthen the positive effect of R&D on decreasing carbon intensity. According to the empirical evidence, some insightful policy implications for China to decrease the carbon intensity are presented. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon intensity; Panel threshold model; Research and development; Technology absorption","carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data set; emission control; performance assessment; research and development; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic development; energy resource; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; industry; model; priority journal; technology; China; research; China; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089671604

With the development of society, the incidence of stroke has only risen. A large number of research data show that the onset of stroke is inseparable from meteorological changes. 24 solar terms are the product of Chinese civilization. It is a knowledge system created by our ancestors following the agricultural time by observing the movement of celestial bodies and cognizing the changing laws of time, climate, phenology and other aspects of the year. This study explored the relationship between the twenty-four solar terms and their changes and the peak period of stroke incidence in the region, to verify the law of stroke incidence and meteorological changes. Method: Use the stepwise regression method to screen out the most effective climatic factors. Use the circular distribution method to analyze the peak solar terms, calculate the angle of each solar term, and analyze the peak solar terms. Results: There was no absolute peak solar term for stroke onset, with Lichun and Jingzhe as the relative peaks.

Based on the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 2011-2012, approximately 10% of K-12 public school teachers in the United States, received a threat in the past 12 months and 6% reported being physically attacked. The effects of teacher-directed violence are far reaching and affect not just the victimized teacher, but the larger community itself. In the current study, we used multilevel logistic regression models with state fixed effects to analyze the SASS data set. The analytic sample consisted of 24,070 K-12 teachers in 4,610 public schools and specifically excluded special education teachers and teachers in alternative settings (i.e., online schools, special education centers, juvenile correction facilities). Guided by authoritative school climate theory, we tested for the beneficial associations of disciplinary structure and administrative support with the reduced likelihood of a teacher being threatened or physically attacked by a student, while controlling for teacher (e.g., gender, years of experience, race/ethnicity), school (e.g., school size, percent minority enrollment), and state-level factors. Results indicated that teachers who felt supported by the administration and worked with others (i.e., the principal and other teachers) who enforced the rules consistently were less likely to be victims of threats of injury or physical attacks. Although school climate has been shown to have a positive effect on student outcomes, the current study also suggests that school climate, characterized by consistent rule enforcement and supportive administrators and teachers, may play a role in reducing the likelihood of teacher victimization. © The Author(s) 2017.","physical attacks; school climate; Schools and Staffing Survey; teacher victimization; threats","bullying; crime victim; human; perception; school; school teacher; student; Bullying; Crime Victims; Humans; Perception; School Teachers; Schools; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042594870

Therefore, lab-scale anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactors (AnDMBRs) without and with the addition of zero-valent iron (ZVI) (i.e., AnDMBR1 versus AnDMBR2) were developed for preconcentrated domestic wastewater (PDW) treatment, and the impact of ZVI addition on process performance and associated mechanisms were investigated. The stepwise addition of ZVI from 2 to 4 to 6 g/L improved the treatment performance as COD removal slightly increased and TP removal and methane production were enhanced by 53.3%–62.9% and 22.6%–31.3%, respectively, in consecutive operational phases. However, the average increasing rate of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) in AnDMBR2 (0.18 kPa/d) was obviously higher than that in AnDMBR1 (0.05 kPa/d), indicating an unfavorable impact of dosing ZVI on the dynamic membrane (DM) filtration performance. ZVI that has transformed to iron ions (mainly Fe2+) can behave as a coagulant, electron donor or inorganic foulant, thus enabling the excellent removal of dissolved phosphorous, enhancing the enrichment and activities of specific methanogens and causing the formation of a compact DM layer. Morphological, componential, and microbial community analyses provided new insights into the functional mechanisms of ZVI added to membrane-assisted anaerobic digesters, indicating that ZVI has the potential to improve bioenergy production and resource recovery, while optimizing the ZVI dosage should be considered to alleviate membrane fouling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor; Biochemical methane production; Bioenergy recovery; Carbon capture; Preconcentrated wastewater; Zero-valent iron","Anaerobic digestion; Bioreactors; Dynamics; Iron; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Metal ions; Microfiltration; Wastewater treatment; Associated mechanism; Bioenergy productions; Dynamic membrane bioreactors; Filtration performance; Functional mechanisms; Microbial community analysis; Transmembrane pressures; Treatment performance; Chemicals removal (water treatment); iron nanoparticle; iron; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; iron; membrane; performance assessment; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; Article; biodegradation; bioenergy; chemical oxygen demand; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; methanogenesis; microbial community; oxidation reduction potential; pressure; priority journal; pyrosequencing; scanning electron microscopy; waste water management; X ray diffraction; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; sewage; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Iron; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087500937

The dominant species, Stipa glareosa, plays an important role in maintaining the structure and function of plant communities in the desert steppe, Inner Mongolia. However, little is known about how altered precipitation affects biochemical and functional traits of S. glareosa in different communities in the desert steppe. Here, we examined the responses of biochemical and functional traits of S. glareosa in shrub-and grass-dominated communities to experimentally increased precipitation (control, +20%, +40%, and +60%). We found that +40% and +60% increased plant height and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and decreased specific leaf area (SLA) of S. glareosa in grass community. For biochemical traits in grass community, +60% decreased the contents of protein and chlorophyll b (Cb), while +40% increased the relative electrical conductivity and superoxide dismutase. Additionally, +20% increased LDMC and malondialaenyde, and decreased SLA and protein in shrub community. Chlorophyll a, Cb, carotenoids, protein and superoxide dismutase in the grass community differed with shrub community, while +60% caused differences in SLA, LDMC, leaf carbon content, malondialaenyde and peroxidase between two communities. The positive or negative linear patterns were observed between different functional and biochemical traits in grass-rather than shrub-community. Soil water content explained changes in some biochemical traits in the grass community, but not for functional traits. These results suggest that increased precipitation can affect functional traits of S. glareosa in the grass community by altering biochemical traits caused by soil water content. The biochemical and functional traits of S. glareosa were more sensitive to extreme precipitation in grass-than shrub-community in the desert steppe. Our study highlights the important differences in adaptive strategies of S. glareosa in different plant communities at the same site to precipitation changes. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: This was a prospective, parallel, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty patients with stable Group D COPD were randomly allocated to receive either oral QYCs (intervention group) or placebos (control group, 30 cases per group) for 15 days in the presumed high-incidence air pollution season and followed-up for 1 year. Both groups were given individualized Western medicine therapy according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria as usual. Total and separate numbers of acute exacerbation (AE) associated with striking air pollution was the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included total numbers of deteriorating respiratory symptoms and separate numbers associated with striking air pollution, as well as scores of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council Scale (mMRC). Results: All the 60 patients completed the study. There was no statistical significance in total numbers of AE between the two groups (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, a significant reduction in air-pollution associated numbers of deteriorated respiratory symptoms was observed in the intervention group (1.9–1.2 vs. 3.6–2.4, P<0.01). At the end of follow-up, there was no significant difference in CAT and mMRC scores between the two groups (P>0.05). Only 2 patients in the intervention group reported diarrhea and recovered after drug discontinuance. Conclusion: For patients with Group D COPD, oral QYCs in high-incidence season of air pollution can effectively mitigate respiratory symptoms associated with air pollution, although there was no evidence that it had a significant reductive effect on AEs.

There is limited evidence, however, of their impact through transnational climate initiatives and little empirical support linking mitigation strategies and emissions reductions. Here, we show that 60% of more than 1,000 EU Covenant of Mayors’ cities are on track to achieve their 2020 emission reduction targets. Assessments of cities’ mitigation outcomes and the determinants of performance show that on-track cities tend to have less-ambitious targets and higher baseline emissions and are in countries with more-ambitious national climate policies and greater realized emissions reductions than cities that are not on track. Automated textual analysis and a regression model find city emissions reduction is influenced by plan-level, city-level and country-level characteristics. Greater emissions reductions are associated with plans targeting energy efficiency.

In the case of the urban space, roads are responsible for the consumption of 105M tons of bitumen and 115M tons of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the reduction of the environmental impacts of road construction is becoming an urgent necessity. So far the vast majority of the Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to evaluate the environmental burdens of existing roads and new asphalt solutions. However, due to the different LCA methodological choices, recent studies have highlighted the difficulties in comparing the results of cases published in literature. Driven by this knowledge gap, the aim of the present study was to identify key aspects missing in the assessment of urban roads. Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), 47 publications have been selected for further investigation. An intensive analysis of these documents clearly demonstrate the heterogeneity of the applied LCA methodological choices as well as the selected approaches regarding i.e. the goal of the studies, functional unit, system boundary, database and stratigraphy of the road pavement. Aiming to harmonize the LCA methodology, we have identified key aspects that require solutions for a robust LCA application. The results are expected to be useful for the National Road Administration (NRA) in assessing the environmental impacts of future urban road projects. As a response to the Paris climate agreement targets, the application of harmonized methods regarding LCA should lead to a more robust and structured process in terms of identifying low carbon urban road solutions and contributing to the SDGs respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Stratigraphy; Sustainable development; Climate agreement; Environmental burdens; Functional units; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Literature reviews; Low-carbon urban; Structured process; Systematic literature review (SLR); Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097133711

Using an analysis of UK decision-makers managing and responding to heatwaves and flood risks, this paper argues how more robust local evidence is needed to inform decision-making regarding adaptation options for enhancing local resilience. We identify evidence gaps and issues relating to local climate change impacts, including sources and quality of evidence used, adequacy and accessibility of evidence available, ill-communicated evidence and conflicting or misused evidence. A lack of appreciation regarding how scientific evidence and personal judgement can mutually enhance the quality of decision-making underpins all of these gaps. Additionally, we find that the majority of evidence currently used is reductively based upon socio-economic and physical characteristics of climate risks. We argue that a step change is needed in local climate resilience that moves beyond current physical and socio-economic risk characterisation to a more inclusive co-constitution of social and politically defined climate risks at the local scale that are better aligned with the local impacts felt and needs of stakeholders. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate risk; Communication; Evidence; Local governance; Resilience","Decision making; Floods; Risk assessment; Climate change risks; Climate impacts; Decision makers; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local impacts; Physical characteristics; Scientific evidence; Socio-economics; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; governance approach; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; national planning; risk assessment; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089290162

To effectively regulate greenhouse gas emissions, four different regulation modes, namely, biochar addition (BA), straw addition (SA), combined biochar and straw (CBS) and a natural control (BL), were established. The characteristics of soil greenhouse gas emissions under different treatments and their response relationships to soil water, heat, carbon and nitrogen were explored. The results revealed that the SA and CBS treatments effectively inhibited the substantial reduction in soil temperature, moisture content, inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon during the freezing period; among them, the average soil inorganic nitrogen under the SA and CBS treatments increased by 15.36 and 11.62 mg·kg−1 compared to that in the BL treatment, respectively. Simultaneously, both N2O and CO2 emission fluxes were low, and the difference was small under the various treatments. However, the soil showed an absorption trend with respect to CH4, and the BA and CBS treatments promoted this effect; furthermore, the response relationships between CH4 and soil water, heat and carbon were enhanced. During the thawing period, the CBS treatment most effectively promoted the increase in soil water, heat, carbon and nitrogen, while it inhibited the flux of CH4 and N2O in soils, and the average CH4 emission flux under the CBS treatment decreased by 8.25 ~ 30.75 μg∙kg−1 relative to that under the other treatments. Concurrently, the responses of CH4 and N2O emission fluxes to soil water, heat, carbon and nitrogen were weakened under this treatment. Although the CBS treatment increased the CO2 emissions flux during this period, in view of the overall effect of the entire freeze–thaw period, the CBS treatment most effectively reduced the global warming potential (GWP) of the soil. Therefore, it is suggested that the joint application of biochar and straw is the most effective strategy for greenhouse gas budget management and soil nutrient restoration in seasonally frozen areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Freeze-thaw cycle; Greenhouse gas emissions; Regulation mode; Response relationship","agricultural land; biochar; carbon flux; decomposition; emission; freeze-thaw cycle; global warming; greenhouse gas; seasonality; soil organic matter; straw",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085899111

This is mostly due to the large amount of CO2 emission from power generation activity using fossil fuels. One of the main methods of fighting global warming and reducing CO2 emission into atmosphere is to perform carbon capture, sequestration and utilization. Carbon capture can be performed through different ways, in which post combustion CO2 capture (PCC) has been developed and both economic and technically wise is in state of art. One of the disadvantages of PCC is its high efficiency penalty due to energy consumption in the reboiler for solvent regeneration. Many efforts have been done to reduce the consumption of energy in the reboiler via different strategies including process parameters optimization, solvent development and novel process configuration. This investigation used different blends of PZ and MDEA as solvent and process parameters optimization via evolutionary algorithm and multi-objective optimization. The optimization was performed on a conventional process flow diagram. CO2 capture efficiency and reboiler heat duty were used as the objective functions and main decision variables are solvent flowrate and MDEA/PZ concentration.

Among a number of planned coal-fired power plants, five power plants each with 1320-MW generation capacity are expected to be installed by 2030 in areas within 5-km radius of Payra, situated in Patuakhali district, by 2030. This study involved simulation of pollutant concentration and evaluation of health risks due to emission from these power plants. Four pollutants, SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, were assessed for health risks under two scenarios: (a) scenario I, operation of Payra phase I and phase II power plants (expected by 2022); and (b) scenario II, cumulative operation of all 5 power plants. An air dispersion model has been used to investigate the pollutant dispersion and ground-level concentration at receptor grids over a 30 × 30-km model domain for a 1-year period. Hazard quotients (HQ) of the selected pollutants were estimated at 10 sensitive receptors, which revealed that long-term HQ were well below the safe limits; however, short-term NOx exposure might pose serious threat to the residents.

This study developed a bottom-up physics-based approach to calculate heat emissions from buildings to the ambient air and implemented the approach in EnergyPlus. A simple result verification was conducted by comparing the EnergyPlus simulated results against the spreadsheet calculations. Simulations covering 16 commercial building types, four climates, and two energy efficiency levels were conducted to understand and evaluate the building heat emissions and their temporal patterns as well as three major components: (1) building envelope (convective heat transfer to ambient air), (2) zones (air exfiltration and exhaust air), and (3) HVAC systems (relief air and heat rejection from condensers or cooling towers). The main findings are: (1) heat emissions are usually higher than the site energy use (about 2.5 times), and their dynamics should be considered; (2) building characteristics and their energy systems lead to differences in heat emission contributions from the three components, and their dynamics, for example, in the warehouse models, the envelope component accounts for 90.4%, while it is 12.7% for the large office models; (3) for most building typologies, the climate has a strong impact on heat emissions, for example, buildings with dominant heat emissions from the zone exhaust air and/or the HVAC reject heat, a general decrease in heat emissions in hotter climates is observed, while envelope-dominated buildings show the opposite; and (4) building technologies that reduce energy use in buildings may perform differently in reducing heat emissions. The developed heat emissions calculation method can be adopted in EnergyPlus and most other building energy modeling programs. It can provide dynamic building heat emissions as an input to urban climate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available, to improve the simulation accuracy of the urban microclimate and capture the urban heat island effect and urban overheating. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic heat; Building performance simulation; Buildings heat emission; Microclimate; Urban environment; Urban heat island effect","Climate control; Climate models; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat convection; Office buildings; Building characteristics; Building energy model; Building technologies; Convective heat transfer; Energy use in buildings; Result verifications; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Urban Heat Island Effects; HVAC; accuracy assessment; ambient air; building; computational fluid dynamics; energy efficiency; heat island; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088655894

Contamination of land and soil increases and is a serious concern around the Baltic Sea region but further worldwide. The most common remedial technologies for related to the clean-up of soil is excavation, removal and disposal to a contained landfill. Therefore, heavily contaminated soils in landfills, can in some instances, mixing with another disposal of hazardous materials. In the Kalmar, a region of south-eastern Sweden, on the Baltic Sea, the glass waste dumps are removed in such old fashion way with no contribution towards the Circular Economy. The best available remediation strategy is soil washing strategy, an ex-situ technology with a chemical additive application to remove contaminants from the soil and wastewater. Recently, many studies have been carried out encouragingly the phytoremediation processes in different plant species. For instances, food crops, sunflower and Indian mustard are considered as the best plants for phytoremediation, as they have a role in phytoextraction of heavy metals.

Anthropogenic climate change, however, threatens the enduring effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity and providing ecosystem services, because it modifies and redistributes biodiversity with unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning within protected areas. Here, we assess (a) the climate change exposure of the global terrestrial protected area estate and (b) the climate change vulnerability of national protected area estates. Location: Terrestrial protected areas worldwide. Methods: We calculated local climate change exposure as predicted climate anomalies between the present and 2070 using ten global climate models, two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and the finest spatial resolution available for global climate projections (approx. 1 km). We estimated the climate change vulnerability of national protected area estates by analysing countrywide relationships between protected areas’ climate anomalies and other protected area characteristics, that is area, elevation, terrain ruggedness, human footprint and irreplaceability for globally threatened species. Results: We found predicted climate anomalies highest in protected areas of (sub-)tropical countries. The correlations between climate anomalies and protected area characteristics strongly differ between countries. Globally, protected areas showing large climate anomalies tend to be at high elevation and highly irreplaceable for threatened species, increasing climate change vulnerability. These protected areas are relatively large in area, of high topographic heterogeneity and less pressured by humans, decreasing climate change vulnerability. Main conclusion: This study reveals potential hotspots of climate change impact inside the terrestrial protected area estate. It thus supports and guides climate-smart conservation policy and management, particularly national to local authorities, to ensure the future effectiveness of protected areas in preserving biodiversity and ecosystem benefits under climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

Data sets based on numerical atmospheric modeling, such as reanalysis data sets, represent an alternative source of information, but they often suffer from inaccuracies, e.g., due to insufficient spatial resolution. sDoG (statistical Downscaling for Glacierized mountain environments) is a reanalysis data postprocessing tool designed to extend short-term weather station data from high mountain sites to the baseline climate. In this study, sDoG is applied to ERA-Interim predictors to produce a retrospective forecast of daily air temperature at the Vernagtbach climate monitoring site (2640 MSL) in the Central European Alps. First, sDoG is trained and cross-validated using observations from 2002 to 2012 (cross-validation period). Then, the sDoG retrospective forecast and its cross-validation-based uncertainty estimates are evaluated for the period 1979–2001 (hereafter referred to as the true evaluation period). We demonstrate the ability of sDoG to model air temperature in the true evaluation period for different temporal scales: day-to-day variations, year-to-year and season-to-season variations, and the 23-year mean seasonal cycle. sDoG adds significant value over a selection of reference data sets available for the site at different spatial resolutions, including state-of-the-art global and regional reanalysis data sets, output by a regional climate model, and an observation-based gridded product. However, we identify limitations of sDoG in modeling summer air temperature variations particularly evident in the first part of the true evaluation period. This is most probably related to changes of the microclimate around the Vernagtbach climate monitoring site that violate the stationarity assumption underlying sDoG. When comparing the performance of the considered reference data sets, we cannot demonstrate added value of the higher resolution data sets over the data sets with lower spatial resolution. For example, the global reanalyses ERA5 (31 km resolution) and ERA-Interim (80 km resolution) both clearly outperform the higher resolution data sets ERA5-Land (9 km resolution), UERRA HARMONIE (11 km resolution), and UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX (5.5 km resolution). Performance differences among ERA5 and ERA-Interim, by contrast, are comparably small. Our study highlights the importance of station-scale uncertainty assessments of atmospheric numerical model output and downscaling products for high mountain areas both for data users and model developers. © 2020 by the authors.

Hence, a reduced tendency to discount the future should be associated with increased involvement in climate change mitigation. Prior research has demonstrated that episodic future thinking (EFT; i.e., envisioning future events that involve self-projection) can reduce discounting. In two laboratory studies, we showed that engaging in EFT about mitigation action was associated with a lower discounting tendency toward future environmental gains (Experiments 1 and 2) and a greater tendency to act pro-environmentally, as manifested by using air conditioning in an energy-saving manner (Experiment 1), choosing a meal with less environmental impact (Experiment 2), and willingness to participate in beach cleaning (Experiment 2).

In Swedish cities, fluvial and pluvial floods risk being aggravated, necessitating adaptation efforts to make the build environment more resilient. A recent governmental inquiry states that owners are primarily responsible for adapting their property, and that the existing built environment is particularly tricky. Property owners often lack tools and approaches to strategically adapt to climate risks. This paper presents and tests a structured approach intended for large property owners to assess and visualize flood vulnerability in both individual buildings and the property portfolio, and organizational adaptive responses. The approach was developed and tested using the municipal housing company Hyresbostäder in Norrköping, Sweden as case. The study builds on workshops with staff, a systematic flood vulnerability mapping of 575 buildings, and in-situ inspections of the 85 most vulnerable buildings. The vulnerability and need for adaptation of individual buildings were visualized on a map, and adaptive avenues were identified. The approach was found useful for identifying the most vulnerable buildings, concrete adaptation measures and five broad adaptation avenues: risk-focused adaptation investments, area-focused adaptation, regular inspection and maintenance, informed collaboration and tenant dialogues. The property owner's transformative capacity was improved by creating a shared vision, empowerment and learning, innovation capacity, gaining overview supporting transformative leadership and external cooperation likely to contribute to meeting SDGs 13 and 11. In further studies the approach will be tested by other large property owners under limited research support. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Climate change; Floods; Risk assessment; Adaptive response; Built environment; Climate vulnerability; Flood vulnerabilities; Innovation capacity; Regular inspections; Research support; Structured approach; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097150610

Finland already has an extensive district heating grid and large amounts of combined heat and power generation. However, despite the average climate, there is little use for excess heat in summer. Waste incineration plants need to be running regardless of weather, so long-term storage of heat requires consideration. However, no seasonal energy storage systems are currently in operation in connection with Finnish waste incineration plants. This study used dynamic energy simulation performed with the TRNSYS 17 software to analyze the case of utilizing excess heat from waste incineration to supplement conventional district heating of a new residential area. Seasonal energy storage was utilized through a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system. Parametric runs using 36 different storage configurations were performed to find out the cost and performance range of such plans. Annual energy storage efficiencies from 48% to 69% were obtained for the BTES. Waste heat could generate 37–89% of the annual heat demand. Cost estimations of waste heat storage using BTES are not available in the literature. As an important finding in this study, a levelized cost of heat of 10.5–23.5 €/MWh was obtained for various BTES configurations used for incineration waste heat storage. In the three most effective cases, the stored heat reduced annual CO2 emissions of the residential area by 42%, 64% and 86%. Thus, the solution shows great potential for reducing carbon emissions of district heating in grids connected to waste incineration plants. © 2020 by the authors.

Based on 18 comparisons across four continents, we found that substituting conventional building materials for mass timber reduces construction phase emissions by 69%, an average reduction of 216 kgCO2e/m2 of floor area. Studies included in our analysis were unanimous in showing emissions reductions when building with mass timber compared to conventional materials. Scaling-up low-carbon construction, assuming mass timber is substituted for conventional building materials in half of expected new urban construction, could provide as much as 9% of global emissions reduction needed to meet 2030 targets for keeping global warming below 1.5 ​°C. Realizing the climate mitigation potential of mass timber building could be accelerated by policy and private investment. Policy actions such as changing building codes, including mass timber in carbon offset crediting programs and setting building-sector-specific emissions reduction goals will remove barriers to and incentivize the adoption of mass timber. Private capital, as debt or equity investment, is poised to play a crucial role in financing mass timber building. © 2020 The Author(s)","Carbon; CLT; Cross laminated timber; Global warming; LCA; Mass timber","Building codes; Building materials; Carbon; Emission control; Global warming; Life cycle; Timber; Wooden buildings; Climate mitigations; Construction phase; Conventional materials; Emissions reduction; Life cycle analysis; Low carbon constructions; Private investment; Urban construction; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104589661

Among other countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, Jordan is facing a number of electricity related challenges, such as a rising energy demand, high dependency on fossil fuel imports and management of local, fossil and renewable resources. The paper presents an analysis based on an open source optimisation modelling approach identifying a cost-optimal extension of the Jordanian electricity system with growing demand projections until 2030 utilising pumped hydro energy storage and determining the costs of different CO2 mitigation pathways. The results highlight the large potential of renewable energy for the cost effective, environmentally friendly and energy independent development of the Jordanian electricity sector. A share of up to 50% renewable energy can be achieved with only a minor increase in levelised cost of electricity from 54.42 to 57.04 $/MWh. In particular, a combination of photovoltaic and pumped hydro storage proved to be a superior solution compared to the expansion of existing shale oil deployments due to high costs and CO2 emissions. Aiming for a more than 50% renewable energy share within the electricity mix calls for substantial wind energy deployments. In a system with a renewable energy share of 90%, wind energy covers 45% of the demand. © 2020 by the authors.

N2O emission is determined by rate and timing of the N2O producing and reducing steps which are sensitive to a series of proximal and distal regulators such as pH and microbial community composition. Microbial community associations to N2O emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)) are commonly entangled with pH leaving the true role of community composition unclear. Here, we leverage a set of soil microbiomes strongly linked to rainfall above pH to test the hypothesis that microbiome vs. N2O emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)) correlations will be maintained across alternative distal drivers. N2O emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)) and denitrification gas (NO, N2O, N2) kinetics were assessed by automated gas chromatography while community composition was assessed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR of nosZI and II genes. Analyses revealed a sustained correlation between microbiome and N2O emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)) in the absence of a pH effect. Further, a continuum of gas accumulation phenotypes linked to NO accumulation and sensitive to carbon addition are identified. Separate phenotypes carried out N2O production and reduction steps more concurrently or sequentially and thus determined N2O accumulation and emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)). Concurrent N2O producing/reducing soils typically contained NO accumulation to a low steady state, while carbon addition manipulations which increased NO accumulation also increased sequentiality of N2O production/reduction and thus emission potential (N2O/(N2O + N2)). These features may indicate a conserved NO inhibitory mechanism across multiple effectors (rainfall, community composition, carbon availability). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon availability; Denitrification phenotype; Microbiome; N2O emission Potential; nosZ; Rainfall","Carbon; Denitrification; Gas chromatography; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Inert gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; pH effects; Polymerase chain reaction; Rain; Reduction; RNA; Soils; Carbon addition; Carbon availability; Community composition; Emission potential; Gas accumulation; Inhibitory mechanism; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Soil pollution; community composition; denitrification; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; nitrous oxide; phenotype; rainfall; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091329095

Thus, many countries across the world including Canada have agreed for national level emission reduction targets. A significant fraction of the anthropogenic CO2 is emitted from fossil fuel-based energy generation. Carbon-dioxide capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) technologies are currently the sole means of capturing CO2 emissions generated by such energy systems. However, only a limited amount of research has been done on CCSU integration in community energy systems. This review aims at exploring the prospects of CCSU integration in community energy systems to achieve zero-emission communities. A systematic literature review was conducted to critically analyze the feasibility of community level carbon capturing. A particular focus was given to the techno-economic aspects of carbon capture integration in community energy systems. The drivers and barriers to CCSU implementation in Canadian communities were discussed under techno-economic, socio-political, legal, and environmental themes in the form of a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. Recommendations for overcoming the above barriers were provided from the findings of the review. Finally, a road map aimed towards assessing the suitability of CCSU integration in Canadian communities was defined. The knowledge compiled through this study will aid investors and decision-makers to make informed decisions when planning zero-emission communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","And utilization; Carbon capture; Climate change mitigation; Emissions capturing; Greenhouse gas emissions; Storage; SWOT analysis; Zero-emission communities","Air pollution; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Integration; Petroleum prospecting; Carbon dioxide capture; Community energy; Emission reduction targets; Energy generations; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Informed decision; Systematic literature review; Techno-economics; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089808992

The research college EnEff.Buildings.2050 is a collaboration of five PhD students and their supervisors to support this goal. In this paper, five key action fields for transformation of urban districts are described, and decisive stakeholders are identified and linked to the action fields. As a case study, the urban district Mierendorff-Island in Berlin is introduced. Three strategies to support transformation are identified: Firstly, new digital planning tools should be applied to assess and improve the energetic performance of new and existing buildings and to illustrate it to decision makers. Secondly, digital processes should be combined throughout the lifecycle of a building by building information modeling (BIM). This can ensure the energetic quality and enable cost-effective construction, servicing and monitoring. Thirdly, start-ups and contractors need support for development of new business models and technical solutions, which can e.g. enable disruptive technologies. Awareness of stakeholders on the transformational state of a district enables them to identify windows of opportunity to spring into action.

Documenting the benefits can help drive more ambitious and health-protective climate change mitigation actions; however, documenting the adverse health effects can help to avoid them. Estimating the health effects of mitigation (HEM) actions can help policy makers prioritize investments based not only on mitigation potential but also on expected health benefits. To date, however, the wide range of incompatible approaches taken to developing and reporting HEM estimates has limited their comparability and usefulness to policymakers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort was to generate guidance for modeling studies on scoping, estimating, and reporting population health effects from climate change mitigation actions. METHODS: An expert panel of HEM researchers was recruited to participate in developing guidance for conducting HEM studies. The primary literature and a synthesis of HEM studies were provided to the panel. Panel members then participated in a modified Delphi exercise to identify areas of consensus regarding HEM estimation. Finally, the panel met to review and discuss consensus findings, resolve remaining differences, and generate guidance regarding conducting HEM studies. RESULTS: The panel generated a checklist of recommendations regarding stakeholder engagement: HEM modeling, including model structure, scope and scale, demographics, time horizons, counterfactuals, health response functions, and metrics; parameterization and reporting; approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; accounting for policy uptake; and discounting. DISCUSSION: This checklist provides guidance for conducting and reporting HEM estimates to make them more comparable and useful for policymakers. Harmonization of HEM estimates has the potential to lead to advances in and improved synthesis of policy-relevant research that can inform evidence-based decision making and practice. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6745. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Previous studies of individual free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experimental sites have shown significant impacts of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on soil microbial communities; however, no common microbial response patterns have yet emerged, challenging our ability to predict ecosystem functioning and sustainability in the future eCO2 environment. Here we analyzed 66 soil microbial communities from five FACE sites, and showed common microbial response patterns to eCO2, especially for key functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen fixation (e.g., pcc/acc for carbon fixation, nifH for nitrogen fixation), carbon decomposition (e.g., amyA and pulA for labile carbon decomposition, mnp and lcc for recalcitrant carbon decomposition), and greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., mcrA for methane production, norB for nitrous oxide production) across five FACE sites. Also, the relative abundance of those key genes was generally increased and directionally associated with increased biomass, soil carbon decomposition, and soil moisture. In addition, a further literature survey of more disparate FACE experimental sites indicated increased biomass, soil carbon decay, nitrogen fixation, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, plant and soil carbon and nitrogen under eCO2. A conceptual framework was developed to link commonly responsive functional genes with ecosystem processes, such as pcc/acc vs. soil carbon storage, amyA/pulA/mnp/lcc vs. soil carbon decomposition, and nifH vs. nitrogen availability, suggesting that such common responses of microbial functional genes may have the potential to predict ecosystem functioning and sustainability in the future eCO2 environment. © 2020 The Author(s)","Common/specific response; Elevated carbon dioxide; Functional gene; Global change; Soil microbial community","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic activity; Carbon decomposition; Conceptual frameworks; Ecosystem functioning; Nitrogen availability; Nitrous oxide emissions; Nitrous oxide production; Soil microbial community; Nitrogen fixation; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; conceptual framework; decomposition analysis; experimental study; functional group; global change; microbial community; soil biota; acc gene; amyA gene; Article; biomass; carbon fixation; carbon footprint; conceptual framework; decomposition; environmental sustainability; genetic association; lcc gene; mcrA gene; microbial genetics; mnp gene; nifH gene; nitrogen fixation; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; norB gene; pcc gene; prediction; priority journal; pulA gene; soil microflora; soil moisture; ecosystem; microbiology; soil; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090595861

Chemically functionalized (hydroxylation and carboxylation) CNTs were prepared by oxidizing original CNTs in H2SO4 solutions of different temperatures and concentrations by KMnO4. Graphitized CNTs were prepared by heat-treating original CNTs in an inert gas at 2800°C for 20 hours. CNTs Nickel plating on the surface was obtained by electroless plating. The effect of pretreatment on the surface state and microstructure of carbon nanotubes was also studied. The results showed that Chemical functionalization could form some functional groups on the surface of CNTs, which could not only improve the compatibility of CNTs with some solvents, but also purified CNTs, which had a positive effect on the preparation of composite materials. High-temperature graphitization treatment could significantly increase the degree of crystallization of carbon nanotubes and reduce structural defects. After electroless nickel plating, evenly distributed nano-sized metal particles were formed on the surface of the CNTs, and the interface between the two was well bonded. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Automation; Carboxylation; Electroless plating; Graphitization; Inert gases; Manganese compounds; Microstructure; Nanotubes; Nickel plating; Potash; Process control; Chemical functionalization; Degree of crystallization; Electroless nickel plating; Functionalized; High temperature; Metal particle; Pre-Treatment; Structural defect; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096619556

In a three-week-long field campaign in urban Shanghai, we deployed a commercial Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph system (TAG) that integrates sampling, in-situ derivatization, and thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis, producing hourly measurement of polar organics including a set of biogenic and anthropogenic SOA tracers. The abundance and variations of these SOA tracers were examined in relation to five PM2.5 episodes, varying from 4 to 64 h in duration, during the field campaign from 9 November to 3 December 2018. The episodes were associated with stagnant air parcels. In comparison with the non-episodic hours, the episodic hours showed distinct chemical characteristics of a large mass increment of nitrate (an average of 4.7 fold) and secondary organic compounds (~3–6.4 fold), exceeding those of primary pollutants (1.6–1.9 fold). These results clearly indicate the significant contributions of secondary inorganic and organic production processes to forming PM2.5 episodes. The SOA concentration estimated by the set of TAG-measured SOA tracers reached an average concentration of 2.6 μg/m3, accounting for a significant portion of OA in view of that the total organic matter (OM) in PM1 measured by an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer was 7.9 μg/m3. Among them the SOA attributed to monoaromatic compounds (e.g., toluene) accounted for a noticeable portion of the total OM, implying that control strategies targeting local anthropogenic emissions would be effective in reducing the severity of episodic PM pollution. Examining the ratio of two monoterpene-derived SOA products, we found evidence of less-aged SOA in urban Shanghai, and this result was collaborated by the O/C value (0.4) of bulk OA. This work demonstrates hourly SOA tracer measurements by TAG are uniquely specific on identification of major SOA precursors for episodic events and observing the evolution of SOA. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Episodes in urban Shanghai; Online organic compound speciation; SOA formation; Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph (TAG)","Aerosols; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Monoterpenes; Pollution control; Thermal desorption; Tracers; Aerosol mass spectrometers; Anthropogenic emissions; Chemical characteristic; Gas chromatograph systems; In-situ derivatization; Mass spectrometric analysis; Polar organic compounds; Secondary organic aerosols; Particles (particulate matter); antimony; arsenic acid; barium; bismuth; bromine; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; gallium; germanium; gold; indium; lead; manganese; mercury; molecular marker; molybdenum; nickel; nitrate; organic compound; palladium; phosphorus; platinum; scandium; selenium; silver; strontium; tin; vanadium; zinc; aerosol composition; anthropogenic source; aromatic hydrocarbon; biogenic material; chemical composition; molecular analysis; organic compound; particle size; particulate matter; pollution incidence; tracer; urban area; Article; biomass; China; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); controlled study; decarboxylation; decomposition; derivatization; desorption; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; measurement; particulate matter; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; time; time series analysis; wind speed; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089527996

However, how biochar, inhibitors and the combination of biochar and inhibitors affect CH4 emissions remains unclear in paddy soils. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of biochar application alone, and in combination with urease (hydroquinone) and nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide) on CH4 emissions and yield-scaled CH4 emissions during three rice growing seasons in the Taihu Lake region (Suzhou and Jurong), China. In Suzhou, N fertilization rates of 120–280 kg N ha−1 increased CH4 emissions compared to no N fertilization (Control) (P &lt; 0.05), and the highest emission was observed at 240 kg N ha−1, possibly due to the increase in rice-derived organic carbon (C) substrates for methanogens. Biochar amendment combined with N fertilization reduced CH4 emissions by 13.2–27.1% compared with optimal N (ON, Suzhou) and conventional N application (CN-J, Jurong) (P &lt; 0.05). This was related to the reduction in soil dissolved organic C and the increase in soil redox potential. Addition of urease and nitrification inhibitor (ONI) decreased CH4 emissions by 15.7% compared with ON treatment. Combined application of biochar plus urease, nitrification and double inhibitors further decreased CH4 emissions by 22.2–51.0% compared with ON and CN-J treatment. ON resulted in the highest yield-scaled CH4 emissions, while combined application of biochar alone and in combination with the inhibitors decreased yield-scaled CH4 emissions by 12.7–54.9% compared with ON and CN-J treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The lowest yield-scaled CH4 emissions were observed under combined application of 7.5 t ha−1 biochar with both urease and nitrification inhibitors. These findings suggest that combined application of biochar and inhibitors could mitigate total CH4 and yield-scaled CH4 emissions in paddy fields in this region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; CH4 emission; Dicyandiamide; Hydroquinone; Nitrogen fertilizer; Yield-scaled CH4 emissions","Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Redox reactions; Soils; Biochar amendments; Dicyandiamide; Dissolved organic C; Growing season; N fertilization; Nitrification inhibitor; Soil redox potential; Synergistic effect; Gas emissions; amide; biochar; charcoal; dicyandiamide; hydroquinone; methane; nitrogen fertilizer; organic carbon; unclassified drug; urease; biochar; charcoal; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; urease; biochar; enzyme; inhibitor; methane; nitrification; paddy field; soil amendment; soil emission; agricultural land; Article; biomass; bulk density; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; harvest; methanogenic archaeon; methanotrophic bacterium; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; particle size; priority journal; rice; soil acidity; soil amendment; soil fertilization; soil pollution; agriculture; nitrification; Oryza; soil; China; Jiangsu; Suzhou; Taihu Lake; Agriculture; Charcoal; China; Fertilizers; Methane; Nitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil; Urease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087487371

As demand side changes are called for reducing car use, the fast-growing sharing economy shows great potential to shift travel demand away from single-occupancy vehicles. Although previous inter-disciplinary research on shared mobility has explored its multitudes of benefits, it is yet to be investigated how the uptake of this eco-friendly sharing scheme is affected by gasoline prices. In this study, we examine the impact of gasoline prices on the use of bikeshare programs in three U.S. metropolises: New York City, Boston, and Chicago. Using bikeshare trip data, we estimate the impact of citywide gasoline prices on both bikeshare trip duration and trip frequency in a generalized linear regression setting. The results suggest that gasoline prices significantly affect bikeshare trip frequency and duration, with a noticeable surge in short trips. Doubling gasoline prices could help save an average of 1933 gallons of gasoline per day in the three cities, approximately 0.04% of the U.S. daily per capita gasoline consumption. Our findings indicate that fuel pricing could be an effective policy tool to support technology driven eco-friendly sharing mobility and boost sustainable transportation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Understanding the sources of pollutants is crucial to the prevention of air pollution. Using numerical simulation method, this study analysed the contributions of the total local emissions and local emissions from different sectors (such as industrial, traffic, resident, agricultural, and power plant emissions) to PM2.5 concentration, backward trajectory, and potential source regions in Tangshan, a typical heavy industrial city in north China. The impact of multi-scale meteorological conditions on source apportionment was investigated. From October 2016 to March 2017, total local emissions accounted for 46.0% of the near-surface PM2.5 concentration. In terms of emissions from different sectors, local industrial emissions which accounted for 23.1% of the near-surface PM2.5 concentration in Tangshan, were the most important pollutant source. Agricultural emissions were the second most important source, accounting for 10.3% of the near-surface PM2.5 concentration. The contributions of emissions from power plants, traffic, residential sources were 2.0%, 3.0%, and 7.2%, respectively. The contributions of total local emissions and emissions from different sectors depended on multi-scale meteorological conditions, and static weather significantly enhanced the contribution of regional transport to the near-surface PM2.5 concentration. Eight cluster backward trajectories were identified for Tangshan. The PM2.5 concentration for the 8 cluster trajectories significantly differed. The near-surface PM2.5 in urban Tangshan (receptor point) was mainly from the local emissions, and another important potential source region was Tianjin. The results of the source apportionment suggested the importance of joint prevention and control of air pollution in some areas where cities or industrial regions are densely distributed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","FLEXPART; Potential source region; Source apportionment; WRF-Chem","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Industrial emissions; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Particles (particulate matter); Power plants; Trajectories; Agricultural emissions; Backward trajectory; Meteorological condition; Numerical simulation method; Potential source regions; Power-plant emissions; Prevention and controls; Source apportionment; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; concentration (composition); emission inventory; industrial emission; numerical model; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; pollution monitoring; source apportionment; urban pollution; article; China; computer simulation; meteorology; particulate matter; weather; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; Hebei; Tangshan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088113447

Despite living exclusively in intertidal, saline environments, mangroves rely on non-saline water to maintain plant productivity. However, several mangrove species persist in arid environments where non-saline water from rain and groundwater sources are limited. Under these conditions, foliar water uptake from fog and mist may be an important water acquisition strategy. We conducted a field experiment in arid Baja California Sur, Mexico along with a controlled mist chamber experiment (using seedlings sourced from humid subtropical region, Florida, USA) to show that three co-occurring, neotropical mangrove species, Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle, growing in both arid and humid environments can access water condensed on their leaves. Foliar water uptake was greatest in A. germinans and lowest in R. mangle, possibly reflecting leaf traits associated with species-specific water balance strategies. In our field misting experiment, the contribution of foliar water uptake was higher in A. germinans (32 ± 2%) than L. racemosa (26 ± 2%) and R. mangle (16 ± 1%). Foliar water uptake also varied across locations for L. racemosa and R. mangle, with declining uptake towards both species’ northern range limits in Baja California Sur, suggesting the distribution patterns of arid-zone mangroves may be affected by species-specific spatial variation in foliar water use. Within species, foliar water use was comparable across field and controlled experiments irrespective of source population (Baja California Sur vs. Florida), suggesting foliar water uptake is not an arid-zone adaptation, and is instead used as a supplemental water balance strategy in arid and humid neotropical mangroves. Synthesis. Our findings indicate mangroves have the potential to access atmospheric water, such as rain, dew and sea fog, through their leaves to offset soil water deficits. Variation in foliar water use across these three neotropical mangrove species may influence mangrove species distributions across arid-zone and pseudo-drought (highly saline) environments, with implications for mangrove response to climate change. © 2020 British Ecological Society","foliar; global change; isotopes; mangrove; plant–climate interactions; range limit; stress; water use","adaptation; arid region; climate change; coastal wetland; experimental study; foliage; humid environment; mangrove; Neotropical Region; subtropical region; water budget; water uptake; Baja California Sur; Florida [United States]; Mexico [North America]; United States; Avicennia germinans; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084210218

However, they are also highly vulnerable to land degradation. Despite widespread demand for dryland restoration and rehabilitation, little information is available to help land managers effectively re-establish native perennial vegetation across drylands. RestoreNet is an emerging dryland restoration network that systematically tests revegetation techniques across environmental gradients. Using the RestoreNet experimental framework, we tested the effectiveness of restoration treatments (i.e. ConMod nurse plant structures, mulch, pits) that increase soil moisture and seed mixes with different climatic niches to achieve revegetation goals. Across sites, seedling recruitment was consistently influenced by treatment and seed mix type. Pit and mulch treatments increased total seedling density, with pits promoting the highest seeded species recruitment while limiting non-native species establishment. Seeding increased total seedling density regardless of seed mix type, but cooler-adapted seed mixes promoted greater seeded species density and resulted in lower density of unseeded (non-native) species relative to warmer-adapted mixes. Seedling recruitment was also controlled by the temporal and environmental context of restoration with the positive effect of high precipitation greatest in the weeks immediately following seeding. Above-average precipitation during the study period across most of the sites may partially explain why the highest seeded species recruitment occurred in pit treatments and seed mixes with cooler, wetter niche requirements. Synthesis and applications. Results from the dryland restoration network, RestoreNet help to better understand variation in seeding and restoration treatment success across space and time in drylands.

First-principles electronic structure calculations can reveal unique insights into these processes, such as the role of the alignment of the oxide electronic energy levels with those of liquid water. An essential prerequisite for the success of such calculations is the ability to predict accurate structural models of these interfaces, which in turn requires careful experimental validation. Here we report a general, quantitative validation protocol for first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of oxide/aqueous interfaces. The approach makes direct comparisons of interfacial x-ray reflectivity (XR) signals from experimental measurements and those obtained from ab initio simulations with semilocal and van der Waals functionals. The protocol is demonstrated here for the case of the Al2O3(001)/water interface, one of the simplest oxide/water interfaces. We discuss the technical requirements needed for validation, including the choice of the density functional, the simulation cell size, and the optimal choice of the thermodynamic ensemble. Our results establish a general paradigm for the validation of structural models and interactions at solid/water interfaces derived from first-principles simulations. While there is qualitative agreement between the simulated structures and the experimental best-fit structure, direct comparisons of simulated and measured XR intensities show quantitative discrepancies that derive from both bulk regions (i.e., alumina and water) as well as the interfacial region, highlighting the need for accurate density functionals to properly describe interfacial interactions. Our results show that XR data are sensitive not only to the atomic structure (i.e., the atom locations) but also to the electron-density distributions in both the substrate and at the interface. © 2020 authors.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calculations; Electronic structure; Metals; Molecular dynamics; Reflection; Van der Waals forces; X rays; Experimental validations; First principles electronic structure; First principles molecular dynamics; First-principles simulations; Interfacial interaction; Photocatalytic process; Photoelectrochemical water splitting; Quantitative validation; Phase interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097186159

The participation of ENGOs in climate change governance occurs in a four-phase policy cycle. They include (1) identification of policy options, (2) policy formulation, (3) policy implementation, and (4) policy monitoring and evaluation. The ENGOs, however, have been criticized for their lack of effectiveness, and their roles in tackling climate change remain unclear. To date, the study on the roles and activities of Southeast Asian ENGOs in climate change governance has been under-researched. This study, therefore, applies a systematic literature review of 19 published articles from Scopus and Web of Science-indexed journal to understand the current state of the Southeast Asian ENGOs participation in climate change governance based on the four-phase policy cycle. The findings show that the ENGOs in Southeast Asia are involved directly and indirectly in climate change governance. They are significant actors in the implementation of the climate change policy, but they play a minimal role in the formulation of said policy. It implies that they could also be a vital partner to the government in the climate change governance process as they can bring effective policy improvements.

During boreal summer, the confinement of this air mass leads to an accumulation of aerosol between about 13 and 18 km (360 and 440 K potential temperature); this accumulation of aerosol constitutes the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). We present balloon-borne aerosol backscatter measurements of the ATAL performed by the Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD) instrument in Nainital in northern India in August 2016, and compare these with COBALD measurements in the post-monsoon time in November 2016. The measurements demonstrate a strong variability of the ATAL’s altitude, vertical extent, aerosol backscatter intensity and cirrus cloud occurrence frequency. Such a variability cannot be deduced from climatological means of the ATAL as they are derived from satellite measurements. To explain this observed variability we performed a Lagrangian back-trajectory analysis using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). We identify the transport pathways as well as the source regions of air parcels contributing to the ATAL over Nainital in August 2016. Our analysis reveals a variety of factors contributing to the observed day-to-day variability of the ATAL: continental convection, tropical cyclones (maritime convection), dynamics of the anticyclone and stratospheric intrusions. Thus, the air in the ATAL is a mixture of air masses coming from different atmospheric altitude layers. In addition, contributions from the model boundary layer originate in different geographic source regions. The location of the strongest updraft along the backward trajectories reveals a cluster of strong upward transport at the southern edge of the Himalayan foothills. From the top of the convective outflow level (about 13 km; 360 K) the air parcels ascend slowly to ATAL altitudes within a large-scale upward spiral driven by the diabatic heating in the anticyclonic flow of the South Asian summer monsoon at UTLS altitudes. Cases with a strong ATAL typically show boundary layer contributions from the Tibetan Plateau, the foothills of the Himalayas and other continental regions below the Asian monsoon. Weaker ATAL cases show higher contributions from the maritime boundary layer, often related to tropical cyclones, indicating a mixing of clean maritime and polluted continental air. On the one hand increasing anthropogenic emissions in the future are expected due to the strong growth of Asian economies; on the other hand the implementation of new emission control measures (in particular in China) has reduced the anthropogenic emissions of some pollutants contributing to the ATAL substantially. It needs to be monitored in the future whether the thickness and intensity of the ATAL will further increase, which will likely impact the surface climate. © Author(s) 2020.

Waste collection encompasses the largest part of the total budget in current waste management systems. SWC is a crosscutting issue that can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 of the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study aims to develop an SWC route optimisation model to improve collection efficiency, save collection costs and reduce emissions by considering fixed routing optimisation (FRO) with static data and variable routing optimisation (VRO) with real-time data. To realise the optimisation, a mixed-integer linear programming model utilising FRO and VRO was developed. Results show that VRO improved the collection efficiency by 26.08 % when the minimum filled-up level for collection was 70 %. Moreover, VRO achieved 44.44 % cost savings and 17.60 % carbon emission reduction at 70 % filled level. The proposed system achieved the targeted goals and demonstrated the feasibility of an optimisation model for the waste management sector to build a sustainable smart city. The findings of this study can be used to strengthen efforts towards the achievement of the SDGs related to solid waste collection and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Collection efficiency; Cost saving; Emission reduction; Optimisation model; Sustainable development goals; Waste collection","Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Emission control; Integer programming; Planning; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Carbon emission reductions; Collection efficiency; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimisation models; Route optimisation; Solid waste collection; Transportation system; Waste management systems; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088401028

SF6 gas in the equipment not only plays the role of insulation and arc suppression, but also is the information carrier of the equipment status. The moisture, impurities and leakage in SF6 gas is an important index and basis to evaluate the state of SF6 electrical equipment. Therefore, how to make good use of all kinds of testers to analyze and monitor SF6 gas is the most important thing. At present, in order to solve the problems of high standard gas cost, short period of validity and long ordering cycle, which are needed in the calibration of these instruments, we are indicated to research an eight-component dynamic gas distribution device based on mass flow controller (MFC) in this paper. Based on MFC theory, through relevant hardware and software design, the device obtains a gas distribution instrument for continuously preparing and supplying eight-component mixed standard gas with continuously adjustable concentration, so as to meet the calibration needs of SF6 component analyzer, purity meter and leak detector. Compared with the four groups, the eight-group gas distribution instrument just needs to connect the dynamic gas distribution device and the gas pipeline of the tested instrument when verifying the SF6 decomposition product instrument, and simple parameter setting in the computer management system. The computer automatically controls the single-component or multi-component mixed standard gas needed for the configuration and verification of the dynamic gas distribution system through serial communication, and it do not need to change the gas path.

Therefore, the suggestion on better planting of vegetation for maximum utility in air pollutant reduction. We therefore proposed a hypothetical method, based on the temporal matches, that vegetation supply for air purification is sufficient, between normalized vegetation and air pollution dynamic in a year, for estimating the gap between urban air pollution and urban vegetation that can be used for air pollutant reduction and further preliminarily practiced the method with vegetation indicator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the major pollutants of fine and coarse particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) in a year. We found that cities in East and Central China had relatively high-level urban vegetation throughout the growing season. However, cities with medium and low PM2.5 concentrations and low PM10 concentrations were most common in China. Both the temporal matches of PM2.5 and PM10 with vegetation were relatively high in cities with high urbanization levels, particularly in North China, but lower in cites in South China. Our results provided a theoretical method for gap estimation between urban vegetation and air pollutant reduction and demonstrated its preliminary application, which provided both methodology and evidence for understanding the trade-off between urban air pollution and urban greenspace ecoservices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Ecosystem service; Trade-off; Urbanization","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Urban growth; Coarse particulate matter; Normalized difference vegetation index; PM10 concentration; PM2.5 concentration; Preliminary analysis; Theoretical methods; Urban air pollution; Urbanization levels; Vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087590960

A train automatic driving speed planning scheme with only one operation state transition point in the simplified slope section is proposed based on slope simplification principle and speed limit regulation on an interval line, which reduces the control complexity and energy consumption for automatic driving. An improved fitness function of genetic algorithm (GA) is explored to solve an operation state transition point position of the train, then train energy-saving operation strategy is presented. Practical energy costing experiment for freight train (HXD3) with 2,800 tons for a 33.7km line on Bin-Zhou railway line is obtained and compared with the proposed algorithm. Results show that energy consumption is saved by 15.2% for the speed strategy from the proposed method. So operation strategy is simplified greatly because of only one state transition point in a simplified interval which is more suitable for automatic driving.

Currently, most biomass supply chains use edible first-generation feedstocks to produce bioethanol, therefore incentivizing them to switch to a non-edible second-generation feedstock seems necessary and motivating in this context. Implementing various carbon policy mechanisms to curb carbon emissions plays a vital role in planning bioethanol supply chains. This research proposes a quantitative optimization model for designing and planning biomass bioethanol supply chains considering monetary incentives. The model is developed further by investigating the impact of four different carbon policies including carbon tax, carbon cap, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset policy on the supply chain decisions. Also, the proposed model compares a first-generation (corn) and two different second-generation (corn stover and switchgrass) bioethanol supply chain networks to identify a better alternative for first-generation bioethanol producers. The presented methodology is implemented by applying a case study for the state of North Dakota to derive more realistic results and policies. The results show that switchgrass is a better alternative for corn rather than corn stover both economically and environmentally. A minimum incentive of $0.204/liter and $0.167/liter of bioethanol are needed to switch from corn-based to corn-stover-based and switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chains, respectively. Also, carbon cap-and-trade is the best carbon policy since it causes the lowest profit loss (31.5%) and the highest reduction in emissions (up to 1.98%) compared to other policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol production; Biomass supply chain; Carbon policy; Environmental sustainability; Motivational incentives; Optimization approach","Biomass; Carbon; Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Emission control; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Plants (botany); Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bioethanol supply chains; Biomass feedstock; Biomass supply chain; Carbon emissions; Competitive markets; Environmental sustainability; Optimization modeling; Second generation; Bioethanol; carbon emission; decision making; demand-side management; emission control; energy use; ethanol; incentive; maize; optimization; supply chain management; North Dakota; United States; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088984805

We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as >30% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification–Decomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1% to 3% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46% to 44%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of −65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland. © 2020 by the authors.

As traffic density is very high in large cities, air pollution is amplified by the various means of transport resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. Urban air pollution is mainly caused by vehicles generating emissions harmful to human health. Our objective of this work is to analyze a strategy to eliminate or reduce the emission of these pollutants (NOx, CO, CO2) during combustion. This strategy aims to explore a clean energy source alternative to fossil fuels. This approach consists of completely replacing the internal combustion scalar with the engine powered by fuel cells using hydrogen. This motivates decision makers to choose hydrogen as an alternative fuel to protect the urban environment and the health human from air pollution. This study shows that it is possible to perfectly mitigate pollutants from urban transport systems by using a PEMFC as an alternative clean energy source. Analyze a strategy to eliminate or reduce the emissions of these pollutants (NOx, CO, CO2) during the combustion of full fossil fuel in vehicle engines. This strategy aims to exploit the energy vector represented by hydrogen in order to save human life in more populated areas and protect the environment. The pressure, temperature and concentration of each species (O2, H2 and H2O) are obtained from the resolution of the electrochemical model coupled to the dynamic model, which we do not present here. © 2020 WITPress.

Especially in the historic inner cities of the Netherlands, quay walls currently need to be replaced. During construction, temporary valuable underground space is created that can be used to accommodate energy installations for the benefit of the surrounding buildings. The quay wall itself can also be a thermal active structure relying on a combination of aquatic and geothermal energy. Two different designs for quay walls incorporating thermal energy infrastructure have been designed: (i) based around a sheet pile; and (ii) based around a concrete pile with a 'L' wall on top. An evaluation of the energy, mechanics, finances and CO2 saving is presented for a case study in this paper. It is seen that for the case studies elaborated, both walls can supply sufficient thermal energy for the houses along the canals improved by good use of surface water, reduce CO2 emissions by more than 1 tonne per meter length and can be financially positive. The influence on the mechanical performance of the energy quay wall (settlements, bearing capacity and bending) has been evaluated and found to be reassuringly small. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Canals; Carbon dioxide; Hydraulic structures; Piles; Quay walls; Surface waters; Thermal energy; Walls (structural partitions); Active structures; Case-studies; CO2 emissions; Energy infrastructures; Mechanical performance; Sheet piles; Surrounding buildings; Underground space; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097721364

This approach will largely remain as a promising option to handle the MSW capacities in the future. Due to the organic waste fractions present in MSW, net negative CO2 emissions are feasible when integrating carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes into WtE plants. The calcium looping (CaL) process represents one option to capture CO2 from WtE plant exhaust gases. Hereby, CO2 is separated by a circulating limestone-based sorbent being exposed to cyclic carbonation-calcination reaction regimes. Within this study, a techno-economic analysis of a CaL retrofit on a generic 60 MWth WtE plant is conducted. The analysis considerers three different types of supplementary fuel for the CaL process, namely coal, natural gas (NG) and solid recovered fuel (SRF). Based on a detailed process model, economic key performance indicators were calculated by means of a bottom-up approach. Additionally, different heat integration concepts were proposed and assessed. The techno-economic results are discussed in comparison to a benchmark MEA scrubbing process. It was found that levelized cost of electricity increases quite significantly, which leads to cost of CO2 avoidance in the range of 119 EUR/tCO2,av (CaL-SRF) up to 288 EUR/tCO2,av (MEA). It is important to note, that the supply of negative CO2 emissions from a CCS equipped WtE plant enables a cost-efficient solution to at the same time treat MSW in a carbon neutral way while clean heat and/or power as well as negative CO2 emissions are delivered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS); Calcium looping (CaL) process; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); CO2 negative solution; Waste-to-energy (WtE) plants","Benchmarking; Calcium; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Exhaust gases; Gas fuel analysis; Lime; Metal recovery; Natural gasoline plants; Calcination reactions; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Key performance indicators; Levelized cost of electricities; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic assessment; Waste-to-energy plants; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; coal; fuel; natural gas; solid recovered fuel; unclassified drug; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; integrated approach; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; waste technology; Article; calcium looping; carbon cycle; carbon footprint; carbon storage; controlled study; energy absorption; energy cost; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; heat exchange; thermodynamics; waste-to-energy plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087708564

The simulation results show that hydro, wind, nuclear, and PV will be the dominant power sources, thus reducing the current share of coal, under carbon regulation scenario. The requirements of PV exceed its estimated commercially exploitable potential in most of the nodes in the nuclear-restricted scenario. Expanding cross-border transmission capacity will be an effective way to exploit untapped hydro resources so that Bangladesh and India can import power from Bhutan and Nepal.

The accelerating utilization of D&AI has stirred the discussion concerning the responsible application of technologies for assisting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). D&AI can raise productivity, lower costs, reduce resource intensity, and enable efficient public services. However, there are also risks and downsides that we all must identify and tackle to address any potential short-/long-term undesired impact. Notably, there exists a gap in knowledge about the mutual relationships between D&AI and the 17 SDGs. To address this gap and gather broader perspectives of experts on the potential uses and pitfalls of D&AI for SDGs and their respective indicators, we propose a participatory research approach: the Digitalization–Sustainability Matrix (DSM). The DSM serves as a means for collaborative methods, such as participatory action research (PAR), for the knowledge production process. We exercised the DSM in the Digitainable Thinkathon event, a gathering of experts from diverse sectors and backgrounds for capturing the action-oriented dialogues concerning the use of D&AI technologies for the indicators of SDGs 4 (Education) and 13 (Climate Action). As a tool, the DSM aided in the discussion by systematically capturing transdisciplinary knowledge generated on several aspects, such as: (1) the need for research–practice nexus action; (2) data-capturing efforts and social considerations; (3) collaborative planning for utilizing the power of D&AI; (4) lessons from the diverse community to encourage the purposeful use of technologies.

However, few studies have investigated the optimization of the management of water resources based on trade-offs of ES in arid areas. In order to solve this problem, four important ES that affect the carbon cycle and water cycle were selected from the regulating ecosystem services (carbon storage (CAS), evapotranspiration (ET)), the supporting ecosystem services (soil drought index (TVDI)) and the provisioning ecosystem services (groundwater depth (GWD)) in arid areas. The spatiotemporal distribution of these four ES were quantitatively analyzed—using related models—in the Tarim River, situated in a typical arid inland basin, in 2000, 2010, and 2018, in order to determine the fundamental driving factors of change in ES. The results showed that CAS was mainly affected by changes in land use, while ET, TVDI, and GWD were mainly affected by changes in water volume. The unified management of water resources improved the regulating ecosystem services (an initial increase in CAS, followed by a decrease; ET continued to grow from 2000 to 2018), the supporting ecosystem services (TVDI was maintained at 0.69–0.74), and the provisioning ecosystem services (GWD rose 5.77% in 2000–2010, and stabilized at 3.05 m in 2018). The trade-off/synergy relationships of the four ES were further analyzed at different geographical scales through correlation analysis and the trade-off index (RMSD). In different river sections, the ES that affect carbon and water cycles were highly dependent on each other. In areas with high CAS, the groundwater depth was low, and the soil moisture and ET were high. With different land use types, there was a synergistic relationship between CAS and GWD in woodland and grassland areas, and between ET and GWD in farmland areas. This showed that there was still strong competition between natural vegetation and groundwater, represented by woodland and grassland, and the ineffective loss of water resources such as ET through expansion of farmland. Finally, this study innovatively incorporated the results of trade-offs of ES into water resource management. In order to reduce the trade-offs between ES, and to improve ES, to achieve the ecological protection and restoration of desert riparian forests, and to optimize the water resource management in arid areas, different ecological water regulation and control measures were proposed in the high-flow years and the low-flow years of arid areas. This study can provide important scientific references for the improvement of ES and the optimization of the management of water resources in other similar river basins in arid areas. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the increase in energy demand and the large peak effects of charging, the passive integration of electric cars is likely to undermine sustainability efforts. This study investigates three different charging strategies for electric vehicle in Europe offering various degrees of flexibility: passive charging, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid, and puts this flexibility in perspective with the flexibility offered by interconnections. We use the Balmorel optimization tool to represent the short-term dispatch and long-term investment in the energy system and we contribute to the state-of-the-art in developing new methodologies to represent home charging and battery degradation. Our results show how each step of increased charging flexibility reduces system costs, affects energy mix, impacts spot prices and reduces CO2 emissions until the horizon 2050. We quantify how flexible charging and variable generation mutually support each other (>100 TWh from wind and solar energy in 2050) and restrict the business case for stationary batteries, whereas passive charging results in a substitution of wind by solar energy. The comparison of each charging scheme with and without interconnection expansion highlights the interplay between European countries in terms of electricity prices and CO2 emissions in the context of electrified transport. Although the best outcome is reached under the most flexible scenario at the EU level, the situation of the countries with the cheapest and most decarbonised electricity mix is damaged, which calls for adapted coordination policy at the EU level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Energy system; Flexibility; Renewable energy; Transmission system","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Costs; Electric automobiles; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission; Investments; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery degradation; Charging strategies; Coordination policies; Long-term investment; Passive integration; Stationary batteries; Transmission systems; Variable generations; Secondary batteries; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electrification; European Union; long-term change; optimization; smart grid; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088968425

Adaptation strategies were developed that are locally relevant by identifying a set of technologies that help to offset potential impacts of climate change on maize yields. Impacts and adaptation options were evaluated using projections by 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Two widely used crop simulation models, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on maize. Results showed that 20 CMIP5 models are consistent in their projections of increased surface temperatures with different magnitude. Projections by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM tend to be higher than the rest of 17 CMIP5 climate models under both emission scenarios. The projected increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) which ranged between 2.7 and 5.8°C is higher than the increase in maximum temperature (Tmax) that varied between 2.2 and 4.8°C by end century under RCP 8.5. Future projections in rainfall are less certain with high variability projections by GFDL-ESM2G, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M suggest 8 to 25% decline in rainfall, while CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR and BNU-ESM suggested more than 85% increase in rainfall under RCP 8.5 by end of 21st century. Impacts of current and future climatic conditions on maize yields varied depending on the AEZs, soil type, crop management and climate change scenario. Impacts are largely negative in the low potential AEZs such as Lower Midlands (LM4 and LM5) compared with the high potential AEZs Upper Midlands (UM2 and UM3). However, impacts of climate change are largely positive across all AEZs and management conditions when CO2 fertilization is included. Using the differential impacts of climate change, a strategy to adapt maize cultivation to climate change in all the five AEZs was identified by consolidating those practices that contributed to increased yields under climate change. We consider this approach as more appropriate to identify operational adaptation strategies using readily available technologies that contribute positively under both current and future climatic conditions. This approach when adopted in strategic manner will also contribute to further strengthen the development of adaptation strategies at national and local levels. The methods and tools validated and applied in this assessment allowed estimating possible impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies which can provide valuable insights and guidance for adaptation planning. © 2020 Gummadi et al.

The use of turbochargers on smaller engines is one such concept, but they are limited by a time delay in reaching the required boost during transient operation. The amount of turbocharger lag plays a key role in the driver’s perceived quality of a passenger vehicle’s engine response. This paper investigates an alternative method to the conventional design of a turbocharger turbine to improve the transient response of a passenger vehicle. The investigation utilises the Ford Eco-Boost 1.6 L petrol engine, an established production engine, equipped with a turbocharger of similar performance to the GT1548 produced by Honeywell. The commercially available Ricardo WAVE was used to model the engine. Comparing the steady-state performance showed that the axial turbine provides higher efficiencies at all operating conditions of an engine. The transient case demonstrated an improved transient response at all operating conditions of the engine. The study concluded that, by designing a similar sized axial turbine, the mass moment of inertia can be reduced by 12.64% and transient response can be improved on average by 11.76%, with a maximum of 21.05% improvement. This study provides encouragement for the wider application of this turbine type to vehicles operating on dynamic driving cycles such as passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, and certain off-road applications. © 2020 by the authors.

As the key precursors of ozone generation, it is necessary to control the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) pollution. To have a better understanding of the pollution status and source contribution, the concentrations of 117 ambient VOCs were analyzed from April to August 2018 in an urban site in Shijiazhuang. Results showed that the monthly average concentration of total VOCs was 66.27 ppbv, in which, the oxygenated VOCs (37.89%), alkanes (33.89%), and halogenated hydrocarbons (13.31%) were the main composite on. Eight major sources were identified using Positive Matrix Factorization modeling with an accurate VOCs emission inventory as inter-complementary methods revealed that the petrochemical industry (26.24%), other industrial sources (15.19%), and traffic source (12.24%) were the major sources for ambient VOCs in Shijiazhuang. The spatial distributions of major industrial activities emissions were identified by using geographic information statistics system, which illustrated the VOCs was mainly from the north and southeast of Shijiazhuang.

For countries with uneven distribution of renewable energy, it is necessary to evaluate both cross-regional and on-site green hydrogen supply pathways. The goal of this paper is to identify the economic, energy and environmental aspects of potential solar energy integrated green hydrogen supply routes including cross-regional and on-site options for hydrogen refueling stations in China. Four green hydrogen supply routes are proposed in our study: 1) northwest solar power integrated methanol production as hydrogen carrier coupled with cross-regional delivery to hydrogen refueling station for onsite hydrogen production pathway (Route I), 2) northwest solar power integrated hydrogen production coupled with gas H2 cross-regional delivery pathway (Route II), 3) northwest solar power integrated hydrogen production coupled with liquid H2 cross-regional delivery pathway (Route III) and 4) on-site solar energy -powered hydrogen refueling station (Route IV). The results indicate that solar energy integrated hydrogen supply pathways have remarkable CO2 emission reduction effect. Route I, Route II, Route III and Route IV can reduce CO2 emission by 83%, 59%, 96%, and more than 99% respectively, compared with the conventional coal gasification for hydrogen production coupled with gas H2 delivery to nearby fueling station pathway (coal-H2 delivery). In term of energy consumption, Route III and Route IV show advantage in energy efficiency, which consumes 27% and 38% less energy compared with coal-H2 delivery, respectively. In economic aspect, the four routes are not competitive with conventional coal-H2 delivery, but from the perspective of green hydrogen supply, Route I and Route III are economically competitive compared with on-site solar energy-powered hydrogen refueling station (Route IV).

Machining process is a major process of manufacturing industries, plays an important role in energy saving and emission reduction. This paper established an energy-consumption model for machining processes considering the full states of machining processes. Firstly, machining processes are decomposed into activities and activity transitions according to the different characteristics of energy demand. Secondly, based on the decomposition of activities and activity transitions, the energy-consumption models of activities and activity transitions are established, respectively. Thirdly, combining with the established energy-consumption models of activities and activity transitions, this paper proposes an energy-consumption model for the entire machining processes that systematically reflects different machining states. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed model can accurately calculate the energy consumption of machining processes and provide guidance for machine tool energy saving. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activity transition; Energy saving; energy-consumption model; machining processes; transient state","Emission control; Energy conservation; Machining; Machining centers; Manufacture; Energy consumption model; Energy consumption process; Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental pollutions; Machining Process; Machining systems; Manufacturing industries; Provide guidances; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094872774

In this study we assess the effects of a 7–week (23 March– 10 May, 2020) lockdown in the Greater Area of Athens, coupling in situ observations with estimations from a meteorology–atmospheric chemistry model. Measurements in central Athens during the lockdown were compared with levels during the pre– and post–lockdown 3–week periods and with respective levels in the four previous years. We examined regulatory pollutants as well as CO2, black carbon (BC) and source–specific BC components. Models were run for pre– lockdown and lockdown periods, under baseline and reduced–emissions scenarios. The in–situ results indicate mean concentration reductions of 30–35% for traffic–related pollutants in Athens (NO2, CO, BC from fossil fuel combustion), compared to the pre–lockdown period. A large reduction (53%) was observed also for the urban CO2 enhancement while the reduction for PM2.5 was subtler (18%). Significant reductions were also observed when comparing the 2020 lockdown period with past years. However, levels rebounded immediately following the lift of the general lockdown. The decrease in measured NO2 concentrations was reproduced by the implementation of the city scale model, under a realistic reduced–emissions scenario for the lockdown period, anchored at a 46% decline of road transport activity. The model permitted the assessment of air quality improvements on a spatial scale, indicating that NO2 mean concentration reductions in areas of the Athens basin reached up to 50%. The findings suggest a potential for local traffic management strategies to reduce ambient exposure and to minimize exceedances of air quality standards for primary pollutants. © 2020 by the authors.

In 2020, the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in China overlapped with Week 3 of the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday, and an Asian outflow event. Thus, movement of the Chinese populace from city to city was already greatly reduced by the time of the LRT episode, although the reductions in industrial output are less clear. We found NO2 column concentrations were reduced by 24% during the CNY Week 3 this year compared to previous years. The attenuated transport event arrived to northern Taiwan with a PM2.5 concentration &lt;45 μg m−3 and most often &lt;35 μg m−3, which is 2–3 times lower than LRT episodes of similar back-trajectory and synoptic patterns. The whole episode persisted for about 60 h, longer than most LRT episodes from China to Taiwan. CMAQ v5.2.1 modeling of the LRT event with 100% emission and reduced emission scenarios, revealed emissions in China were approximately 50% less than normal periods. Due to the length of the episode and the significant reduction in emissions, Taiwan avoided a PM2.5 surplus of 19.2 μg m−3 on average during the episode, equivalent to a 0.5 μg m−3 reduction for the whole 3-month winter season. Employing the 100% emission model scenario and scaling up to the average episode hours each winter, the PM2.5 surplus delivered via plumes on the northeast monsoon is equivalent to a 0.5 μg m−3 surplus for the whole year. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CMAQ; Emissions reduction; PM2.5; Shutdown; Taiwan; Transboundary aerosol","Air pollution; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Air pollution transport; Back trajectories; Emission scenario; Industrial outputs; Long range transport; Northeast monsoon; PM2.5 concentration; Transport events; Atmospheric movements; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; long range transport; mobility; nitrogen dioxide; pollutant transport; respiratory disease; air pollution; Article; boundary layer; China; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; field emission; leisure; monsoon climate; particulate matter; plume dispersion; population movement pattern; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); scale up; Taiwan; wind speed; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; Far East; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Far East; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086805542

They are also likely to be the system most impacted by climate change, feeling the effects of sea levels rise, temperature increases and rainfall regime changes. Climate change impacts on estuarine coastal wetlands (mangroves, saltmarsh) have been thoroughly investigated; however, the impacts on coastal freshwater wetlands (CFWs) are relatively unknown. To explore the current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on CFWs globally, we undertook a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed published literature. We found surprisingly little research (110 papers of an initial 678), the majority of which was conducted in the USA, focusing on the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on CFW vegetation or sediment accretion processes. From this research, we know that SLR will lead to reduced productivity, reduced regeneration, and increased mortality in CFW vegetation but little is known regarding the effects of other climate change drivers. Sediment accretion is also not sufficient to keep pace with SLR in many CFWs and again the effects of other climate drivers have not been investigated. The combination of unhealthy vegetation communities and minimal gain in vertical elevation can result in a transition towards a vegetation community of salt-tolerant species but more research is required to understand this process. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coastal swamp; Floodplain; Sea level rise; Tidal freshwater wetland; Tidal marsh","Ecosystems; Sea level; Vegetation; Water; Wetlands; Accretion process; Climate change impact; Coastal landscapes; Ecosystem services; Freshwater wetlands; Literature reviews; Temperature increase; Vegetation community; Climate change; climate change; ecosystem service; global perspective; literature review; mortality; satellite laser ranging; sea level change; service provision; wetland; United States; Rhizophoraceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089520495

First implemented in 1978, they have been adapted over time, responding to lessons learned and changing circumstances. In combination with the more recent vehicle greenhouse gas emission (GHG) standards, they have achieved enormous fuel savings and emission reductions. Until the 2018 proposed rollback, the quality of research and analysis in support of rulemakings improved dramatically with advances in analytical methods, computing power and the resources dedicated to the task. Despite the abundance of fuel economy and related data, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the standards from 1975 to the present. This paper analyzes historical data to assess the real-world impact of the standards, as well as draw lessons about energy and environmental policy design. Cumulatively, fuel economy improvements due to the standards have reduced fuel consumption by well over one and a half trillion gallons, saved consumers trillions of dollars and avoided 14 billion tons of GHG emissions. Our analysis indicates that fuel savings have exceeded the cost of improving fuel economy, traffic safety has improved and the impact on vehicle travel has been small. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CAFE standards; Fuel economy standards; Vehicle greenhouse gas emissions; Vehicle standards","Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Quality control; Analytical method; Comprehensive assessment; Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Emission reduction; Energy regulation; Environmental policy; Research and analysis; Vehicle travels; Fuel economy; carbon emission; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; standardization; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089651789

Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 (δ13CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and δ13C in plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric δ13CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) because 14C is absent in million-year-old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric Δ14CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in δ13C and Δ14C in atmospheric CO2 are influenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused Δ14CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the first few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric Δ14CO2. For δ13CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent δ13CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and flask δ13CO2 observations indicates that the decline in δ13CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of δ13CO2 have been used to investigate carbon fluxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with δ13C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air-sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 are also used for comparison with Δ14C in other materials in many fields such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using Δ14CO2 observations and models. In the future, δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other fields will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of δ13C and Δ14C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model-data analysis tools. ©2020.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have the unique potential to be centres of renewable H2 generation with the growing availability of two attractive feedstocks: biomethane and ammonia. An innovative and novel method of ammonia recovery from digestate liquor followed by a state-of-the-art H2 production process named NWaste2H2 is demonstrated for a case-study WWTP. The recovered ammonia is used alongside biomethane for H2 production and its diversion from conventional biological treatment has two other crucial benefits, with reductions in both associated electricity demand and emissions of nitrous oxide, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. Process modelling, supported by extensive experiments in a packed-bed reactor at bench-scale, demonstrate the prized capability of simultaneously performing steam methane reforming and ammonia decomposition to generate a H2-rich syngas with yields close to equilibrium values. Greenhouse gas emission abatement from the replacement of diesel buses and reduced N2O emissions from biological treatment could save up to 17.2 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per year for each person served by the WWTP.

The real-life effectiveness of clean cooking interventions has been disappointing overall yet variable, but the sociodemographic determinants are not well described. We measured personal 24-h PM2.5 (particulate matter &lt;2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter) thrice in pregnant women (n = 218) gravimetrically with Teflon filter, impactor, and personal pump setups. To estimate the effectiveness of owning chimney and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves (i.e., proportion of PM2.5 exposure that would be prevented) and to predict subject-specific typical exposures, we used linear mixed-effects models with log (PM2.5) as dependent variable and random intercept for subject. Median (IQR) personal PM2.5 in µg/m3 was 148 (90–249) for open fire, 78 (51–125) for chimney stove, and 55 (34–79) for LPG stoves. Adjusted effectiveness of LPG stoves was greater in women with ≥6 years of education (49% (95% CI: 34, 60)) versus &lt;6 years (26% (95% CI: 5, 42)). In contrast, chimney stove adjusted effectiveness was greater in women with &lt;6 years of education (50% (95% CI: 38, 60)), rural residence (46% (95% CI: 34, 55)) and lowest SES (socio-economic status) quartile (59% (95% CI: 45, 70)) than ≥6 years education (16% (95% CI: 22, 43)), urban (23% (95% CI: −164, 42)) and highest SES quartile (−44% (95% CI: −183, 27)), respectively. A minority of LPG stove owners (12%) and no chimney owner had typical exposure below World Health Organization Air Quality guidelines (35 µg/m3). Although having a cleaner stove alone typically does not lower exposure enough to protect health, understanding sociodemographic determinants of effectiveness may lead to better targeting, implementation, and adoption of interventions. © 2020 by the authors.

It provides a central unified database that can be queried, filtered, manipulated and/or changed for analysis, thus providing a collaborative tool for all the stakeholders in the project throughout the life cycle of the project. Positive returns on investments are acceded by the contractors adopting BIM while it helps detect clashes of intersecting building components early in the design stages. BIM is proving of utmost importance while focusing on the development of sustainable buildings and to develop the cities smarter and intelligent. Environmental concerns warrant more and more sustainable buildings to be designed and implemented. BIM has an intrinsic role to play in building design to address the growing environmental concerns such as to reduce carbon footprint, to cut construction and demolition waste, selection of green material, quality of the indoor environment, water conservation, and health factors of inhabitants, etc. In the current practices, the simulation and environmental performance analysis follow the design phase of the project, thus not getting incorporated into the decision making at this stage. Some models of flat slab buildings are generated by some studies where required parameters were assigned to different elements of the building.

In a companion paper, we study the evolution of hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) jets, finding that mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to an interface layer, termed jet-cocoon interface (JCI), which contains a significant fraction of the system energy. We find that the angular structure of the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by a flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend on the degree of mixing. In this paper, we examine the effect of subdominant toroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak fields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of the mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout structure. Nevertheless, the overall shape of the outflow can still be approximated by a flat core + a power-law function, although the JCI power-law decay is steeper. The effect of weak fields is more prominent in long GRB jets, where the mixing in hydrodynamic jets is stronger. In short GRB jets, there is small mixing in both weakly magnetized and unmagnetized jets. This result influences the expected jet emission which is governed by the jet's morphology. Therefore, prompt and afterglow observations in long GRBs may be used as probes for the magnetic nature at the base of the jets. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","instabilities; methods: numerical; MHD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096835474

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were tested for 12 years. The problem is that several complex physical, chemical and biological processes take place in the baled waste for bio-waste, which was then an integral part of mixed municipal waste. To solve this problem, the experimental values are used, and they determine the dependence of the DOC concentration on time, as well as the transition points and events that cause the abrupt changes in the decomposition of the organic component in mixed municipal waste. Unlike the landfill in the baled waste, after aerobic phase begins the anaerobic phase, and after anaerobic phase begins again aerobic phase, because the foil gas permeability is starting. The whole process is, according to System Theory, a complex system with many components, and the interaction, connections, and interdependencies among them, but also the interaction with the environment of the system.

As the building sector is one of the main contributors to energy consumption, renovation of existing buildings is a key strategy. However, for a drastic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction, sensible material solutions are required. Bio-based products seem to be a promising alternative thanks to carbon sequestration in the new biomass, which needs to be regrown for substitution. The conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) framework seems unsuited to model temporal emissions and carbon uptake of such solutions. Dynamic LCA (DLCA), which models temporal aspects, is more appropriate to evaluate the environmental performance of bio-based products. Moreover, the different dynamic drivers of urban building stocks should be included to allow for informed material choices. A new methodology is proposed, integrating DLCA with material flow analysis (MFA) considering a dynamic renovation rate. The global warming potential over time of the thermal retrofit of a Lisbon neighbourhood with a straw-based technology is assessed. The results highlight the importance of the end of life scenario, greatly influencing the results in the mid- to long term. Increased renovation rates can yield higher carbon storage benefits. However, if accompanied by technological solutions that rely on carbon intensive materials, e.g. finishing, this can lead to increased embodied carbon emissions in the transition period. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The pandemic, which reduced global air travel significantly, provides an opportunity to discuss the scale, distribution and growth of aviation until 2018, also with a view to consider the climate change implications of a return to volume growth. Industry statistics, data provided by supranational organizations, and national surveys are evaluated to develop a pre-pandemic understanding of air transport demand at global, regional, national and individual scales. Results suggest that the share of the world's population travelling by air in 2018 was 11%, with at most 4% taking international flights. Data also supports that a minor share of air travelers is responsible for a large share of warming: The percentile of the most frequent fliers – at most 1% of the world population - likely accounts for more than half of the total emissions from passenger air travel. Individual users of private aircraft can contribute to emissions of up to 7,500 t CO2 per year.

While the most complex climate models contain the most detailed representations of many physical processes within the climate system, both parameter space exploration and integrated assessment modelling require the increased computational efficiency of reduced-complexity models. This study presents a computationally efficient method for generating probabilistic projections of local warming across the globe, using a pattern-scaling approach derived from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, that can be coupled to any efficient model ensemble simulation of global mean surface warming. While the method can project local warming for arbitrary future scenarios, using it for scenarios with peak global mean warming ≤ 2 °C is problematic due to the large uncertainties involved. First, global mean warming is projected using a 103-member ensemble of history-matched simulations with an example reduced complexity Earth system model: theWarming Acidification and Sea-level Projector (WASP). The ensemble projection of global mean warming from this WASP ensemble is then converted into local warming projections using a pattern-scaling analysis from the CMIP5 archive, considering both the mean and uncertainty of the local to global ratio of temperature change (LGRTC) spatial patterns from the CMIP5 ensemble for high-end and mitigated scenarios. The LGRTC spatial pattern is assessed for scenario dependence in the CMIP5 ensemble using RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and spatial domains are identified where the pattern scaling is useful across a variety of arbitrary scenarios. The computational efficiency of our WASP-LGRTC model approach makes it ideal for future incorporation into an integrated assessment model framework or efficient assessment of multiple scenarios.We utilise an emergent relationship between warming and future cumulative carbon emitted in our simulations to present an approximation tool making local warming projections from total future carbon emitted. © Author(s) 2020.",,"global warming; historical geography; methodology; probability; scale effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096053642

This study compares the capability of both methodologies in assessing soil water dynamics as a key variable that reflects the effects of forest management in a semi-arid environment. To this end, two experimental plots were established in Sierra Calderona in the province of Valencia in Spain in a post-fire regeneration Aleppo pine forest with high tree density. One plot was thinned (T) and the other remained as control (C). Nine capacitance probes and one Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) were installed in each plot. First, the CRNP was calibrated and validated, and subsequently, the performance of both techniques was analyzed by comparing soil moisture and its relationship with environmental variables and stand transpiration. The validation results confirmed the general reliability of CRNP to obtain soil moisture under semi-arid conditions, with a Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE) between 0.75 and 0.84, although this performance decreased significantly when dealing with extreme soil moisture (KGE: −0.06–0.02). A significant effect of forest biomass and litter layer was also observed on CRNP-derived soil moisture, which produced an overestimation of soil moisture. The performance of both methodologies was analyzed by partial correlations between soil moisture and environmental variables and transpiration, as well as by applying Boosted Regression Trees to reproduce tree transpiration with each soil moisture measurement technique together with the environmental variables. Both methodologies were capable to reproduce tree transpiration affected by soil moisture, environmental variables and thinning, although CRNP always appeared as the most affected by atmospheric driving forces.

Therefore, the soils ability to store organic carbon is a key factor for climate regulation and for other soil functions. The soil management and the topographic position play an important role in SOC variation, especially when the landscape is not uniform (Mediterranean areas). Many researches have explored the SOC distribution according to topographic position in hillsides for long-term, but very few studies have focused on the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to know, the changes that taking place in the soil due to land management change (LMC) in these irregular surfaces for sustainable agricultural production and its implications on climate change regulation. This study aims to assess the influence of topographic position and LMC on SOC stock (SOC-S) in Mediterranean olive groves (OG) soils in short term (2 years). In this line, three experimental plots were selected in three topographical position (summit - S, backslope - B and toeslope - T). In these plots, the land management was modified from conventional tillage (CT) to no tillage (NT) with application of pruned olive branch chippings branches and vegetation cover (spontaneous vegetation) in the OG streets. The studied soils did not show important changes due to LMC in their physical properties for short term, in addition, these soils were characterized by low organic matter content (&lt;1.2%). LMC caused a SOC reduction in surface, and a SOC increase in the Bw horizon. The N concentrations showed a similar trend to SOC and the C:N ratios were highly variable (4.37: C horizon-NT-S; 13.45 Bw/C horizon -CT-B). Normally, the SOC-S concentrations decreasing in depth. LMC for two years showed soil carbonization (S and T position) and decarbonization (B position) processes. The SOC-S increased 1.88 Mg ha−1 y−1 and 0.47 Mg ha−1 y−1 for S and T topographic position respectively, however the SOC-S decreased in B position 5.27 Mg ha−1 y−1. Therefore, LMC has a positive effect on soil carbon reserves in S and T position, conversely in B position, this effect was negative. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cambisol; Carbonization; Decarbonization; Mediterranean areas; Topographical position; Traditional olive grove","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Carbonization; Climate change; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; System-on-chip; Vegetation; Conventional tillage; Experimental plots; Mediterranean areas; Organic matter content; Short-term effects; Soil organic carbon; Sustainable agricultural; Topographic positions; Magnesium; nitrogen; organic carbon; soil organic matter; cover crop; land management; organic carbon; soil management; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; topographic effect; Article; carbonization; climate change; controlled study; conventional tillage; cover crop; land use; olive; particle size; priority journal; soil analysis; soil depth; soil erosion; soil management; soil property; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088367475

Still, currently fire regimes have been increasingly altered by human activities and climate change, causing economic losses, air pollution, and environmental damage. In Brazil, savannas (locally known as the Cerrado) occupy almost 25% of the area of the country and contain 70% of the concentrated burned area. Fire frequency is related to the use of biannual fire in agricultural practices, aiming at cleaning cattle pastures, which act as ignition sources for the surrounding natural vegetation. Here, we present an ecological model to demonstrate how biennial fire affects plant biomass and carbon release from fine fuel in the Cerrado. The BEFIRE model (Behavior and Effect of Fire) is the first quantitative model to simulate the relationships between fire frequency, plant biomass, and fire-associated emissions based on the synthesis of knowledge about fire behavior and the effects on ecosystems compiled from experimental burnings in the Cerrado. Our model uses microclimate variables and vegetation structure (the amount of the aboveground biomass of trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses) as inputs, and generates outputs related to the fire behavior (fire spread rate, fire intensity, and heat released) and the fire effects on the dynamic of plant biomass and post-fire carbon emissions. The BEFIRE model predicts that biennial fires allow for the recovery of the biomass of herbs and grasses, due to its fast growth. However, this fire interval does not allow for the recovery of the biomass of shrubs and trees. These growth limitations alter the co-existence of trees/shrubs and herbs/grasses and prevent the uptake of the total amount of emitted carbon from the combustion of fine fuel. Based on the model results, we proposed some recommendations for fire management in this threatened biome. © Copyright © 2020 Gomes, Miranda, Soares-Filho, Rodrigues, Oliveira and Bustamante.","aboveground biomass; carbon emissions; Cerrado; climate change; co-existence; fire behavior; fire frequency; management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097945373

Au/PVA + benzimidazole Cu complex/n-Si MPS diode's electronic and photo-responsivity (PR) properties were investigated by current-voltage (I–V) measurements under various ultraviolet (UV) (365 nm wavelength) illumination intensities (from 50 to 250 mW/cm2) and at room temperature. It was found that the difference between the dark and high UV illumination I(V) plots of the MPS diode exceeds 105 times. Thus, this higher response to UV illumination has caused the reverse region current of the diode exceeds the forward region current since the first UV illumination level (50 mW/cm2). This ensures both the MPS diode has a very high PR value and allows that the diode working direction can be adjusted with UV exposure. The remarkably high PR values were obtained for P = 100 mW/cm2 as 11.01 A/W at −4.84 V, and 2.14 mA/W at 0 V. Also, main electronic parameters of the MPS diode were calculated by thermionic emission, Ohm law, Cheung&amp;Cheung and Card&amp;Rhoderick methods. The series resistance (Rs) values calculated for each Cheung&amp;Cheung function are compatible each other and there is an acceptable coherence with obtained values by ohmic approach. For the surface states density (Nss) of the MPS diode obtained for each UV illumination, it was found that they are higher than the dark ones and they shifted to lower energy region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Benzimidazole Cu complex; Photo-responsivity; Photodiode; PVA; Ultraviolet","Copper compounds; Crystal symmetry; Diodes; Electric resistance; Photodiodes; Silicon; Thermionic emission; Electronic parameters; Illumination intensity; Interfacial layer; Photoresponsivity; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Series resistances; Surface states density; UV illuminations; Silicon alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091916562

The anodic Cu2O and CuO nanowires or nanoneedles are attractive photo-and electrocatalysts since they show wide array of desired electronic and morphological features, such as highly-developed surface area. In CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) copper and copper-based nanostructures indicate unique adsorption properties to crucial reaction intermediates. Furthermore, anodized copper-based materials enable formation of C2+ hydrocarbons and alcohols with enhanced selectivity. Moreover, anodic copper oxides provide outstanding turnover frequencies in electrochemical methanol oxidation at lowered overpotentials. Therefore, they can be considered as precious metals electrodes substituents in direct methanol fuel cells. Additionally, due to the presence of Cu(III)/Cu(II) redox couple, these materials find application as electrodes for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. In photoelectrochemistry, Cu2O-CuO heterostructures of anodic copper oxides with highly-developed surface area are attractive for water splitting.

Also, how to decide the marketing strategy under low carbon regulation is a significant and realistic problem for enterprises. This paper analyzes a two-echelon dual-channel supply chain model by considering emission sensitive stochastic demand under governments’ mandatory cap-and-trade regulation and consumers’ low carbon preferences. By considering the products’ compatibility, the proposed model illustrates some key channel strategies to gain more managerial insights for the members of the chain. The results show that the arrival pattern of the consumer affects significantly the economic order quantity of the members and profit of the supply chain. The compatibility of the product is proved to be a key factor in determining the optimal channel strategy for the members of the supply chain. The proposed model identifies two regions of the compatibility parameter which is preferable to all the members of the supply chain. When the compatibility of the product in an online channel is extremely high, the addition of the online channel can be accepted by the manufacturer and the whole supply chain with a retailer is disadvantageous. The analytical results assure that under the emission sensitive stochastic demand, the decentralized dual-channel strategy can be coordinated successfully by adopting buyback contracts and reduction task-sharing contract to originate a win–win outcome for all the members of the supply chain. Finally, the numerical results show that the introduction of a dual-channel strategy is profitable when consumers’ low carbon preference is higher and the product has lower initial emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cap-and-trade regulation; Carbon emissions reduction; Consumers’ low carbon preferences; Dual-channel supply chain; Stochastic demand","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Marketing; Profitability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Analytical results; Buy-back contracts; Channel strategies; Dual channel supply chain; Economic order quantity; Environmental contamination; Marketing strategy; Stochastic demand; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089696936

The canopy of many native plants including shrubs and trees not only provides refuge from predators for some animals but also offers a shelter from climatic stressors for other plants. The canopy of native vegetation can thus be a microhabitat critical to the persistence of many species locally, and it is vital to better understand its importance for the conservation and recovery of species in these landscapes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that triangular and rectangular artificial canopies function similarly to the canopy of resident native shrubs when ameliorating the understory micro-climate. Three light permeabilities including 15%, 50%, and 90% were tested by measuring soil and air temperature with light relative to paired open gap (non-canopied) microsites and shrubs. Shelters offered more stable temperatures and reduction in light compared to the open gap and were not significantly different from established native shrubs. This suggests that this simple, affordable intervention can provide a stop-gap solution that approximates natural heterogeneity in climate at fine scales and offers a refuge whilst managers and stakeholders restore native vegetation such as slow-growing and difficult to establish shrubs within this ecosystem. © 2020","climate change; conservation; micro-climate; restoration; shelter; solar radiation; temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096218072

Therefore, retrofitting the existing buildings is a priority for most EU countries. Long term goals for the energy performance of buildings are premised. However, to be able to monitor the progress and feasibility to achieve the goals in 2050, knowledge of the actual renovation rate is indispensable. Since years an overall renovation rate of 1% for the EU is communicated. This number is withheld in several countries to stimulate retrofitting (Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands). However, it is not clear how this renovation rate reflects the actual renovation rate and the actual energy savings because accurate knowledge on this is lacking in most countries. This paper focusses on elaborating our knowledge of the renovation rate by analysing its definition and providing a possible, more accurate calculation method. A literature study shows that there is no commonly used definition of 'renovation rate' in the EU. Instead different approaches are being used, often depending on available data. A case study for Flanders, Belgium reconstructs the communicated renovation rate of 0.7% to 1% by means of a database of the renovation activity of approximately 6000 homeowners (2012-2018). The used survey concept shows that the actual renovation rate exceeds 1% and is able to provide extra insights on the energy renovation depth in Flanders. In a next step this could be extended to calculate the actual energy savings due to renovations. As this survey concept can easily be adopted in other EU countries, it could form the base of an aligned monitoring of the progress towards a sustainable built environment. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The current study presents an experimental and numerical investigation of the CO2 generation rate and spatial distribution in the crew quarters (CQ) of the International Space Station. In microgravity, density-difference based airflow is nonexistent, and CO2 accumulates around the astronaut's head if the BZ is poorly or not at all ventilated. The aim is to study the breath's influence on CO2 spatial distribution in order to circumscribe the region that needs to be ventilated in the CQ. An experimental setup was used to measure the CO2 generation rate of several test subjects on Earth in a non-ventilated full-scale model of the CQ. The experimental CO2 results were used to validate CFD simulations of the CQ with gravity, with a human model inside featuring a full respiratory cycle. The validated CFD model was then used without gravity for a CO2 accumulation study. The respiratory cycle was analyzed in order to propose a rigorous definition of the BZ based on a frequency analysis of the breath. Results show that CO2 concentrations in the identified BZ are greater in the absence of gravity compared to a similar situation with gravity. It is believed that the ventilation system presently in place in the CQ does not effectively ventilate this strategic area, therefore a personalized ventilation type solution should be studied in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Breathing zone definition; CO2 accumulation in microgravity; Human breathing simulation; ISS ventilation","Carbon dioxide; Respiratory mechanics; Space stations; Ventilation; CO2 concentration; Density difference; Frequency Analysis; Full-scale modeling; International Space stations; Numerical investigations; Personalized ventilation; Ventilation systems; Spatial distribution; accumulation rate; airflow; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; computational fluid dynamics; spatial distribution; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090835103

In this work, we analyze the neutrino emission properties and the conditions leading to the growth of flavor instabilities in merger remnants consisting of a hypermassive neutron star and an accretion disk during the first 10 ms after the merger. The analyses are based on hydrodynamical simulations that include a modeling of neutrino emission and absorption effects via the ""improved leakage-equilibration-absorption scheme""(ILEAS). We also examine the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) inside the material ejected during this phase. The dominant emission of ν¯e over νe from the merger remnant leads to favorable conditions for the occurrence of fast pairwise flavor conversions of neutrinos, independent of the chosen equation of state or the mass ratio of the binary. The nucleosynthesis outcome is very robust, ranging from the first to the third r-process peaks. In particular, more than 10-5 M of strontium are produced in these early ejecta that may account for the GW170817 kilonova observation. We find that the amount of ejecta containing free neutrons after the r-process freeze-out, which may power early-time UV emission, is reduced by roughly a factor of 10 when compared to simulations that do not include weak interactions. Finally, the potential flavor equipartition between all neutrino flavors is mainly found to affect the nucleosynthesis outcome in the polar ejecta within 30°, by changing the amount of the produced iron-peak and first-peak nuclei, but it does not alter the lanthanide mass fraction therein. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097178522

Today's cities typically TRAP URBAN DWELLERS in the local housing type with NO ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITY! This paper proposes a NEW CITY INFRASTRUCTURE with neighborhood modules of completely flexible, large two-story totally private development sites suitable for any typical urban business or 1 to 4 homes. Entrepreneurial urban dwellers may pursue any enterprise, an amazing new economic resource for individuals and cities. These vacant building sites will be built in a permanent (1000+year) multi-story infrastructure. Flexibility of space and utility raceways allow continual updating for continually changing objectives and new technology to meet SDG's. Locals complete their city and transit link. It will function as a permanent, autonomous, Self-sustaining, compact, efficient, adaptable dwelling and farming system. Methods: Designing, building, market testing and worldwide research over 40 years proved the need for this proposal. Inspiration: Ancient stone structures occupied for hundreds of years. Flexibility and privacy make a permanent infrastructure practical. ""Continual-use""reduces future housing costs 70%. This infrastructure stimulates remarkable new ownership and financial arrangements for all income levels. Results: Long term success of SDG targets ultimately depends on individuals. Options give hope and more control over their property and future. Flexibility encourages incentives to improve and increase ownership equity. This design's hillside village qualities of dwellings overlooking daily life on their neighborhood plaza will generate common bonds overlapping many generations. Total privacy, flexibility, backyard gardens and incentives encourage entrepreneurs, combining talents, sweat equity, Self-employment, pride and hope! Conclusion: In some locations the need is already desperate. The only logical conclusion: Immediately build, test and refine this proposal. Many modules together become a city, living areas above floods, capable of reducing CO2 and totally eliminating fire or climate risk. Implementing this new urban flexibility will revolutionize future human habitats and the life of every person. Test it, discover new SDG guidelines. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerospace vehicles; Ecosystems; Housing; Privacy by design; Surveying; Sustainable development; Building sites; Economic resources; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Farming system; Human habitats; Self employment; Stone structures; Urban dwellers; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097186427

The energy sector is transforming via the convergence of power, transportation, and industrial sectors and inter-sectoral integration. To assess the level of decarbonization achieved through this change, one needs to study the carbon footprint of the energy system as a whole. Here, we present a novel, system-scale energy analysis tool, the Sustainable Energy System Analysis Modelling Environment (SESAME), to assess the pathway- and system-level GHG emissions of today's changing energy system. The underlying analytic tool constitutes more than a thousand individual energy pathways. SESAME provides a consistent platform to estimate life cycle GHG emissions of all stages of the energy sector. Furthermore, the system representation is embedded into the tool for power and transportation sectors. The developed novel architecture, and implications of energy choices for example scenarios (vehicle fleet projections for US and generator-level hourly power generation) are presented to demonstrate SESAME's high-resolution analysis capabilities. Impact of operational variations such as partial loading of power generation units and technology choices, such as treatment of the same crude oil in different refinery configurations, is explored. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon footprint; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Life cycle analysis; Renewable energy","Carbon footprint; Energy conservation; Energy management; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Consumption of energy; High resolution analysis; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Modelling environment; Power generation units; Sustainable energy systems; System representation; Transportation sector; Greenhouse gases; carbon footprint; convergence; crude oil; energy efficiency; energy planning; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; power generation; transportation planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088644201

However, climate change has been politicized in many countries, potentially blocking the introduction of climate policies and broader green industrial policies. Publicly funded green investment banks (GIBs) are one policy instrument that mobilizes private finance into national opportunities. However very little is known about the political decisions behind the establishment and design of these banks. Taking an exploratory approach, we analyse the parliamentary discourse behind the establishment and design of the UK's Green Investment Bank and Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We find that the debate on GIB establishment focused on arguments related to high-level policy goals and the role of the state. The debate on GIB design focused on technology target sectors, tasks and tools to be implemented, and organizational aspects. We find a difference in political controversy levels with Australia's debates displaying distinct partisanship on all debate topics, whereas the UK's debates displayed clear consensus on the majority of debated topics. We also find that debate on higher-level establishment concepts, especially the role of the state, received more attention in Australia, whereas in the UK there was greater discussion of design concepts, namely organizational aspects. We derive propositions on the politics of GIBs beyond our two cases, and conclude with an agenda for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085477029

The process of developing adaptation measures at local-scale (e.g., river basins) requires high-quality climate information with higher resolution. Climate projections are available at a coarser spatial resolution from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and require spatial downscaling and bias correction to drive hydrological models. We used the hybrid multiple linear regression and stochastic weather generator model (Statistical Down-Scaling Model, SDSM) to develop a location-based climate projection, equivalent to future station data, from GCMs. Meteorological data from 24 ground stations and the most accurate satellite and reanalysis products identified for the region, such as Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data were used. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of the projected climate on hydrology. Both SDSM and SWAT were calibrated and validated using the observed climate and streamflow data, respectively. Climate projection based on SDSM, in one of the large and agricultural intensive basins in Ethiopia (i.e., Awash), show high variability in precipitation but an increase in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature, which agrees with global warming. On average, the projection shows an increase in annual precipitation (>10%), Tmax (>0.4 °C), Tmin (>0.2 °C) and streamflow (>34%) in the 2020s (2011–2040), 2050s (2041–2070), and 2080s (2071–2100) under RCP2.6-RCP8.5. Although no significant trend in precipitation is found, streamflow during March–May and June–September is projected to increase throughout the 21 century by an average of more than 1.1% and 24%, respectively. However, streamflow is projected to decrease during January–February and October–November by more than 6%.

Spatial mismatches between trait and climatic conditions are commonly thought to arise from disequilibrium responses to past environmental changes. We aimed to investigate whether current trait–climate disequilibrium is likely to emerge during plant functional responses to Holocene climate warming. Location: North America. Time period: 14–0 ka. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial plants. Methods: We joined global trait data with palaeoecological time series and climate simulations on 425 sites. We estimated plant community functional composition for three leaf traits involved in resource use. We then quantified disequilibrium in plant trait temporal responses to climate change during two contrasted periods: a period of high climate variability (14–7 ka) and a period of low climate variability (7–0 ka). Results: Functional trait composition showed consistent deviation from climatic equilibrium during both periods. The temporal dynamics of trait composition tends to be positively correlated with climate equilibrium expectations during Holocene climate warming (14–7 ka), but not during a subsequent period of low climate variability (7–0 ka). Main conclusions: Long-term functional responses of plants to climate change showed mixed evidence for both equilibrium and disequilibrium responses. Temporal trait dynamics were closer to the expectations of spatial dynamics under high climate variability, indicating that the relevance of space-for-time substitution might be dependent, in part, on climate variability. Our results also suggest that current mismatches between trait and climatic conditions might arise because of a divergence of factors influencing trait dynamics during periods of low climate variability. These findings provide a counterpoint to the common assumption that contemporary trait–climate mismatches result from lagged responses to past climate warming. Our study also demonstrates the need for a deeper investigation of the potential influence of non-climatic factors on functional plant community dynamics. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate legacy; climate mismatch; disequilibrium dynamics; functional trait; global change; Late Quaternary; palynology; space-for-time substitution","climate variation; disequilibrium; functional response; global change; global warming; Holocene; palynology; plant community; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090067052

The annual average concentration of PM2.5 was reported 119.54 µg/m3, and for NO2 was 42.69µg/m3which is higher than the prescribed CPCB limits. The concentration of gaseous pollutant (SO2) is found to be within the permissible range of 50µg/m3 at the industrial site as concentration of sulphur dioxide was 13.34 µg/m3. Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) of 6 plant species which was pick out from both experimental as well as control site was calculated to determine their biochemical parameters viz. Total chlorophyll content, leaf extract pH, ascorbic acid and RWC (relative water content). According to APTI Ficus religiosa and Azadirachta indica were tolerant species as their APTI was greater than 17 and P. pinnata be the sensitive species reporting APTI lower than 11. In Pearson correlation of biochemical parameter, it shows that Ascorbic acid (R2 = 0.9763) shows significance correlation with APTI. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Ambient Air Quality; APTI; Ascorbic Acid; Pearson Correlation; Relative water content",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097148314

This nexus plays an important role in the areas where women’s participation in agriculture is high, and the contribution of the agricultural sector to total emission is significant. This study generates evidence on women’s labor contribution in rice cultivation and potential reduction of their labor drudgery, including GHG mitigation co-benefits with the adoption of direct seeding and machine transplanting technologies. Using a large number of plot-level data (11,987 data points) from the rice-growing regions of India, the study shows that changing rice production technology from conventional to direct-seeded rice (DSR) and/or machine-transplanted rice (MTR) offers huge potential to reduce women’s labor in rice planting (745 million labor-days for DSR and 610 million labor-days for MTR) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission (34 MtCO2e for DSR and 7 MtCO2e for MTR) at the same time. This potential differs from the agro-ecological region, the level of input use, and women’s involvement in rice cultivation. The realization of this gender-responsive GHG mitigation strategy depends on the adoption of these technologies, which rely on several social, economic, and political factors. At the same time, the immense potential for negative implications for some specific groups should not be ignored, but focused on addressing and mitigating those challenges. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Co-benefits; Gender-responsive mitigation; India; Rice cultivation","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Agricultural sector; Agro-ecological regions; Emissions reduction; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Political factors; Potential reduction; Rice cultivation; Cultivation; agricultural emission; agricultural technology; carbon dioxide; climate change; cultivation; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; participatory approach; rice; seeding; strategic approach; womens status; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096374660

The 1950-1975 increase in North American sulphate aerosols is found to have regional and remote impact. Over central U.S. and northern Mexico, the strengthening and westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High and subsequent intensification of the low-level easterlies, along with local aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds, cause a cooling trend and enhance precipitation. The interaction between the enhanced moisture transport across the Gulf of Mexico and the elevated topography of central Mexico favours positive rainfall on the Atlantic side while suppressing it on the Pacific side. These continental anomalies are embedded in a hemispheric-wide upper-tropospheric teleconnection pattern over the mid-latitudes, extending from the Pacific to the Atlantic basin. Details of the underlying mechanisms - in particular the prominent role of dynamical adjustments - are provided. With SO2 emissions considerably reduced in the U.S., and the expectation of a continued global decline throughout the 21st century, this study sheds light upon possible ongoing and future regional climate responses to changes in anthropogenic forcing. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, state-of-the-art global and regional climate model simulations yield a broad inter-model range of intensity, duration and frequency of these extremes. Here, we present a modeling experiment using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to determine the influence of the land surface model (LSM) component on uncertainties associated with extreme events. First, we analyze land-atmosphere interactions within four simulations performed by the WRF model from 1980 to 2012 over North America, using three different LSMs. Results show LSMdependent differences at regional scales in the frequency of occurrence of events when surface conditions are altered by atmospheric forcing or land processes. The inter-model range of extreme statistics across the WRF simulations is large, particularly for indices related to the intensity and duration of temperature and precipitation extremes. Our results show that the WRF simulation of the climatology of heat extremes can be 5 °C warmer and 6 d longer depending on the employed LSM component, and similarly for cold extremes and heavy precipitation events. Areas showing large uncertainty in WRF-simulated extreme events are also identified in a model ensemble from three different regional climate model (RCM) simulations participating in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project, revealing the implications of these results for other model ensembles. Thus, studies based on multi-model ensembles and reanalyses should include a variety of LSM configurations to account for the uncertainty arising from this model component or to test the performance of the selected LSM component before running the whole simulation. This study illustrates the importance of the LSM choice in climate simulations, supporting the development of new modeling studies using different LSM components to understand inter-model differences in simulating extreme temperature and precipitation events, which in turn will help to reduce uncertainties in climate model projections. © Author(s) 2020.",,"climate modeling; climatology; extreme event; land surface; model; precipitation (climatology); simulation; temperature effect; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096023099

Moreover, the next European normative (EU VII) will impose a decrease of 50% for NOx and particulate matter emissions with respect to the current EUVI normative. Meeting these requirements pose a significant challenge to truck and bus manufacturers. Several proposals appeared in the last few years as improve the cabin aerodynamics, decrease the friction losses and improve the powertrain efficiency. The last point involves improving the current combustion systems as well as the transmission and energy management. This work proposes to couple two potential technologies to reduce at the same time the global (CO2) and local pollution (NOx and soot). For this, two truck platforms representative of medium-duty applications (18 ton and 25 ton) are tested using the reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode with diesel and gasoline as fuels. In addition, the trucks are electrified to full hybrid technology in a parallel pre-transmission (P2) architecture. A 0D vehicle numerical model is used to evaluate the trucks under four different driving cycles representative of homologation and real driving conditions. The numerical model is validated against on road measurements. The RCCI combustion is modeled by means of a map-based approach with 54 points measured in steady-state conditions. This work presents a complete engine map calibration with measurements up to 350 hp using two combustion modes inside the map (so-called dual-mode dual-fuel). As a baseline, the commercial diesel no-hybrid trucks and the dual-fuel no-hybrid trucks are used. The results show the potential of the dual-mode dual-fuel combustion to achieve ultra-low NOx and soot emissions. In addition, the CO2 target reduction is achieved for several truck platforms and driving conditions due to the hybridization of the driveline. The cycles with large phases of urban driving are the most favorable due to the ability of recovering energy by means of the regenerative braking system and the possibility to avoid large idling phases with respect to the no-hybrid versions. In addition, the decrease of the payload improves the CO2 reduction with respect to the baseline cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Driving cycles; Emissions regulations; Hybrid powertrain; RCCI","Automobile manufacture; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Fuels; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical models; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; Soot; Transmissions; Trucks; Compression ignition; Dual fuel combustion; European Commission; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Particulate matter emissions; Potential technologies; Regenerative braking systems; Steady-state condition; Commercial vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089527696

The diffusion coefficients of quinine in supercritical CO2 are measured using the Taylor dispersion technique when quinine is pre-dissolved in ethanol. First, the diffusion coefficients of pure ethanol in the supercritical state of CO2 were investigated in order to get a basis for seeing a relative change in the diffusion coefficient with the addition of quinine. We report measurements of the diffusion coefficients of ethanol in scCO2 in the temperature range from 304.3 to 343 K and pressures of 9.5, 10 and 12 MPa. Next, the diffusion coefficients of different amounts of quinine dissolved in ethanol and injected into supercritical CO2 were measured in the same range of temperatures at p = 12 Mpa. At the pressure p = 9.5 MPa, which is close to the critical pressure, the diffusion coefficients were measured at the temperature, T = 343 K, far from the critical value. It was found that the diffusion coefficients are significantly dependent on the amount of quinine in a small range of its content, less than 0.1%. It is quite likely that this behavior is associated with a change in the spatial structure, that is, the formation of clusters or compounds, and a subsequent increase in the molecular weight of the diffusive substance.","diffusion coefficients; ethanol cosolvent; quinine; supercritical CO2; Taylor dispersion","alcohol; carbon dioxide; quinine; solvent; chemistry; diffusion; pressure; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Diffusion; Ethanol; Pressure; Quinine; Solvents; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096457178

It is home to more than 113 million people and features unique geographical and climatic characteristics. Typhoons that pass through often result in heavy rainfall, which causes flooding. The region’s risk of typhoon and flood disasters, and the resulting indirect economic impacts, have not been fully assessed. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method for assessing the spatial and temporal cumulative risk of typhoon-induced flood disasters, and the resulting indirect economic impacts, in order to deal with the uncertainty of disasters. We combined an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and spatial analysis using a geographic information system (GIS) to produce a comprehensive weighted-risk assessment from three different aspects of disaster, vulnerability, and resilience, with 11 indicators. A new method for computing risk based on spatial and temporal cumulative patterns of typhoon-induced flood disasters was introduced. We incorporated those direct impacts into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate indirect economic losses in alternative scenarios according to different risk levels. We found that the risk in the coastal area is significantly higher than that in the northern mountainous area. The coastal areas of western Guangdong, Pearl River Delta, and Chaoshan Plain face the greatest risk. Our results indicate that typhoon and flood disasters have negative effects on the real GDP, residents’ income, consumption, and several other macroeconomic indicators. We found differing disaster impacts across industrial sectors, including changes in the output, prices, and flow of labor among industries. Our estimates provide scientific support for environmental planning, spatial planning, and disaster-risk management in this important region. They are also of reference value for the development of disaster management strategies in similar climatic regions around the world. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of soybeans crude extract induced calcium carbonate precipitation (SICP) on reducing wind erosion risk of sandy soil. Field tests were carried out in Ulan Buh Desert, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. Results showed that the SICP method could significantly enhance the surface strength and wind erosion resistance of the topsoil. The optimal cementation solution (urea-CaCl2) concentration and spraying volume, according to experiments conducted on sandy land, were 0.2 mol/L and 4 L/m2, respectively. Under this condition, the CaCO3 content was approximately 0.45%, the surface strength of sandy soil could reach 306.2 kPa, and the depth of wind erosion was approximately zero, after 30 d completion of SICP treatment. Soil surface strength declined with the increase of time, and long-term sand fixation effects of SICP treatment varied depending on topography. Whereas wind erosion in the top area of the windward slope was remarkable, sandy soils on the bottom area of the windward slope still maintained a relatively high level of surface strength and a low degree of wind erosion 12 month after SICP treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) confirmed the precipitation of CaCO3 and its bridge effect. These findings suggested that the SICP method is a promising candidate to protect sandy soil from wind erosion in desert areas. © 2020, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","biocementation; erosion controll; field tests; sandy soil; soybeans crude extract induced calcium carbonate precipitation (SICP)","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonate minerals; Erosion; Precipitation (chemical); Sand; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; Storms; Topography; Urea; Arid and semi-arid areas; Bridge effects; Carbonate precipitation; Energy dispersive x-ray; Land desertification; Sand fixation; Soil surfaces; Surface strengths; Soil conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097984176

For gravity sewers, enhancing ventilation is a practical method that reduces the production of both sulfide and methane. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a new method, Upstream Natural Pulsed Ventilation (UNPV), to control sulfide and methane production in gravity sewers. Two lab-scale reactors simulating the gravity sewer pipe with and without ventilation were set up to assess the effectiveness. The results show that compared with the gravity sewer pipe without ventilation, under the UNPV condition, the total sulfide concentration reduced by 39.08% and 58.74%, and the methane concentration reduced by 42.29% and 35.70% in the upstream and downstream sewer pipe, respectively. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that the UNPV method could inhibit the proliferation of sulfate-reducing bacteria and stimulate the proliferation of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria within the whole sewer pipe. The composition of methanogenic archaea that are responsible for methane production was changed by ventilation.

However, the question about the transferability of a mitigation method from a specific city to another remains largely unanswered. This study compares common UHI mitigation strategies (including green roofs, cool roofs, and changing urban building structure) for two Chinese megacities suffered from summer heat stress: Xi’an with a semi-humid climate and Wuhan with a humid climate, through the use of the urbanized-high-resolution land data assimilation system (u-HRLDAS) modeling tool and remote-sensing data. The results reveal that (1) all UHI mitigation strategies work more efficiently for Xi’an than that for Wuhan, particularly for the strategy of modifying urban fraction and associated green roof fraction; (2) the difference in cooling efficacy between the two cities is insignificant during relatively cool periods. Under hot weather conditions, the best choice of UHI mitigation strategy depends on urban land use categories in Xi’an; and (3) the differences in UHI mitigation efficacy are likely caused by the differing regional climate. This study highlights the need to better understand the transferability of UHI mitigation strategies in different climate zones. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"comparative study; data assimilation; efficiency measurement; heat island; megacity; public health; regional climate; remote sensing; urban planning; urbanization; China; Hubei; Shaanxi; Wuhan; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091727052

This article quantifies and compares the sensitivity of dual-channel inversion of the two-stream (2S) and - models and proposes a new inversion approach for simultaneous retrievals of SM, VOD, and vegetation-scattering albedo from a single satellite overpass. In particular, the inversion algorithm incorporates the information of the nearby spatial observations, assuming that the values of VOD and remain locally invariant, and constrains its solutions to high-resolution a priori physical/climatological knowledge of the retrieval variables. The results demonstrate that the uncertainty in the inversion of 2S model is slightly higher than the - model under noisy observations and remains homoscedastic for SM and , while grows heteroscedastically for higher VOD values due to the shape of the cost function. The results are validated using the SMAP data, the dense Mesonet SM network, the in situ measurements from the International SM Network (ISMN), and the derived VOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the state of Oklahoma in the United States. It is shown that the new approach can recover simultaneously high-resolution features of SM, VOD, and only from a single Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) overpass, where the unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of SM and VOD is reduced by 30% and 70%, respectively, when compared with an unconstrained time-windowed inversion approach. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","L-band radiometry; soil moisture (SM); Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); vegetation optical depth (VOD); vegetation-scattering albedo","Cost functions; Mean square error; Overpasses; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Microwave emission models; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multichannel algorithms; Normalized difference vegetation index; Radiative transfer model; Root mean squared errors; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Vegetation optical depth; Video on demand; algorithm; canopy reflectance; data inversion; microwave imagery; MODIS; soil moisture; spatial data; spatial distribution; vegetation cover; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088897165

A common approach to dampen the indoor temperature fluctuations and thus reduce cooling energy demand is the use of thermal mass. However, the use of lightweight structures in many cities (e.g., high-rise structures, or for earthquake protection) precludes the use of traditional forms of thermal mass. Therefore, phase change materials (PCMs) are being widely developed as thermal energy storage systems for building applications. However, challenges such as leakage of PCMs in liquid state and their low thermal conductivity, still limit their applications in buildings. In this paper, we review the potential of Form or Shape-Stabilized Phase Change Materials (SSPCMs), which are developed by incorporating the PCM into a supporting matrix to prevent leakage in liquid state whilst improving thermal conductivity. We review different methods of preparation and the resultant thermal properties and chemical stability. We find good evidence in the literature for SSPCMs to reduce PCM leakage in liquid state, dampen indoor temperature fluctuations, and potentially alleviate peak energy demand by shifting peak loads to off-peak periods. © 2020 by the authors.

Compared to other aspects of climate and energy policy evaluation, however, there are still relatively few of these co-benefits analyses. This sparsity reflects a historical disconnect between research quantifying energy and climate, and research dealing with air quality and health. The air quality co-benefits of climate, clean energy, and transportation electrification policies are typically assessed with models spanning social, physical, chemical, and biological systems. This review article summarizes studies to date and presents methods used for these interdisciplinary analyses. Studies in the peer-reviewed literature (n = 26) have evaluated carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment, and clean transportation. A number of major findings have emerged from these studies: [1] decarbonization strategies can reduce air pollution disproportionally on the most polluted days; [2] renewable energy deployment and climate policies offer the highest health and economic benefits in regions with greater reliance on coal generation; [3] monetized air quality health co-benefits can offset costs of climate policy implementation; [4] monetized co-benefits typically exceed the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewable energies; [5] Electric vehicle (EV) adoption generally improves air quality on peak pollution days, but can result in ozone dis-benefits in urban centers due to the titration of ozone with nitrogen oxides. Drawing from these published studies, we review the state of knowledge on climate co-benefits to air quality and health, identifying opportunities for policy action and further research. © Copyright © 2020 Gallagher and Holloway.","climate mitigation; electric vehicles (EV); integrated assessment modeling; interdisciplinary; renewable energy","ozone; air pollution; climate change; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; public health; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Public Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097183175

The coma is an envelope of gas that forms through the sublimation of ices from the nucleus as the comet gets closer to the Sun. In the far-ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, observations of comae have revealed the presence of atomic hydrogen and oxygen emissions. When observed over large spatial scales as seen from Earth, such emissions are dominated by resonance fluorescence pumped by solar radiation. Here, we analyse atomic emissions acquired close to the cometary nucleus by the Rosetta spacecraft and reveal their auroral nature. To identify their origin, we undertake a quantitative multi-instrument analysis of these emissions by combining coincident neutral gas, electron and far-ultraviolet observations. We establish that the atomic emissions detected from Rosetta around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at large heliocentric distances result from the dissociative excitation of cometary molecules by accelerated solar-wind electrons (and not by electrons produced from photo-ionization of cometary molecules). Like the discrete aurorae at Earth and Mars, this cometary aurora is driven by the interaction of the solar wind with the local environment.

Thus, we attempted to demonstrate phenological patterns of selected 4 alpine/sub-alpine and 4 temperate medicinal herbs based on higher medicinal value of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) using total 654 herbarium records and applied Generalized Additive Model (GAM) as non-normal and non-linear application. The GAM demonstrated an advancement in the flowering time for alpine/sub-alpine species (Arnebia benthamii, Meconopsis aculeata, Podophyllum hexandrum) and temperate species (Delphinium denudatum and Dioscorea deltoidea), while delayed flowering for Swertia cordata (p < 0.001). Combining the herbarium records, the model significantly projected advancement in flowering time (21–25 days) over the last 100 years only for alpine/sub-alpine species (p < 0.0001). However, the relationship between flowering time and warming winter temperature was predicted advancement in flowering time for alpine/sub-alpine species (6–10 days per 1 °C) and temperate species (8–11 days per 1 °C).

The fast transformations that cities are undergoing can no more be considered only a local phenomenon, since they have global implications: large agglomerations and megacities are drivers of climate change. Nevertheless, the increased tempo of transformations and technological innovation also triggers the city to regenerate its systems, opening a path for the emergence of new sustainable models. If these models succeed, their impact can be bold and effective on the reduction of global CO2 emissions and climate change, aiming to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure and sustainable cities and communities. The fast growth has overloaded Berlin's housing stock. In order for it to keep pace and relieve the real-estate market, the senate released the development plan “Berlin-2030”, which aims to create 200.000 new dwellings on the affordable housing sector by then. Cities consume 80% of the energy produced worldwide and produce approximately 85% of global emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the Energy and Climate Protection Program developed by the Senate, Berlin aims to become climate neutral by 2050. By now the city is far behind in its tempo for achieving its ambitious goals. This paper investigates a scenario for Berlin involving housing co-operatives and stakeholders from the energy sector joining efforts. It explores a system that operates with a building kit for housing developments with optimized elements for energy generation in order to increase production of new socially sustainable affordable housing and a energetic production - consumption simulation.

The conventional Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) aims to find a set of routes to reduce operational costs. However, route planning of EVs poses different challenges than that of Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV). The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (E-VRP) must take into consideration EV limitations such as short driving range, high charging time, poor charging infrastructure, and battery degradation. In this work, the E-VRP is formulated as a Prognostic Decision-Making problem. It considers customer time windows, partial midtour recharging operations, non-linear charging functions, and limited Charge Station (CS) capacities. Besides, battery State of Health (SOH) policies are included in the E-VRP to prevent early degradation of EV batteries. An optimization problem is formulated with the above considerations, when each EV has a set of costumers assigned, which is solved by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. This GA has been suitably designed to decide the order of customers to visit, when and how much to recharge, and when to begin the operation. A simulation study is conducted to test GA performance with fleets and networks of different sizes. Results show that E-VRP effectively enables operation of the fleet, satisfying all operational constraints. © 2020 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

However, in a nascent household waste management (HSWM) system, which is characterized by divergent interest groups ranging from the national government, municipalities, waste pickers and householders as providers of waste, implementing MBTs could create positive but also adverse impacts, in particular on waste pickers (WPs). Formal WPs are in cities, like Belo Horizonte (Brazil), a constituent part of the HSWM. This study builds strategies as a form of normative scenarios to assist decision-making processes to deal with WPs and implement MBTs systems. The present study includes material and energy flows, life cycle environmental impacts and social indicators characterized by the number of active WPs and capacity building. The results show that an integrated commitment of the local society can reduce landfilling by 70% and global warming emissions to a quarter. An emphasis on greenhouse gas emissions, like Belo Horizonte's promise for long-term attitude, brings a broad commitment to developing HSWM since a functioning system based on focused strategies will consequently reflect a positive action on climate. Waste pickers can fulfill the estimated vacancies at MBT plants and promote their active life or not according to the capacity building. MBT has substantial room to grow. Therefore, this growth will only happen with new thoughts on the adaptability of MBT systems focused on sufficiency to secure fair conditions for local livelihoods and targets with systemic implications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Belo Horizonte; Life cycle assessment; Material and energy flow; Normative scenario analysis; Policy orientation","Biochemical engineering; Decision making; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Decision making process; Household solid waste; Life-cycle environmental impact; Material and energy flows; Mechanical-biological treatment; National governments; Normative scenarios; Waste management systems; Waste treatment; biodegradation; capacity building; domestic waste; emission control; policy implementation; pollution policy; solid waste; targeting; waste management; article; attitude; capacity building; carbon footprint; climate; decision making; domestic waste; greenhouse effect; human; life cycle assessment; waste management; waste picker; Belo Horizonte; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087632066

The extended photoperiod increased the top dry matter of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) via the extended active photosynthesis time. However, it is possible that continuous daytime conditions caused by overnight supplemental lighting (OSL) place stress on the plant via the excess photosynthesis. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of OSL from red LEDs on the growth and photosynthetic capacities of lettuce. The combined effects of OSL and carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment were also examined to develop a way to increase lettuce production in greenhouses. Lettuce seedlings were transplanted in a glasshouse at the 3-4 true-leaf stage and grown hydroponically for 3 weeks. During the night (17:00-7:00), OSL was provided by red LEDs at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 (high) or 100 (low) µmol m-2 s-1. A constant net photosynthetic rate was maintained during OSL under both light intensities. However, the maximum photosynthetic ratio was reduced by approximately 10% in lettuce grown under OSL, especially with the high light intensity. Moreover, the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II in the dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm) tended to decrease in the lettuce grown under OSL. Conversely, under a short, continuous photoperiod with the same daily integrated PPFD, lettuce had the same photosynthesis level. This suggested that OSL induced physiological stress via excess photosynthesis. However, when we evaluated the effects of the carbon dioxide concentration during OSL on the photosynthesis of lettuce in a growth cabinet, a high carbon dioxide concentration (1,000 ppm) restored the maximum photosynthetic ratio and Fv/Fm value under OSL. The carbon dioxide enrichment reduced the photosynthetic stress on lettuce under continuous daytime conditions caused by overnight lighting. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Under climate change, wetlands plant community productivity and diversity may be affected. In previous studies of wetlands, the effects of climate change have been primarily investigated using field observations, factor-controlled experiments, and mechanism analyses. However, the ecological risks to wetland communities under potential long-term climate change on a regional scale remain uncertain. The Sanjiang Plain is the largest area of natural marsh wetlands and the national ecological functions in China. In this study, the changes in plant productivity and diversity of wetland ecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain were simulated under different climate change scenarios (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5), and the rank of spatiotemporal risk on a regional scale was estimated using a pressure–state–response model. Temperature and precipitation had average rates of increase of 0.44 °C/10a and 12.13 mm/10a, respectively, under different climate change scenarios to 2050. The fluctuation range in climatic factors was largest under the RCP8.5 scenario. On a long-term scale, compared with the base year of 2010, vegetation productivity increased significantly under the RCP2.6 scenario, remained almost constant under RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios, and decreased under the RCP8.5 scenario. In contrast to productivity, plant diversity increased under all four scenarios, but the range of increase gradually decreased with the increase in scenarios. Spatially, a fluctuation range change in precipitation was one of the important factors that caused high risks to regional wetlands. In the northwest of the Sanjiang Plain, most wetlands were assessed as high risk at level-3. In the other regions, the risks were lower with the values below level-2, and only a few places were assessed at risk level-3. In national wetland nature reserves, the northeast of the Qixing River, Xingkai Lake, and the Dongfanghong Marsh wetland area were ranked as high risk at level-3. These findings suggest that wetland protection and management should be focus on hydrological allocation and the potential ecological risks to national wetland nature reserves. However, a joint risk assessment of climate change and human activity should be conducted to provide a comprehensive reference for the protection and development of natural marsh wetlands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Ecological risk assessment; Plant diversity; Vegetation productivity; Wetlands","climate change; human activity; marsh; plant community; risk assessment; wetland; article; China; climate change; human; marsh; plant yield; precipitation; productivity; risk assessment; river; simulation; vegetation; China; climate change; ecosystem; risk assessment; wetland; China; Heilongjiang; Sanjiang Plain; Xingkai Lake; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Risk Assessment; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088891121

Energy use in buildings is a significant source of pollution in the Greater Athens Area (GAA), Greece, where over 90% of the existing building stock has been classified below energy class B. The present study focuses on the potential effects that a realistic level of building energy efficiency upgrades will have on the air quality over the GAA. Results are expected to be relevant to similar urban areas. Furthermore, the study of primary pollutants’ dispersion is applied at a 1.2 × 1.2 km spatial resolution, providing significant local (neighborhood) level information. Numerical simulations were performed using EPA’s CALPUFF modeling system with wind field input from an independent numerical weather prediction using NCAR’s Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In order to calculate emission rates from major roads, highways, shipping ports, residential heating installations, and major industrial facilities, data were taken from National and European statistics, demographics, and local topography. After validation, the modeling system was used to examine three building energy efficiency upgrade scenarios, implemented on 20% of the buildings. Ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx, CO, and PM10 were calculated and reductions of up to 9% were found for GAA maximum values but up to 18% for local values that were also close to or above the European safety thresholds. © 2020 by the authors.

Although the stimulation of solar generation in the Republic of Uzbekistan is unconditional, the task of increasing the CF is also urgent for Uzbekistan. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact on a solar plants CF by the use of two methods for increasing the solar influx on the surface of a SPP solar battery; the use of Sun tracking systems (trackers) and bifacial photovoltaic panels. Calculation of the CF was carried out for several types of photovoltaic panels in the climatic conditions of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the south of Russia by dynamic simulation using the TRNSYS code. Actinometric and climatic data were taken from the NASA POWER satellite observation database; the spatial resolution was 1° × 1° in latitude and longitude. Photovoltaic panels were described by the five-parameter model, whose parameters were determined using the manufacturers’ datasheets. It is shown that the use of vertical axis and tilt axis trackers can increase the CF in comparison with fixed panels by 6.5–6.6%, which is close to the effect of biaxial trackers (up to 7.0% of CF growth). It was found that the use of bifacial panels was most effective together with tilt axis trackers (the increase of CF is up to 4.1%). This effect is less for fixed panels and other types of trackers (up to 3.6%). According to the simulations, the magnitude of surface albedo (without the use of special reflectors) has almost no effect on the usage of bifacial panels. © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.","bifacial photovoltaic panel; capacity factor; photovoltaic power plant; Sun tracking system; tracker","Investments; NASA; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Thermoelectricity; Capacity factors; Climatic conditions; Five-parameter model; Photovoltaic panels; Russian federation; Satellite observations; Spatial resolution; Sun tracking systems; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105504417

Cabo Verde does not have regulations for traffic emission control or air quality guidelines, although the number of road vehicles has grown steadily over the past decade. Moreover, studies focusing on the impact of road transport on air quality in this archipelago are sparse. In this study, we present a first detailed air pollutant inventory of road traffic emissions through a bottom-up methodology, along with snapshots of the state of air quality on the islands of Santiago, São Vicente, and Sal. For the year 2017, emission estimates for the main island (Santiago) are 654 tons of CO, 35 tons of PM10, 562 tons of NOx, and 84 tons of NMVOCs. The air quality assessment was carried out using the TAPM model for a period of 6 months from January to July 2017. The results showed that the mean concentration values for Sao Vicente, Sal, and Santiago Islands ranged between 2.0 and 18 μg m−3 for NO2 and 3.8 and 5.6 μg m−3 for PM10. NO2 concentrations show an increasing trend from January to July in Santiago and Sal, and no clear trend in São Vicente Island. The simulated PM10 concentrations showed values in the same range over the year, even though they appeared slightly higher in July than in January. It was observed that both NO2 and PM10 average concentrations have been consistently above healthful levels, according to air quality guidelines fixed by the WHO. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air quality; Cabo Verde; Emission inventory; Road traffic","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Air quality assessment; Average concentration; Mean concentrations; PM10 concentration; Quality degradation; Quality guidelines; Road traffic emissions; Scientific community; Air quality; ammonia; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; emission inventory; road traffic; traffic emission; air pollutant; air quality; Article; Cape Verde; controlled study; particulate matter 10; seasonal variation; traffic and transport; traffic pollution; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cabo Verde; Environmental Monitoring; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093917238

While passive warming techniques are widely used to elevate temperature in low stature plant communities, active warming has been applied less frequently due to the associated resource requirements. In forest ecosystems, however, active warming is crucial to simulate projected air temperature rises of 3–5 K, especially at the warm (i.e., southern and low elevation) range edges of tree species. Moreover, the warming treatment should be applied to the complete height of the experimental plants, e.g., regenerating trees in the understory. Here, we combined open top chambers (OTCs) with active heat sources, an electric heater (OTC-EH) and warming cables (OTC-WC), and tested the effectiveness of these set-ups to maintain constant temperature differences compared to ambient temperature across 18 m2 plots. This chamber size is needed to grow tree saplings in mixture in forest gaps for 3 to 10 years. With passive warming only, an average temperature increase of approx. 0.4 K as compared to ambient conditions was achieved depending on time of the day and weather conditions. In the actively warmed chambers, average warming exceeded ambient temperatures by 2.5 to 2.8 K and was less variable over time. However, active warming also reduced air humidity by about 15%. These results underline the need to complement passive warming with active warming in order to achieve constant temperature differences appropriate for climate change simulations under all weather conditions in large OTCs. Since we observed considerable horizontal and vertical temperature variation within OTCs with temperature differences of up to 16.9 K, it is essential to measure and report within-plot temperature distribution as well as temporal temperature variation. If temperature distributions within large OTCs are well characterized, they may be incorporated in the experimental design helping to identify non-linear or threshold responses to warming. © Copyright © 2020 Frei, Schnell, Vitasse, Wohlgemuth and Moser.","air temperature; electric heater (EH); phenology; relative humidity; spatial temperature distribution; warming cables",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097237249

This limits their applicability given their high sensitivity to outdoor conditions and the duration required to obtain accurate results. To overcome these limitations, the present paper introduces an in situ method for the assessment of building wall thermal resistance. It is based on rapid active measurements: indoor air is heated for several hours. In addition, unlike common active methods based only on temperatures, the proposed method is based on measurements of a heat flux and one or several temperatures. Two approaches are implemented and compared to estimate wall thermal characteristics from measurements. In the first approach, inverse technique are used based on “white-box” models derived from the heat equation. The best direct model to choose depends on the type of wall tested and weather conditions. In the second approach, ARX “black-box” models are used. The proposed methods were thoroughly tested on a full-size load-bearing wall equipped with a classical internal insulation system commonly found in french buildings. The wall was built inside a climate chamber in order to assess the robustness of the methods to various outdoor conditions. The results demonstrated that, for type of wall, both approaches lead to accurate and repeatable results if the external temperature remains roughly constant. With varying external conditions, white-box models remained accurate while ARX “black-box” models did not. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ARX; Building wall; in situ; Inverse methods; Measurements; Thermal resistance","Heat flux; Inverse problems; External conditions; External temperature; In-situ measurement; Internal insulation; Inverse techniques; Load bearing walls; Repeatable results; Thermal characteristics; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090053168

Knowledge of the diurnal fluctuations in N2O flux has been used to choose a sampling time that maximizes the accuracy of N2O flux estimates, thereby reducing the sampling frequency required, but results from previous studies are inconsistent. We analyzed N2O soil emissions measured quasi-continuously over 3 yr in a highly fertilized (&gt;200 kg N ha−1) corn (Zea mays L.) system grown in southern Wisconsin. This is the first study of temporal variability in N2O flux that includes multiple difficult to measure peak emission events (“hot moments”) and estimates the relative contribution of hot moments to cumulative emissions. The relationship between the observed hourly average flux and the mean daily flux was assessed via linear regression of all measured data (≈22,000 fluxes) and data subsets grouped by magnitude. Diurnal variation in flux was closely associated with normalized flux size. During low-emission periods, fluxes exhibited a diurnal pattern, where N2O flux measured at particular times of day, named “Preferred Measuring Times” (PMTs), were not significantly different from the mean daily flux. During high-emission periods, N2O flux did not exhibit a diurnal pattern and there was no PMT. High-emission periods included difficult to measure hot moments that did not exhibit a PMT and contributed up to 50% of the cumulative emissions; therefore, flux measurements with high temporal resolution were required to estimate cumulative emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

It is therefore important to address the influence of methodological choices related to materials on LCA results. This paper focuses on scenarios for the maintenance and replacement of building elements. Methods: A literature review is carried out to summarize the state of the art regarding scenarios for maintenance and replacement in building LCA, their influence on LCA results and related methodological issues. Additionally, a case study is carried out to investigate whether assumptions about service lives in LCA could significantly influence the recommended design for a building's roof, using a Monte Carlo analysis considering service lives as stochastic variables. Results: The literature review reveals a broad range of impacts from maintenance and replacement in case studies. There is therefore no consensus about the relative impact of these processes. These differences can be partly explained by differences in scope (e.g. what elements are considered to be replaced and what kinds of processes are included), in methods for service life estimation and in future scenarios for the production and recycling of materials. Relative impacts from maintenance and replacement seem to be highest for energy efficient buildings with a long service life, and for elements such as carpets, paint, insulation, doors and windows. The case study of roofing materials exemplifies a case where assumptions about service lives could influence design decisions. Both the ranking of alternatives and the relative significance of maintenance and replacement processes depend on assumptions about service lives. An asphalt roof cover is preferred when considering only initial installation, but a clay tile roof cover is preferred over asphalt in roughly two thirds of the cases when considering maintenance and replacement. Metal roofs almost always had a poorer environmental performance under the assumptions considered. Conclusions: Results from the case study are compared with previous studies of maintenance and replacement processes, and methodological issues deserving further consideration are highlighted. In particular, the case study is used to discuss the issue of whether a modelling based on independent service lives for various building elements accurately reflects industrial practices. Moreover, the relevance of including maintenance and replacement in regulations and climate declarations for buildings is discussed.

To halt this trend, several international agreements have been made, and various biodiversity metrics have been developed to evaluate whether the targets of these agreements are being met. The process of developing good indicators is not trivial. Indicators should be able to synthesize and communicate our current knowledge, but they also need to meet both scientific and practical criteria. Since it would not be practical to monitor all species, indicators are mainly built on the monitoring of some well-known taxa, such as birds. Here we systematically review the wide spectrum of bird biodiversity indicators (hereafter indicators) available to: i) evaluate recent methodological advances; ii) identify current knowledge gaps jeopardizing indicator interpretation and use in guiding decision-making; and iii) examine challenges in their applicability across different spatial and temporal contexts. We pay particular attention to indicator characteristics such as site and species selection, spatial, seasonal and habitat coverage, and statistical issues in developing indicators and tools to tackle them, to provide specific recommendations for the future construction of indicators. Several methodological advances have recently been made to enhance the process of indicator development, including multiple ways to select sites and species to increase their robustness. However, we found that there are strong spatial, seasonal and habitat biases among the selected indicators. Most of them are from Europe, using mainly census data from the breeding season and typically covering farmland and forest habitats. The major challenges that we detected in their applicability were related to the modelling of the statistical uncertainty associated to the indicator. We recommend the use of quantitative methods in site and species selection procedures whenever possible. Current indicators should be expanded to areas outside Europe and to less studied habitats and should not neglect monitoring work outside the breeding season. Time-series analyses studying temporal trends and using multi-species data should in general account for temporal autocorrelation as well as for phylogenetic correlation. Multi-species hierarchical models are a good alternative for analysing and constructing indicators, but they need to include annual random effects allowing for unexplained annual variation in the average status of the community, i.e. the indicator target. Despite methodological and context-specific differences in the indicators reviewed, most of them seem to highlight the urgent need of devising strategic climate and conservation policies to improve the status and trends of biodiversity. © 2020 The Author(s)","Biodiversity targets; Birds; Environmental monitoring; Multi-species indicators; Site and species selection methodology; Uncertainty measures","Birds; Decision making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Hierarchical systems; Population statistics; Random processes; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Biodiversity indicators; Conservation policy; Ecosystem changes; Hierarchical model; Indicator development; Quantitative method; State-of-the art reviews; Statistical uncertainty; Biodiversity; biodiversity; bioindicator; biomonitoring; bird; breeding season; decision making; ecosystem management; literature review; phylogenetics; Europe; Aves",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088918097

The latter is mostly used to produce alcoholic beverages as well as low carbon biofuel. Despite well-established production chains, their respective residues and by-products present unexploited potentials for further product portfolio diversification. These fully or partially untapped product streams are a) sugarcane trash or straw that usually remain on the fields after mechanized harvest, b) ashes derived from bagasse combustion in cogeneration plants, c) filter cake from clarification of the sugarcane juice, d) vinasse which is the liquid residue after distillation of ethanol, and e) biogenic CO2 emitted during bagasse combustion and ethanol fermentation. The development of innovative cascading processes using these residual biomass fractions could significantly reduce final disposal costs, improve the energy output, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the product portfolio of sugarcane mills. This study reviews not only the state-of-the-art sugarcane biorefinery concepts, but also proposes innovative ways for further valorizing residual biomass. This study is therefore structured in four main areas, namely: i) Cascading use of organic residues for carboxylates, bioplastic, and bio-fertilizer production, ii) recovery of unexploited organic residues via anaerobic digestion to produce biogas, iii) valorization of biogenic CO2 sources, and iv) recovery of silicon from bagasse ashes. © Copyright © 2020 Formann, Hahn, Janke, Stinner, Sträuber, Logroño and Nikolausz.","anaerobic digestion; anaerobic fermentation; biogenic silicon; carbon capture and utilization (CCU); carboxylates; methane production; power-to-x; sugarcane","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Alcoholic beverages; Anaerobic digestion; Bagasse; Carbon dioxide; Carboxylation; Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Distillation; Ethanol; Fertilizers; Financial markets; Fruit juices; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Tropics; Agricultural commodities; Bagasse combustion; Biorefinery concept; Ethanol fermentation; Ethanol production; Product portfolios; Subtropical regions; Sugarcane residues; Sugar industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097579383

Instead, emphases on climate apathy and climate skepticism overrepresent privileged sensibilities, marginalizing those who fall outside of what Black feminist theorist Audre Lorde calls “the mythical norm” (1987). In so doing, predominant approaches obscure forms of climate engagement that do not resemble researcher identified pro-environmental behaviors. In order to illustrate relationships between social location, culture, and response to climate change, we apply the notion of environmental subjectivities in a secondary analysis of climate engagement in two communities, one of which resembles and one of which lies outside the “mythical” norm. Both members of the Karuk Tribe and urban homesteaders frame climate change as symptoms of unsustainable political-economic structures. Yet differences in the structural location of each community result in divergent understandings of and practices in relation to the changing climate. These divergent community understandings and practices cannot be explained by individual preferences or cultural differences alone. Instead, the concept of environmental subjectivities (1) calls attention to the situated knowledges of climate change that emerge in relation to differences of indigeneity, race, and class, (2) relates community environmental practices to interlocking power structures, and (3) illustrates how elite narratives obscure the role of the colonial, settler, capitalist state in the generation of climate emissions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Cultural framing; Culture; Indigenous peoples; Intersectionality; Subjectivity","Cell culture; Economics; Location; Cultural framing; Environmental practices; Indigenous people; Individual preference; Intersectionality; Pro-environmental behaviors; Structural locations; Subjectivity; Climate change; climate change; economic structure; knowledge; local participation; marginalization; perception; political system; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077713568

Today, it is not clear what the extent of these effects could be at multiple spatial scales including building sectors, cities, and climate zones. More importantly, the uncertainty of mathematical models used to estimate these effects is not well understood. This knowledge gap makes it difficult to evaluate decisions about what buildings, cities, and even technologies should be prioritized in the race to mitigate climate change. Moreover, this lack of knowledge makes it difficult for researchers to build on the limitations of past models effectively. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a novel framework for quantifying model uncertainty in the context of climate change and building energy consumption. The framework blends for the first time large sources of weather and building energy consumption data with Bayesian statistics and first-principle building energy models. The framework is used to forecast the potential effects of climate change in buildings across 96 cities in the United States for the 21st century. Based on our estimates and credible intervals, we found reasons to support the idea that commercial buildings in hot/warm and humid climates should be at the top of the agenda of climate action in the building sector of the United States. We believe that future research on uncertainty quantification should take a closer look at the local effects of extreme events rather than yearly effects of climate change on buildings. © 2020 The Authors","Building energy demand; Climate change; Enthalpy gradients; Hierarchical Bayesian linear models; United States; Wide and deep neural networks","Climate models; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Estimation; Office buildings; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian statistics; Building energy consumption; Building energy model; Commercial building; Model uncertainties; Positive and negative effect; Potential effects; Uncertainty quantifications; Climate change; action plan; Bayesian analysis; building; climate change; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; prioritization; quantitative analysis; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089350568

We used 2.5 MeV protons to emulate the particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) branch (5 MeV alphas) of the APXS. Seven polished rock slabs (igneous and sedimentary), ranging from fine- to coarse-grained, were analyzed by PIXE in their original form, then milled to powders and pressed into pellets for further analysis. The summed area (160 mm2) over 10 interrogated regions on each slab is comparable to the area interrogated on the APXS; analysis of two pellets per rock, each using a 16 mm2 region, was found to be appropriate. The mean pellet/slab concentration ratio for Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, and Fe was close to 1.0 for fine-grained samples, but changed by ±10% for the coarser cases. The variability among PIXE concentration values across the 10 rock regions increased monotonically with coarseness in the rock slabs. Comparison of overall PIXE concentrations with values measured by borate-fusion WDXRF provides further quantitative support to the direct comparison of pellet and slab PIXE concentrations. This work affirms the use of the APXS on fine-grained Martian materials but recommends larger interrogation areas (including rastering) when analyzing coarser-grained materials. It also demonstrates that the presence of relatively large mineral grains (phenocrysts) or rock/mineral fragments within fine-grained materials can contribute to greater error for specific elements associated with those phenocrysts/fragments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087302175

The goal of these maps is to make climate change relatable, tangible, and understandable. However, little research has assessed the content of these maps and the aspects of these maps which attract readers, reduce complexity, and make climate change tangible. One way to evaluate maps of climate change is through the concept of vividness, a term from the communication literature. This article examines the content and vividness of maps of climate change to answer the following: which media organizations publish these maps? What is the design and content of these maps? Did these maps convey climate change vividly? Using content analysis and multidimensional scaling (nMDS) this research showed that producers of climate change maps are often not the publishers of this same content. These maps primarily showed topics which were relevant to audiences in the United States. There was a wide variety of different cartographic designs used. And finally, maps were vivid when they employed the eight aspects of vividness presented in this paper: legend design, symbolization, layout, projections which were appropriate for the data, visual salience, visible change over time, color use which aligned with color connotations, and novel design styles. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here we provide an empirical evaluation of IPCC graph comprehension among IPCC target audience (N = 110), (political) decision-makers from climate-related (non-)governmental organizations from 54 countries, and a comparative sample of German junior diplomats, representing future international decision-makers (N = 33). We assess comprehension of current climate change risk visualizations using two IPCC graphs, one that employs principles of intuitive design, and one that violates principles of intuitive design. Results showed that (i) while a minority of IPCC target audience misinterpreted the intuitive graph, (ii) the majority of participants systematically misinterpreted the counter-intuitive graph, drawing the opposite conclusion from what was meant to be conveyed by the graph, despite (iii) having high confidence in the accuracy of their interpretation. Since misinterpretation of IPCC graphs does not allow for optimal use of the scientific information for policy-making, the results emphasize the importance of IPCC graphs that follow the principles of intuitive design. © 2020 The Author(s).

The Passive House (PH) concept has the same ambitious goal, targeting the reduction of the carbon footprint while promoting a construction design that gives primacy to the optimum energy balance, assuring comfort and quality with a minimum impact on the final building cost and operation. However, the PH concept is still not an easy process to implement in the traditional construction sector, especially in South European territory, as is the case of Portugal. Contextually, the present study through the discussion of a case study research method applied to European PH successful experience, has defined guidelines for the implementation of this concept within sustainable development principles. The methodology strategy starts with the information collection from Hanover, Brussels, and Tyrol case studies. Then, a statement regarding the current situation of Portugal in respect of the PH numbers and policies was performed. Moreover, the information gathered, as well as the experience of learnt lessons, were compared to the Portuguese reality. As a final procedure, barriers and obstacles for the Portuguese case have been identified through the analysis and understanding of the country’s social dynamics, and also with the crossing of sustainable development principles. Thus, the present research enables us to propose guidelines to increase the PH implementation in Portugal. © 2020 by the authors.

The implementation and continuous evaluation of mitigation measures requires regular independent information on emissions of the two main anthropogenic greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Our aim is to employ an observation-based method to determine regionalscale greenhouse gas emission estimates with high accuracy. We use aircraft-and ground-based in situ observations of CH4, CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and wind speed from two research flights over the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), Poland, in summer 2018. The flights were performed as a part of the Carbon Dioxide and Methane (CoMet) mission above this European CH4 emission hot-spot region. A kriging algorithm interpolates the observed concentrations between the downwind transects of the trace gas plume, and then the mass flux through this plane is calculated. Finally, statistic and systematic uncertainties are calculated from measurement uncertainties and through several sensitivity tests, respectively. For the two selected flights, the in-situ-derived annual CH4 emission estimates are 13.8±4.3 and 15.1±4.0 kg s-1, which are well within the range of emission inventories. The regional emission estimates of CO2, which were determined to be 1.21 ± 0.75 and 1.12 ± 0.38 t s-1, are in the lower range of emission inventories. CO mass balance emissions of 10.1±3.6 and 10.7±4.4 kg s-1 for the USCB are slightly higher than the emission inventory values. The CH4 emission estimate has a relative error of 26 %-31 %, the CO2 estimate of 37 %-62 %, and the CO estimate of 36 %-41 %. These errors mainly result from the uncertainty of atmospheric background mole fractions and the changing planetary boundary layer height during the morning flight. In the case of CO2, biospheric fluxes also add to the uncertainty and hamper the assessment of emission inventories. These emission estimates characterize the USCB and help to verify emission inventories and develop climate mitigation strategies. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal mining; greenhouse gas; methane; planetary atmosphere; uncertainty analysis; Upper Silesian Coal Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094628824

A better knowledge of local and regional sources of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 evolution over time and space provides policy-makers with the right awareness when acting to improve air quality. Assessing the links between air pollutant mixing ratios and wind direction data can help to identify possible sources. Using the Lagrangian METEX model, the current paper’s main motivation is to identify the impact of the Valladolid urban plume on the final CO2 and CH4 high-precision measurements recorded with a Picarro analyser at a rural station in the upper Spanish plateau (CIB station). The current paper is based on a statistical approach in which multiyear CO2 and CH4 observations are interpreted by means of different statistics and distribution functions. Higher values were detected for both CO2 and CH4 in southern sectors, showing the effect which the Valladolid plume has on final CO2 and CH4 measurements. In addition, six different distribution functions were applied to the dataset and provided satisfactory contrasts with experimental values obtained using Pearson correlation and r critical values. Results indicate that CO2 and CH4 data fitted the Gamma, the Gumbel, and the Lognormal distributions best. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air mass modelling; Back trajectories; CH4; CO2; Distribution functions; METEX model","air mass; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; coalbed methane; correlation; experimental study; measurement method; observational method; rural area; statistical analysis; Valladolid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088856063

This research compares different suburban roundabouts in terms of traffic performance, pollutant and noise emissions through an integrated empirical assessment. Field measurements were carried out with a light duty vehicle in single-lane (SL), compact two-lane (CTL) and multi-lane (ML) roundabouts using Portable Emission Measurements Systems, On-Board Diagnostic scan tool and Sound Level Meter, to measure real-world exhaust emissions, engine activity and acoustic data, respectively. Afterwards, predictive discrete choice models that correlate the probability of occurrence of speed profiles (no stop, stop once and multiple stops) with roundabout operational parameters were developed. Although SL yielded the lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) per vehicle, a high equivalent continuous A-weighted sound level (LAeq) was returned because vehicles drove at moderate speeds in the approach and low conflicting traffic was identified when compared to the other layouts. CTL was the worst option in terms of both CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The proposed methodology can be used to quantify the performance of roundabout layouts in suburban areas by simply identifying their traffic volumes, noise level, pollutant emission and representative speed profiles. This can help researchers, traffic planners or practitioners to reduce congestion and emissions, and enhance road traffic management near urban areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete models; Noise; On-road emissions; Roundabouts; Speed profiles","Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Exhaust systems (engine); Global warming; Highway planning; Nitrogen oxides; Predictive analytics; Street traffic control; Vehicles; A-weighted sound levels; Discrete choice models; Emission measurement; Environmental indicators; On board diagnostics; Operational parameters; Probability of occurrence; Road traffic management; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087980087

The UK food supply chain includes imports from other countries. Design/methodology/approach: This research develops a conceptual framework from extant literature. Secondary data obtained from ONS and FAOSTAT covering from 1990 to 2014 are analysed using Multilinear Regression (MLR) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to identify the factors relating to CO2 emissions significance, and the efficient contributions that are being made to their reduction in the UK food supply chains. Findings: The study results suggest that Transportation and Sales/Distribution are the two key factors of CO2 emissions in UK food supply chains. This is confirmed by two multivariate methods, MLR and SFA. MLR results show that transportation increases UK CO2 emissions by 10 tonnes of CO2 emissions from one tonne of fruits and vegetables imports from overseas to the UK Sales and Distribution reduces the UK CO2 emissions by 1.3 tonnes of CO2 emissions due to improved, technological operation activities in the UK. In addition, the SFA results confirm that the key factors are sufficient to predict an increase or decrease in CO2 emissions in the UK food supply chains. Research limitations/implications: This study has focused on the LCA of the UK food supply chain from limited data. Future studies should consider Sustainability Impact Assessment of the UK food supply chain, identifying the social, economic, regulatory and environmental impacts of the food supply chain using a re-defined LCA (all-inclusive assessment) tool. Practical implications: This research suggests that food supply chain professionals should improve efficiency, e.g. the use of solar energy and biogas, and also integrate low-carbon policies and practices in food supply chain operations. Furthermore, governments should encourage policies such as mobility management programmes, urban redevelopment and privatisation to enhance better transportation systems and infrastructure to continuously reduce CO2e from the food trade. Originality/value: Although logistics play a major role in CO2 emissions, all logistics CO2 emissions for other countries are not included in the ONS data. This research reveals some important insights into the UK food supply chains. Logistics and other food supply chain processes of importing countries significantly contribute to CO2 emissions which are yet to be considered in the UK food SCs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emissions; Food supply chain; Low carbon operations; Sales and distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086779512

Second, the productivity effect of market-based environmental regulation varies from the productivity level of enterprise. For example, the SO2 ETP has a significant effect on TFP only at 40–80 percent quantile of TFP, and the effect increases at first and then decreases. Third, the financing constraints and bargaining power of enterprises have significant negative moderating effects on the impact of SO2 ETP on TFP, and the moderating effects between state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises exist heterogeneity.

Deep tillage (DT) can alleviate high soil strength, influencing both the surface and subsoil carbon pools either directly or indirectly. However, field studies on the benefits of DT to SOC remain inconclusive, and comprehensive quantitative assessment has been lacking. This study used meta-analysis to assess the response of SOC storage to DT based on global data of 430 comparisons from 43 studies. In general, DT was found to significantly enhanced SOC by 7.79%. Specifically, subsoiling significantly increased SOC, augmenting it by 8.87%. Deep ploughing did not facilitate SOC sequestration to a significant extent for the whole soil profile, although it did significantly increase SOC in 20–50 cm layer. The individual response of SOC to DT was found to be highly site-specific. DT was found to bring greater benefits in soil under arid zones, which typically featured fine or medium textured soil, and relatively high background SOC (&gt; 6 g kg−1) and BD content (&gt; 1.3 g cm−3). Furthermore, agronomic practices played an essential role in constraining SOC responses to DT, where better SOC responses were observed under rotational cropping, DT/NT (no-tillage) rotational tillage, advisable DT depth difference, and moderate nitrogen application rate (200–300 kg ha−1 y−1) with prolonged experiment duration. In this regard, it is important to include site-specific environmental and agronomic conditions when identifying appropriate DT practices for enhancing SOC sequestration. The investigation into SOC storage capacity and DT technologies can provide scientific policy guidance for long-term global carbon management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep tillage; GHG mitigation; Grain yield; Soil organic carbon; Subsoiling; Sustainable agricultural management","Agronomy; Arid regions; Digital storage; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Textures; Agronomic practices; Carbon management; Carbon sequestration; Nitrogen application rates; Quantitative assessments; Soil organic carbon; Storage capacity; Sustainable agricultural; Soils",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089905727

However, the underlying mechanism of PM2.5 on cardiac function remains unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-205 (miR-205) on PM2.5-induced myocardial inflammation and cardiac dysfunction. PM2.5 increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), following by decreased cell viability and antioxidant enzymes, resulting in apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (AC16). The histopathological and ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 caused myocardial damage via interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and myocardial fiber destruction. PM2.5 enhanced the release of inflammatory factors in AC16 cells and heart tissue. Microarray analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that PM2.5-induced down-regulation of miR-205 regulated interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2), which further activated the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in vivo. Moreover, the chemical mimics of miR-205 markedly inhibited the IRAK2/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway, whereas the chemical inhibitors of miR-205 amplified PM2.5-induced activation of the IRAK2 signaling pathway in vitro. In summary, our results found that PM2.5 could trigger myocardial toxicity via miR-205 negative regulating the IRAK2/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study suggests that miR-205 could be a promising target molecule for mitigating the hazardous effects of PM2.5 on the cardiovascular system. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cardiac function; Fine particulate matter; IRAK2/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway; miR-205; myocardial toxicity","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 2; malonaldehyde; microRNA 205; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase; malonaldehyde; microRNA; MIRN205 microRNA, human; reactive oxygen metabolite; signal peptide; Tifab protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell destruction; cell infiltration; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; heart muscle injury; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; male; microarray analysis; myocarditis; nonhuman; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; urban area; air pollutant; animal; cardiac muscle; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; heart; metabolism; particulate matter; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; toxicity; ultrastructure; Air Pollutants; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart; Humans; Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Malondialdehyde; MicroRNAs; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; NF-kappa B; Particulate Matter; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090203472

This study investigates this topic using a quantified air stagnation index (ASIE) that combines stagnation intensity with fixed emission information, given that haze occurrence depends strongly on the rate of emission. ASIE has a close spatial and temporal relationship with observed PM2.5 concentrations, and a strong sensitivity to haze occurrence in NC. The annual ASIE increased by 18.2% over the period 1980–2018 due to significant decreases in planetary boundary layer height and ventilation. However, there was an apparent drop during 2013–2018, which suggests that lower stagnation intensity may take effect on the improved air quality in NC reported in recent years. Such low-frequency oscillation occurred twice during 1980–2018. Hence, if the current trend of decreasing stagnation intensity reverses, haze events may become more common in the future. In addition, the interannual variations in stagnation intensity were very significant. The percentage change of ASIE was as high as 50%–70% in some years. Finally, using the year-to-year growth ratio of ASIE, we highlight the difficulty of the “clean air challenge” due to the variations in stagnation in NC. The results suggest that the enforcement of the emission reduction plan should be tailored according to the stagnation conditions in the region and period of interest. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Haze; North China; Stagnation","Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Emission control; Emission reduction; Interannual variation; Long-term trend; Low frequency oscillations; North China; Planetary boundary layers; PM2.5 concentration; Temporal relationships; Meteorology; air quality; boundary layer; climate conditions; climate variation; emission control; haze; long-term change; air quality; article; boundary layer; China; haze; oscillation; quantitative analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089372496

Due to the decreasing amounts of habitats with increasing elevation, such shifts are likely to increase their extinction risk. Heterogeneous mountain topography, however, may reduce this risk by providing microclimatic conditions that can buffer macroclimatic warming or provide nearby refugia. As aspect strongly influences the local microclimate, we here assess whether shifts from warm south-exposed aspects to cool north-exposed aspects in response to climate change can compensate for an upward shift into cooler elevations. Location: Switzerland, Swiss Alps. Methods: We built ensemble distribution models using high-resolution climate data for two mountain-dwelling viviparous ectotherms, the Alpine salamander and the Common lizard, and projected them into various future scenarios to gain insights into distributional changes. We further compared elevation and aspect (northness) of current and predicted future locations to analyse preferences and future shifts. Results: Future ranges were consistently decreasing for the lizard, but for the salamander they were highly variable, depending on the climate scenario and threshold rule. Aspect preferences were elevation-dependent: warmer, south-exposed microclimates were clearly preferred at higher compared to lower elevations. In terms of presence and future locations, we observed both elevational upward shifts and northward shifts in aspect. Under future conditions, the shift to cooler north-exposed aspects was particularly pronounced at already warmer lower elevations. Main conclusions: For our study species, shifts in aspect and elevation are complementary strategies to mitigate climatic warming in the complex mountain topography. This complements the long-standing view of elevational upward shift being their only option to move into areas with suitable future climate. High-resolution climate data are critical in heterogeneous environments to identify microrefugia and thereby improving future impact assessments of climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

Sutami 36A, Surakarta, 57126, Indonesia","A small power plant based on biomass gasification technology is attractive to provide electricity to many remote areas without fossil fuel access because biomass is locally available and contributes to net-zero carbon emissions in the terms of a greenhouse gas component. Palm kernel shell is a potential biomass in Indonesia to provide energy needs. It is available in scattered areas that are economical for a small-scale power plant operation up to 200 kW. The gasification technology converts the shell into combustible gases, which are also known as producer gases with carbon monoxide and hydrogen as the main components for fuelling a gas generator set resulting in carbon dioxide and water in the flue gas. Although palm kernel shell considered carbon-neutral, a power plant based on biomass gasification also emits C 0 2 indirectly as a result of the fossil fuel combustion during shell generation in a palm oil mill, handling and transportation from the mill to the power plant. A power plant based on the palm kernel shell gasification system produces greenhouse gases and solid residue as char and tarry components in the producer gas. This assessment examined the global warming potential level of a 5-kW power plant based on palm kernel gasification technology using a Gate-to-Gate approach to develop system improvement scenarios. A l l carbon dioxide emissions were predicted with an openLCA database of Environmental Footprint (MID-point indicator). The mass and energy balance calculations resulted in the amount of generated char. A laboratory experiment was conducted to observe tar content in the producer gas. It was found that the power plant emits 1.69 kg C 0 2 eq/kWh, produces 0.33 kg char/kWh and the producer gas contains 2.70 x IO""4 kg tar/kWh. It is recommended that when using palm kernel gasification for electricity generation, plant managers should consider char as a solid conditioner in a palm plantation area and implement a tar removal system to minimize gas genset failure. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Tribological systems play an essential role in the development of sociotechnical systems, but have proved to be particularly complex. The development of tribological systems, as part of the overall system under development, is an interdisciplinary effort. Involvement of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, rheology, and many more scientific disciplines is essential to cope with the high number of nonlinear relationships, which often cause unpredictable system behavior. This paper contributes to the scientific field of tribology by introducing concepts of model-based systems engineering for the specific case of elastohydrodynamic lubrication states. The elastohydrodynamic lubrication state of tribological system has been chosen as example to show how system models can be used to better describe the behavior of a system by connecting several specific models. In order to gain an overview of the models used in tribological system development, a system cube was used to structure the models. The system cube enabled gaps and overlapping model zones to be identified. Finally, the role of system models in development and the benefit of using system models to solve problems that cannot be solved by a single technical discipline but only in an interdisciplinary effort are discussed. An approach to connect models and methods to describe a system in an elastohydrodynamic lubrication state is presented. © 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, accessing a three-dimensional model of the slope structure covering by the shallow loose stratum and quantifying its thickness and spatial distribution are very important in deepening one's understanding of the failure mechanism and distribution features and improving the efficiency of geohazard prevention and mitigation. This study applies high-density electrical method, microtremor survey, artificial transient surface wave method, and ground-penetrating radar to explore the slope structure covered by the loose stratum. By validating and comparing the results obtained through engineering geological drilling, an integrated system of the geophysical methods for the shallow loose covering stratum is proposed herein with greater precision and suitability for the granite region in the northwest of Zhejiang Province. This integrated system of methods consists of geophysical exploration, followed by drilling for validation. Each individual method in the system can be applied with suitability evaluation and recommended parameters. The proposed system could also properly void shortage when only an individual method is used. The major conclusions obtained in this study are as follows: (1) the accuracy of the high-density electrical method in the dry condition could reach 85% or above, and in the rainy season, the test should be conducted 48 h after the rainfall; (2) the microtremor survey and artificial transient surface wave methods can achieve good results in the case of a complex climate condition or a large-Area detection; (3) the ground-penetrating radar method can be used to discover the loose covering layer thickness with good precision (less than 5 m); and (4) the integrated method system is more applicable when the ground slope is less than 30°. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Failure (mechanical); Geological surveys; Geophysical prospecting; Granite; Ground penetrating radar systems; Infill drilling; Integrated control; Power quality; Precision engineering; Structural geology; Surface waves; Weathering; Distribution features; Geophysical exploration; Geophysical methods; Ground Penetrating Radar; High density electrical method; Suitability evaluation; Three-dimensional model; Transient surface wave; Geophysics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097140546

A thorough understanding of the responses of composition, biomass, and metabolic rate of soil microbial community to warming is crucial to predict soil carbon stocks in a future warmer climate. Therefore, we conducted a field manipulative experiment in a semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau of China to evaluate the responses of the soil microbial community to increased temperature from April 2015 to December 2017. Soil temperature was 2.0°C higher relative to the ambient when open-top chambers (OTCs) were used. Warming did not affect microbial biomass or the composition of microbial functional groups. However, warming significantly decreased microbial respiration, directly resulting from soil pH decrease driven by the comediation of aboveground biomass increase, inorganic nitrogen increase, and moisture decrease. These findings highlight that the soil microbial community structure of semiarid grasslands resisted the short-term warming by 2°C, although its metabolic rate declined. © 2020 The Authors.

We examined effects of elevated CO2 concentration on plant growth, stomatal traits, leaf gas exchange, and biochemistry of bell peppers under water stresses with environmental growth chambers controlling CO2 concentration at ambient (400 μmol mol−1) or elevated (800 μmol mol−1) CO2 level along a soil water gradient including full irrigation (75–85 % FC), mild water stress (65–75 % FC), moderate water stress (55–65 % FC), and severe water stress (45–55 % FC). We found that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration dramatically enhanced the plant biomass of bell peppers through the strong CO2 fertilization effect even under the mild and moderate water stresses. The CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth under water stress was directly confirmed by the boosted leaf photosynthesis, which can be attributed to the increased stomatal number and the larger stomatal openness as well as the more regular spatial distribution patterns of bell pepper plants grown at high CO2 concentration and water stress. As a result, the leaf-level water use efficiency was enhanced due to the stimulated leaf photosynthesis and the reduced leaf transpiration under high CO2 concentration, even for these bell pepper plants are suffering water stresses. Nevertheless, this CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth and leaf photosynthesis were generally decreased along the soil water gradients, indicating that the CO2 fertilization effect may partially be mitigated or even offset by water availability as evidenced by the little impact of high CO2 concentration on the total biomass of pepper plants under severe water stress. Our results suggest that water stress may lower the CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth of bell pepper plants, thus current ecological processes models based on the strong CO2 fertilization effect may overestimate the benefits of plants from future rising CO2 concentration, and meanwhile underestimate the potential risk of climate change on global agricultural productivity, where elevated CO2 concentration is usually accompanied by regional drought events. © 2020","Elevated CO2 concentration; Leaf photosynthesis; Plant biomass; Stomatal traits; Water stress; Water use efficiency","biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); drought; ecological modeling; soil water; water availability; water stress; water use efficiency; Capsicum; Capsicum annuum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088933256

This work aims to quantify the carbon sequestration on green roofs from 2012 to 2017 by measuring and calculating parameter on substrate organic carbon and plant organic carbon, when using waste building material substrate (WBMS) as GF substrate for the recycling of waste solid. Green roof group 2 (waste building material substrate (WBMS) as substrate) and green roof group 1 (local natural soil (LNS) as substrate), planting same three native plants (N. auriculata, L. spicata, and L. vicaryi), were both three substrate depth of 20 cm, 25 cm, and 30 cm, respectively. Results show that both innovative WBMS and LNS were a great capability of carbon sequestration and carbon storage on green roofs. Carbon storage of green roof group 1 and green roof group 2 was 65.6 kg C m−2 and 72.6 kg C m−2, respectively. Annual mean carbon sequestration of the WBMS was 1.8 times higher than LNS. The overall average carbon sequestration (12.8 kg C m−2 year−1) in green roof group 2 using WBMS was 1.1 times than corresponding in green roof group 1 (11.4 kg C m−2 year−1 using LNS). WBMS substrate and L. vicaryi could be considered as the most adaptable green roof configuration, which can be a recommendation to promote the carbon sequestration and the function of green roof for the better urban ecosystem services. Future work may focus on the GF carbon model, water interface, long-term monitoring, environmental impact, water quality and quantity, synthesized effect on GF ecosystem, low impact development (LID), management and simulation, and combination on intelligent urban system, based on LCA. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Green roof; L. vicaryi; Waste building material substrate (WBMS)","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; construction material; ecosystem service; greenspace; recycling; substrate; urban ecosystem; carbon; building material; ecosystem; environmental protection; recycling; soil; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Construction Materials; Ecosystem; Recycling; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088035807

This paper intends to provide a review of existing literature from a meteorological perspective in order to answer the question how results from urban climate studies can be linked to architectural design of future urban areas.

This sector needs a climate shift to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Local municipalities play an important role in this shift and the City of Gothenburg has therefore initiated an innovation project, Hoppet - the first fossil-free preschool. The purpose is to highlight the climate issue and inspire the industry to develop new fossil-free products and processes as well as promoting existing ones. Hoppet is an initiative leading the way towards a fossil-free society in Gothenburg City, Sweden and the world. Hoppet will be built with minimal climate impact and no fossil resources, as far as possible. This includes everything from production and transport of materials to energy used in the building. The fossil content and climate impact of traditionally built preschools have been calculated as a benchmark for Hoppet. More than 70 % of the 250 building products in a traditionally built preschool has a petroleum-based content, eg plastics. The climate impact of the building products in a traditionally built preschool was calculated to about 390 kg CO2-eq./m2 gross area. The design phase of first Hoppet preschool started in the autumn 2019 and, before materials are chosen, calculations of the actual climate impact are made. Examples of climate calculations and strategies for material selection for Hoppet are presented as well as ongoing and future work for fossil-free construction. For more than two years, the project has scouted for new innovative materials and old techniques in order to build fossil-free. Finding fossil-free and climate neutral products has been challenging. Product development and innovation are key issues for fossil-free construction, as well as communication and collaboration within the construction industry. Five important strategies for the transition into a fossil-free society have been identified; biobased building products, reused and recycled building products, minimized material usage, fossil-free construction site and a product life cycle perspective. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

For many policy makers there is a gap between recognising a long-term change and implementing short-term practical responses; therefore many countries are failing to implement changes needed for long-term adaptation. Traditional planning approaches are often closely aligned with near- term political cycles and perform poorly in terms of prioritising interventions that address multi-decadal climate impacts. We propose a novel approach that builds on adaptive planning and lessons from the business sector. The Future-Climate, Current-Policy (FCCP) Framework is based on plausible medium-term future climate scenarios, linked 'backwards' to identify short-term 'no regrets' actions. The approach was designed by a team of climate scientists and policy practitioners in East Africa and tested in national and regional fora. Initial trials of the FCCP Framework has proved it to be popular and effective as a way of linking climate science with policy. Its use shows promise as a way of initiating discussions that can enable long-term climate change information to feed effectively into the policy and planning process. © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet, aquatic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements remain scarce, particularly at high resolution and over long periods of time. Effluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from Toolik Lake, a deep glacial lake in northern Alaska, were measured for the first time with the direct eddy covariance (EC) flux technique during six ice-free lake periods (2010-2015). CO2 flux estimates from the lake (daily average efflux of 16.7 ± 5.3 mmol m-2 d-1) were in good agreement with earlier estimates from 1975-1989 using different methods. CH4 effluxes in 2010-2015 (averaging 0.13 ± 0.06 mmol m-2 d-1) showed an interannual variation that was 4.1 times greater than median diel variations, but mean fluxes were almost one order of magnitude lower than earlier estimates obtained from single water samples in 1990 and 2011-2012. The overall global warming potential (GWP) of Toolik Lake is thus governed mostly by CO2 effluxes, contributing 86-93% of the ice-free period GWP of 26-90 g CO2,eq m-2. Diel variation in fluxes was also important, with up to a 2-fold (CH4) to 4-fold (CO2) difference between the highest nighttime and lowest daytime effluxes. Within the summer ice-free period, on average, CH4 fluxes increased 2-fold during the first half of the summer, then remained almost constant, whereas CO2 effluxes remained almost constant over the entire summer, ending with a linear increase during the last 1-2 weeks of measurements. Due to the cold bottom temperatures of this 26 m deep lake, and the absence of ebullition and episodic flux events, Toolik Lake and other deep glacial lakes are likely not hot spots for greenhouse gas emissions, but they still contribute to the overall GWP of the Arctic. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Gas emissions; Glacial geology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Ice; Lakes; Methane; Bottom temperature; Carbon emissions; Eddy covariance; Flux measurements; Global warming potential; High resolution; Interannual variation; Northern Alaska; Carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; ice; methane; water; carbon dioxide; methane; Alaska; Article; controlled study; decomposition; Eddy covariance; follow up; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; ice sheet; lake; periodicity; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; surface area; time series analysis; Arctic; season; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Carbon Dioxide; Lakes; Methane; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096456566

The greatest air quality challenge in Los Angeles, some other areas of California, and some parts of China is to reduce ozone levels to meet regulations. Background ozone is a major factor which makes it more difficult to reduce urban concentrations in Los Angeles and some other locations. Air pollution from China affects the background ozone entering California. More than 50 years of history are reviewed with an emphasis on reducing concentrations of nitrogen oxides and ozone. During this time period, there has been significant progress in reducing levels of these pollutants in urban air in the United States and Europe; however, ozone concentrations in China have increased since 2013. Cost and benefit analysis has shown that benefits associated with the Clean Air Act of 1970 have greatly exceeded costs to improve air quality in the U.S. over the past 50 years. Further actions to consider to improve air quality include reducing combustion of coal and petroleum products and transitioning to renewable energy.

However, there is increased labor and financial cost related to this kind of feeding, which could be reduced if fresh forages were used in place of some of the conserved forage in the cow diet. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of including fresh mixed annual ryegrass and berseem clover into the diet of dairy cows on milk, nitrogen utilization, and methane emission. Twenty-four lactating dairy cows were split into two groups and offered either a diet similar to that usually offered to the cows (CON) or one where a mixture of fresh annual ryegrass and berseem clover was used to partially substitute the corn silage and alfalfa hay in the diet (MIX). Milk yield was recorded automatically, and methane emissions were estimated using the SF6 tracer technique. The MIX diet had lower crude protein concentration (148 vs. 170 g/kg DM) but higher DM digestibility (81.6 vs. 78.6%) than the CON diet. Compared to the cows offered the CON diet, milk yield was reduced when cows were fed the MIX diet (36.4 vs. 31.9 kg/d), but methane emissions (381 vs. 332 g/d) and nitrogen excretion were also reduced (238 vs. 180 g/d). Nitrogen use efficiency was unaffected (30.8%). In addition, milk from cows fed the MIX diet had a fatty acid profile considered to be more beneficial to human health than that of the milk from cows fed the CON diet. Increasing the protein concentration in the MIX diet, either by direct supplementation or increasing the proportion of legume in the mixed herbage, could overcome the reduction on milk and positively affect methane emission and N use efficiency. © Copyright © 2020 Enriquez-Hidalgo, Teixeira, Pinheiro Machado Filho, Hennessy, Toro-Mujica, Williams and Pereira.","dairy cattle; enteric methane; Lolium multiflorum; milk production; milk quality; mixed herbage; total mixed ration; Trifolium alexandrinum","fatty acid; lactose; methane; milk fat; milk protein; nitrogen; protein; alfalfa; animal experiment; Article; chemical composition; clover; comparative study; controlled study; dairy cattle; diet composition; digestion; female; forage; herbage; legume; milk yield; nitrogen balance; nitrogen metabolism; nitrogen urine level; nitrogen utilization; nonhuman; silage; stem elongation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097285566

Due to new developments in sensor and communication technology different business models of automated vehicles (AV) - such as private AV, car-sharing-AV, ride-sharing-AV and public transport-AV – are likely to enter the transport market. Further, different penetration rates of AVs, extension of user groups (elderly and young, people without driving licenses etc.), different cost scenarios of AV veh-kms, parking regimes/fees, etc. will have significant impact on future transport demand. The objective of the work presented in this paper was to develop a simulation-based approach to analyse the potential impacts of different vehicle automation scenarios in Austria. Method: A multitude of complex cause-effect-chains and feedback loops characterise the relationship between AV take up, travel demand and environmental effects. The method of System Dynamics (SD) is designed to deal with such complexities. As a first step the qualitative method of Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD) was used to identify all potential automation related factors influencing the attractiveness of car and public transport use. In a second step the identified factors were coded into an operational version of the Stock-Flow based land use and transport interaction model MARS (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator). As a third step sensitivity tests and scenarios were defined and simulated. Finally the resulting quantitative impacts were assessed and discussed. Results: In this paper we describe briefly how MARS was adapted to be able to simulate the effects of different AV-take up rates on the national level of Austria. Simulation results are presented for the scenario elements road capacity, remote parking, value of travel time, access for new user groups in the business models private car, car-sharing and ride-sharing and automation of the first and last mile in public transport. The results show that with a fleet share of 90% of private AVs in 2050, the nationwide changes in veh-kms travelled are between −2% (impact on road capacity) and +22 percent (new user groups in the case of AVs as private cars). Policy implications: An uncontrolled market take-up of AVs into the transport system will very likely increase the dependency on motorized transport, veh-kms driven and related emissions. Compensating policies have to be implemented in parallel to avoid un-sustainable developments. © 2020",,"automation; car use; environmental effect; land use; parking; public transport; quantitative analysis; transportation policy; travel demand; unmanned vehicle; urban transport; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089530478

The diurnal and nocturnal variations of 17 PAHs in ambient particle-bound PAHs were measured in urban Beijing (China) and Delhi (India) during the summer season using gas-chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-Q-TOF-MS). The mean concentration of particles less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) observed in Delhi was 3.6 times higher than in Beijing during the measurement period in both the daytime and night-time. In Beijing, the mean concentration of the sum of the 17 PAHs (P17 PAHs) was 8.2 ± 5.1 ng m−3 in daytime, with the highest contribution from indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (12 %), while at nighttime the total PAHs was 7.2 ± 2.0 ng m−3, with the largest contribution from benzo[b]fluoranthene (14 %). In Delhi, the mean P17 PAHs was 13.6 ± 5.9 ng m−3 in daytime and 22.7 ± 9.4 ng m−3 at night-time, with the largest contribution from indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene in both the day (17 %) and night (20 %). Elevated mean concentrations of total PAHs in Delhi observed at night were attributed to emissions from vehicles and biomass burning and to meteorological conditions leading to their accumulation from a stable and low atmospheric boundary layer. Local emission sources were typically identified as the major contributors to total measured PAHs in both cities. Major emission sources were characterized based on the contribution from each class of PAHs, with the four-, five- and six-ring PAHs accounting ∼ 95 % of the total PM2.5-bound PAHs mass in both locations. The high contribution of five-ring PAHs to total PAH concentration in summer Beijing and Delhi suggests a high contribution from petroleum combustion. In Delhi, a high contribution from six-ring PAHs was observed at night, suggesting a potential emission source from the combustion of fuel and oil in power generators, widely used in Delhi. The lifetime excess lung cancer risk (LECR) was calculated for Beijing and Delhi, with the highest estimated risk attributed to Delhi (LECR = 155 per million people), which is 2.2 times higher than the Beijing risk assessment value (LECR = 70 per million people). Finally, we have assessed the emission control policies in each city and identified those major sectors that could be subject to mitigation measures. © Author(s) 2020.

In this study, three oil-contaminated soils (industrial area, Dukhan city, and artificial soils) were utilized to examine the effect of microwave (MW) heating and UV-C irradiation on the PAHs degradation. A rapid assessment of the impact was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and multivariate analysis. The total organic matter values for the maximum PAHs reduction were evaluated based on the FTIR spectra of the contaminated soils followed with the principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the highest total organic carbon reduction was achieved for the industrial soil sample that required a high MW power and long MW exposure time. On the other hand, the Dukhan city soil sample, which has the lowest total organic carbon, required a high MW power and short MW exposure time followed by UV-C treatment for 20 min to reach the maximal FTIR transmittance reduction. The cluster analysis was also used to evaluate the impact of MW heating, and MW heating followed by UV-C irradiation on the degradation of PAHs. The PCA results of the industrial city sample showed that neither MW treatment (100% MW, 15 min exposure time) followed by UV-C treatment for 20 min nor 10 min is significantly different from the MW treatment (100% MW, 15 min exposure time). However, for the Dukhan sample, the UV-C treatment at 10 min after high MW power and long exposure time (100% MW, 15 min exposure time) was the most efficient treatment. © 2020 The Authors","Fourier transform infrared; Microwave heating; Multivariate analysis; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Soil contamination; UV-C irradiation","Cluster analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Irradiation; Microwave heating; Microwave irradiation; Multivariant analysis; Organic carbon; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Contaminated soils; Efficient treatment; Fourier transform infrared; Multi variate analysis; Oil contaminated soil; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Total Organic Carbon; Total organic matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091513318

Our approach is based on location-specific constraints rather than on pre-established, location-independent methodologies or assumptions. First, we propose that a thorough analysis of the socio-economic and technical possibilities of a location must act as the guide to optimize the deployment of renewables. This requires detailed knowledge of the area. Second, we propose that optimizing the exploitation of renewables by focusing on a particular location can also lead to successful outcomes with global impact. With this in mind we focus our attention on the Arctic region, known for its highly seasonal solar availability, and the challenge posed by increasing cruise ship tourism and corresponding air pollution. Our study targets Tromsø city, Norway, and we show that solar energy generation could be a strong contribution for charging cruise ships in the summer with no need for generation and transmission investments. Our study opens the door to shifting to a location specific paradigm to seek sustainable energy solutions with the possibility to have a global impact. © 2020 The Author(s)","Arctic tourism; Cruise ship load; Photovoltaics; Self-sufficiency; Solar availability","Economics; Investments; Location; Photovoltaic cells; Ships; Arctic regions; Energy generations; Geographic location; Location independent; Photovoltaic systems; Socio-economics; Sustainable energy solutions; Transmission investments; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091970487

Surprisingly, 9% of such contacts are arranged in such a way that the positively charged regions of the two atoms involved, i.e., Br and C, are in close contact, so the interaction geometry cannot be predicted in terms of molecular electrostatic potential maps. Remarkably, despite this like-like electrostatic configuration, the interaction energies associated with these contacts are attractive and considerably large (ca. 1 kcal/mol). Comprehensive energy decomposition analysis and natural bond orbital analysis have allowed us to unveil the physical origin of these interactions, which arise from a precise balance between steric factors (Pauli and electrostatics), dispersion, and charge transfer. These results reinforce the idea of noncovalent interactions as a more or less subtle combination of attractive and repulsive forces rather than a ""purely electrostatic"" or a ""purely orbital"" process and open the way to explore new types of interactions beyond the electron density holes model. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

In contrast with GFDL's CM4.0 development effort that focuses on ocean resolution for physical climate, ESM4.1 focuses on comprehensiveness of Earth system interactions. ESM4.1 features doubled horizontal resolution of both atmosphere (2° to 1°) and ocean (1° to 0.5°) relative to GFDL's previous-generation coupled ESM2-carbon and CM3-chemistry models. ESM4.1 brings together key representational advances in CM4.0 dynamics and physics along with those in aerosols and their precursor emissions, land ecosystem vegetation and canopy competition, and multiday fire; ocean ecological and biogeochemical interactions, comprehensive land-atmosphere-ocean cycling of CO2, dust and iron, and interactive ocean-atmosphere nitrogen cycling are described in detail across this volume of JAMES and presented here in terms of the overall coupling and resulting fidelity. ESM4.1 provides much improved fidelity in CO2 and chemistry over ESM2 and CM3, captures most of CM4.0's baseline simulations characteristics, and notably improves on CM4.0 in (1) Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water ventilation, (2) Southern Ocean aerosols, and (3) reduced spurious ocean heat uptake. ESM4.1 has reduced transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity compared to CM4.0. Fidelity concerns include (1) moderate degradation in sea surface temperature biases, (2) degradation in aerosols in some regions, and (3) strong centennial scale climate modulation by Southern Ocean convection. ©2020.

Herein, we hypothesize that chronic exposure to elevated pCO2 with increasing atmospheric CO2 (&gt;400 ppm), and extended time spent in confined, crowded indoor atmospheres (pCO2 up to 5,000 ppm) with urban lifestyles, may be an important, largely overlooked driver of change in human proteome performance. The reduced pH (downregulated from 0.1 to 0.4 units below the optimum pH) of extant humans chronically exposed to elevated CO2 is likely to lead to proteome malfunction. This malfunction is due to protein misfolding, aggregation, charge distribution, and altered interaction with other molecules (e.g., nucleic acids, metals, proteins, and drugs). Such alterations would have systemic effects that help explain the prevalence of syndromes (obesity, diabetes, respiratory diseases, osteoporosis, cancer, and neurological disorders) characteristic of the modern lifestyle. Chronic exposure to elevated CO2 poses risks to human health that are too serious to be ignored and require testing with fit-for-purpose equipment and protocols along with indoor carbon capture technologies to bring CO2 levels down to approach levels (180–280 ppm) under which the human proteome evolved. © Copyright © 2020 Duarte, Jaremko and Jaremko.","climate-change; CO2; health; human; pH","bicarbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; proteome; atmosphere; human; Atmosphere; Bicarbonates; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Humans; Proteome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096973871

To reduce air pollution concentrations, and warn the public regarding the occurrence of hazardous air pollutants, an accurate and reliable air pollutant forecasting model must be designed. However, previous studies had numerous deficiencies, such as ignoring the importance of predictive stability and poor initial parameters; these deficiencies significantly affected the air pollution prediction performance. Therefore, in this study a novel hybrid model is proposed to address these issues. Powerful data preprocessing techniques are applied to decompose the original time series into different modes from low frequency to high frequency, and a new multi-objective Harris hawks optimization algorithm is developed to tune the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model with high forecasting accuracy and stability for prediction air pollution. The optimized ELM model is then used to predict a time-series of air pollution. Finally, a scientific and robust evaluation system with several error criteria, benchmark models, and experiments conducted using twelve air pollutant concentration time series from three cities in China is designed to assess the presented hybrid forecasting model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model can achieve a more stable and higher predictive performance than other models, and its superior prediction ability may aid in developing effective plans for mitigating air pollutant emissions and preventing the health issues caused by air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutants prediction; Hybrid forecasting model; Improvement of accuracy and stability; Multi-objective Harris hawks optimization algorithm","Forecasting; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Time series; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutant emission; Air pollution predictions; Data preprocessing technique; Extreme learning machine; Hazardous air pollutants; Optimization algorithms; Pollution concentration; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089417747

An open-cathode, air-cooled proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack provides a relatively simple electric generation system for a vehicle in terms of system complexity and number of components. The temperature within a PEMFC stack is critical to its level of performance and the electrochemical efficiency. Previously created computational models to study and predict the stack temperature have been limited in their scale and the inaccurate assumption that temperature is uniform throughout. The present work details the creation of a numerical model to study the temperature distribution of an 80-cell Ballard 1020ACS stack by simulating the cooling airflow across the stack. Using computational fluid dynamics, a steady-state airflow simulation was performed using experimental data to form boundary conditions where possible. Additionally, a parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of the distance between the stack and cooling fan on stack performance. Model validation was performed against published results. The temperature distribution across the stack was identical for the central 70% of the cells, with eccentric temperatures observed at the stack extremities, while the difference between coolant and bipolar plate temperatures was approximately 10°C at the cooling channel outlets. The results of the parametric study showed that the fan-stack distance has a negligible effect on stack performance. The assumptions regarding stack temperature uniformity and measurement were challenged. Lastly, the hypothesis regarding the negligible effect of fan-stack distance on stack performance was confirmed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","airflow simulation; coolant temperature; fuel cell vehicles; PEM fuel cells; stack temperature; thermal management","Air; Cathodes; Computational efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Cooling systems; Fossil fuels; Proven reserves; Temperature distribution; Vehicles; Computational model; Electric generation systems; Emissions regulations; Number of components; Numerical investigations; Open cathode proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks; Thermal characteristics; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089392807

SE50/110 is the industrially relevant producer of acarbose, which is used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Recent studies elucidated the expression dynamics in Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 during growth. From these data, we obtained a large genomic region (ACSP50_3900 to ACSP50_3950) containing 51 genes, of which 39 are transcribed in the same manner. These co-regulated genes were found to be stronger transcribed on maltose compared with glucose as a carbon source. The transcriptional regulator MalT was identified as an activator of this maltose-regulated large genomic region (MRLGR). Since most of the genes are poorly annotated, the function of this region is farther unclear. However, comprehensive BLAST analyses indicate similarities to enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. We determined a conserved binding motif of MalT overlapping the -35 promoter region of 17 transcription start sites inside the MRLGR. The corresponding sequence motif 5′-TCATCC-5nt-GGATGA-3′ displays high similarities to reported MalT binding sites in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in which MalT is the activator of mal genes. A malT deletion and an overexpression mutant were constructed. Differential transcriptome analyses revealed an activating effect of MalT on 40 of the 51 genes. Surprisingly, no gene of the maltose metabolism is affected. In contrast to many other bacteria, MalT is not the activator of mal genes in Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. Finally, the MRLGR was found partly in other closely related bacteria of the family Micromonosporaceae. Even the conserved MalT binding site was found upstream of several genes inside of the corresponding regions. Key points: • MalT is the maltose-dependent activator of a large genomic region in ACSP50_WT. • The consensus binding motif is similar to MalT binding sites in other bacteria. • MalT is not the regulator of genes involved in maltose metabolism in ACSP50_WT. © 2020, The Author(s).","Actinoplanes; MalT; Transcriptional regulation; Transcriptomic","Binding sites; Escherichia coli; Maltose; Metabolism; Transcription; Amino acid metabolism; Co-regulated genes; Diabetes mellitus; Expression dynamics; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Transcription start site; Transcriptional regulator; Transcriptome analysis; Enzymes; glucose; maltose; transcriptome; acarbose; bacterial protein; maltose; amino acid; coliform bacterium; diabetes; gene expression; genetic analysis; genome; glucose; metabolism; mutation; Actinoplanes; amino acid metabolism; Article; binding site; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene deletion; gene overexpression; genomics; Klebsiella pneumoniae; nonhuman; operon; promoter region; transcription initiation site; transcription regulation; genetics; genomics; Micromonosporaceae; Actinoplanes; Actinoplanes sp.; Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Micromonosporaceae; Acarbose; Actinoplanes; Bacterial Proteins; Genomics; Maltose; Micromonosporaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091609222

As such, in lower-income nations where dumpsites are the leading waste disposal structures, there is an ongoing effort to upgrade to more sustainable options. In Mozambique, a semi-aerobic landfill, also known as the Fukuoka method, was selected to replace the key dumpsite located in the capital. Nevertheless, limited information is available on the prospective environmental impacts resulting from the planned upgrade. This study aims to assess the greenhouse gas emissions from Hulene dumpsite in Maputo City, Mozambique, operating under anaerobic conditions and the changes after the upgrade to a semi-aerobic landfill, employing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies. The emissions from 1980 to 2030 in the dumpsite totaled 2,455 Gg CO2-eq, which 568 Gg CO2-eq corresponds to the contribution from open-burning activities. On the other hand, emissions for the semi-aerobic landfill from 2020 to 2030 were 685 Gg CO2-eq, 40% less than the total emissions from open dumping in the same period. The findings suggest that transitioning to a semi-aerobic landfill can significantly reduce GHG emissions, improve the local environment, and protect human health. © 2020 The Author(s)","GHG emissions; Maputo-Mozambique; Open dump; Semi-aerobic landfill",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096714280

In this view, we provide fundamental insights into the gas hydrate dynamics by carefully conducting a molecular dynamics simulation in an extensive range of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (CO2/H2O from 1:5 to 1:18) and sodium chloride (NaCl) salt (from 0.0 to 18.0 wt %) concentrations. Using the F4φorder parameter and the radial distribution function, we assess the important information about the time evolution of the visualization states and the formation and growth of small (512) and large (51262and 51264) cages of hydrates along with their crystalline nature. We found that (1) CO2forms the pure S-I type of hydrate structure irrespective of guest gas and salt concentrations; (2) lower CO2gas concentration (CO2/H2O from 1:8 to 1:18) leads to fast but incomplete conversion of water to hydrate, while the higher CO2gas concentration (1:6) causes the phase separation and consequent sluggish hydrate growth; (3) 1:7 is an optimum CO2/H2O ratio for the rapid, complete, and properly ordered hydrate growth; (4) at the optimum amount of CO2and H2O, the lower range of salt concentrations (0.0-5.0 wt %) has a slight inhibition effect on the hydrate growth, while there is a notable inhibition effect for the higher salt concentrations (7.0-18.0 wt %); (5) the number of oxygen atoms of water present in the first coordination sphere remains constant for the lower salt concentrations (0.0-5.0 wt %), and they get reduced with the higher salt concentrations (7.0-18.0 wt %); (6) the inhibition effect is due to the reduction of CO2solubility in the aqueous phase in the presence of salt ions.

This paper presents a dynamic kernel partial least squares (KPLS) model incorporated with delay estimation and variable selection for outlet NOx emission and investigated control strategy for NH3 injection. First, k-nearest neighbor mutual information (KNN_MI) was used for delay estimation, and the effect of historical data lengths on KNN_MI was taken into account. Bidirectional search based on the change rate of KNN_MI (KNN_MI_CR) was used for variable selection. Delay–time difference update algorithm and feedback correction strategy were proposed. Second, the NH3 injection compensator (NIC) and the outlet NOx emission model constituted a correction controller. Then, its output and the output of the existing controller are added up to suitable NH3 injection. Finally, the KNN_MI_CR method was compared with different algorithms by benchmark dataset. The field data results showed that the KNN_MI_CR method could improve model accuracy for reconstructed samples. The final model can predict outlet NOx emissions in different operating states accurately. The control result not only meets the NOx emissions standard (50 mg/m3) but also keeps high de-NOx efficiency (80%). NH3 injection and NH3 escape are reduced by 11% and 39%. © 2020 by the authors.

Bimetallic catalysts have been extensively developed for the selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) and formate (HCOOH), while efforts to understand the change in structure and composition under reaction conditions have been limited. Here, we provided experimental evidence for the local corrosion phenomenon of bimetallic Cu-Sn catalysts through the patterning of the Sn layer on Cu foil (Cu/p-Sn). The surface composition and morphology of Cu/p-Sn 3 nm catalysts spontaneously changed during the reaction in CO2-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The Sn patterns became thinner, and the Sn elements were migrated to the outside of the patterns. Consequently, the Cu/p-Sn catalysts exhibited a unique catalytic selectivity of high CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 58.1% at -1.0 VRHE, which cannot be obtained from the bulk Cu (FECO = 7.5%) and Cu/Sn catalysts without the Sn pattern (FEHCOOH = 90.6%). Moreover, the catalytic selectivity of the Cu/p-Sn catalysts shifted from CO to HCOOH as the thickness of the Sn pattern increased from 3 to 50 nm. This study sheds light on the origin of the local corrosion of bimetallic catalysts and its effect on the catalytic selectivity of CO2 reduction. © 2020 American Chemical Society","Bimetallic; Carbon dioxide reduction; Cu-Sn catalysts; Galvanic corrosion; Patterning; Selectivity","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Electrolytes; Formic acid; Localized corrosion; Metal cladding; Morphology; Potassium compounds; Reduction; Tin; Bimetallic catalysts; Carbon recycling; CO2 reduction; Experimental evidence; Faradaic efficiencies; Local corrosion; Reaction conditions; Selective production; Copper corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095992022

During this process, a mixture of hydrocarbons is heated at a high temperature and in the absence of oxygen. Because of the side reactions of polymerization and polycondensation, coke products are formed and settle on the inner walls of the coil. This decreases the technical efficiency of the hydrocarbon pyrolysis furnace during its operation, making the process unsteady. In the present research, we developed an unsteady-state mathematical model of hydrocarbon feedstock pyrolysis in order to improve the monitoring, forecasting, and optimization of this technological process. This model can calculate the rate of coke deposition along the length of the coil, considering the technological parameters and the composition of the supplied raw materials (the calculated value of coke deposition rate equals 0.01 mm/day).

The goal is to show challenges and pitfalls and how remote sensing can improve the modelling. The first approach uses 2D cadastral data and specific heat demand values from a typology. For the second approach, we derive a 3D building model from aerial imagery, use parameters from the same typology, and calculate the heat balance for each building. We compare the differences in several geometric parameters, U-values and the heat demand. Additionally, we analyse if window detection on aerial image textures and surface temperatures from aerial infrared thermography can improve the estimated window-wall ratios and U-values. The two heat demand approaches lead to different results for individual buildings. Averaging effects reduce the differences at an aggregated level.

For validation of the modeling approach, three grid versions were applied: 1 km, 2 km and 4 km. Simulated results confirmed experimental-computational values of an excess of both radionuclides in the atmosphere in 2017 in the city of Lodz.

The assistance and identification of the harmful objects are assisted by the generation of the environmental monitoring schemes in emerging technology. Air Pollution is the main problem that affects living creatures. In this paper, the research on the use of WSN in air pollution monitoring has been done. The main focus of the research has been done on the idea of the detection of air pollution and related methods that helped in the detection of air pollution. Moreover, the architecture of the wireless air pollution monitoring system has been described along with the interrelated components. Also, an energy-efficient routing protocol in the wireless air pollution monitoring system has been discussed. Additionally, the comparative analysis of heterogeneous and homogeneous protocol for improving the network lifetime of WSN has been done. However, energy efficiency is the maj or restraint of the restricted lifespan of WSN. Consequently, the main goal of the current research is to find the solution to decrease the energy consumption issue and a way to improve the network lifetime of both the protocols. © 2020 IEEE.","Energy-efficient routing protocol; Network lifetime; Wireless air pollution monitoring system","Air pollution; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Grid computing; Image segmentation; Internet protocols; Monitoring; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Air pollution monitoring; Comparative analysis; Emerging technologies; Energy efficient routing protocol; Environmental Monitoring; Interrelated components; Living creatures; Network lifetime; Pollution detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100588389

Congestion occurs not only on arterial roads but also on toll roads. The impact of this traffic jam is extraordinary. According to data from the Ministry of National Development Planning of the Republic of Indonesia, in the State capital of Indonesia alone, the value of losses due to congestion every year reaches 65 trillion. In addition, a study found the fact that congestion also increases the risk of heart failure, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. Since 2017 the Indonesian Government through the regulation of the Ministry of Public Works has required electronic payment transactions on toll roads. The media used is an electronic toll card. By using this media, the vehicle must really stop at the Automatic Toll Gate to be able to tap the electronic toll card. But the relatively long reading time often actually adds to the traffic jam. This study aims to create a system with a GPS-based mobile application to reduce the toll queue payment at the Automatic Toll Gate through simulations using Vissim software. With Vissim software, an analysis of six simulation scenarios was carried out. The simulation results show that a GPS-based mobile application has succeeded in reducing the toll payment queue. In the ideal scenario of a small vehicle queue, there is an average queue reduction of 56.43%, an average reduction of 68.99% delay, a reduction in fuel use by 22.67% and a reduction of CO2, NOx and PM10 exhaust gases respectively amounted to 46.21%, 64.39% and 63.45%. © 2020 IEEE.","Automatic toll gate; Congestion; Electronic toll card; GPS; Mobile application","Blood pressure; Diseases; Exhaust gases; Mobile computing; Queueing theory; Toll highways; Traffic congestion; Arterial roads; Coronary artery disease; Electronic payment; Heart failure; High blood pressures; Mobile applications; National development; Small vehicle; Application programs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099314305

Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest. © 2020 Dionizio et al.

In this perspective, we provide a bird's eye view on the varying energy modelling capacities of four case study countries – South Africa, China, Germany and the United States of America. We employed a simple but logical approach to compare energy modelling capacities across these four high-carbon states. We argue that, although the case study countries fare relatively well in their energy modelling capacities, there remains room for further improvements. The study suggests that for a successful climate policy informed by energy models, there is a need to establish strong and well-funded institutions to sustain energy modelling expertise. It also evinces the necessity of a good communication platform between the research institutions and policymakers. Another potent insight is the desirability of international engagements to ensure best practices in energy modelling in support of climate policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate policy; Energy modelling; Energy transition",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090052995

In order to better understand the mechanisms of biological hydrolysis (BH) pretreatment on AD, biochemical methane potential (BMP) and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) tests were utilized to compare untreated municipal combined sludge with pilot-scale BH pretreated sludge. During the BH process, there was 15%, 30%, and 33% (w/w) volatile solids (VS) reduction after BH at 42 °C (BH42) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively; under BH61 (42 °C for 36 h and 61 °C for 6 h), and there was 10% and 30% (w/w) overall VS reduction after 36-h and 42-h hydrolysis, respectively. BMP results showed that BH42-pretreated sludge had 22.6% enhancement of methane yield compared to untreated sludge, and BH61 pretreated sludge had 29.4% enhancement of methane yield. Both temperature and solids’ retention time (SRT) contributed to the enhanced AD performance within 36 h, while temperature played more important roles after 36-h BH pretreatment. CSTR tests confirmed the acceleration of anaerobic digestion by BH pretreatment, and higher enhancement was observed when SRT of anaerobic digestion was shorter than 16 days. Through a literature review of BH-related studies, the possible mechanisms were highlighted for further optimization on the scale-up systems in order to reduce carbon footprint and operating expenditure for wastewater treatment plants. © 2020 by the authors.

This facies differentiation is controlled by the fluvial regimes and their degree of sinuosity of channels. The hydraulic and hydrographic systems of the badland trilogy depend on the geodynamic setting and climate (1st order) and on the bedrock lithology and tectonics (2nd order). Allogenic heavy minerals attest to two counteracting palaeogradients which interdigitate where the badlands evolved and authigenic heavy and light minerals furnish evidence of the physical-chemical regime to be governed by alkaline meteoric solutions and oxidizing conditions driven by the climate and the parent rocks. It is the high solubility of sulfates and chlorides and the differential expandability of smectite which impacted on the development of the individual badland zones. Large 1st order synclines plunging to the W and 2nd order fold structures account for the traps and conduits of the subsurface water system. The key to the hydraulic evolution of the badland lies within the hinterland hampering surface alteration and favoring the subsurface hydrogeological system to corrode the gully zone from below. The binary genetic model of the badlands in the DDT reveals, on a local scale, a “fight for dominance” of different fluvial drainage systems at the edge of the badlands as a hydrological consequence of neotectonics while, on a regional scale, badland formation is an upstream expression of a eustatic sea level oscillation in the Caribbean Sea. A review of true, false and pseudo-badlands concludes the study and underscores the reference character of the DDT badlands among the true badland series. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Central Colombia; Climate; Geodynamics; Geomorphology-sedimentology-mineralogy; True-false-pseudo badlands","authigenesis; badlands; bedrock; climate change; geodynamics; hydrological regime; literature review; neotectonics; oscillation; sea level change; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Colombia; Magdalena Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085467305

While these co-benefits can be significant, quantifying conservation impacts has been challenging, and most projects use simple species presence to demonstrate positive biodiversity impact. Some of the same tools applied in the quantification of climate mitigation benefits have relevance and potential application to estimating co-benefits for biodiversity conservation. In western Tanzania, most chimpanzees live outside of national park boundaries, and thus face threats from human activity, including competition for suitable habitat. Through a case study of the Ntakata Mountains REDD project in western Tanzania, we demonstrate a combined application of deforestation modelling with species distribution models to assess forest conservation benefits in terms of avoided carbon emissions and improved chimpanzee habitat. The application of such tools is a novel approach that we argue permits the better design of future REDD projects for biodiversity co-benefits. This approach also enables project developers to produce the more manageable, accurate and cost-effective monitoring, reporting and verification of project impacts that are critical to verification under carbon standards. © 2020 by the authors.

The temporal and spatial analysis highlights different behavior between the value and the variability of HEIs, but also between the western and the eastern part of the basin based on RCA4 outputs. Duration indices seem to be consistently overestimated by the RCA4 model with large uncertainty and variability (e.g. consecutive wet days), whereas the absolute indices are underestimated with uncertainties more pronounced in the west of the river basin. The heavy rain days are overestimated and very heavy rain days are underestimated as known in the literature. The RCA4 fails to well represent the daily precipitation intensity in the Casamance river basin except in one station (Bignona). However, the RCA4 model frames relatively well the indices based on the percentile threshold (R95PTOT, R99PTOT) but with some fluctuations. Overall, the annual total wet days seems to be better simulated by the RCA4 model in the western part. As conclusion, the RCA4 model exhibits relatively good or poor performance in representing extreme indices depending on the locations within the river basin but also on the range periods. These results confirm the difficulties for models in extreme climate representation. © 2020 The Author(s)","Casamance river basin; Climate model evaluation; Hydro-extreme indices; Present climate analysis; Regional modeling; Senegal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095418751

There was a strong diel effect on Rsoil, which was 16% greater at noon than at 18:00 h. Rsoil had low sensitivity to soil temperature (Q10 ~ 1) regardless of the CO2 treatment. Conclusions: In this tropical managed pasture, diel variation in photosynthesis strongly affected Rsoil, suggesting that Rsoil may be more limited by substrate availability than abiotic factors such as temperature. Predicted changes in climate for the region will likely affect the C dynamics of C4-dominated tropical pastures. Although, the short-term experiment may limit the extrapolations of our findings, the highly controlled settings of the experiment highlighted the role of canopy photosynthesis on Rsoil respiration in tropical C4-pastures. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C4 grass; Elevated CO2; Soil respiration; Tropical pasture; Warming","abiotic factor; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); diel variation; dominance; experimental study; grassland; pasture; respiration; soil respiration; soil temperature; warming; Panicum maximum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091607275

Landslides usually involve the shallow pyroclastic soil layers (2-3 m thick) covering the steep slopes of the Lattari Mountains. The cultivation of trees for fruit production on the pyroclastic cover is a common practice by local farmers. Woody vegetation contributes to slope stability through the mechanical reinforcement of soil by roots. We investigated the use of Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) trees as a low-carbon landslide mitigation measure to be applied in large areas where conventional geotechnical engineering solutions would be costly and extremely invasive, in order to respond to the demand in energy and environmental geotechnics for eco-friendly approaches. The root distribution of C. sativa in terms of root volume ratio was determined from soil cores. The mechanical reinforcement of soil by tree roots was quantified based on root-soil interaction models. Slope stability was analysed by means of limit equilibrium analyses performed on an infinite slope. The safety factor calculated for a cultivated slope was higher than for a fallow slope due to the mechanical reinforcement provided by roots. Therefore, the cultivation of C. sativa is a useful mitigation measure against shallow landslides. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon; Cost engineering; Cultivation; Forestry; Fruits; Landslides; Safety factor; Slope protection; Soils; Environmental geotechnics; Limit equilibrium analysis; Mechanical reinforcement; Mitigation measures; Pyroclastic covers; Rainfall induced landslides; Root distribution; Shallow landslide; Reinforcement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097708512

The redirection/harvesting of carbon has been studied in systems which utilize suspended biomass cultures. The potential of high-rate moving bed biofilm reactors, however, has not been explored. This study sought to control the biofilm solids retention time in a high-rate moving bed biofilm reactor operated at 17 ± 4 g-bCOD m−2d−1. Biofilm solids retention time was controlled by one of two strategies (i.e., 100% and 60% effective biofilm removal) that targeted several nominal biofilm solids retention times (i.e., 8, 6, 4, and 2 days) by employing different biocarrier replacement times. The results demonstrated that the suspended solids activity could be reduced by decreasing the nominal biofilm solids retention time. Using the 60% biofilm removal strategy, the actual biofilm solids retention time with a nominal biofilm solids retention time of 2 days was 12 h. When utilizing the 100% biofilm removal strategy, an actual biofilm solids retention time of less than 3 h was achieved with a nominal biofilm solids retention time of 2 days. The control reactor, which was a conventional moving bed biofilm reactor with no biocarrier replacement, was estimated to have a biofilm solids retention time of 2 days. Overall, the biofilm removal strategies favored carbon redirection and maximized the biomass yield at 1.1 ± 0.3 g-TSS g-COD−1 removed. © 2020","Biofilm solids retention time control; Carbon redirection; High-rate moving bed biofilm reactor; Observed yield","Bioproducts; Bioreactors; Chemical oxygen demand; Organic carbon; Biomass yield; Carbon oxidation; Control reactors; Moving bed biofilm reactors; Retention time; Side streams; Solids retention time; Suspended solids; Biofilms; organic carbon; carbon; biofilm; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; organic carbon; oxidation; reaction kinetics; retention; Article; biofilm; biomass production; carbon metabolism; chemical oxygen demand; concentration (parameter); high rate moving bed biofilm reactor; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical parameters; oxidation; priority journal; retention time; solid state; suspended particulate matter; biofilm; biomass; bioreactor; sewage; Biofilms; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088369857

In order to successfully perform such a strategy, it is important that site evaluation takes into account both reservoir and caprock properties in order to trap the CO2. Many caprocks for such sites are clay-rich mudrocks, hence evaluating their seal capacity and seal integrity are critical for storage sites. Analytical studies on the impact of potential CO2-water-rock interaction are an important part of site evaluation since potential geochemical reactions may degrade the seal quality and effectiveness. This paper investigates the impact of static exposure of mudrock seals to super-critical CO2 (sCO2) at high temperature and pressure (150˚C, 29 MPa) on the mineralogy (illite-smectite, kaolinite, illite and quartz), major element geochemistry and geomechanical properties of mudrock seals over a six-month period. Mineralogy and geochemistry were determined stepwise from their preserved initial state and after 1, 4 and 6 months exposure to sCO2 in a batch reactor, with no detectable changes in any of the minerals or elements observed. This is likely due to low reactivity in silicate systems and low volume of pore fluid available to facilitate chemical reactions. Samples for geomechanical testing were exposed to sCO2 for 6 months only. Geomechanical properties changed significantly between preserved and sCO2 exposed samples tested under equivalent effective stress conditions, with sCO2 exposed samples being much stronger and stiffer than their preserved counterparts. Given that no mineralogical and geochemical changes were noted during exposure to sCO2, it is most likely that the loss of pore water during sCO2 exposure resulted in the strengthening and stiffening of these mudrocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Caprock; Geochemistry; Geological storage of CO2; Geomechanics; Mineralogy; Mudrock","Batch reactors; Geochemistry; Geomechanics; Kaolinite; Mechanical properties; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality control; Reservoirs (water); Seals; Silicates; Analytical studies; Geochemical changes; Geochemical reaction; Geological storage; Geomechanical properties; High temperature and pressure; Industrial scale; Water rock interactions; Carbon dioxide; cap rock; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon storage; geochemistry; mechanical property; mineralogy; mudstone; water-rock interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091953007

This article applies a strategic management lens to local government sustainability capabilities to examine the conditions under which local governments diversify into new areas of service delivery and when they do not. Building on recent efforts to apply resource-based theories to the public sector, the authors distinguish between more and less fungible capabilities and posit that local government officials make such commitments to enhance the competitiveness of their communities. Two surveys of U.S. cities provide evidence that governments that rely on tax incentive-based development approaches may struggle to make sustainable development gains. Such cities are more likely to devote resources disproportionately to delivering benefits to firms at the risk of incurring increasing opportunity costs over time. Prior commitments to traditional, firm-based economic development capabilities appear to inhibit their ability to pursue broader sustainability policies. However, economic development strategic planning can also positively influence some investments in greenhouse gas reduction efforts. Moreover, cities facing more competition for development are more likely to integrate planning and performance measurement to assess their sustainability commitments. © 2020 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089071021

However, little is known about how fluctuations in groundwater depth influence plant water absorption in carbonate outcrop regions. This study quantified the plant water uptake patterns and plant responses to different groundwater depths at four distinct sites. The aquifers of the boreholes CF10 (4 to 10 m groundwater level) and CF12 (2 to 9 m groundwater level) basically consisted of porous and fissure media. The aquifer of borehole CF13 (historically sustained 0 to 1 m groundwater level) was dominated by fissure and conduit media, while that of borehole CF18 (2 to 3 m groundwater level) was comprised on rocks with considerable small-sized dissolution pores and seams. Borehole water, referred to as rock water in this study, is defined as a potential water source that plants can absorb. The IsoSource model, based on the dual stable isotopes of δ D and δ18O was employed to estimate soil and rock water contributions to the plant xylem water. The results revealed that the groundwater depth of the CF10, CF12, and CF13 boreholes had significant negative correlations with the total precipitation of the previous ten days. At the CF10 site, Toona sinensis and Caesalpinia decapetala absorbed soil water during the rainy season, and rock water during the dry season. At the CF12 site, Toona sinensis primarily absorbed rock water during rainy season and soil resident moisture during the dry season, while the water utilization proportion of Caesalpinia decapetala fluctuated significantly in different seasons. At the CF13 site, rock water was the dominant water source for both plant species during the rainy and dry seasons, while soil water was the main water source for both plants in the CF18 site. The proportion of rock water absorption by plants did not directly statistically correlate with groundwater depth; however, it did with the total precipitation of the previous two and fifteen days, respectively. Nevertheless, groundwater depth is a comprehensive embodiment of precipitation and the structure of karst water-bearing media. Therefore, the plant absorption of rock water is not only contingent on groundwater depth but also on the karst water-bearing media. For the first time, the isotopic values of borehole water were employed to estimate the contributions of plant water sources to improve calculations. The above results indicated that field surveys of hydrogeological structures and high precision monitoring were equally indispensable toward facilitating the restoration of vegetation and groundwater management in fragile rocky desertified ecosystems. © 2020","Borehole; Groundwater depth; Karst water-bearing media; Limestone outcrops; Plant water uptake; Rock water","Aquifers; Boreholes; Drought; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Lime; Rocks; Soil moisture; Water management; Ground water depths; Groundwater management; Hydrogeological structures; Negative correlation; Plant absorption; Stable isotopes; Total precipitation; Water utilization; Water absorption; aquifer; borehole; groundwater; limestone; outcrop; plant water relations; precipitation (chemistry); seasonal variation; soil water; soil water potential; water depth; water-rock interaction; Caesalpinia decapetala; Toona sinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089490249

The reaction is limited by low catalytic activities, poor tolerance to a large excess of chain transfer agent, and tendency to form byproducts. Here, a series of new catalysts are reported that comprise heterodinuclear Co(III)/M(I) macrocyclic complexes (where M(I) = Group 1 metal). These catalysts show highly efficient production of PPC polyols, outstanding yields (turnover numbers), quantitative carbon dioxide uptake (>99%), and high selectivity for polyol formation (>95%). The most active, a Co(III)/K(I) complex, shows a turnover frequency of 800 h-1 at low catalyst loading (0.025 mol %, 70 °C, 30 bar CO2). The copolymerizations are well controlled and produce hydroxyl telechelic PPC with predictable molar masses and narrow dispersity (D < 1.15). The polymerization kinetics show a second order rate law, first order in both propylene oxide and catalyst concentrations, and zeroth order in CO2 pressure. An Eyring analysis, examining the effect of temperature on the propagation rate coefficient (kp), reveals the transition state barrier for polycarbonate formation: ΔG‡ = +92.6 ± 2.5 kJ mol-1. The Co(III)/K(I) catalyst is also highly active and selective in copolymerizations of other epoxides with carbon dioxide. ©",,"Alcohols; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Copolymerization; Polyols; Propylene; Catalyst concentration; Chain transfer agents; Effect of temperature; Macrocyclic complex; Poly(propylene carbonate); Polymerization kinetics; Propagation rate coefficient; Ring opening copolymerization; Cobalt compounds; carbon dioxide; propylene carbonate; propylene oxide; Article; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical structure; controlled study; cross linking; electrophilicity; high temperature; hydrodynamics; infrared spectroscopy; ligand binding; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nucleophilicity; polymerization; synthesis; temperature; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095850592

Köppen classification relates types of climate to types of vegetation, while Camargo classification seeks to map climatic types based on thermal and water factors. In Brazil, the Midwest region is a major agricultural producer but still lacks detailed climate information. In this sense, we aimed to compare Köppen and Geiger (1928) with Camargo (1991) methods for climate classification in the Midwest of Brazil. For this purpose, we used data on daily global solar radiation; mean, maximum, and minimum air temperature; relative humidity; wind speed; and precipitation from 2160 weather stations, which were obtained from the NASA/POWER platform. Components of normal climatological water balance were calculated using the Thornthwaite and Mather (1955) method, with an available water capacity of 100 mm. Köppen and Geiger (1928) system uses data on mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, coldest month mean temperature, warmest month mean temperature, and driest month precipitation. The method of Camargo (1991), modified by Maluf (2000), uses the following meteorological elements: mean annual temperature, coldest month mean temperature, annual water surplus and deficit, and water deficit months. The similarity between classification methods was verified by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and Tukey’s test at 95% reliability. The most predominant climate class according to Camargo (1991) was TR-UMi (humid tropical climate), representing 33.63% of the entire territory of the Midwest of Brazil. According to Köppen and Geiger (1928), six climate types were observed in the Midwest region, with a predominance of class Aw (tropical climate with dry winter), representing 58.50% of the entire region. While Köppen and Geiger (1928) showed a macroscale scope, Camargo (1991) classification had a mesoscale approach. The latter was more suitable for agricultural purposes, mainly because it provided information on prevailing water conditions in the region. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; climate classification; climatology; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; relative humidity; solar radiation; vegetation type; wind velocity; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090300997

However, the insufficient long-term stability of these technologies precludes their commercial deployment. The structural deterioration of the catalyst material is one possible source of device durability issues. Unfortunately, this issue has been insufficiently studied in systems using actual technical electrodes. Herein, we make use of a morphologically tailored Ag-based model nanocatalyst [Ag nanocubes (NCs)] assembled on a zero-gap GDE electrolyzer to establish correlations between catalyst structures, experimental environments, electrocatalytic performances, and morphological degradation mechanisms in highly alkaline media. The morphological evolution of the Ag-NCs on the GDEs induced by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR), as well as the direct mechanical contact between the catalyst layer and anion-exchange membrane, is analyzed by identical location and post-electrolysis scanning electron microscopy investigations. We find that at low and mild potentials positive of -1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, the Ag-NCs undergo no apparent morphological alteration induced by the CO2RR, and the device performance remains stable. At more stringent cathodic conditions, device failure commences within minutes, and catalyst corrosion leads to slightly truncated cube morphologies and the appearance of smaller Ag nanoparticles. However, comparison with complementary CO2RR experiments performed in H-cell configurations in a neutral environment clearly proves that the system failure typically encountered in the gas-fed approaches does not stem solely from the catalyst morphological degradation. Instead, the observed CO2RR performance deterioration is mainly due to the local high alkalinity that inevitably develops at high current densities in the zero-gap approach and leads to the massive precipitation of carbonates which is not observed in the aqueous environment (H-cell configuration). © 2020 American Chemical Society.","carbon monoxide; CO2electroreduction; exchange membrane electrode assembly; gas diffusion electrodes; zero-gap electrolyzer","Carbon dioxide; Corrosion; Degradation; Deterioration; Diffusion in gases; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Ion exchange membranes; Nanocatalysts; Reaction rates; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver metallography; Silver nanoparticles; Electrocatalytic performance; Electrochemical reductions; Experimental environment; Gas diffusion electrodes; Morphological alteration; Morphological evolution; Performance deterioration; Structural deterioration; Silver compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096013683

Capital cities are situated mainly around the coastline and are subjected to different meteorological conditions. This complex set of drivers is expected to result in varying trends in particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations in urban ambient air across the country. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the long-term trends in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in capital cities, and to analyse the factors that influenced such trends. The spatial variability of PM concentrations within the capital cities was first established to identify representative stations. Then trends were determined using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope, and the generalised additive model. The results show that, in general, the PM concentrations in Australian cities are relatively low (12.1–21.7 μg m−3 mean daily PM10 and 4.6–8.7 μg m−3 mean daily PM2.5) and within the WHO daily limit 95% of the time. Over the past two decades, very small declines of 8.0 × 10−5–1.1 × 10−3 μg m−3.yr−1 for PM10 and 7.7 × 10−5–2.6 × 10−3 μg m−3.yr−1 for PM2.5 were observed while some stations exhibited increase in concentration based on available data; more stations showed a significant monotonic decline for PM10 than PM2.5. This is attributed to the effectiveness of the implemented emission reduction policies particularly for vehicle exhaust and power generation, given the simultaneous increase in the demand for energy and the number of vehicles over the last two decades. Regarding climate, in the coastal cities of Sydney and Brisbane, high rainfall and strong winds aid in maintaining low PM concentrations despite the significant anthropogenic emissions, while higher PM levels in Darwin can be attributed to its tropical savannah climate, which makes it prone to bushfires and necessitates regular prescribed burnings. PM concentrations increase when exceptional events such as bushfires and dust storms are induced by the extreme climate variability. Further reduction of PM concentrations in Australian cities is unlikely, considering the expanding urbanisation and the changing climate. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Australian cities; PM10; PM2.5; Spatial variability; Temporal variability","rain; ambient air; anthropogenic source; climate change; meteorology; particulate matter; traffic emission; ambient air; Article; Australia; city; climate change; concentration (parameter); drought; dust storm; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; exhaust gas; industrial area; Northern Territory; particulate matter; prescribed burning; priority journal; Queensland; residential area; savanna; seasonal variation; Tasmania; urban area; Victoria; Western Australia; wet deposition; wildfire; wind; World Health Organization; air pollutant; air pollution; Australia; particulate matter; season; Australia; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Australia; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089389832

Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) is a method to capture the environmental consequences of the entire cause and effect chain of these disruptions but has never been adapted to transportation disruption at the city scale. This paper proposes a mathematical formalization of CLCA applied to a territorial mobility change. The method is applied to quantify the impact on climate change of the breakthrough of free-floating e-scooters (FFES) in Paris. A FFES user survey is conducted to estimate the modal shifts due to FFES. Trip substitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered – personal or shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus, streetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit system). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA. Final results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen thousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to major shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER, 22% from active modes). Recommendations are given to enhance their carbon footprint. A scenario analysis shows that increasing the lifetime mileage is insufficient to get a positive balance: reducing drastically servicing emissions is also required. A sensitivity analysis switching the French electricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change effect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon intensity, such as in Germany and China. Finally, the novelty and the limits of the method are discussed, as well as the results and the role of e-scooters, micromobility, and shared vehicles towards a sustainable mobility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Consequential LCA; Free-floating e-scooters; Modal shifts; Territorial public policies; Transportation disruptions","Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Estimation; Life cycle; Light rail transit; Motor scooters; Multimodal transportation; Rapid transit; Sensitivity analysis; Taxicabs; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Cause and effects; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Environmental consequences; Mass rapid transit systems; Metropolitan area; Scenario analysis; Sustainable mobility; Transportation disruptions; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088385481

Commodity hardware present in HDFS consumes significant energy even when not in an active state, and considering our fragile ecosystem, reduction of the carbon footprint and conservation of energy in these environments is the focus of our work. We have evolved on a dynamic approach to Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) that provides an energy efficient paradigm for Hadoop clusters by segregating the servers in the cluster to two 'Zones', a 'Hot-Zone', and a 'Cold-Zone'. We use energy efficient storage devices (SSDs), to store data that is frequently used for the hot zone. The Cold-Zone would have lesser energy efficient devices (HDDs) and would be used to store data that is not frequently used. The Hot-Zone would always be in an active state to compute while the cold zone would have the HDDs to be in a low power consumption state. We have also enhanced the block placement policy for HDFS to support dynamic block transfer among the two zones. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; HDFS; SSD and HDD","Carbon footprint; Cloud computing; Commerce; Computational efficiency; Computer software; File organization; Virtual storage; Block placement; Commodity hardware; Conservation of energy; Distributed file systems; Dynamic approaches; Energy efficient; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Low-power consumption; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114864741

In this study, we collected social data in four communities in the central Ethiopian Highlands on farmers’ climate perceptions and adaptations using group discussions and PRA tools. We related these to climate data spanning 30 years (1981 to 2010), consisting of daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation, modelled for the four communities using global databases and regional meteorological data. We found that farmers’ climate perceptions showed considerable spatial and gender differences. Perceptions matched well with records describing climate variability, particularly in terms of the shortening and the increased variability of the rainy season, as well as the occurrence of extreme drought in recent years. Climate change, described by long-term average increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation, was perceived, but with subordinate priority. Perceived climate impacts included reduced crop yield, increased occurrence of pests and diseases and increased crop damage by extreme events and poverty. Adaptations were mainly land based and included agronomic measures, land management and ecosystem restoration. Furthermore, important gender differences in adaptation could be traced back to typical gender roles. Results highlight the risk of broadcast adaptation programs, such as the government-propagated combination of mineral fertilizers and early maturing crop varieties. Most importantly, they point to the need to consider climate variability, site- and gender-specific perceptions and priorities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate data; Climate perceptions; Combination of natural and social science; Ethiopian highlands; SPEI","Crops; Ecosystems; Adaptation response; Climate variability; Ecosystem restoration; Gender differences; Maximum temperature; Meteorological data; Mineral fertilizers; Minimum temperatures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092595417

In this review, we summarize the mechanisms linking the excessive absorption of light energy in chloroplasts to programmed cell death in plant leaves.

While most of the work evaluating carbon sequestration capacity has focused on global change factors that can affect carbon release from plant litter decomposition through changes in (large-scale) environmental conditions, less is known about the possible effects of the loss (or replacement) of dominant species. We hypothesized that dominant marsh plants can influence decomposition not only through changes in litter quality but also through changes in (microscale) soil environmental conditions such as humidity, soil temperature or solar radiation. Location: We performed a field manipulative experiment in a southwestern (SW) Atlantic salt marsh in Argentina. Methods: We simulate a selective disturbance (i.e., removal of the dominant grass species Spartina densiflora) thus allowing removal plots to develop an alternative plant community. To evaluate the effect of the dominant grass species on litter decomposition, in an experiment we performed a litterbag approach three years after the establishment of the removal plots. Results: Results showed that the presence of S. densiflora significantly decreased litter decomposition directly by producing less labile litter, but also by effects that seem to be related to its structure as standing dominant vegetation. The experimental removal of S. densiflora led to an alternative plant community, formed by otherwise subordinate species, which is less densely packed, allowing higher radiation incidence on the soil and elevated midday soil temperature. Conclusions: Our results suggest that salt marsh litter decomposition, and thus C sequestration, is determined in part by the identity of the dominant plant, not only because of the quality of the produced litter but also as a consequence of the vegetation structure. Changes in species diversity, above all changes in the dominant species in these coastal systems, could have large impacts on the carbon turnover and mitigation capacity of these ecosystems. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","community structure; decomposition; dominant species; salt marshes; Spartina","carbon sequestration; decomposition; dominance; environmental conditions; global change; grass; litter; plant community; saltmarsh; soil temperature; Argentina; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Spartina; Spartina densiflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088807569

In this study, an integrated model is developed to clarify the mechanism of incomplete carbon partitioning and quantify its effects on austenite stabilization in the low-alloy medium-carbon Fe–C–Mn–Si steels. The fraction of carbon consumed by Cottrell atmospheres around dislocations is described using a semi-empiric equation. Then, the kinetic competition among carbide precipitation, carbon partitioning and austenite decomposition during the partitioning step is simulated by coupling the Deschamps–Bréchet model and quenching and partitioning-local equilibrium (QP-LE) model. It is found that transition carbide precipitation in martensite and carbon partitioning into austenite are kinetically coupled at the very early stage of the partitioning step and subsequently promotes austenite decomposition. Taking the synergy effects of incomplete carbon partitioning and austenite decomposition into account, our model is capable of predicting the evolution of volume fraction of austenite and its carbon content during partitioning. © 2020","Austenite decomposition; Cottrell atmosphere; Local equilibrium; Quenching and partitioning; Transition carbide","Carbides; Martensite; Quenching; Silicon steel; Austenite decomposition; Carbide precipitation; Carbon partitioning; Cottrell atmospheres; Experimental validations; Kinetic competitions; Quenching and partitioning; Transition carbides; Austenite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091218418

Assessments of the chronic and acute effects of particulate matter on human health tend to be based on mass concentration, with particle size and composition also thought to play a part4. Oxidative potential has been suggested to be one of the many possible drivers of the acute health effects of particulate matter, but the link remains uncertain5–8. Studies investigating the particulate-matter components that manifest an oxidative activity have yielded conflicting results7. In consequence, there is still much to be learned about the sources of particulate matter that may control the oxidative potential concentration7. Here we use field observations and air-quality modelling to quantify the major primary and secondary sources of particulate matter and of oxidative potential in Europe. We find that secondary inorganic components, crustal material and secondary biogenic organic aerosols control the mass concentration of particulate matter. By contrast, oxidative potential concentration is associated mostly with anthropogenic sources, in particular with fine-mode secondary organic aerosols largely from residential biomass burning and coarse-mode metals from vehicular non-exhaust emissions. Our results suggest that mitigation strategies aimed at reducing the mass concentrations of particulate matter alone may not reduce the oxidative potential concentration.

That have exerted huge pressure on hosting countries trying to accommodate refugees in decent shelters and in quick manner. Temporary shelters normally carry a high environmental burden due to their short lifespan, and the majority are fabricated from industrialised materials. This study assesses the carbon impact for a minus carbon experimental refugee house in Sweden using life cycle assessment (LCA) as tool. SimaPro and GaBi software were used for the calculations and the ReCiPe midpoint method for impact assessment. The results show that using local plant-based materials such as straw, reeds and wood, together with clay dug from close to the construction site, can drastically reduce the carbon footprint of temporary shelters and even attain a negative carbon impact of 226.2 kg CO2 eq/m2. Based on the results of the uncertainty importance analysis, the overall global warming potential impact without and with sequestration potential are mostly sensitive to the variability of the GWP impact of wood fibre insulation. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is designed to calculate the GWP impact of the refugee house over its entire life cycle (production, operation and maintenance and end of life). Then, the sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of input uncertainties (selection of material from the database and the method) on the total GWP impact of the refugee house with and without sequestration. The ISO standards (International Standard 14040 2006; International Standard 14044 2006) divide the LCA framework into four steps of Goal and scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation. Findings: This study has shown an example for proof of concept for a low impact refugee house prototype using straw, reeds, clay, lime and wood as the principle raw materials for building construction. Using natural materials, especially plant-based fibres, as the main construction materials, proved to achieve a minus carbon outcome over the life cycle of the building. The GWP of the shelter house without and with sequestration are found to be 254.7 kg CO2 eq/m2 and -226.2 kg CO2 eq/m2, respectively. Originality/value: As there are still very few studies concerned with the environmental impact of temporary refugee housing, this study contributes to the pool of knowledge by introducing a complete LCA calculation for a physical house prototype as a proof of concept on how using low impact raw materials for construction combined with passive solutions for heating and cooling can reach a minus carbon outcome. The GWP of the shelter house without and with sequestration are found to be 254.7 kg CO2 eq/m2 and -226.2 kg CO2 eq/m2. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","GHG; LCA; Minus carbon; Refugee housing; Urban living lab",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087652516

We use the Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS) to analyze scenarios that consider greater uptake of LDEVs in different time frames, implementation of a CO2 emission restriction policy, exclusion of fossil fuels from the power mix, and a combination of these policies. We find that carbon pricing, along with higher rates of LDEVs adoption, causes the highest emission reductions (up to 47%), albeit at higher costs. LDEVs become the preferred vehicle technology as soon as they reach cost parity with internal combustion engine vehicles in different scenarios. Greater LDEVs uptake, however, leads to increased electricity consumption (up to 3%), which is provided by fossil fuels when there is no emission restriction policy. If restrictions are placed on the expansion of fossil fuel power plants, fewer LDEVs are adopted (up to less than 26%) because there is not enough electricity to supply the demand. Given the state’s power mix in 2016 (58% provided by fossil fuels), investment in zero-carbon energy is necessary for mitigation policies in the transportation sector to be effective. © 2020 by the authors.

Once the mite pests are introduced, it is essential to understand their dynamics in important crops under open-field climatic conditions to implement strategies for their management and determine the periods when species populations may increase in the field. Modelling tools have been used to determine the potential distribution of species and implications for the management of invasive species. Thus, our aim in this study was to determine the seasonal variation in R. indica and the influence of the monthly climate using CLIMEX modelling. We adjusted the CLIMEX model for R. indica based on distribution data, additional biological characteristics, and fluctuations in the R. indica population in a commercial coconut plantation. RESULTS: The model for the current climate shows a good match between the ecoclimatic index and the global distribution of R. indica. The model results demonstrate that most states of Brazil and several regions worldwide include areas with highly suitable climatic conditions for R. indica. We observed variations in the density of R. indica in commercial coconut crops, with the highest incidence occurring during the first months of the year. CONCLUSION: Our results showed different alterations in seasonal suitability for R. indica that may provide information for the implementation of methods for time management, such as strategies for sampling and control during periods with a high degree of suitability for R. indica. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","banana; coconut; invasive species; red palm mite","fruit; global change; invasive species; mite; numerical model; sampling; seasonal variation; Brazil; Acari; Tenuipalpidae; animal; Brazil; coconut; mite; Musa; season; Animals; Brazil; Cocos; Mites; Musa; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087319011

In agriculture specifically, the cultivation and productivity of crops such as sugarcane, maize, and sorghum are influenced by several environmental factors. The effects of high atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ([CO2]) have been the subject of research investigating the growth and development of C4 plants. Therefore, this brief review presents some of the physiological and genetic changes in economically important C4 plants following exposure periods of increased [CO2] levels. In the short term, with high [CO2], C4 plants change photosynthetic metabolism and carbohydrate production. The photosynthetic apparatus is initially improved, and some responses, such as stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, are normally maintained throughout the exposure. Protein-encoding genes related to photosynthesis, such as the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, to sucrose accumulation and to biomass growth and are differentially regulated by [CO2] increase and can variably participate owing to the C4 species and/or other internal and external factors interfering in plant development. Despite the consensus among some studies, mainly on physiological changes, further studies are still necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms modulated under this condition. In addition, considering future scenarios, the combined effects of high environmental and [CO2] stresses need to be investigated so that the responses of maize, sugarcane, and sorghum are better understood. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to match these goals, authors integrate the Life Cycle Assessment with a scenario analysis. The future electricity mix scenarios, characterized by a share of renewables (57% for 2030-BS scenario and 51% for 2030-DS scenario) show a reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions per kWh of electricity generated, compared to the current one in which renewables account for 24%. Greenhouse gases emissions decrease by 39.9% in 2030-BS and by 32.9% in 2030-DS. However, the analysis highlights that the state of development of technologies does not allow improvements in a whole set of impacts categories. Particularly, freshwater ecotoxicity increases by around 30% and resources depletion by more than 100%.

To study the impact of this reduction and closing down, hourly concentrations of PM2.5-related elements were measured at a rural site before (12–25 January 2020), during (26 January–9 February 2020) and after (22 March–2 April 2020) the control period when all people remained socially isolated in their homes and could not return to economic zones for work. Nine major sources were identified by the positive matrix factorization model, including fireworks burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, Cr industry, oil combustion, Se industry, Zn smelter, and iron and steel industry. Before the control period, K, Fe, Ca, Zn, Ba and Cu were the main elements, and fireworks burning, Zn smelter and vehicle emissions provided the highest contributions to the total element mass with 55%, 12.1% and 10.3%, respectively. During the control period, K, Fe, Ba, Cu and Zn were the dominating elements, and fireworks burning and vehicle emissions contributed 55% and 27% of the total element mass. After the control period, Fe, K, Ca, Zn and Ba were the main elements, and dust and iron and steel industry were responsible for 56% and 21% of the total element mass. The increased contribution from vehicle emissions during the control period could be attributed to our sampling site being near a town hospital and the fact that the vehicle activities were not restricted. The source apportionment results were also related to air mass backward trajectories. The largest reductions of dust, coal combustion, and the industrial sources (Cr industry, Zn smelter, Se industry, iron and steel industry) were distinctly seen for northwest transport (Ulanqab) and were least significant for northeast transport (Tangshan and Tianjin). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; COVID-19; Elements; Emission reduction; PM2.5; Xianghe","Coal dust; Coal industry; Disease control; Explosives; Factorization; Iron and steel industry; Petroleum industry; Rural areas; Smelting; Steelmaking; Vehicles; Anthropogenic activity; Backward trajectory; Control periods; Industrial sources; Positive matrix factorization models; Source apportionment; Vehicle activity; Vehicle emission; Coal combustion; barium; calcium; chromium; coal; copper; element; iron; oil; potassium; selenium; steel; zinc; concentration (composition); COVID-19; human activity; particulate matter; rural area; source apportionment; traffic emission; viral disease; Article; burn; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dust; exhaust gas; home; human; iron and steel industry; mass; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); rural area; social isolation; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; virus pneumonia; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Beijing; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087779108

As a kind of abundant and inexpensive carbon resource, CO2 can be converted into high-utilization chemicals and fuels, and its resource utilization is of great significance to environmental protection and energy security. Among the many CO2 conversion technologies, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is considered to be one of the most promising methods, and it is a research hotspot in the world at present. In recent years, ionic liquids (ILs) have provided opportunities for the electroreduction of CO2 due to their unique physical and chemical properties. ILs have attracted more and more attention in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 due to their advantages of reducing reaction overpotential, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and improving product selectivity. In this paper, the research progress in recent years of ILs in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is reviewed from three aspects: adsorption of CO2 by ILs, ILs-based electrolyte, and modification and preparation of electrodes in ILs. At the end of this paper, some issues and challenges to which more attention needs to be paid in future research were discussed as well. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Ionic liquids; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Electroreduction of CO2; International community; Issues and challenges; Physical and chemical properties; Product selectivities; Resource utilizations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096574129

In the last decade, the onset of chilling temperatures in winter was reported to be later, with milder winter temperatures in general across the subtropical regions of South Africa. This change in environmental conditions results in continuous vegetative shoot growth during times of expected dormancy that is required for the accumulation of carbohydrate reserves to support flowering and fruiting of the next season. Nonstructural carbohydrates, such as soluble sugars and starch, are important indicators of carbon source capacity of a plant and enable adaptation to environmental changes. In order to study carbohydrate levels and their effect on flowering in dormant versus vegetative growing trees during the pre-flowering period, experiments were conducted on 16-year-old ‘Mauritius’ trees in the north-east of South Africa using ethephon to inhibit shoot growth during autumn/early winter. Ethapon® (a.i. 48% ethephon) was applied as a single full cover spray to dormant, hardened off trees at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg L-1 to inhibit any further shoot growth. Control treatments either consisted of untreated trees or tree where ethephon was applied at 1000 mg L-1 as a spot spray to the young developing vegetative flushes, as is the current management strategy for flush control in South Africa. Wood samples of small branches were collected at various phenological stages and analysed for starch and soluble sugar content. Results indicated that starch and soluble sugars fluctuated in response to growth events. Shoot inhibition by ethephon preserved carbohydrates during the pre-flowering period and improved flowering.

The urban surfaces (i.e. streets, façades, roofs, etc.) are a key element in this process. Indeed, their exploitation offers the opportunity to increase resource efficiency, to produce renewable energy, to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to reduce the overall environmental impact of cities. Urban planning plays an essential role in defining the allocation of surface uses and ensuring their integration. This paper proposes an analytical framework to support planning decisions about the types of surface use allowable, their extent and location. First, urban surfaces typologies and their major cluster of uses have been classified. For each cluster, a set of criteria has been identified to evaluate the technical viability of its application. Finally, a workflow has been designed for characterising the most suitable surface uses in consolidated urban areas. The application of the proposed approach, which has been tested in Bolzano (Italy), is able to support the implementation of integrated policies aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals in cities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Environmental impact; Planning; Urban planning; Global climate changes; ITS applications; Renewable energies; Resource efficiencies; Sustainable cities; Systemic approach; Technical viability; United Nations; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097256250

We evaluate PM2.5 monitoring sites near major freeways in Indianapolis, Indiana (for 2016) and Providence, Rhode Island (for 2015–2016). The modeling analyses are built upon bottom-up estimates of temporally and spatially resolved roadway PM2.5 emissions based on traffic monitoring data and local vehicle fleet emission factors. The dispersion model simulations use local meteorological data collected at or close to the near-road monitoring sites. Predictions involved a modeling chain that included travel activity data processing, emissions modeling (MOVES and AP-42), and air quality dispersion modeling. We estimated the difference between PM2.5 concentrations at the near-road monitor and at nearby urban air quality monitoring sites (the measured near-road “increment”), and compared modeled results to the measured increments. Based on monitoring data, estimates of multi-day-averaged near-road PM2.5 increments were 0.9 ± 0.6 μg/m3 at Indianapolis and 1.4 ± 0.2 μg/m3 at Providence (where the uncertainty represents the 95% confidence interval on the mean value), and were comparable to measured PM2.5 increments at these sites in the near-road literature. Modeled roadway contributions to multi-day-averaged near-road concentrations substantially exceeded measured values based on the near-road monitoring data. The average near-road PM2.5 increment modeled with AERMOD was more than 300% (factor of four) larger than the measured increment at Indianapolis, and more than 500% (factor of six) larger than the measured increment at Providence. These biases reflect cumulative uncertainty throughout the near-road PM2.5 modeling chain. The emissions modeling component may have contributed to the modeling chain biases in two ways. First, the relative contribution of modeled non-exhaust emissions (PM2.5 brake wear, tire wear, and re-suspended road dust) compared to tailpipe exhaust emissions was higher than what has been documented in several published studies. Second, other research findings indicate that the U.S. EPA MOVES2014 model may over-predict tailpipe PM2.5 exhaust. The dispersion modeling component may have also contributed to the modeling chain biases. For example, when local meteorological data were used, AERMOD results were relatively insensitive to wind direction on a daily averaged basis; as a result, modeled concentrations exceeded measured values regardless of whether the near-road monitor was upwind or downwind of the roadway. In summary, this work provides a unique evaluation of PM2.5 concentrations predicted by the near-road modeling chain, and provides valuable information to understand potential sources of uncertainty in the near-road modeling process. © Elsevier Ltd","AERMOD; Air pollution; Dispersion modeling; Emissions modeling; Near-road; Particulate matter","Air quality; Dispersions; Exhaust systems (engine); Fleet operations; Meteorology; Monitoring; Roads and streets; Uncertainty analysis; Urban growth; Wear of materials; Air quality dispersion models; Confidence interval; Dispersion modeling; Meteorological data; PM2.5 concentration; Processing approach; Relative contribution; Spatially resolved; Predictive analytics; air quality; concentration (composition); confidence interval; data processing; dispersion; exhaust emission; particulate matter; roadside environment; wind direction; air pollution; air quality; article; highway; Indiana; particulate matter; prediction; Rhode Island; simulation; travel; uncertainty; Indiana; Indianapolis; Rhode Island; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089490277

Air quality and source apportionment modeling with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) was conducted for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County to develop a refined understanding of ozone source apportionment in the region, estimate ozone concentrations in the year 2025 based on projected changes in anthropogenic emissions, and evaluate the sensitivity of future ozone concentrations to various changes in local and non-local emissions. The study focused on two ozone episodes during June and July 2017 when 8-hr average ozone concentrations were greater than 70 ppb. Based on the modeling results, ozone during the June 2017 episode was found to be driven largely by contributions from non-local and regional emissions, whereas ozone during the July 2017 episode was driven more strongly by local emissions from within Albuquerque/Bernalillo County. On high ozone days, anthropogenic emissions from within Albuquerque/Bernalillo County contributed between 8% and 19% (6–14 ppb) of total ozone. Half of this local ozone contribution was from on-road mobile sources. Fire emissions contributed as much as 2 ppb of ozone on a given day. Contributions from large power plants in New Mexico were as large as 1 ppb on a given day but less than 0.5 ppb on most days. Modeled ozone concentrations in Albuquerque/Bernalillo County were also sensitive to emissions from oil and gas emissions in New Mexico. If projected emission reductions by 2025 materialize, these reductions could reduce future peak 8-hr average ozone concentrations by as much as 3–4% compared to 2017 values. Implications: The results of this study have important implications for air quality management in Albuquerque/Bernalillo County. Ozone in Albuquerque/Bernalillo County is the result of local and non-local emissions, is impacted by wildfires, and is sensitive to statewide oil and gas emissions. The magnitude of modeled contributions from anthropogenic emissions within Albuquerque/Bernalillo County is strongly influenced by meteorological conditions, transport pathways, and the presence of wildfire. This modeling is important for understanding the potential effectiveness of local emission controls in Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, and can serve as a basis for testing future regional and local emission control options. © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Fires; Gas emissions; Quality control; Quality management; Anthropogenic emissions; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Meteorological condition; National ambient air quality standards; On-road mobile sources; Ozone concentration; Source apportionment; Transport pathways; Ozone; ozone; ozone; petroleum; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; biomass; concentration (parameter); electric power plant; meteorology; New Mexico; pollution transport; priority journal; simulation; wildfire; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; New Mexico; Ozone; Petroleum; Power Plants; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094903619

Institutional punishment of wrong-doers is well-known to curtail their impetus as free-riders. However, institutions often have limited scope in imposing sanctions, more so when these are strict and potentially viewed as disproportionate. Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment. We frame our model within the context of the global reduction of carbon emissions, but the results are shown to be general enough to be applicable to other collective action problems, shedding further light into the origins of Human institutions. © 2020","Climate action; Cooperation; Evolutionary dynamics; Game theory; Institutions; Stochastic processes","carbon emission; collective action; decision making; game theory; numerical model; public goods; self organization; Article; correlation analysis; dangerous goods; evolution; game; human; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; participatory management; priority journal; prisoner dilemma; punishment; risk assessment; social learning; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089808747

This paper provides a historical overview of DRT experiences, understanding their pros and cons. In addition, it presents the case study of Mokumflex, a 12-month DRT pilot program that replaced the regular bus service in low-density areas of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Based on a close collaboration with the private enterprise that operated the service and also with the local bus operator, we performed an empirical before and after comparison. These insights help to understand the impacts of DRT systems and support (future) design of DRT and public transport. A set of indicators was chosen for the intermodal comparison: travel distances, ridership, costs, Greenhouse Gases (GHG), emissions and population's perception. Ridership dropped from 78.1 passengers/day to 15.9 passengers/day, however, for being “demand-tailored”, passenger-km reduced even more, going from 1252.8 km/day to 136.6 km/day, hence reducing the costs and GHG emissions per passenger.

In 2016, EU-28 households accounted for 24.5% of the total (final) energy consumed: 79.2% for indoor and water heating (94.1% from petroleum derivatives), and 0.3% for cooling (100% electric sources).

The international MRE industry is in the early stages of development, focused largely on tidal and riverine turbines, and wave energy converters (WECs), to harness energy from tides, rivers, and waves, respectively. Although MRE supports climate change mitigation, there are concerns that MRE devices and systems could affect portions of the marine and river environments. The greatest concern for tidal and river turbines is the potential for animals to be injured or killed by collision with rotating blades. Other risks associated with MRE device operation include the potential for turbines and WECs to cause disruption from underwater noise emissions, generation of electromagnetic fields, changes in benthic and pelagic habitats, changes in oceanographic processes, and entanglement of large marine animals. The accumulated knowledge of interactions of MRE devices with animals and habitats to date is summarized here, along with a discussion of preferred management methods for encouraging MRE development in an environmentally responsible manner. As there are few devices in the water, understanding is gained largely from examining one to three MRE devices. This information indicates that there will be no significant effects on marine animals and habitats due to underwater noise from MRE devices or emissions of electromagnetic fields from cables, nor changes in benthic and pelagic habitats, or oceanographic systems. Ongoing research to understand potential collision risk of animals with turbine blades still shows significant uncertainty. There has been no significant field research undertaken on entanglement of large animals with mooring lines and cables associated with MRE devices. © 2020 by the authors.

Site-specific variables play an integral role in determining the chemical and physical form of Pu, and its migration, bioavailability, and immobility. This paper aims to identify the key variables that can be used to highlight regions of radioecological sensitivity and guide remediation strategies in Australia. Plutonium is present in the Australian environment as a result of global fallout and the British nuclear testing program of 1952–1958 in central and west Australia (Maralinga and Montebello islands). We report the first systematic measurements of 239+240Pu and 238Pu activity concentrations in distal (≥1000 km from test sites) catchment outlet sediments from Queensland, Australia. The average 239+240Pu activity concentration was 0.29 mBq.g −1 (n = 73 samples) with a maximum of 4.88 mBq.g −1.238Pu/239+240Pu isotope ratios identified a large range (0.02–0.29 (RSD: 74%)) which is congruent with the heterogeneous nuclear material used for the British nuclear testing programme at Maralinga and Montebello Islands. The use of a modified PCA relying on non-linear distance correlation (dCorr) provided broader insight into the impact of environmental variables on the transport and migration of Pu in this soil system.

As the increased concern on the Global Warming, Fukushima Prefecture made more efforts on the promotions of the renewable energy than the fossil fuel power. Nine years has passed since the GEJE, however, the spatial variation of the energy supply facilities is not clarified and the resilience of its energy system has not been evaluated. Therefore, this study focused on spatial analysis on these energy supply facilities before and after the GEJE and discussing the energy resilience in Fukushima Prefecture toward future disasters or climate events. This approach will be helpful for policy makers to spatiotemporally evaluate the sustainable development on the energy system. © Authors 2020.","Before and after; Energy resilience; Fukushima nuclear disaster; GIS; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Earthquakes; Global warming; Climate event; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Great east japan earthquakes; Policy makers; Renewable energies; Spatial analysis; Spatial variations; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100902442

The cold ironing allows a reduction of pollutants satisfying the power demand of ships while they are at berth, replacing on board diesel engines. In this paper, the methodology of analysis of the electrical loads required by ships concerns the typical week of each month over a one year period. The power is provided by a cogeneration plant powered by natural gas. It is flanked by a Compressed Air Energy Storage system since the energy demand is linked to the presence of ships in port and so very variable over time. The heat waste is recovered in a heating district network for overall optimization. At last, the economical aspect has been evaluated to prove the feasibility of the whole system. The results, for the case of the port of Ancona, show that a 1.5 MW and 2 MW cogenerator covers the 83.05% and 92.5% of the electrical need of ships respectively, and the 61% and 74% of the thermal need of buildings over the period analysed.

One of the current questions in the contemporary environmental and sustainability debate is how high air pollution and reduced use of renewable energy can affect the diffusion of COVID-19. This study endeavors to explain the relation between days of air pollution, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19 to provide insights into sustainable policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on a case study of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. The results reveal two main findings: (1) cities with high wind speed and high wind energy production have a lower number of cases of COVID-19 in the context of a more sustainable environment; (2) cities located in hinterland zones with high air pollution, low wind speed and less wind energy production have a greater number of cases and total deaths. The results presented here suggest that the pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 cannot be solved only with research in medicine but the solution also needs advanced capabilities and technologies for supporting sustainable development based on the reduction of air pollution and increase of production in renewable energy to improve air quality and as a consequence public health. © 2020 by the author.

Herein we report the first use of P,S,O-co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to produce a photocatalyst hydrogel. The hydrogels are generated by photoinitiated crosslinking of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide) with modified g-C3N4 materials and the photocatalytic activity is evaluated by monitoring the degradation of methyl blue (MB) solutions. S- or O-doping creates C‒S or C‒O bonds, respectively, by replacement N atoms, while P-doping produces P‒N bonds by substitution of C in the heptazine rings of g-C3N4. Based on a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental analyses, phosphorus, sulfur, and oxygen doping considerably facilitates charge separation across the heptazine rings and attracts photoexcited electrons, thus contributing to enhanced photocatalytic activity of doped g-C3N4. The P,S,O-co-doped g-C3N4 hydrogel exhibited high photocatalytic activity for MB removal under simulated solar irradiation and could be easily isolated and cleaned for reuse.

The impacts of political ideology, environmental value, and belief in climate science on message effect are also examined. Based on the results of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression, we found that compared with the economy frame, the public health frame led to greater polarization in risk perception and policy support between liberals and conservatives, and these relationships were mediated by environmental value and belief in climate science. Similarly, distance framing also increased ideological polarization in risk perception and policy support. © 2020 by the authors.

In a before-after control-­impact study, we surveyed the sediment microbial community of these swamps to test the impact of a low-intensity hazard reduction burn. Along with sediment pH, moisture and organic content, we measured gene abundances including those relating to carbon cycling (quantitative PCR (qPCR) of pmoA, mcrA, bacterial 16S rRNA and archaeal 16S rRNA), and bacteria community fingerprint (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)).

Explicit and timely information on urban trees and their roles in the atmospheric Carbon Stock (CS) are essential for policymakers to take immediate actions to ameliorate the effects of deforestation and their worsening outcomes. In this study, a detailed methodology for urban tree CS calibration and mapping was developed for the small urban area of Sassuolo in Italy. For dominant tree species classification, a remote sensing approach was applied, utilizing a high-resolution WV3 image. Five dominant species were identified and classified by applying the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach with an overall accuracy of 78%. The CS calibration was done by utilizing an allometric model based on the field data of tree dendrometry—i.e., Height (H) and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). For geometric measurements, a terrestrial photogrammetric approach known as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) was utilized. Out of 22 randomly selected sample plots of 100 square meters (10 m × 10 m) each, seven plots were utilized to validate the results of the CS calibration and mapping. In this study, CS mapping was done in an efficient and convenient way, highlighting higher CS and lower CS zones while recognizing the dominant tree species contributions. This study will help city planners initiate CS mapping and predict the possible CS for larger urban regions to ensure a sustainable urban green management system. © 2020 by the authors.

At the same time, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), for which transportation is a major source, remains an important public health issue in the United States. Motivated by recent developments in epidemiology and reduced-form air pollution modeling, as well as reductions in power plant emissions, we conduct an updated assessment of health benefits of light-duty vehicle electrification in large metropolitan areas (MSAs) in the United States. We first calculate MSA-specific mortality impacts per mile attributable to fine particles from internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) tailpipe emissions of PM2.5, SO2, NOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds, and power plant emissions of PM2.5, SO2, and NOx. We complement these with changes in greenhouse-gas emissions associated with vehicle electrification. We find that electrification leads to large benefits, even with EVs powered exclusively by fossil fuel plants. VMT-weighted mean benefits in the 53 MSAs are 6.9 ¢/mile ($10,400 per 150,000 miles), 83% of which (5.7 ¢/mile or $8600 per 150,000 miles) comes from reductions in PM2.5-attributable mortality. Variability among the MSAs is large, with benefits ranging from 3.4 ¢/mile ($5100 per 150,000 miles) in Rochester, NY, to 11.5 ¢/mile ($17,200 per 150,000 miles) in New York, NY. This large variability suggests incentives should vary by MSA and presents an opportunity to target areas for EV deployment aimed at maximizing public health benefits. Impacts are smaller when EVs disproportionately replace newer ICEV models but EVs still lead to positive benefits in all MSAs. Vehicle electrification in urban areas is an opportunity to achieve large public health benefits in the United States in the short term. © 2020 The Authors","Electric vehicles; Environmental health; Greenhouse gases; Health impacts; Intake fraction; Particulate matter","Air pollution; Ammonia; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Light weight vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Public health; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Air Pollution Modeling; Environmental consequences; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Internal combustion engine vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Power-plant emissions; Public health issues; Vehicle electrifications; Gas emissions; ammonia; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electrification; environmental assessment; epidemiology; greenhouse gas; health impact; metropolitan area; particulate matter; age; air pollution; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; electric power plant; epidemiological data; exhaust gas; female; fossil fuel plant; greenhouse gas; health impact assessment; human; internal combustion engine vehicle; major clinical study; male; mortality; motor vehicle; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; United States; urban area; air pollutant; New York; United States; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; New York; Particulate Matter; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089814152

These systems heat or cool passing air based on the seasonal air-soil temperature differences, therefore exhibiting a natural correlation between system performance and climate. Key performance indicators (KPIs) of EAHE cooling potential generated from climatic indicators were compared to building simulation results, for a multitude of system and building configurations, baseline cooling thresholds, and future climate scenarios to identify sensitivity of these indices useful for pre-design evaluations. The analysis was conducted for nine representative locations in North America. Using weather files representative of future climate scenarios, the potential for EAHE cooling was shown to persist in cooler climates in contrast to cooling dominated regions like Miami and Phoenix whose use of the EAHE was not effective. In terms of building and system design, shading and control natural ventilation (CNV) were identified as the ideal additions to promote EAHE cooling. Mean soil temperature was also identified as a possible metric for estimating EAHE cooling as cooler soil temperatures expectedly perform better. The comparison between the two approaches demonstrated climate indicators consistently reflected the behaviour predicted by building simulation despite changes to building dimensions. As a result, climate indicators have been shown to be effective pre-design tools in estimating EAHE cooling potential. These can be used by stakeholders evaluating the benefit of EAHEs in providing sustainable cooling in various climates and future climate conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","EAHE; Future climate models; Geo-climatic applicability; Green design technologies; Ground cooling; Passive cooling","Benchmarking; Cooling systems; Earth (planet); Heat exchangers; Soils; Temperature; Ventilation; Air-soil temperature difference; Building configuration; Building simulation; Climatic indicators; Earth-to-air heat exchanger; Future climate scenarios; Key performance indicators; Passive low energies; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090013330

To improve the electrochemical performance of LFP/C, we tested graphene oxides (GOs) of various morphologies as conductive additives, including pristine GO, three-dimensional GO, and hydrothermal porous GO (HTGO). Among our samples, the cathode material prepared through spray-drying with the addition of 1 wt% of HTGO (denoted SP-LFP/C/1%rHTGO) displayed the best electrochemical performance; its discharge capacities at 0.1C, 1C, 5C, and 10C were 160.5, 151.8, 138.8, and 130.3 mA h g−1, respectively. From measurements of its long-term cycling performance, the discharge capacity in the first cycle and the capacity retention after 30 cycles at 0.1C were 160.2 mA h g−1 and 99.6%, respectively; at 10C, these values were 132.2 mA h g−1 and 91.8%, respectively. The electronic conductivity of SP-LFP/C/1%rHTGO (6.58 × 10−5 S cm−1) was higher than that of the pristine LFP/C (9.24 × 10−6 S cm−1). The Li+ ion diffusivities (DLi+) of the SP-LFP/C/1%HTGO cathode, measured using AC impedance (3.91 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) and cyclic voltammetry (6.66 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 for discharge), were superior to those of the LFP/C cathode (9.31 × 10−15 cm2 s−1 and 1.79 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 for discharge, respectively). Galvanostatic intermittent titration revealed that the value of DLi+ was located in a reasonable range from 1 × 10−10 to 1 × 10−17 cm2 s−1; its value dropped to its lowest point when the state of charge was close to 50%. Thus, the use of spray-drying and the addition of conductive HTGO (having a 3D wrinkled morphology and interconnected pore structure) can enhance the electronic conductivity and Li+ ion diffusivity of LFP/C cathode materials, thereby improving the electrochemical performance significantly. © 2020 The Society of Powder Technology Japan","Calcination; Graphene oxide; Lithium iron phosphate; Sol-gel; Spray drying","Additives; Cathode materials; Composite structures; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric conductivity; Electric discharges; Graphene; Lithium compounds; Morphology; Pore structure; Sols; Spray drying; Composite cathode material; Conductive additives; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; Electronic conductivity; Galvanostatic intermittent titration; Interconnected pores; Morphology and structures; Cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095810024

The changes in the column averages are substantial in a few places of the model global grid, but the induced gradients are most often less than the random errors of the retrievals. The current necessity to restrict the quality-assured column retrievals to almost cloud-free areas appears to be a major obstacle in identifying changes in CO2 emissions. Indeed, large changes have occurred in the presence of clouds, and in places that were cloud free in 2020, the comparison with previous years is hampered by different cloud conditions during these years. We therefore recommend to favor all-weather CO2 monitoring systems, at least in situ, to support international efforts to reduce emissions. ©2020.

This paper seeks to understand the complexity of actions, relations and local dependencies within the governance of urban energy systems in shaping the transition processes. We present an analytical framework engaging the governance aspects with characteristics of material-related political processes, and apply it to our case study of the city of Hamburg, Germany. We interrogate the city's transition pathway in the context of local energy-climate politics, general aspects of the German energy transition, and energy materiality. This paper builds up understandings of path dependencies by exploring the inter-relations between important elements of the urban energy system and the material-related political processes in a learning context. Drawing on the Hamburg case, we suggest a more context-specific way to outline the different motives, interests and powers of actors/coalitions in cities. This paper reveals the learning and experimenting capacities of actors as a means of understanding the conditions and roles of cities to make structural changes for transition. Finally, city-driven transitions should further expand from the translation of ‘global problem, local solution’, to a more local-oriented focus. The notion of locality highlights that urban energy transition is creating a special political arena with its own and self-regulated dynamics, and resulting in local solutions for both the governance mode and materiality of the urban energy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Hamburg; Locality; Materiality; Urban energy systems; Urban energy transitions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089557099

One means to prevent climate change is to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This can be achieved using CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology. Due to the relative novelty of the technology, low level of experience, and high risk of implementation, in practice society often displays a negative attitude towards CCS projects. Thus, it is necessary to develop a targeted strategy to popularize CO2 capture and storage technology. Based on an extensive literature review and the experience of implementation of CCS projects in different countries, this study demonstrates the necessity of applying the deficit, contextual, lay expertise, and public participation models to promote CCS technology. As a result, the factors influencing the choice of promotion tools are identified, and the measures to popularize CCS technology, depending on the stage of its implementation, are determined. Recommendations for the improvement of CCS public databases are developed.

One third of our electricity is used on air-conditioning, which naturally become a key to decarbonization of the City. District Cooling System (DCS) is one of the most important sustainable infrastructures as stipulated in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2030+. As one of the key initiatives to increase the awareness of energy efficiency concept to the community, the HKSAR Government has promoted the adoption of DCS in the Kai Tak Development (KTD) and other planned New Development Areas (NDA). By applying the DCS, the cooling load could be shared amongst the diversified cooling requirements of various building types in the same district, thus the benefits including the improvement of energy efficiency, reduction of standby capacity and spatial requirements can be enjoyed. In recent years, Hong Kong has amassed many experiences on DCS. Successful implementation of DCS at KTD has provided many valuable know-hows on its design, construction and operation. Many challenges on the implementing DCS including the land matter, design, planning, environmental and regulatory arrangements have been resolved and paved the way for the wider application in other NDAs such as the Tung Chung New Town Extension (East) and Kwu Tung North. For each of these NDAs, many site-specific constraints are required to be investigated and addressed.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied over the contiguous United States to link emissions and climate change to reactive nitrogen deposition by simulating both present-day and future speciated Nr deposition to protected areas. Future conditions included examining the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate and the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway 5 emission scenarios. We further identify protected areas that would benefit most from better Nr management strategies by comparing the simulated deposition with multiple critical loads (CLs) for both biodiversity and acidification in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Achieved by further NOx emission reductions from the mobile and power generation sectors, future Nr deposition is expected to decrease. However, in regions with intensive fertilizer application or hosting concentrated animal feeding operations, the reduction may be offset by rising agricultural NH3 emissions. The protected areas having CL exceedances in 2050 are expected to increase by 5.5% for empirical lichen-based CL, and by 11% and 22% for surface water and forest soil acidity, respectively, because of the agricultural NH3 emission increase. By linking the deposition simulations with a water quality model, we identified that atmospheric deposition is the dominant source of nitrogen for several remote watersheds, including several lakes in National Parks and National Wilderness areas in Colorado, Montana, and Minnesota. ©2020.

This paper examines China's Non-ferrous Metals Industry (CNMI) as a case study to analyze the static and dynamic energy and CO2 emission performances and the internal driving factors using the Data Envelopment Approach (DEA)-Malmquist analysis framework. This study shows that: (1). The dynamic energy-carbon performances of all regions in China have increased at different degrees. (2). Eastern China is and has maintained its position as a technical leader, with energy-carbon performance rising most notably. (3). The central and western China are the main producers of non-ferrous metals products. Their technical innovation and technical efficiency have significantly improved. Northeast China needs to improve its performance level. (4) Technical progress (innovation) plays the most important role in performance improvement compared with other factors.

China’s agricultural production faces severe pressures and challenges in agricultural carbon reduction. In this paper, we take observation for the 31 provinces in china from 1997 to 2017, to explore the influencing factors and spatial spillover effects of agricultural by estimating spatial panel data models. The results show that China’s agricultural carbon emissions will continue to increase in the future, because the growth of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is the main driving force to accelerate the growth of agricultural carbon emissions, but the agricultural input factors will help to reduce the growth of carbon emissions. Moreover, it is proved that economic factors and agricultural input factors have direct effects and spatial spillover effects on agricultural carbon emissions except for agricultural environmental factors. In the short term, strengthening environmental protection may bring some pressure to the economic development of some places, but to achieve high-quality development, we must fundamentally solve the problem of environmental pollution. The conclusion provides important enlightenment and scientific basis for formulating effective policies to curb the growth of CO2 emissions in China. © 2020 Chen et al.

It can deposit along the waterflowing path from the near-wellbore reservoir region to the surface equipment, which results in formation damage, causes tubing blockage, interferes with well intervention, and reduces hydrocarbon production. The main objectives of this paper are to review the new advancements and remaining challenges concerning iron sulfide management in sour-gas wells, covering the mechanisms of iron sulfide formation, the mechanical and chemical removal techniques, and the prevention strategies. In this paper we give a special emphasis to the different mechanisms of iron sulfide formation during well-completion and production stages, especially the sources of ferrous iron (Fe2 ) for scale deposition. It is essential to understand the root cause to identify and develop suitable technologies to manage the scale problem. We also summarize the latest developments in mechanical methods and chemical dissolvers for the removal of iron sulfide deposited on downhole tubing. The capabilities of the current chemical dissolvers are discussed, and the criteria for effective dissolvers are provided to serve as guides for future development. Then, we provide an overview of recent developments on iron sulfide prevention technologies and treatment strategies. We differentiate the treatment approaches for corrosion byproduct and scale precipitation and scale-inhibitor deployment through continuous-injection and squeeze treatments. Finally, we outline the technical gaps and areas for further research-and-development (R&D) efforts.

Anthropogenic heat emission (AHE) is a crucial component of urban energy budget and has direct implications for investigating urban climate and environment. However, reliable and accurate representation of AHE across China is still lacking. This study presented a new machine learning-based top–down approach to generate a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) benchmark dataset at 1 km spatial resolution for China in 2010. Cubist models were constructed by fusing points-of-interest (POI) data of varying categories and multisource remote sensing data to explore the nonlinear relationships between various geographic predictors and AHE from different heat sources. The strategy of developing specific models for different components and exploiting the complementary features of POIs and remote sensing data generated a more reasonable distribution of AHF. Results showed that the AHF values in urban centers of metropolises over China range from 60 to 190 W m−2. The highest AHF values were observed in some heavy industrial zones with value up to 415 W m−2. Compared with previous studies, the spatial distribution of AHF from different heating components was effectively distinguished, which highlights the potential of POI data in improving the precision of AHF mapping. The gridded AHF dataset can serve as input of urban numerical models and can help decision makers in targeting extreme heat sources and polluters in cities and making differentiated and tailored strategies for emission mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic heat; China; Cubist; Points-of-interest; Remote sensing","Budget control; Decision making; Energy utilization; Heat flux; Waste heat; Anthropogenic heat flux; Complementary features; Emission mitigation; Multisource remote sensing data; Non-linear relationships; Points of Interest(POI); Rapid urbanizations; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing; anthropogenic source; emission inventory; estimation method; heat flux; heat source; industrialization; machine learning; numerical model; pollution monitoring; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial resolution; strategic approach; urban climate; urbanization; article; China; city; extreme hot weather; heating; machine learning; remote sensing; China; environmental monitoring; heat; urbanization; China; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Remote Sensing Technology; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087787260

Herein, we designed and fabricated rare-earth La single-atoms on carbon nitride with La-N charge-transfer bridge as the active center for photocatalytic CO2 reaction. The formation of La single-atoms was certified by spherical aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, STEM-EELS, EXAFS, and theoretical calculations. The electronic structure of the La-N bridge enables a high CO-yielding rate of 92 μmol·g-1· h-1 and CO selectivity of 80.3%, which is superior to most g-C3N4-based photocatalytic CO2 reductions. The CO production rate remained nearly constant under light irradiation for five cycles of 20 h, indicating its stability. The closely combined experimental and DFT calculations clearly elucidated that the variety of electronic states induced by 4f and 5d orbitals of the La single atom and the p-d orbital hybridization of La-N atoms enabled the formation of charge-transfer channel. The La-N charge bridges are found to function as the key active center for CO2 activation, rapid COOH* formation, and CO desorption. The present work would provide a mechanistic understanding into the utilization of rare-earth single-atoms in photocatalysis for solar energy conversion. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Carbon nitride; La single atom; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction; Selectivity; Solar fuels","Aberrations; Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Carbon nitride; Electronic structure; Energy conversion; Orbits; Rare earths; Solar energy; CO selectivity; DFT calculation; Light irradiations; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic systems; Spherical aberrations; Theoretical calculations; Transfer channel; Charge transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096879496

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15–April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017–2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown.

Based on decoupling analyses and index decomposition, this study is the first to explore whether carbon emission per capita decouples from the human development index from 2000 to 2015 at the provincial level in Southwest China [Chongqing (CQ), Sichuan (SC), Guizhou (GZ), and Yunnan (YN)]. We demonstrate the following. (1) The economic output and energy intensity effects among the five drivers are the strongest to promote and suppress the growth of carbon emission per capita from 2001 to 2015. (2) At the provincial level, we observed four decoupling statures, and the decoupling impact was organized in decreasing order: CQ > GZ > SC > YN (2001–2005), GZ > YN > CQ > SC (2006–2010), YN > SC > GZ > CQ (2011–2015).

The results show that: (1) Economic growth, population size, industrial scale and energy structure have positive impacts on CO2 emissions from construction industry, while energy efficiency has negative impacts. (2) Economic growth has a significant double threshold effect on CO2 emissions of construction industry, and it has a positive effect under the three regimes. Its intensity of effect increases first and then decreases with the economic level across the two thresholds. As a result, the Chinese government should pay more attention to the asymmetric influence of economic growth at different stages of development when formulating the construction industry emission reduction policies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Chinese Government; Economic growths; Energy structures; Industrial scale; Industry emissions; Population sizes; Threshold regression models; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097088054

Urbanization and carbon emissions are two major characteristics of modern Chinese economic and social development. China's new urbanization requires not only the realization of population, the harmonization of land and economic urbanization also requires the protection of the ecological environment in the process of urbanization to achieve green and low-carbon development. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore the influencing factors of carbon emissions and compare their differences based on spatial econometric models and from various perspectives of urbanization. Empirical findings of the study are as follows: (1) The Moran's I indexes are all above 0.5, the spatial effects of regional carbon emissions are significant, and it cannot be ignored. Similarly, it shows that the optimal model is a spatial doubly model with dual fixed effects. (2) Direct effects of population, land, and economic urbanization are positive. Whereas, indirect effect about population urbanization is negative, but its total effect is same direction change with carbon emissions. Indirect and total effect of land urbanization are negative, indirect effect of economic urbanization is small and total effect is significantly positive.

Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in an urban site in Shanghai before and during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was Jan. 8-23 and Jan. 24-Feb. 8, respectively. The observed results show that the reduction in PM2.5 can be mainly attributed to decreasing concentrations of nitrate and primary aerosols. Nitrate accounted for 37% of NR-PM2.5 before the quarantine period when there was no emission reduction. During the quarantine period, the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 60%, which is attributed to a reduction in the NOx concentration. Ammonium, as the main balancing cation, showed an approximately 45% simultaneous decrease in concentration. The concentrations of chloride and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols from primary emissions also declined due to limited human activities. By contrast, sulphate and oxygenated organic aerosols showed a slight decrease in concentration, with their contributions increasing to 27% and 18%, respectively, during the quarantine period, which resulted in two pollution episodes with PM2.5 exceeding 100 μg/m3. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of quarantine measures on variations of the PM2.5 concentration and chemical compositions. Atmospheric oxidation capacities based on the oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) and oxidation ratios have been discussed for elucidating the source and formation of haze in an environment with lower anthropogenic emissions. With increasing contribution of secondary aerosols, lower NOx and nitrate concentrations did not completely avoid haze in Shanghai during the epidemic. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Understanding the states and changes in global forests is vital for ecological assessments and forest policy guidance. However, there is no consensus on how global forests have changed based on current datasets. In this study, five global land cover datasets and Global Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) were assessed to reveal uncertainties in the global forest changes in the early 21st century. These datasets displayed substantial divergences in total area, spatial distribution, latitudinal profile, and annual area change from 2001 to 2012. These datasets also display completely divergent conclusions on forest area changes for different countries. Among the datasets, total forest area changes range from an increase of 1.7 × 106 km2 to a decrease of 1.6 × 106 km2. All the datasets show deforestation in the tropics. The accuracies of the datasets in detecting forest cover changes were evaluated by a global land cover validation dataset. The spatial patterns of accuracies are inconsistent among the datasets. This study calls for the development of a more accurate database to support forest policies and to contribute to global actions against climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

Three different designs of the exhaust system were proposed, including the non-control, the overall ventilation, and the local exhaust scenario. We also took into account the actual human behavior to simulate the concentration changes for various situations. The results showed that the scenario with no fine suspended particles (PM2.5) control had the maximum PM2.5 concentration, exceeding the indoor air quality standards in Taiwan. Although the overall ventilation strategy may reduce the concentration, it may also agitate the environment and disperse the pollutants to the entire room, resulting in a hazy smog condition. This might pose additional threat to people spending time indoor. Finally, using local exhaust plan showed the best PM2.5 controlling efficiency among the three scenarios, while its energy consumption was also the most economical.

Careful coordination of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can potentially modulate energy demand, decrease operating costs, and increase grid resiliency. However, it is challenging to control a heterogeneous population of TCLs: the control problem has a large state action space; each TCL has unique and complex dynamics; and multiple system-level objectives need to be optimized simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed control solution, which consists of a central load aggregator that optimizes system-level objectives and building-level controllers that track the load profiles planned by the aggregator. To optimize our agents' policies, we draw inspirations from both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control. Specifically, the aggregator is updated with an evolutionary strategy, which was recently demonstrated to be a competitive and scalable alternative to more sophisticated RL algorithms and enables policy updates independent of the building-level controllers. We evaluate our proposed approach across four climate zones in four nine-building clusters, using the newly-introduced CityLearn simulation environment. Our approach achieved an average reduction of 16.8% in the environment cost compared to the benchmark rule-based controller. © 2020 IEEE.","Demand flexibility; Evolutionary strategies; Reinforcement learning; Thermostatically controlled loads","Distributed parameter control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Level control; Model predictive control; Operating costs; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Control problems; Distributed control; Distributed control schemes; Evolutionary strategies; Heterogeneous populations; Renewable generation; Simulation environment; Thermostatically controlled loads; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097144731

However, national intentions to deploy NbS have yet to be fully translated into evidence-based targets and action on the ground. To enable NbS policy and practice to be better informed by science, we produced the first global systematic map of evidence on the effectiveness of nature-based interventions for addressing the impacts of climate change and hydrometeorological hazards on people. Most of the interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems were reported to have ameliorated adverse climate impacts. Conversely, interventions involving created ecosystems (e.g., afforestation) were associated with trade-offs; such studies primarily reported reduced soil erosion or increased vegetation cover but lower water availability, although this evidence was geographically restricted. Overall, studies reported more synergies than trade-offs between reduced climate impacts and broader ecological, social, and climate change mitigation outcomes. In addition, nature-based interventions were most often shown to be as effective or more so than alternative interventions for addressing climate impacts. However, there were substantial gaps in the evidence base. Notably, there were few studies of the cost-effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and few integrated assessments considering broader social and ecological outcomes. There was also a bias in evidence toward the Global North, despite communities in the Global South being generally more vulnerable to climate impacts. To build resilience to climate change worldwide, it is imperative that we protect and harness the benefits that nature can provide, which can only be done effectively if informed by a strengthened evidence base. © 2020 The Authors.

Trees in compact residential areas are particularly prone to development of defects and unstable tree structures. We assessed in detail tree species, key structural and physiological defects, tree dimensions, growing habitats and planting site conditions of 38,156 trees in 102 sampled public housing estates (PHEs) in Hong Kong. The open spaces in PHEs allowed trees to grow in representative urban habitats. PHE attributes including estate age, number of trees, species richness and tree diversity were assessed. The associations among estates, species, tree structure and defects were investigated using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The species-specific approach enlisted tree community, age, DBH and other biomass-structural traits in the data analysis and interpretation. The results showed diverse planting of 202 species from 56 families, with most species beset by multiple defects. The health and structure of two dominant tree species, Acacia confusa and Ficus microcarpa, were respectively influenced by inadequacies and stresses in planting environments, such as inclined surface of disturbed slopes, small pits and planters with poor soil quality, and soil not shielded by groundcover vegetation. Some tree defects of twigs, branches and trunks were associated with tree dimensions, especially tree height and its unnaturally high ratio to crown width and DBH.

This paper uses Oman as a Gulf Cooperation Council Countries representative model, with a transport-fuel policy to reveal carbon growth from the transportation sector and to examine feasible paths for carbon-neutral mobility. This study uses IPCC guidelines and methodology of 2006 for the assessment of the GHG emissions trends of transportations modes from 2000 to 2015. The results of the analysis indicating that the share of transport emissions in Oman's total GHG emissions has doubled from 8.1% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2015. Transportation emissions became the third larger contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions in Oman, after the oil and natural gas (26%) and energy industries (20%). Road transport is the biggest contributor to transport sector emissions, and their contribution to total transport emissions increased from 66% in 2000 to 92% in 2015. Carbon emission from the transportation sector will continue to grow steadily due to the high demand for transportation by a growing population. The cheap availability of fuel and affordable car costs, given the limited public transport, will persist as driving factors of the ongoing rise in carbon emission from transportation. Therefore, curbing emission from the Omani transportation system should take place in the socio-economic context of the country through phasing out the fuel subsidies system, developing a reliable public transport system, planning for the electrification of road transportation, and using rail for freight transportation. © 2020 The Authors","Decarbonization pathways; GHG emissions; Oman; Transport sector","Carbon; Electric railroads; Freight transportation; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas transportation; Petroleum transportation; Proven reserves; Roads and streets; Gulf Cooperation Council; Oil and gas reserves; Oil and natural gas; Public transport systems; Road transportation; Transport emissions; Transportation sector; Transportation system; Motor transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090153155

The shrimp industry has deployed ever-improved and innovated methods, from extensive farming to semi-intensive and intensive farming. Various high-density intensive culture models, such as high-land, greenhouse and indoor industrialized culture models, have been used for shrimp pond farming in the coastal area. However, efficiency, environmental and social considerations have led to an increasing adoption of the environmentally-friendly culture model called integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). This has occurred most rapidly along the northern and central coasts of China. The deployed IMTA culture models reviewed here are shrimp + crab, shrimp + fish, shrimp + sea cucumber, shrimp + jellyfish + clam, shrimp + crab + clam, shrimp + crab + clam + fish and the ridgetail white shrimp polyculture in saline alkaline water, which have been tailored to local conditions and organisms' characteristics. Suitable organism varieties and the maintenance of suitable eco-friendly water quality have been key to success. The eco-friendly IMTA culture models described here fully exploit the pond culture resources, to increase production with minimal additional feed and labor inputs, while reducing effluent emissions and treatment cost. The performance of shrimp IMTA models is compared to shrimp monoculture models regarding the economics. An equally important outcome of this publication is making generally accessible the findings from a vast Chinese scientific literature on shrimp culture that has hitherto been unavailable in English. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","brackish water; ecosystem friendly; integrated multi-trophic aquaculture; mariculture; resource efficiency; shrimp breeding",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087645471

A better understanding and quantification of their occurrences can be highly relevant for the development of proper climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience strategies. Here we examine meteorological droughts from observed data covering the 1971–2000 period for the Fulda catchment in Germany by means of the Standardized Precipitation Index. The joint dependency of drought duration and severity is modelled by a copula function, which relates their univariate distributions in a functional relationship. Recurrence intervals are further calculated as a function of the joint relationship and univariate marginals. Future projections are investigated in which downscaled EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Model (RCM) projections for the period 2021–2050 are used together with the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, in order to analyse and compare future joint patterns of duration and severity of events. We find that drought duration and severity present a clear interdependency supporting the choice of a bivariate model. Results suggest substantial differences in the future joint relationship duration–severity. Depending on the RCM and RCP, drought patterns show different magnitude of changes in the future. The projected changes are different for the different returns periods. RCP8.5 shows more severe events and longer drought durations than RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The uncertainties of the projected patterns also depend on the RCP and RCM and are larger for higher return periods. © 2020 The Authors.

In the application of a microgrid system, it is important to calculate the capacities of renewable energy sources and storage systems (ESSs) to ensure economic feasibility. In some microgrids that have recently had environmental challenges, there are island regions where the policy is to consider both the installation of the microgrid system and the supplement of electric vehicles (EV). However, an EV load pattern that does not match the solar radiation pattern may increase the required ESS capacity. Therefore, in this study, we designed and analyzed a method for reducing the microgrid system cost using a controllable EV charging load without the requirements of vehicle-to-grid technology and real-time pricing. The power system operations at similar capacities of photovoltaic and ESS were shown by applying EV charging control steps in 10% increments to analyze the effect of EV charging demand control on the microgrid. As a result of the proposed simulation, the amount of renewable power generation increased by 2.8 GWh over 20 years only by moving the charging load under the same conditions. This is an effect that can reduce CO2 by about 2.1 kTon. © 2020 by the authors.

Specifically, a series of devastating dzuds occurred in 1999–2000, 2000–2001, 2001–2002, and 2009–2010, leading to total losses of about 18 million livestock. Although dzuds are primarily caused by extreme climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, notably a lack of early preparations and mitigative actions against climate-related hazards may partially account for their occurrence. Our aim was to identify dzud-inducing climatic and socioeconomic factors and to evaluate the effectiveness of early actions implemented by national and local governments and by herders. Accordingly, we conducted interview-based surveys in two neighboring soums with similar environments in Khuvsgul aimag, in northern Mongolia, to examine factors influencing their markedly different livestock mortality rates (11.7% in Tsetserleg versus 0.6% in Tsagaan-Uul) during the winter of 2016–2017. We further analyzed the timeline of all actions taken against dzuds and their effects. An analysis of climatic conditions revealed a slightly higher normalized anomaly value for snow depth in Tsetserleg than that in Tsagaan-Uul, which not only prevented grazing but also limited access of vulnerable herding households to assistance. At the local governmental level, inadequate hay and fodder, poor organization and management of emergency actions in Tsetserleg soum were primary causes of the high livestock mortality rate while at the herders’ level, the mortalities were possibly exacerbated by shorter-distance seasonal movements and the absence of otor. The findings of the study suggest that early actions are critical factors in reducing dzud-induced damage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Disaster prevention; dzud; Humanitarian assistance; Local action",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087011201

It limits the capacity of system installations, it requires large cooling infrastructures, and it is the cause of a large carbon footprint. Reducing power during application execution without changing the application source code or increasing time-to-completion is highly desirable in real-life high-performance computing scenarios. The power management run-time frameworks proposed in the last decade are based on the assumption that the duration of communication and application phases in an MPI application can be predicted and used at run-time to trade-off communication slack with power consumption. In this article, we first show that this assumption is too general and leads to mispredictions, slowing down applications, thereby jeopardizing the claimed benefits. We then propose a new approach based on (i) the separation of communication phases and slack during MPI calls and (ii) a timeout algorithm to cope with the hardware power management latency, which jointly makes it possible to achieve performance-neutral power saving in MPI applications without requiring labor-intensive and risky application source code modifications.We validate our approach in a tier-1 production environment with widely adopted scientific applications. Our approach has a time-to-completion overhead lower than 1 percent, while it successfully exploits slack in communication phases to achieve an average energy saving of 10 percent. If we focus on a large-scale application runs, the proposed approach achieves 22 percent energy saving with an overhead of only 0.4 percent. With respect to state-of-the-art approaches, COUNTDOWN Slack is the only that always leads to an energy saving with negligible overhead (<3 percent). © 2020 IEEE.","DVFS; DVFS; Energy saving; HPC; MPI; P-states; Power management; Power saving; Reactive policy","Carbon footprint; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Message passing; Power management; Supercomputers; Application execution; Communication phasis; High performance computing; Large-scale applications; Production environments; Scientific applications; State-of-the-art approach; System installation; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095560927

This study reports on the abiotic generation of CH4via Fischer-Tropsch type reactions at room temperature. Natural sources of mineral Fe2+ were reacted with aqueous bicarbonate under sterile and non-sterile conditions. The selected sources of mineral Fe2+ were well-characterized Ediacaran basalts and green clay veins in basalts from the Volyn-Brest continental flood basalt province and hectorite SHCa-1 from Hector, California. Quantitative X-ray powder diffraction results and the Mössbauer characteristics of these materials from the literature were supplemented with specific surface area values determined by N2 physisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanodiffraction analysis. The headspace concentration of the gases in the dispersions was related to the presence of bicarbonate and the mineral composition. Evidence presented herein confirmed that wüstite occurs naturally in SHCa-1, which is unprecedented. Of all mineral dispersions those containing wüstite (basalt MIB and SHCa-1) showed the highest concentration of CH4 and CO2, ranging from 1457 to 6329 μmol CH4 g solid−1 and from 2100 to 8771 μmol CO2 g solid−1, respectively.

The model is based on the stochastic description of the overtopping phenomenon based on the results of extensive laboratory tests, and it is able to simulate the behavior of the device operating under any assigned sequence of sea states, thus allowing to easily obtain results that would otherwise require time consuming and costly physical model tests. The model is used here to identify the main geometrical parameters affecting the performance of the device and to optimize such parameters in order to maximize the average yearly output power. An application to a device embedded in the breakwater of Pantelleria Port (Sicily, Italy) is presented. The model is also proved to be useful to verify the possibility of further increasing the output power through the implementation of specific control strategies concerning the operation of the turbines.

However, most studies assessing tree versus grass root-niche partitioning have focused on one or two sites, limiting generalization about how rainfall and soil conditions influence the degree of rooting overlap across environmental gradients. We used two complementary stable isotope techniques to quantify variation (a) in water uptake depths and (b) in fine-root biomass distributions among dominant trees and grasses at eight semi-arid savanna sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Sites were located on contrasting soil textures (clayey basaltic soils vs. sandy granitic soils) and paired along a gradient of mean annual rainfall. Soil texture predicted variation in mean water uptake depths and fine-root allocation. While grasses maintained roots close to the surface and consistently used shallow water, trees on sandy soils distributed roots more evenly across soil depths and used deeper soil water, resulting in greater divergence between tree and grass rooting on sandy soils. Mean annual rainfall predicted some variation among sites in tree water uptake depth, but had a weaker influence on fine-root allocation. Synthesis. Savanna trees overlapped more with shallow-rooted grasses on clayey soils and were more distinct in their use of deeper soil layers on sandy soils, consistent with expected differences in infiltration and percolation. These differences, which could allow trees to escape grass competition more effectively on sandy soils, may explain observed differences in tree densities and rates of woody encroachment with soil texture. Differences in the degree of root-niche separation could also drive heterogeneous responses of savanna vegetation to predicted shifts in the frequency and intensity of rainfall. © 2020 British Ecological Society","niche partitioning; plant–climate interactions; rooting depths; savanna; soil texture; stable isotopes; tree–grass coexistence","biomass; environmental gradient; grass; rainfall; sandy soil; savanna; semiarid region; soil texture; soil-vegetation interaction; temperature gradient; tree; Kruger National Park; South Africa; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089400978

This focus on removal, also referred to as negative emissions, is suggestive of novel opportunities, risks, and challenges in addressing climate change, but tends to build on the narrow techno-economic framings that characterize integrated assessment modeling. While the discussion on negative emissions bears important parallels to a wider and older literature on carbon sequestration and carbon sinks, this earlier scholarship—particularly from the critical social sciences—is seldom engaged with by the negative emissions research community. In this article, we survey this “long history” of carbon removal and seek to draw out lessons for ongoing research and the emerging public debate on negative emissions. We argue that research and policy on negative emissions should proceed not just from projections of the future, but also from an acknowledgement of past controversies, successes and failures. In particular, our review calls attention to the irreducibly political character of carbon removal imaginaries and accounting practices and urges acknowledgement of past experiences with the implementation of (small-scale) carbon sequestration projects. Our review in this way highlights the importance of seeing continuity in the carbon removal discussion and calls for more engagement with existing social science scholarship on the subject. Acknowledging continuity and embracing an interdisciplinary research agenda on carbon removal are important aspects in making climate change mitigation research more responsible, and a precondition to avoid repeating past mistakes and failures.

Despite the impact of water erosion on crops, it is typically neglected in global crop yield projections. Furthermore, previous efforts to quantify global water erosion have paid little attention to the effects of field management on the magnitude of water erosion. In this study, we analyse the robustness of simulated water erosion estimates in maize and wheat fields between the years 1980 and 2010 based on daily model outputs from a global gridded version of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) crop model. By using the MUSS water erosion equation and country-specific and environmental indicators determining different intensities in tillage, residue handling and cover crops, we obtained the global median water erosion rates of 7 t ha-1 a-1 in maize fields and 5 t ha-1 a-1 in wheat fields. A comparison of our simulation results with field data demonstrates an overlap of simulated and measured water erosion values for the majority of global cropland. Slope inclination and daily precipitation are key factors in determining the agreement between simulated and measured erosion values and are the most critical input parameters controlling all water erosion equations included in EPIC. The many differences between field management methods worldwide, the varying water erosion estimates from different equations and the complex distribution of cropland in mountainous regions add uncertainty to the simulation results. To reduce the uncertainties in global water erosion estimates, it is necessary to gather more data on global farming techniques to reduce the uncertainty in global land-use maps and to collect more data on soil erosion rates representing the diversity of environmental conditions where crops are grown. © Author(s) 2020.",,"agricultural modeling; arable land; climate modeling; cover crop; crop yield; sensitivity analysis; soil erosion; soil fertility; uncertainty analysis; water erosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095986510

Almost all of these studies have been instantaneous snapshots of methane emissions; however, total methane emissions from a production site and the methane emission intensity would be expected to evolve over time. A detailed site-level methane emission estimation model is used to estimate the temporal evolution of methane emissions and the methane emission intensity for a variety of well configurations with and without emission mitigation measures in place. The general pattern predicted is that total emissions decrease over time as production declines. Methane emission intensity shows complex behavior because production-dependent emissions decline at different rates and some emissions do not decline over time. Prototypical uncontrolled wet gas wells can have approximately half of their emissions over a 10 year period occur in the first year; instantaneous wellsite methane emission intensities range over a factor of 3 (0.62-2.00%) in the same period, with a 10 year production weighted-average lifecycle methane emission intensity of 0.79%. Including emission control in the form of a flare can decrease the average lifecycle methane emission intensity to 0.23%. Emissions from liquid unloadings, which are observed in subsets of wells, can increase the lifecycle methane emission intensity by up to a factor of 2-3, between 1.2 and 2.3%, depending on the characteristics of the unloadings. Emissions from well completion flowbacks raise the average lifecycle methane emission intensity from 0.79 to 0.81% for flowbacks with emission controls; for flowbacks with uncontrolled emissions, lifecycle methane emissions increase to 1.26%. Dry gas and oil wells show qualitatively similar temporal behavior but different absolute emission rates. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Liquid methane; Methane; Natural gas well production; Oil well completion; Petroleum industry; Unloading; Emission mitigation; Methane emissions; Oil and gas production; Production declines; Temporal behavior; Temporal evolution; Uncontrolled emissions; Well configuration; Life cycle; methane; methane; natural gas; well water; emission; gas production; methane; oil production; temporal evolution; air pollution control; Article; chemical composition; controlled study; gas field; greenhouse gas; human; oil field; time series analysis; air pollutant; oil and gas field; Air Pollutants; Methane; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095808796

Both consolidated and fast urbanizing areas face diverse acute shocks from natural disasters and long-term stresses, such as the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is a need for cities to implement plans for increasing resilience and improving preparedness to cope with both acute shocks and long-term stresses. Development of resilience action plans (RAP) constitutes an important process for the cities to plan their resilience enhancement in the long, medium, and short terms. These are key tools for the city, considering the associated complexity, uncertainties, data scarcity, interdependencies among urban services provided in the city, as well as involved stakeholders. Herein, a framework is presented to support city resilience action planning related to climate change through a multisector approach. The framework was applied step by step to three cities—Barcelona, Bristol, and Lisbon—and their RAPs to climate change provide roadmaps for resilience, having the urban water cycle as the core. In these plans, urban services are included, given their interactions and contributions to city’s resilience. Addressed services are water supply, wastewater, storm water, waste, electric energy, and mobility. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, scientific and accurate PM2.5 exposure risk assessment is essential. However, the considering daily/hourly mean PM2.5 concentration and overlooking population mobility in exposure risk assessments result in underestimation of its adverse effects. Thus, using social media data and exceedance PM2.5 concentration, two novel indicators named hourly exceedance PM2.5 exposure (HEPE) and daily cumulative variation of exceedance PM2.5 exposure (DCEPE) are developed in our study. Spatiotemporal variation analysis of HEPE showed that the first exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk was observed at 10:00; this lasted till the end of the day. According to the standard deviation ellipse (SDE) method analysis results, at first, the major spatial tendency direction was northeast-southwest, with the average center (AE) located in the Yuangang Township. Then, the HEPE in the western study area increased dramatically. The major spatial tendency direction shifted from northeast-southwest to east-west. Consequently, the AE of HEPE shifted to central study area. The spatiotemporal variation characteristics led us to investigate the mechanisms. A bivariate LISA was applied to detect the spatial association between DCEPE and city functional zones (CFZs). Results showed that highly spatial associations were found between the DCEPE and CFZs in the southwest of the study area. Residential neighborhoods and transportation services showed a closer relationship with the spatial distribution of DCEPE. Based on these results, we found increasing public health threats posed by PM2.5. Thus, HEPE is an essential factor to assess air pollution exposure risk.

The response of leaf stoichiometry to topographic factors reflects plant adaptation strategies to different habitats. Common in various grasslands across China, Oxytropis ochrocephala Bunge. is well known in pastoral areas for its toxicity. The effects of partial or full slope sunniness (south-facing) or shadiness (north-facing) and elevation (2400 m, 2600 m, 2800 m, 3000 m, or 3200 m) on the leaf C:N:P stoichiometry of O. ochrocephala was investigated in northwest China's Qilian Mountains. While leaf C:N:P stoichiometry of O. ochrocephala changed with elevation, there was no uniform pattern of change: the greatest leaf C and P concentrations ([C]leaf, and [P]leaf) were measured at an elevation of 2800 m (417.81 g kg−1 and 1.17 g kg−1, respectively); the lowest [C]leaf was 360.43 g kg−1 at 2400 m, and the lowest [P]leaf was 0.81 g kg−1 at 2600 m. The greatest leaf N concentration ([N]leaf) was 38.29 g kg−1 at 3200 m, and the lowest was 31.94 g kg−1 at 2600 m. Leaf C:N, C:P and N:P ratios were all relatively greater at 2600 m. Across the elevation gradient, O. ochrocephala leaf nutrient concentrations and their stoichiometries were mainly determined by mean annual temperature, soil organic carbon, and soil organic carbon to soil total phosphorus ratio. The [C]leaf, [N]leaf, and [P]leaf were significantly greater on north-facing slope aspects (393.86 g kg−1, 38.04 g kg−1, and 1.16 g kg−1, respectively) than on south-facing slope aspects (365.39 g kg−1, 32.98 g kg−1, and 0.92 g kg−1, respectively). Leaf C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios were significantly lower on north-facing slope aspects (10.43, 416.49, and 39.73, respectively) than on south-facing slope aspects (11.14, 512.57, and 45.98, respectively). Differences in leaf nutrient concentrations and their stoichiometries in O. ochrocephala leaves between slope aspects were mainly determined by soil temperature and soil moisture content. In terms of leaf N:P ratios across the elevation gradient and the two slope aspects, results indicated that the growth of O. ochrocephala in the study region was mainly restricted by P. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Leaf nutrient concentrations; Plant adaptation; Qilian Mountains; Topographic factors","bioenergetics; elevation; environmental gradient; leafy vegetable; local adaptation; phytochemistry; soil moisture; soil organic matter; soil temperature; soil-vegetation interaction; stoichiometry; China; Qilian Mountains; Oxytropis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087503556

The objective of this work was to define management zone (MZs) for a village by comparing the use of crop yield proxies derived from historical satellite images with soil information derived from remote sensing, and the integration of these two data sources. The village chosen for the study was Wangzhuang village in Quzhou County in the North China Plain (NCP) (30◦51′55” N; 115◦02′06” E). The village was comprised of 540 fields covering approximately 177 ha. The subdivision of the village into three or four zones was considered to be the most practical for the NCP villages because it is easier to manage many fields within a few zones rather than individually in situations where low mechanization is the norm. Management zones defined using Landsat satellite data for estimation of the Green Normalized Vegetation Index (GNDVI) was a reasonable predictor (up to 45%) of measured variation in soil nitrogen (N) and organic carbon (OC). The approach used in this study works reasonably well with minimum data but, in order to improve crop management (e.g., sowing dates, fertilization), a simple decision support system (DSS) should be developed in order to integrate MZs and agronomic prescriptions. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, these implementations need to cover the minimum requirements as balanced energy price, power demand, and a higher ROI, among others, to be reliable and compete with traditional sources. This paper presents a novel approach for sizing a hybrid renewable energy system, using data-driven decisions to meet the demand of a population in Barranquilla city.

As this is a key challenge facing developing countries, assessing the potential for energy savings in households appears as a crucial action to be considered by local policymakers, given the growing importance of residential electricity demand and the difficulties they face in managing the supply/demand balance of electricity. The literature review reveals a shortage of knowledge on residential electricity consumption behaviours in sub-African developing countries. Noting this gap, an energy demand frontier function is used to assess the potential for electricity savings in the residential sector in Cameroon, taking as a case study. The result showed that: households have an average efficiency of 62.4% with a range of 71%, which implies a significant potential for reducing electricity consumption. Rural households emerged more efficient than urban households. The study also clarify the potential for demand management at the household level which confirms that the efficiency level varies according to technical and social standards.

However, the Directive provides no tools for the assessment of BATs leading to the determination of BAT at the installation level. This study applies the cross-media effects assessment methodology to assess BATs at the installation level, applicable to all industrial sectors. The methodology considers cross-media impacts, economic evaluations such as initial and operation and maintenance cost, and cost-effectiveness as the assessment criteria and relies on emission data both from the local level and operating installations. As an example of application, the methodology was applied to the BAT selection for reducing dust emissions from the sintering process of the iron and steel production. The BAT options of the integrated bag filter system (BFS) and advanced electrostatic precipitator (ESP) were compared. The results suggested that ESP has lower impacts in the impact categories of acidification potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and eutrophication potential than BFS. In contrast, BFS has lower impacts on the other categories. However, the results from the economic analyses revealed a remarkable advantage of ESP over BFS. With these findings, it was concluded that the identification of the best abatement option for dust emissions with a particular reference to BAT is a complex issue. Industrial establishments and the competent environmental authorities must consider not only the environmental impacts and economic evaluations but also legal obligations in developing their approach to emission control.

Global cities produce more than 70% of the world's carbon emissions from energy activities and thus play an important role in changing climate and causing environmental problems. The spatial modelling of urban carbon emissions can serve as the basis for carbon emissions mitigation. Building attributes are the key energy demand indicators and significant in constructing the emission inventory, but they are often not accounted for in the modelling process due to data availability. Therefore, this study aims to develop a tool for modelling a high-resolution emission inventory using open urban form data and demonstrate it for Hong Kong. This tool modelled the urban carbon emissions for building and transport sectors using a hybrid method involving both bottom-up and top-down approach. Open urban data including building attributes and traffic flow were extracted as model input data. The urban carbon emissions were modelled for Hong Kong at 100 m spatial resolution for different sectors and integrated in Tertiary Planning Unit. Validation results show that the method has reasonably represented both the total emissions and the spatial pattern of urban carbon emissions of Hong Kong. The spatial distribution of carbon emissions of Hong Kong can provide reference information for low-carbon city management for other high-density cities. The method shows the potentially broad applicability, therefore contributing to the global collaborative effort in the mitigation of carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","High-resolution emission inventory; Low-carbon city; Open data; Urban carbon emissions; Urban form","Carbon; Environmental management; Bottom-up and top-down; Data availability; Emission inventories; Environmental problems; High-density cities; High-resolution emission; Spatial resolution; Validation results; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089426341

In order to improve estimates of the contribution of primary sources to the particle number and mass concentrations, we performed source apportionment analyses using both chemical fingerprints and particle size distributions measured at the same site in urban Beijing from April to July 2018. Both methods resolved factors related to primary emissions, including vehicular emissions and cooking emissions, which together make up 76 % and 24 % of total particle number and organic aerosol (OA) mass, respectively. Similar source types, including particles related to vehicular emissions (1.6 ± 1.1 μgm-3; 2.4 ± 1.8 × 103 cm-3 and 5.5 ± 2.8 × 103 cm-3 for two traffic-related components), cooking emissions (2.6±1.9 μgm-3 and 5.5± 3.3×103 cm-3) and secondary aerosols (51±41 μgm-3 and 4.2±3.0×103 cm-3), were resolved by both methods. Converted mass concentrations from particle size distributions components were comparable with those from chemical fingerprints. Size distribution source apportionment separated vehicular emissions into a component with a mode diameter of 20 nm (""traffic-ultrafine"") and a component with a mode diameter of 100 nm (""traffic-fine""). Consistent with similar day-and nighttime diesel vehicle PM2.5 emissions estimated for the Beijing area, traffic-fine particles, hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, traffic-related factor resulting from source apportionment using chemical fingerprints) and black carbon (BC) showed similar diurnal patterns, with higher concentrations during the night and morning than during the afternoon when the boundary layer is higher. Traffic-ultrafine particles showed the highest concentrations during the rush-hour period, suggesting a prominent role of local gasoline vehicle emissions. In the absence of new particle formation, our results show that vehicular-related emissions (14 % and 30 % for ultrafine and fine particles, respectively) and cookingactivity-related emissions (32 %) dominate the particle number concentration, while secondary particulate matter (over 80 %) governs PM2.5 mass during the non-heating season in Beijing. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Mechanistic understanding of ecological responses requires the separation of different climatic parameters and processes that often operate on diverse spatiotemporal scales. Yet most environmental studies do not distinguish the effects of internal climate variability from those caused by external, natural (e.g. volcanic, solar, orbital) or anthropogenic (e.g. greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols, land-use) forcing factors. We suggest extending the climatological concept of ‘Detection and Attribution’ (DA) to unravel abiotic drivers of ecological dynamics in the Anthropocene. We therefore apply DA to quantify the relative roles of natural versus industrial temperature change on elevational shifts in the outbreak epicentres of the larch budmoth (LBM; Zeiraphera diniana or griseana Gn.); the classic example of a cyclic forest defoliating insect. Our case study shows that anthropogenic warming shifts the epicentre of travelling LBM waves upward, which disrupts the intensity of population outbreaks that occurred regularly over the past millennium in the European Alps. Our findings demonstrate the ability of DA to detect ecological responses beyond internal system variability, to attribute them to specific external climate forcing factors and to identify climate-induced ecological tipping points. In order to implement the climatological concept of ‘Detection and Attribution’ successfully into modern global change ecology, future studies should combine high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to inform inference-based ecosystem models.

If countries around the world are to meet challenging global carbon reduction targets, then how our cities are governed and managed to maximize energy efficiency is of vital importance. Faith is increasingly being placed in what are commonly referred to as 'smart cities.' Smart cities seemingly offer a utopian vision of urban integration, efficiency and [subsequent] carbon reductions, yet urbanisation presents real challenges, as noted by Sustainable Development Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Cities are made up of people and increasingly both policymakers and practitioners are starting to see citizens as an essential stakeholder, even if there is a blurring over the boundaries between citizens and consumers. It is unclear what these people actually refer to when they talk about citizen engagement. Adopting key theoretical underpinning of ladder of participation (Arnstein), this research will present findings from case studies of novel citizen engagement from around the world, notably Nottingham (UK), Espoo (Finland) and Portland (USA). Utilising semi-structured interview material findings are analysed through critical framework of citizen engagement to see whether they fulfil the notion of smart cities and communities. Specifically, new forms of engagement that do not fit previously held assumptions around participation need to be considered. Recommendations are provided for increasing new forms of citizen engagement in smart city strategies in order to ensure they are fully adopted and embedded. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The occurrence of new, previously unidentified species in Israel or of suggested new species worldwide is a consequence of the continuous withdrawal of efficient nematicides. Among plant-parasitic nematodes, migratory endoparasitic species of the genus Pratylenchus are widely distributed in vegetable and crop fields in Israel and are associated with major reductions in quality and yield. This review focuses on the occurrence, distribution, diagnosis, pathogenicity, and phylogeny of all Pratylenchus species recorded over the last few decades on different crops grown throughout Israel—covering early information from nematologists to recent reports involving the use of molecular phylogenetic methodologies. We explore the accepted distinction between Pratylenchus thornei and Pratylenchus mediterraneus isolated from Israel’s northern Negev region, and address the confusion concerning the findings related to these Pratylenchus species. Our recent sampling from the northern Negev revealed the occurrence of both P. thornei and P. mediterraneus on the basis of molecular identification, indicating P. mediterraneus as a sister species of P. thornei and their potential occurrence in a mixed infection. Finally, the efficiencies of common control measures taken to reduce Pratylenchus’ devastating damage in protected crops and field crops is discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Once injected, CO2 dissolves into formation brine, lowering pH and creating conditions favorable for mineral dissolution. Cations released from dissolving minerals may create conditions favorable for secondary mineral precipitation, which can result in the long-term mineralogical trapping of injected CO2. These reactions may alter the natural rock mechanical properties, which can affect the safety and efficiency of geological sequestration. This work aims to investigate the impact of mineral composition and distribution on the mechanical properties of porous media. In this study, the mineralogy, mineral distribution, and mechanical properties of samples from Escambia County, AL, are evaluated. The mechanical properties of the rock samples are evaluated using the unconfined compression and indirect tensile tests in the combination with digital image correlation. The mineral composition and distribution are determined through the analysis of scanning electron microscopy backscattered electron and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy images of thin sections. These analyses showed that the mechanical properties vary with composition, which may have significant practical consequences for geological sequestration of CO2. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Geology; Mechanical properties; Porous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile testing; Backscattered electrons; Deep saline formations; Digital image correlations; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Geological sequestration; Mineral precipitation; Safety and efficiencies; Unconfined compression; Minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097716090

Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South. It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize. Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison1, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge. We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics. Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, Côte D’Ivoire, and Aotearoa – New Zealand. We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice. It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps.

The early months of the year see the celebratory use of fireworks, a week-long public holiday in China, but in 2020 overlapped in Hubei Province with lockdowns, some of &gt; 70 days duration. The urban lockdowns enforced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic give a chance to explore the effect of rapid changes in societal activities on air pollution, with a public willing to leave views on social media and show a continuing concern about the return of pollution problems after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. Fireworks typically give rise to sharp peaks in PM2.5 concentrations, though the magnitude of these peaks in both Wuhan and Beijing has decreased under tighter regulation in recent years, along with general reductions in pollutant emissions. Firework smoke is now most evident in smaller outlying cities and towns. The holiday effect, a reduction in pollutant concentrations when normal work activities are curtailed, is only apparent for NO2 in the holiday week in Wuhan (2015-2020), but not Beijing. Lockdown in Wuhan was characterised by decreases in NO2, along with more subtle changes in particulate matter and other pollutants. Ozone noticeably increases as there is less NO available for titration, but such change may not be widespread geographically. Beijing, where restrictions were less stringent, showed some improvement in air quality, though this is more difficult to detect, even within the 5th Ring Road. © The Author(s).","Beijing; Holiday effect; Social media; Weekend effect; Wuhan","Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Nitrogen oxides; Smoke; Cities and towns; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Pollutant emission; Pollution problems; Public attitudes; Weather patterns; Explosives; air quality; atmospheric pollution; burning; festival; particle size; particulate matter; public attitude; smoke; social media; Beijing [China]; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094195520

One of the most prominent natural resource management agencies in the United States is the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is tasked with managing over 248 million acres (&gt;1 million km2) of public lands for multiple, often conflicting, uses. Climate change will affect the sustainability of many of these land uses and could further increase conflicts between them. As such, the purpose of our study was to determine the extent to which climate change will affect public land uses, and whether the BLM is managing for such predicted effects. To do so, we first conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature that discussed potential impacts of climate change on the multiple land uses the BLM manages in the Intermountain West, USA, and then expanded these results with a synthesis of projected vegetation changes. Finally, we conducted a content analysis of BLM Resource Management Plans in order to determine how climate change is explicitly addressed by BLM managers, and whether such plans reflect changes predicted by the scientific literature. We found that active resource use generally threatens intrinsic values such as conservation and ecosystem services on BLM land, and climate change is expected to exacerbate these threats in numerous ways. Additionally, our synthesis of vegetation modeling suggests substantial changes in vegetation due to climate change. However, BLM plans rarely referred to climate change explicitly and did not reflect the results of the literature review or vegetation model synthesis. Our results suggest there is a disconnect between management of BLM lands and the best available science on climate change. We recommend that the BLM actively integrates such research into on-the-ground management plans and activities, and that researchers studying the effects of climate change make a more robust effort to understand the practices and policies of public land management in order to effectively communicate the management significance of their findings. © 2020 The Authors.","Bureau of Land Management; climate change; ecosystem services; Intermountain West; natural resource management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097319086

Fluorine is an intrinsically sensitive nucleus for MRI—there is negligible endogenous 19F in the body and, thus, no background signal which allows the detection of fluorinated materials as “hot spots” by combined 1H/19F MRI and renders fluorine-containing molecules as ideal tracers with high specificity. In addition, perfluorocarbons are a family of compounds that exhibit a very high fluorine payload and are biochemically as well as physiologically inert. Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions (PFCs) are well known to be readily taken up by immunocompetent cells, which can be exploited for the unequivocal identification of inflammatory foci by tracking the recruitment of PFC-loaded immune cells to affected tissues using 1H/19F MRI. The required 19F labeling of immune cells can be accomplished either ex vivo by PFC incubation of isolated endogenous immune cells followed by their re-injection or by intravenous application of PFCs for in situ uptake by circulating immune cells. With both approaches, inflamed tissues can unambiguously be detected via background-free 19F signals due to trafficking of PFC-loaded immune cells to affected organs. To extend 19F MRI tracking beyond cells with phagocytic properties, the PFC surface can further be equipped with distinct ligands to generate specificity against epitopes and/or types of immune cells independent of phagocytosis. Recent developments also allow for concurrent detection of different PFCs with distinct spectral signatures allowing the simultaneous visualization of several targets, such as various immune cell subtypes labeled with these PFCs. Since ligands and targets can easily be adapted to a variety of problems, this approach provides a general and versatile platform for inflammation imaging which will strongly extend the frontiers of molecular MRI.

Together, participants traveled a total of 27.7 million miles or 44.6 million kilometers. This equates to 58 return trips to the moon. Estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions were 8,646 metric tons or the total weekly carbon footprint of approximately 9,366 average American households. These emissions contribute to climate change and thus may exacerbate many of the global diseases that conference attendees seek to combat. Options to reduce conference travel–associated emissions include 1) alternating in-person and online conferences, 2) offering a hybrid in-person/online conference, and 3) decentralizing the conference with multiple conference venues. Decentralized ASTMH conferences may allow for up to 64% reduction in travel distance and 58% reduction in CO2e emissions. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the clear association between global warming and global health, ways to reduce carbon emissions should be considered.

Research and development of new invasive species barriers is often evaluated in pond and field scales using high-resolution telemetry data. Telemetry data sets can be a rich source of data about fish movement and behavior but can be difficult to analyze due to the size of these data sets as well as their irregular sampling intervals. Due to the challenges, most barrier studies only use summary endpoints, such as barrier passage counts or average (e.g., mean or median) fish distance from the barrier, to describe the data. To examine more fine-scale fish movement patterns, we developed a first-order Markov chain. We then used this model to help understand the impacts of a barrier on fish behavior. For our study system, we used data from a previous study examining how bighead and silver carp (two invasive fish species in the United States) responded to a carbon dioxide (CO2) barrier in a pond. Considerations for management. Based upon our findings, management considerations include: Markov chains can be used to describe and quantify movement patterns of aquatic organisms responding to barriers. These models provide insight not possible with previously used summary approaches. The CO2 barrier changed both the locations of fish and movement patterns of fish. The changes in movement were not captured using conventional endpoints. Specifically, fish had less random movement patterns during periods of CO2 exposure. This provides evidence that bighead and silver carp actively avoided areas with CO2 and also shows that our approach can help assess random versus nonrandom movements. © 2020 The Authors.

From statistical fitting of the near band edge (NBE) emission region of the spectra, it is observed that the acceptor exciton (A, X) emissions decrease with an increase in temperature for ZnO rod structures, whereas comparatively less variation is recorded for ZnO tubular structures. Employing various mathematical analyses, the emission patterns observed for tubular structures are concluded to arise from their lattice dilation and the electron-phonon interactions.

These increases will hamper the global effort to reach the climate target set by the Paris Agreement as most of these vehicles will be fossil-fuel powered. Urban carsharing is a Transport Demand Management measure that can reduce and delay vehicle purchasing. However, little has been reported on its utilization, particularly in the context of developing countries. This study provides empirical results on how a dominantly station-based carsharing service in Bangkok city, Thailand, is utilized. We analyzed the data generated by the service to provide descriptive information on the users' behavior. We also clustered the users into three groups; frequent users, typical car renters, and young car sharers to provide new insights into how carsharing is utilized by the Bangkokians. The outcomes provide a reference case for future studies and support policy-making to promote carsharing in a similar context. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Cluster analysis; Developing countries; Fossil fuels; Carsharing; China and India; Climate targets; Descriptive information; Developing cities; Rapid rate; Support policy; Transport demand management; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099540054

Increasing global temperatures leave coastal locations in particular, vulnerable to impacts that include rising sea levels and more extreme and variable weather events. Stress can be acute for small coastal communities located in the Circumpolar North, where a lack of capacity and awareness along with institutional constraints, can exacerbate vulnerability. Given that continued climate change is inevitable regardless of the extent of mitigative action, adaptation is a necessity. In northern regions, there is evidence that adaptation planning is occurring in response to observed climate stressors, with structural (or hard) adaptation approaches prevalent across the sensitive coastline. However, structural adaptations are often associated with several drawbacks and may not be suitable, particularly in a region that is facing rapid rates of warming, enhanced exposures, and significant environmental and socio-economic constraints. To enhance resilience, small northern coastal communities should adopt a diversified portfolio of adaptations that incorporate more sustainable non-structural and ecosystem-based (or soft) adaptation approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate impacts; Climate policy; Climate resilience; Community planning; Northern communities","adaptive management; climate effect; coastal zone; environmental policy; local participation; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089444533

No-till has elevated levels of carbon at the soil surface compared to intensively tilled soils. The introduction of crop diversification in agricultural systems increases soil carbon protection and aggregate stability. Thus, the association of no-till with crop diversification may change the soil microbial distribution and enhance activity in comparison with tilled soils with no crop diversification. We tested this hypothesis assessing the soil microbial community and enzyme activity in a long-term (32 yr) experiment with contrasting soil management (no-tillage, (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)) and cropping systems in southern Brazil. Long-term NT increased microbial biomass at 0–5 cm. In contrast, soil microbial biomass was higher in deeper soil layers (10–30 cm) of CT. No-tillage and crop diversification increased the activity of β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. The benefits of an intensified/diversified crop rotation were offset by soil tillage. The higher abundance of PLFA groups at 0–5 cm and 10–30 cm of respective NT and CT soils were correlated with increased C and nutrient levels (N, Ca2+, Mg2+) and decreased Al3+. Highlights: Crop diversification increased the soil microbial biomass and individual PLFA groups. No-till without crop diversification did not change microbial biomass.

Samples were collected daily and analyzed for their chemical composition, specifically, the carbonaceous (elemental and organic carbon) and water-soluble ionic (Cl-, NO3 -, SO4 2-, Na+, NH4 +, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) components. Additionally, the secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) as well as the secondary and primary organic carbon (SOC and POC, respectively) content was estimated. To identify the causes of elevated PM2.5 concentrations, the contributions of these chemical species were further investigated, and the role of meteorological factors was also examined. During the measurement period, PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 50 μg m-3 were recorded on 38 days, and 7 pollution episodes were detected. Such events, however, were observed only in the heating season, when stable meteorological conditions (low air temperatures, weak winds, high relative humidity and lack of precipitation) and increased emissions of PM and its precursors from anthropogenic sources favored the accumulation of pollutants. The PM2.5 was dominated by carbonaceous aerosol, especially POC, although the SOC rose significantly during high pollution periods. Furthermore, the fraction of SIA clearly decreased as the concentration of PM2.5 increased, and its variability was greatly affected by regional and/or long-range transport events. Our results can help guide the development of effective strategies for reducing air pollution from fine particulate matter. Such control measures are particularly important in Poland, where PM2.5 concentrations remain high compared to many European countries. © The Author's institution.","Carbonaceous aerosol; High pollution days; Meteorology; PM2.5; Primary and secondary organic carbon; Secondary inorganic aerosol","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric temperature; Chemical analysis; Organic carbon; Anthropogenic sources; Elemental and organic carbons; Fine particulate matter; High relative humidities; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Primary organic carbons; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; chemical composition; meteorology; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution incidence; weather station; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095421324

This raises questions for management authorities, not only regarding the ecological integrity of protected areas but also regarding wildlife that ‘escape’ and cause damage. The protected area is traditionally the primary responsibility of the management authority, but the introduction of charismatic and potentially damage-causing wildlife touches on the overlapping and shared commercial interests of the tourism industry and the neighbouring rural communities. As climate change manifests, the complex relationship between these three stakeholders is likely to become strained by the increased frequency of damage caused by wildlife as they attempt to move out of or expand their home ranges beyond the boundaries of the protected area. It is concluded that a laissez-faire approach to climate change by conservation authorities or protected area managers is likely to be problematic – particularly with respect to relationships with neighbouring rural communities. A greater awareness of climate change impacts among all stakeholders is required, including conservation agencies, the tourism industry and neighbouring rural communities and managing escaped wildlife should become a joint responsibility which is founded on a contractual agreement between these stakeholders. © 2020, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

We use the contingent valuation method to estimate the costs to drivers of Beijing's driving restrictions program, one of the world's largest. Our study generates three main findings. First, costs are substantial: RMB 356 to 709 (US $54 to $107) per driver per year, which represents 0.5 to 1 percent of annual income, and RMB 1.6 billion to 3.3 billion (US $247 million to $493 million) per year for all drivers. Second, comparison of our cost estimates with estimates of the benefits of Beijing's program from other studies suggests that the benefits exceed the costs. Finally, the costs per driver are significantly smaller than the costs (estimated using the same methods) of Mexico City's program, which by most accounts has had zero benefits. These findings provide some of the strongest evidence to date that driving restrictions programs can, given certain conditions, have net benefits. They also suggest that relatively high program costs are not a necessary condition for significant program benefits—in fact, the opposite may be true. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Command-and-control; Contingent valuation; Driving restrictions; Regulatory cost; Stated preference; Transportation","Cost estimating; Developing countries; Economic analysis; License plates (automobile); Pollution control; Traffic congestion; Contingent valuation methods; Contingent valuations; Driving restrictions; Megacities; Mexico City; Cost benefit analysis; atmospheric pollution; contingent valuation; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; megacity; traffic congestion; Beijing [China]; China; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090009321

For decades, global climate models have predicted it as between approximately 2 and 4.5 °C. However, a large subset of models participating in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project predict values exceeding 5 °C. The difference has been attributed to the radiative effects of clouds, which are better captured in these models, but the underlying physical mechanism and thus how realistic such high climate sensitivities are remain unclear. Here we analyse Community Earth System Model simulations and find that, as the climate warms, the progressive reduction of ice content in clouds relative to liquid leads to increased reflectivity and a negative feedback that restrains climate warming, in particular over the Southern Ocean. However, once the clouds are predominantly liquid, this negative feedback vanishes. Thereafter, other positive cloud feedback mechanisms dominate, leading to a transition to a high-sensitivity climate state. Although the exact timing and magnitude of the transition may be model dependent, our findings suggest that the state dependence of the cloud-phase feedbacks is a crucial factor in the evolution of Earth’s climate sensitivity with warming. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"air temperature; climate modeling; CMIP; equilibrium; global climate; numerical model; radiative forcing; reflectivity; warming; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094101567

Within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China, where there are severe air quality problems, several municipalities have begun implementing a coal-to-electricity program that bans residential coal and provides subsidies for electricity and electric-powered heat pumps. We used GEOS-Chem to evaluate two complete residential coal-to-electricity transitions—a Beijing-off scenario and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-off scenario—each relative to a base case. We estimate that within China, the ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reductions in the Beijing-off scenario could lead to 1,900 (95% CI: 1,200-2,700) premature deaths avoided annually, while the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-off scenario could lead to 13,700 (95% CI: 8,900-19,600) premature deaths avoided annually. Additionally, we estimate that the residential-coal-ban scenarios will result in a positive top-of-the-atmosphere aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) (model domain average: Beijing-off: 0.023 W m-2; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-off: 0.30 W m-2) and a negligible cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect (AIE) (Beijing-off: 0.0001 W m-2; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-off: 0.0027 W m-2). To evaluate the uncertainty of the radiative effects, we calculated the DRE under four black-carbon mixing-state assumptions and both the DRE and AIE assuming three different black-carbon-to-organic-aerosol (BC:OA) ratios for residential-coal emissions. Although the magnitude of our radiative forcing estimates varied across sensitivity cases, the domain average remained positive. When only considering the aerosol-related effects of the aforementioned coal-ban scenarios, we predict substantial health benefits, but do not anticipate a climate “co-benefit”, because removing aerosol emissions leads to a warming tendency. However, if the coal-to-electricity program results in less net greenhouse gas emissions due to the replacement heaters, the policy may be able to achieve health and climate “co-benefits”. © The Author(s).","Air pollution; PM2.5-related mortality; Radiative forcing; Residential emissions","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health; Housing; Organic carbon; Aerosol emissions; Aerosol indirect effect; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Radiative effects; Radiative forcings; Residential coals; Top of the atmospheres; Coal; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; estimation method; health impact; mortality; radiation exposure; resident population; risk factor; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095407497

Emission of coal dust from the coal wagons cause contamination of atmosphere and territory adjacent to the railway track. Different ways to reduce coal dust emission from the wagon are used in the world. Unfortunately, in Ukraine, this problem is far from solution and there is no serious research work in this field. The aim of this work was laboratory study of coal dust emission from the wagon model which had different barriers installed on the wagon. Laboratory experiments were carried for coal wagon without barrier and for coal wagon which had barriers of two types. Barrier of the first type had downwind wing. Barrier of the second type had upwind wing. The contamination zones, concentration near the model were studied. The obtained results illustrate that installation of barriers influence intensity of transport corridor contamination. Also a numerical model was developed to estimate wind flow and coal dust dispersion from the coal wagon. Equation of potential flow and equation of coal dust dispersion were used. Implicit difference schemes of splitting were used for numerical simulation of governing equations. Results of numerical experiment, which were performed, are presented. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099162531

This research studies the region of Andalusia (south of Spain). A cluster analysis is applied to 786 Andalusian municipalities, and 4 groups are established according to the potential of adaptive strategies. A town is chosen from each group, and an hourly specific study is conducted for the last 20 years, as well as a daily study of the old time series by using an artificial neural network based on the existing climate data. The possibility of application of the EN 16798–1:2019 standard during the days of the year is analysed, as well as the possibilities of using natural ventilation and the possibility of using adaptive setpoint temperatures in comparison with both 3 fixed heating temperatures and 3 fixed cooling temperatures by considering the energy saving. The results to apply the standard ranged 69.0 and 100% of the days of each year. The possibilities of natural ventilation considered were greater than 10% of the hours of the year in all the assumptions. The energy saving of cooling degrees reveals a greater potential in the area studied than that of heating degrees; this tendency is supported by the study of old temporary series which are part of the climate variation predicted throughout the 21st century. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive comfort; Adaptive setpoint temperature; Andalusia; Energy saving; Natural ventilation","Cluster analysis; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ventilation; Adaptive comfort models; Adaptive strategy; Cooling temperature; Determinant factors; Heating temperatures; Natural ventilation; Reduce energy consumption; Set-point temperatures; Energy conservation; building; energy conservation; energy use; heating; temperature profile; ventilation; Andalucia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091332201

(2017) presented a mathematical programming model that identifies minimum-cost control strategies that reduce emissions regionally to meet ambient air quality targets. This project introduces the Cost And Benefit Optimization Tool for Ozone (CABOT-O3), which extends the previous model by updating emissions and air quality relationships, adding a health impacts module, and quantifying distributional impacts. The tool draws upon source apportionment photochemical air quality modeling to characterize the contribution of emissions reductions to ambient ozone concentrations across the contiguous United States. The health impacts analysis module estimates the change in the number and economic value of premature deaths using modeled changes in ozone levels resulting from the application of emission control strategies. These extensions allow us to evaluate strategies to attain ozone air quality standards at minimum cost or to maximize net benefit, while assessing the change in the distribution of health impacts. In a case study applied to stationary pollution sources, we find that, when compared to minimizing costs to meet a uniform ozone standard, maximizing net benefits results in greater emissions and ozone concentration reductions in some parts of the country and fewer in others.

Objectives: We examined temporal changes in the risk of emergency department (ED) visits for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and asthma associated with short-term increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Los Angeles, California. Methods: Poisson log-linear models with unconstrained distributed exposure lags were used to estimate the risk of CVD and asthma ED visits associated with short-term increases in daily PM2.5 concentrations, controlling for temporal and meteorological confounders. The models were run separately for three predefined time periods, which were selected based on the implementation of multiple emissions control programs (EARLY: 2005–2008; MIDDLE: 2009–2012; LATE: 2013–2016). Two-pollutant models with individual PM2.5 components and the remaining PM2.5 mass were also considered to assess the influence of changes in PM2.5 composition on changes in the risk of CVD and asthma ED visits associated with PM2.5 over time. Results: The relative risk of CVD ED visits associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in 4-day PM2.5 concentration (lag 0–3) was higher in the LATE period (rate ratio = 1.020, 95% confidence interval = [1.010, 1.030]) compared to the EARLY period (1.003, [0.996, 1.010]). In contrast, for asthma, relative risk estimates were largest in the EARLY period (1.018, [1.006, 1.029]), but smaller in the following periods. Similar temporal differences in relative risk estimates for CVD and asthma were observed among different age and season groups. No single component was identified as an obvious contributor to the changing risk estimates over time, and some components exhibited different temporal patterns in risk estimates from PM2.5 total mass, such as a decreased risk of CVD ED visits associated with sulfate over time. Conclusions: Temporal changes in the risk of CVD and asthma ED visits associated with short-term increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations were observed. These changes could be related to changes in PM2.5 composition (e.g., an increasing fraction of organic carbon and a decreasing fraction of sulfate in PM2.5). Other factors such as improvements in healthcare and differential exposure misclassification might also contribute to the changes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Asthma; CVD; Particulate matter; Toxicity; Trends","nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur oxide; volatile organic compound; asthma; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; emission control; health care; health risk; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; adverse outcome; aged; air pollution; Article; asthma; California; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; congestive heart failure; controlled study; disease association; emergency ward; female; heart arrhythmia; human; ICD-10; ICD-9; ischemic heart disease; loglinear model; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; epidemiology; hospital emergency service; particulate matter; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Emergency Service, Hospital; Los Angeles; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089385855

Despite significant effort from aid agencies, it is not clear how aid is received and distributed at local level in recipient countries. This paper highlights some of the challenges associated with funding obtained and utilised particularly to address climate change adaptation via case study of Kathmandu, Nepal. This empirical research is funded by the Government of Australia. This research draws on PhD research including a review of the literature and in-depth interviews with governing actors such as local planners in Kathmandu, climate experts, academics, and community members. The study focused on understanding the impacts of international and aid agency investment in climate action at the local urban scale. Key findings reveal that over the past decade significant resources were spent in capacity building programs nationally, but with limited contribution at the level of local adaptation in the urban regions. Local governing agencies and authorities have little capacity to address urban scale needs. Results of the study suggest that the process of distributing aid funding and evaluation of its impact is not transparent. This raised a number of questions around the legitimacy of governing climate change adaptation programs from the top down. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","actors; adaptation; Aid agencies; climate finance; climate funding; developing countries; local climate governance; sustainable goals","Sustainable development; Capacity building; Climate change adaptation; Developing nations; Empirical research; In-depth interviews; Kathmandu , Nepal; Local adaptation; National governments; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097136291

The enzyme is known to be allosterically inhibited by SAM for decades, but the importance of this regulatory control to one-carbon metabolism has never been adequately understood. To shed light on this issue, we exchanged selected amino acid residues in a highly conserved stretch within the regulatory region of yeast MTHFR to create a series of feedback-insensitive, deregulated mutants. These were exploited to investigate the impact of defective allosteric regulation on one-carbon metabolism. We observed a strong growth defect in the presence of methionine. Biochemical and metabolite analysis revealed that both the folate and methionine cycles were affected in these mutants, as was the transsulfuration pathway, leading also to a disruption in redox homeostasis. The major consequences, however, appeared to be in the depletion of nucleotides. 13C isotope labeling and metabolic studies revealed that the deregulated MTHFR cells undergo continuous transmethylation of homocysteine by methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) to form methionine. This reaction also drives SAM formation and further depletes ATP reserves. SAM was then cycled back to methionine, leading to futile cycles of SAM synthesis and recycling and explaining the necessity for MTHFR to be regulated by SAM. The study has yielded valuable new insights into the regulation of one-carbon metabolism, and the mutants appear as powerful new tools to further dissect out the intersection of one-carbon metabolism with various pathways both in yeasts and in humans. © 2020 Bhatia et al.",,"Amino acids; Carbon; Defects; Metabolites; Nucleotides; Yeast; Allosteric inhibition; Allosteric regulation; Amino acid residues; Feedback-insensitive; Metabolite analysis; Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; Regulatory control; Regulatory regions; Metabolism; 5 methyltetrahydrofolic acid; 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2); glutathione; methionine; ademetionine; adenosine triphosphate; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH2); MTHFR protein, human; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; acid hydrolysis; allosterism; Article; biosynthesis; carbon metabolism; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; feedback system; fungal cell; isotope labeling; mass fragmentography; molecular cloning; molecular docking; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; site directed mutagenesis; allosterism; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; human; metabolism; methylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allosteric Regulation; Humans; Methylation; Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2); S-Adenosylmethionine; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092483713

This article proposes an econometric analysis of the effectiveness of RE policies, based on panel data for 20 Latin American and 30 European countries, over 20 years. The results converge for the influence of promotion policies in general: they have a positive and statistically significant effect on RE investment, being the principal determinant in both regions.

Carbon, hydrogen, and methane were taken as reducing agents. The equilibrium concentrations of the system components were determined by varying the consumption of reducing agents and the process temperature. The change in these concentrations at the boundaries of individual temperature regions was regarded as a result of the passage of corresponding chemical reactions in them. At the same time, it was noted that reactions of the non-variant type begin and end at the same fixed temperatures. Calculations showed that the Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 transformation in all cases was thermodynamically possible at temperatures exceeding 65°C. Consequently, it will be realized without complications at the furnace operating temperatures. The second stage of reduction also proceeded according to the unified scheme Fe3O4 → Fe, bypassing the participation of FeO oxide in it. The temperature of the beginning of the iron reduction by the C, H2, and CH4 components was 680, 350, and 520°C, respectively. In this case, only direct reduction of iron by the indicated components took place. An attempt to record the fact of indirect reduction using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent was unsuccessful even at its high consumption. Carbon monoxide decomposed at low temperatures according to the Boudouard-Bell reaction. Therefore, iron was reduced by “sooty” carbon, i.e., also by a direct method. At the final stage of the carbon-thermal process, depending on the composition of the system, the formation of iron carbide at 720°C can occur with its possible subsequent transformation back into iron, as well as the secondary oxidation of iron with the formation of wustite. Carbon dioxide takes an active part in these reactions. The reduction (or oxidative) efficiency of all elements and components of the Fe–O–C–H system is numerically estimated based on the calculation results of chemical processes at high temperatures. With a high degree of reliability, this allowed predicting the phase composition of the reaction products at the maximal process temperature (1500°C). © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.","blast furnace; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; chemical reaction; hematite; iron reduction; magnetite; phase diagram","Carbides; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon monoxide; Hematite; Magnetite; Reducing agents; Bauman moscow state technical universities; Boudouard-Bell reactions; Calculation results; Degree of reliability; Equilibrium concentration; Operating temperature; Process temperature; Secondary oxidation; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102444183

Through microclimate simulations of a neighbourhood in Brampton, Ontario, this study investigates the trade-offs between large-scale deployments of rooftop PV, street trees, and cool roofs. The performance of each intervention is compared by examining the impact on the PV efficiency (and the produced electricity) and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) values. The study shows that street trees can reduce the energy output of rooftop PV significantly depending on their height and location, and it confirms the need for solar access laws, currently missing in Ontario. Further, this study shows that a large adoption of rooftop PV instead of cool roofs can result in an outdoor environment up to 0.5 °C higher in terms of UTCI during heatwave periods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cell temperature; ENVI-met; Heatwave; Microclimate; Outdoor thermal comfort; Photovoltaics","Economic and social effects; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic effects; Roofs; Energy output; Large-scale deployment; Outdoor environment; Outdoor thermal comfort; Photovoltaics; PV efficiencies; Urban forestry; Urban heat island; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087941370

A potent bacterial chassis for the production of active cellulosomes displayed on the cell surface is the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, a lactic acid bacterium used in many applications. Here, we developed a methodological pipeline to produce improved designer cellulosomes, using a cell-consortium approach, whereby the different components self-assemble on the surface of L. plantarum. The pipeline served as a vehicle to select and optimize the secretion efficiency of potent designer cellulosome enzyme components, to screen for the most efficient enzymatic combinations and to assess attempts to grow the engineered bacterial cells on wheat straw as a sole carbon source. Using this strategy, we were able to improve the secretion efficiency of the selected enzymes and to secrete a fully functional high-molecular-weight scaffoldin component. The adaptive laboratory process served to increase significantly the enzymatic activity of the most efficient cell consortium. Internal plasmid re-arrangement towards a higher enzymatic performance attested for the suitability of the approach, which suggests that this strategy represents an efficient way for microbes to adapt to changing conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

We choose as proxies for R&amp;D and for foreign R&amp;D spillovers, resident patents (RP) and non-resident patents (NRP), respectively. We use annual data for the USA spanning the period 1980–2016. We show the presence of a long-run relationship between NRP, RP, RE, fossil energy consumption (FE), net energy imports (NEI), gross domestic product (GDP), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. There are long-run unidirectional Granger causalities running from all considered variables to economic growth. There are short-run unidirectional causalities running from NEI to all considered variables except RP and GDP, from GDP to RP and RE, from FE to RE, and from carbon emissions to RE. By using the autoregressive distributed lag approach, several long-run elasticities are evaluated. In particular, RP increases carbon emissions, whereas NRP reduces it. Both RP and NRP have a positive impact on RE and GDP. RP and NRP seem to be complementary activities, and RE reduces NEI. Therefore, the US authorities should encourage the use of NRP because of their beneficial effect on pollution, home innovation, renewable energy consumption, and economic growth. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic growth; Non-resident patents; Renewable energy consumption; Resident patents","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; economic growth; energy use; fossil fuel; Granger causality test; innovation; research and development; spillover effect; United States; carbon dioxide; economic development; fossil; gross national product; pollution; renewable energy; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Fossils; Gross Domestic Product; Renewable Energy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088041117

This study aimed to investigate the impact of this land-use change on the AMF species composition and diversity in southern Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from nine plots in each of three land-use types: native forest, agroforestry, and khat monocropping. The plots of the three land-use types were located adjacent to each other for each of the nine replicates. Three 10 × 10m subplots per plot were sampled. AMF spores were extracted from the soil samples, spore densities were determined, and species composition and diversity were evaluated through morphological analysis. Both spore density and species richness were statistically significantly higher in the native forest than in the agroforestry plots with no clear difference to khat, whereas the true diversity (exponential of Shannon–Wiener diversity index) did not differ among the three land-use types due to high evenness among the species in agroforestry. In total, 37 AMF morphotypes belonging to 12 genera in Glomeromycota were found, dominated by members of the genera Acaulospora and Glomus. The highest isolation frequency index (78%) was recorded for Acaulospora koskei from native forest. Consequently, the agroforestry system did not appear to aid in preserving the AMF species richness of native forests relative to perennial monocropping, such as khat cultivation. In contrast, the native forest areas can serve as in situ genetic reserves of mycorrhizal symbionts adapted to the local vegetative, edaphic, and microbial conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Agroforestry; Cordia africana; Khat; Land-use type; Native forest; Species diversity","agricultural land; agroforestry; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; community structure; fungus; monoculture; native species; species diversity; species evenness; species richness; Ethiopia; Acaulospora; Acaulospora koskei; Catha edulis; Cordia africana; Fungi; Glomeromycota; Glomus; biodiversity; Ethiopia; forest; fungus spore; microbiology; mycorrhiza; soil; Biodiversity; Ethiopia; Forests; Mycorrhizae; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Spores, Fungal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090950329

The impact of human emissions on indoor air quality is inadequately understood. The aim of the Indoor Chemical Human Emissions and Reactivity (ICHEAR) project was to examine the impact on indoor air chemistry of whole-body, exhaled, and dermally emitted human bioeffluents under different conditions comprising human factors (t-shirts/shorts vs long-sleeve shirts/pants; age: teenagers, young adults, and seniors) and a variety of environmental factors (moderate vs high air temperature; low vs high relative humidity; presence vs absence of ozone). A series of human subject experiments were performed in a well-controlled stainless steel climate chamber. State-of-the-art measurement technologies were used to quantify the volatile organic compounds emitted by humans and their total OH reactivity; ammonia, nanoparticle, fluorescent biological aerosol particle (FBAP), and microbial emissions; and skin surface chemistry. This paper presents the design of the project, its methodologies, and preliminary results, comparing identical measurements performed with five groups, each composed of 4 volunteers (2 males and 2 females). The volunteers wore identical laundered new clothes and were asked to use the same set of fragrance-free personal care products. They occupied the ozone-free (<2 ppb) chamber for 3 hours (morning) and then left for a 10-min lunch break. Ozone (target concentration in occupied chamber ~35 ppb) was introduced 10 minutes after the volunteers returned to the chamber, and the measurements continued for another 2.5 hours. Under a given ozone condition, relatively small differences were observed in the steady-state concentrations of geranyl acetone, 6MHO, and 4OPA between the five groups. Larger variability was observed for acetone and isoprene. The absence or presence of ozone significantly influenced the steady-state concentrations of acetone, geranyl acetone, 6MHO, and 4OPA. Results of replicate experiments demonstrate the robustness of the experiments. Higher repeatability was achieved for dermally emitted compounds and their reaction products than for constituents of exhaled breath. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One consequence of fluorescence intermittency occurring on time scales longer than the exciton decay time is the so-called delayed photon emission, manifested by a long radiative decay component. Besides their dominant fast radiative decay, fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit a long fluorescence decay component at cryogenic temperatures that is often attributed to the decay of the dark exciton. Here, we show that its origin is delayed photon emission by investigating temporal variations in fluorescence intensity and concomitant decay times found in single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots. We attribute the different intensity levels of the intensity trace to a rapid switching between a high-intensity exciton state and an Auger-reduced low-intensity trion state that occurs when the excitation is sufficiently strong. Surprisingly, we observe that the exponent of this power-law-dependent delayed emission is correlated with the emission intensity, which cannot be explained with existing charge carrier trapping models. Our analysis reveals that the long decay component is mainly governed by delayed emission, which is present in both the exciton and trion state. The absence of a fine structure in trions clarifies the vanishing role of the dark exciton state for the long decay component. Our findings are essential for the development of a complete photophysical model that captures all observed features of fluorescence variations in colloidal nanocrystals. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Blinking; Delayed emission; Fluorescence intermittency; Nanocrystals; Perovskites; Quantum dots","Bromine compounds; Excited states; Excitons; Fluorescence; Lead compounds; Nanocrystals; Perovskite; Photons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Charge carrier trapping; Colloidal nanocrystals; Cryogenic temperatures; Fluorescence decays; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence intermittency; Photon emission rate; Photophysical models; Cesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096679273

Conventional wisdom holds that, of the possible cost paths, gradually raising costs relating to climate action will receive the most public support. Here, we explore mass support for dynamic cost paths in four major economies (France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States). We find that, for a given level of average costs, increasing cost paths receive little support whereas constant cost schedules are backed by majorities in all countries irrespective of whether those average costs are low or high.

A proper heating system and improvement of the energy efficiency of residential dwellings are vitally important for Ulaanbaatar city to reduce air pollution as well as for the operation of the current central energy system. This study shows the experimental results for two gers with two different heating systems and different thermal insulation, for investigating the merits of each. The technical feasibility of the system consisting of an electric thermal storage (ETS) heater with a daytime charging schedule and areal photovoltaic (PV) system was also examined by using a simulation with software developed in MATLAB (R2020a, MathWorks, USA). As a result of the experiment, the indoor comfort level and energy efficiency of the ger with added insulation and an ETS heater with nighttime charging were shown to be enhanced compared with those of the reference ger. The ger with added insulation and the ETS heater consumed 3169 kWh for electric appliances and 5989 kWh for the heating season. The simulation showed that the PV self-consumption rate is 76% for the Ger 2 with the ETS heater because of the daytime charging schedule of the ETS heater. The PV system supplied 31% of the total energy consumed, with the remaining 69% from the main grid. © 2020 by the authors.

Nonetheless, the carbon intensity (CI) of the energy sources involved in the electricity generation system could seriously compromise this solution. Hence, this study proposes a methodology to verify the sustainability of the sector by the introduction of EVs. By means of the “Well-to-Wheel” tool, it compares emissions generated by two fleets: one based on internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and another one that also contemplates different EVs penetration levels. This methodology develops an iterative process on the contribution of renewable sources to the electricity generation system until a certain level of emissions reduction is achieved. The needed evolution of the CI for the electricity system is therefore deduced. The methodology has been applied to Spain by the mid-term future, given these country policies for both a high penetration of EVs and a progressive introduction of renewable sources in its electricity system. Results indicate that the current Spanish electricity mix allows for a reduction in CO2 emissions by the introduction of EVs, but a 100% renewable system will be needed for reductions up to 74 million tons per year. This research is a first-ever study to relate the forecasted Spanish environmental policies, in terms of urban transport and configuration of the power system, with a sustainable introduction of EVs in the urban fleet. Hence, this paper would be very helpful for policy makers on evaluation of the requirements for a transport fleet electrification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Electric vehicle; Electricity system; Renewable sources; Well-to-wheel","Emission control; Environmental protection; Iterative methods; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity system; Electricity-generation system; Emissions reduction; Environmental policy; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Renewable generation; Transport emissions; Electric power generation; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electricity generation; renewable resource; traffic emission; urban transport; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091635004

Identifying which microenvironments contribute most to exposure can pinpoint effective exposure reduction strategies and mitigate adverse health impacts. Methods: This work uses real-time sensors to assess the exposures of children with asthma (N = 39) in Shanghai, quantifying microenvironmental exposure to PM2.5 and O3. An air cleaner was deployed in participants’ bedrooms where we hypothesized exposure could be most efficiently reduced. Monitoring occurred for two 48-h periods: one with bedroom filtration (portable air cleaner with HEPA and activated carbon filters) and the other without. Results: Children spent 91% of their time indoors with the majority spent in their bedroom (47%). Without filtration, the bedroom and classroom environments were the largest contributors to PM2.5 exposure. With filtration, bedroom PM2.5 exposure was reduced by 75% (45% of total exposure). Although filtration status did not impact O3, the largest contribution of O3 exposure also came from the bedroom. Conclusions: Actions taken to reduce bedroom PM2.5 and O3 concentrations can most efficiently reduce total exposure. As real-time pollutant monitors become more accessible, similar analyses can be used to evaluate new interventions and optimize exposure reductions for a variety of populations. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Air quality; Children’s health; Exposure assessment; Exposure sensors; Indoor environment; Monitoring methods","ozone; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; child; China; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; filtration; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; China; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Filtration; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091299279

Barriers to grassroots implementation of national and international policies are inexorably linked to local contexts, and in-depth understanding of these barriers is crucial in areas greatly impacted by climate change. This research applied an empirical mixed-methods approach to identify the barriers to implementing grassroots climate resilience in the Araucanía Region in central-southern Chile. Data was collected in the form of expert interviews, 454 questionnaires of community members, community focus group discussions, and historical climate data for the region. The need to strengthen local-level implementation persists in the Araucanía Region. Barriers to implementation include limited horizontal and multi-sectoral governance, and inadequate allocation of human and financial resources at the local level. The majority of community members expressed that they had some (71% n = 322) or a lot (10% n = 47) of climate change knowledge, with 91% (n = 409) indicating that their community is impacted by climate change, and half correctly perceived changes in several climate-related hazards. However, a misconception held by experts regarding community knowledge represents a barrier that limits opportunities for leveraging community willingness to take action, and impedes the inclusion of community priorities into national policies. Opportunities exist to strengthen grassroots climate resilience by adopting a coherent approach which links DRR and CCA/M to key community concerns in sustainable development. National and regional actors need to work closely with municipal governments to mobilize synergies and foster meaningful grassroots action. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change adaptation and mitigation; Disaster risk reduction; Policy implementation; resilience; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087112551

Rapidly evolving gridded agronomic models can facilitate these efforts throughout Europe. However, their performance in modelling soil carbon dynamics at regional scale is yet unexplored. Importantly, as such models are often driven by large-scale inputs, they need to be benchmarked against field experiments. We elucidate the level of detail that needs to be incorporated in gridded models to robustly estimate regional soil carbon dynamics in managed cropland, testing the approach for regions in the Czech Republic. We first calibrated the biogeochemical Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model against long-term experiments. Subsequently, we examined the EPIC model within a top-down gridded modelling framework constructed for European agricultural soils from Europe-wide datasets and regional land-use statistics. We explored the top-down, as opposed to a bottom-up, modelling approach for reporting agronomically relevant and verifiable soil carbon dynamics. In comparison with a no-input baseline, the regional EPIC model suggested soil carbon changes (~0.1–0.5 Mg C ha−1 y−1) consistent with empirical-based studies for all studied agricultural practices. However, inaccurate soil information, crop management inputs, or inappropriate model calibration may undermine regional modelling of cropland management effect on carbon since each of the three components carry uncertainty (~0.5–1.5 Mg C ha−1 y−1) that is substantially larger than the actual effect of agricultural practices relative to the no-input baseline. Besides, inaccurate soil data obtained from the background datasets biased the simulated carbon trends compared to observations, thus hampering the model's verifiability at the locations of field experiments. Encouragingly, the top-down agricultural management derived from regional land-use statistics proved suitable for the estimation of soil carbon dynamics consistently with actual field practices. Despite sensitivity to biophysical parameters, we found a robust scalability of the soil organic carbon routine for various climatic regions and soil types represented in the Czech experiments. The model performed better than the tier 1 methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which indicates a great potential for improved carbon change modelling over larger political regions. © 2020 The Authors","Crop management; EPIC-IIASA; Gridded agronomic modelling; Long-term field experiments; Soil data; Uncertainty analysis","organic carbon; carbon; agricultural land; agricultural soil; benchmarking; carbon storage; experimental study; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; numerical model; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil type; agricultural management; alfalfa; Article; barley; bulk density; carbon dynamics; comparative study; crop management; crop rotation; cropland; Czech Republic; environmental policy; experiment; field experiment; forage; grain; land use; maize; manure; monoculture; nonhuman; oat; observation; plant residue; potato; rapeseed; regionalization; rice; rye; soybean; sugar beet; sunflower; winter wheat; agriculture; crop; Europe; soil; Czech Republic; Agriculture; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Czech Republic; Europe; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089411895

Any prediction of this experiment's results may be obvious to science, as it was totally expected, the air quality has improved substantially. Simply stated, it comes as no surprise. The lockdown has made it possible to quantify the limit of decrease in pollution in light of this drastic reduction in traffic, in Madrid and Barcelona showed a significant decrease of the order of 75%. In the case of Spain's two largest cities, the reductions of NO2 concentrations were 62% and 50%, respectively. Hourly measurements were obtained from 24 and 9 air quality stations from the monitoring networks during the month of March 2020. These results allow us to see the limits that can be achieved by implementing low emission zones (LEZ), as well as the amount of contamination that must be eliminated, which in the cases of Madrid and Barcelona, represent 55%.

The most frequently reported negative impact is a deterioration in urban air quality. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the city lockdown policy in response to Covid-19 on air quality in Shanghai Municipality, China, and sought to identify a balance point between human activities and improving air quality. The first-level response (FLR) by Shanghai to control the spread of Covid-19 was to launch a lockdown, which remained in place from 24 January to 23 March, 2020. We compared airborne pollutant concentrations in different regions (downtown, suburbs) of Shanghai city in three periods (Pre-FLR, During-FLR, and Post-FLR) and in the corresponding periods in the previous year. The results showed that air quality improved significantly During-FLR compared with Pre-FLR, with the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO all decreasing significantly. The concentrations of all pollutants except O3 also decreased significantly compared with the same period in the previous year. There were also some differences in pollutant concentrations between the downtown region and the suburbs of Shanghai. However, we found that the concentrations of pollutants rebounded gradually when the restrictions on human activities ended after two months of lockdown. This study provides empirical evidence of the important effect of limiting human activities on air quality. For sustainable and clean future urban management in Shanghai and beyond, central government policy regulations requiring a low-carbon lifestyle and cleaner production in industries should be established. © 2020 by the authors.

It is highly likely that a significant portion of climate change is anthropogenic. Large and rapid climatic changes have the potential to generate significant discomfort and even hazard to occupants. Well designed, constructed and managed buildings protect people from adverse climatic conditions and provide indoor spaces that foster well-being, health and productivity. Changing climatic conditions require innovative approaches to the design, building, management and use of comfortable and safe indoor environments. This study explores innovative approaches to reducing/avoiding climate-change-induced overheating in residential buildings in Northern Europe (Sweden and Germany), with a focus on managing heat loads during the summer season. Different approaches and measures are discussed, with relevance to building retrofitting and new construction. It is shown that the need for active cooling can be significantly reduced through good building design and smart climate control. Innovative insolation management devices are further shown to have the potential to reduce both winter heating and summer cooling loads. The study also explores the extent to which the intensity of urban heat islands can be reduced by addressing heat storage in the building structure. Innovative approaches to solar shading and heat protection are discussed as alternatives to heat load and indoor climate management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Atmospheric temperature; Climate control; Heat storage; Sustainable development; Thermal load; Building retrofitting; Building structure; Climatic conditions; Global climate changes; Indoor environment; Innovative approaches; Outdoor temperature; Residential building; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097250536

Worldwide, the problem of atmospheric pollution from maritime traffic is a poorly researched area, especially when this type of traffic is continuously growing. On the example of Port Split, the paper aims to present the following emission, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon, of line vessels during manoeuvring and hotelling phase for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the statistical analysis and appropriate conclusions have been performed on CO2 since all other emissions are linearly dependent. From the analyses in the hotelling and manoeuvring phase of line ships, it can be concluded that during 2019 there was a slight increase in emissions, but overall there was no significant increase in the number of line vessels and increased traffic. The obtained results of case study of port Split provide recommendations leading to further reduction of harmful gas emission, monitoring them, and integrating it into management of urban ports. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, an in-depth understanding of changes in SOC pools and its fractions is necessary to reduce carbon (C) emissions and adopt efficient land use planning for sustainable soil management in the North Eastern Himalayan (NEH) region of India. The soils under five prominent land uses [e.g., alder (Alnus nepalensis) + large cardamom (Amomum subulatum), alder + turmeric (Curcuma longa), ginger (Zingiber officinale) + maize (Zea mays), ginger and undisturbed forest] were sampled down to 45 cm depth to assess the impacts of land use systems on SOC content and storage, its fractions, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and the dehydrogenase (DHA) activities. Results demonstrated that undisturbed forest soil had the highest organic carbon (OC, 145.8 Mg ha−1), active C (AC, 73.7 Mg ha−1), passive C (PC, 72.1 Mg ha−1) pools, MBC and DHA activities followed by alder + large cardamom system (140.7 Mg OC ha−1, 70.9 Mg AC ha−1, and 69.8 Mg PC ha−1, respectively). The soils under undisturbed forest and alder + large cardamom system had a higher share of the very labile C fractions for all depths than other land uses. Conversely, soils under sole ginger and ginger + maize land uses had a greater proportion of non-labile C (NLC) fractions; however, absolute values of the NLC pool were the highest under undisturbed forest soil. Alder + large cardamom land use system had the highest AC: PC pool ratio (1.13) and C stratification (1.02–1.05) compared to the other land uses. Of the various land uses, SOC pools (0–45 cm) in six years were reduced nominally under alder + large cardamom system (4.2%), while the reduction was maximum under the ginger system (11.2%) as compared to the SOC pools of undisturbed forest. The study demonstrated that the cultivation of crops like maize and/or ginger is more degrading and will always have a negative impact on the fertility and overall health of the Himalayan soil. Hence, alder + large cardamom system may be promoted to restore the soil C in the Sikkim Himalayan region of NEH, India, and other similar regions of the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Active carbon pool; Alder + large cardamom; Carbon stratification; Passive carbon pool; Soil microbial biomass carbon","enzyme activity; forest soil; land use change; land use planning; organic farming; root vegetable; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil management; soil organic matter; Himalayas; India; Sikkim Himalayas; Alnus; Alnus nepalensis; Amomum subulatum; Curcuma longa; Elettaria cardamomum; Zea mays; Zingiber officinale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087899914

Research limitations/implications: The paper is a field-testing of the implementation results of the #weResilient strategy, a risk-informed sustainable development policy-making action at territorial/local levels based on a structural combination of environmental sustainability, territorial safety and climate change contrasting policies; of the coherence of the multiscale and multilevel approach in integrating risk informed and sustainable development pathways; of the improved governance at urban level thanks to the downscaling of the strategy. Practical implications: Transforming DRR and Resilience to disasters into real “structural” policy-making and actions to be implemented by coordinating territorial and urban development and land-use, with a wide area vision and holistic approach is crucial for the effectiveness of the territorial sustainable development. Moreover, participatory mechanisms can boost althe political will and consequently the related public support. The bottom-up approaches, especially when structured on well defined and clear strategies and supported by concrete actions, are a strategic tool for enhancing the institutional commitment and for enriching the implementation paths also with additional and innovative strategic solution. Social implications: In the #weResilient strategy implementation most of the efforts have been devoted to setting-up a complex system of progressive engagement having the main purpose of entrusting and engaging key-actors and community in the institutional policy-making regarding territorial and urban sustainable and resilient development. Engaging community in decision-making processes allows governments to tap into wider perspectives and potential solutions to improve decisions, services and actions. At the same time, it provides the basis for productive relationships, improved dialogue, increased sense of belonging and, ultimately, concrete better democracy. Originality/value: Multiscale and multilevel holistic approaches in downscaling local well defined Resilience and Sustainable Development integrated strategies (#weResilient) provide for the best approach in terms of future growth. Setting a vision, outlining a strategy and implementing actions on those elements with multiscale and holistic approaches is key- success of every local long-term development; various worldwide leading experiences demonstrated by particularly shining governments are a tangible proof of it. So, the value of this work is to illustrate a concrete example of translation of words into actions so to provide guidance and inspiration to other worldwide governments in performing similar path. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate policy; Community engagement; Disaster risk governance; Local governance; Resilience building; Sustainable development; Territorial development; Urban development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092558099

In doing so, we seek to advance an empirical and theoretical understanding of the links between off-grid energy infrastructures and the politics and governances of low carbon transitions. The argument is empirically unfolded by unpacking the installation and early operation of two recent off-grid photovoltaic (PV) energy projects in rural areas in Chile. We focus on describing how the design, installation, and use of these infrastructures involves producing specific energy ecologies as well as the organization of local energy publics. In this sense, we suggest that by attending to these processes, we might help to unveil the different kinds of material politics taking place in off-grid PV projects. We focus on the potentially higher forms of plasticity ingrained in these types of off-grid energy infrastructures, which result in varied forms of materializing energy use and in distributing the agencies of the different actors involved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087001245

Currently, the AHCS technologies are mainly used in countries with a hot and humid climate. However, there are many territories of the Earth with quite a cold weather. The aim of this review has been to survey the application of AHCS in cold countries. The thermodynamic indicators of AHCS cycle – the first and second law efficiencies - are briefly described. For obtaining a high first law efficiency, the adsorbate exchange per cycle has to be increased, the inert masses - decreased, and a working fluid with a large latent heat should be used. The SLT efficiency for heat amplification increases at colder ambient. It opens up new possibilities for using AHCS in cold countries. The issues of which climate is deemed to be cold and how low ambient temperature can affect thermodynamic and dynamic features of the AHCS cycle/unit are considered. Traditional and recently proposed cycles/units are surveyed, and their applicability for cold territories is analyzed for closed and open AHCS systems.

Naturally, the thermal preferences (TP) of aquatic organisms obtained in controlled conditions have been used to relate physiological performance with field data since they are a good proxy to the fundamental niche. Literature suggests that dispersal capabilities, biological interactions, acclimatisation, adaptation, among others might play a role in species distribution; thus, in reality, species are usually occupying a realized thermal niche (RTN). Therefore, this study was designed to inquire into the following questions: Are the TP of tropical aquatic ectotherms found in laboratory conditions similar to their RTN? Can TP be validated with occurrences in the wild? To answer these questions, this study compared the TP obtained from previously published works with the RTN of the crabs Callinectes similis and C. sapidus, the fishes Centropomus undecimalis and Ocyurus chrysurus, the lobster Panulirus argus, and the octopus Octopus maya obtained from occurrences from 1693documents. When RTN values were tested against the TPs obtained in laboratory, no significant differences were found for fish species (P > 0.05); in contrast, differences for the benthic invertebrates were reported (P < 0.05). At least two factors could have been affecting these results: differences in the average tolerances between geographically distinct populations (local adaptation) and the dispersal capabilities that might have been forcing a differentiation between populations If, as proposed, fishes can actively follow thermal optimum, their response to warming scenarios could be faster than benthic organisms. If our hypothesis is true, the uncertainty of climate change could be reduced when the local adaptation is taking into consideration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crustacean; Fish; Local adaptation; Niche conservatism; Octopus maya; Realized thermal niche; Thermal preferences","Climate change; Fish; Molluscs; Benthic invertebrates; Benthic organisms; Biological interactions; Controlled conditions; Laboratory conditions; Laboratory studies; Species distributions; Thermal preferences; Shellfish; climate change; crab; differentiation; dispersal; fitness; laboratory method; lobster; local adaptation; physiological response; temperature effect; warming; Callinectes similis; Centropomus undecimalis; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Invertebrata; Octopus; Octopus maya; Ocyurus chrysurus; Panulirus argus; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088822990

This has led to the construction of large-scale biofuel refineries. However, this process is raising concern among local stakeholders where the refineries are being sited. Here, we used geospatial techniques to implement a landscape design approach to address societal questions and local concerns regarding the impacts of introducing large-scale production of advanced biofuel (2G). Spatially-explicit landscape design was used to integrate various components in the biofuel supply chain and understand environmental and socioeconomic effects at various levels. Different techniques and modelling approaches were brought together with active participation of local stakeholders to provide answers to varying questions of community relevance. The application of the approach to the analysis of the case of cellulosic ethanol production from dedicated crops in Sardinia (Italy) shows that the introduction of a large-scale biofuel refinery could lead to positive outcomes at local level in terms of habitat quality, employment, energy production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, negative effects are expected regarding water availability and the production of food and animal feed in the landscape. This form of integrated knowledge about benefits and trade-offs can be used by project developers and policymakers to steer the deployment of biofuel projects to advance high level policy goals while respecting local priorities and concerns. © 2020","Biofuel; Biorefineries; Geospatial modelling; Integrated assessment; Landscape design","Biofuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Alternative energy source; Biofuel supply chains; Energy productions; Geospatial techniques; High level policies; Large scale productions; Project developers; Socio-economic impacts; Economic and social effects; alternative energy; biofuel; design; energy resource; environmental modeling; industrial production; policy making; socioeconomic impact; spatial analysis; supply chain management; Italy; Sardinia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091645524

We tested a hypothesis that soil wetting produces trace gas pulses modified by seasonal wetting history, grass litter availability, and cover type in these systems. Methods: Over two seasons, we conducted 48-h wetting experiments and measured CO2, N2O, and NO pulses at an invaded, polluted California shrubland following grass litter addition to sites dominated by either an invasive grass (Schismus barbatus) or a native shrub (Erioginum fasciculatum). Results: CO2 and N2O pulses consistently appeared 15 min post-wetting and diminished within 12 h; NO peaked later and remained elevated at 24 h. All pulses were stronger in the dry season than wet season. Grass litter amendments increased CO2 and dry-season N2O pulses without significantly modifying NO pulses. Grass cover reduced CO2 pulses compared to shrub cover. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that shrubland soils produce stronger pulses of CO2, N2O, and NO during the dry season when wetting is less frequent. We show that invasive grass litter can provide a labile C source that stimulates CO2 and N2O, but not NO, emissions from shrubland soils. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Coastal sage scrub; Grass invasion; Plant litter; Soil rewetting; Trace gas pulse","biological invasion; carbon dioxide; coastal zone; grass; introduced species; litter; nitrate; seasonal variation; shrub; shrubland; soil emission; urbanization; California; United States; Schismus barbatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091388570

A platform for simulating pollutant emissions and concentrations was developed and applied to the Île-de-France Region (Greater Paris) of France, taking account of anthropogenic and natural sources and ‘imported’ pollution from elsewhere in France and Europe. Four technological scenarios for 2025 were studied and compared to the 2014 reference situation (1-REF). These scenarios included the current evolution of the park with widespread adoption of diesel particulate filters (DPFs) (2-BAU), decline in the sale of diesel vehicles and a corresponding increase in petrol vehicle sales (3-PET), promotion of electric vehicles in urban areas (4-ELEC), and a combinaison with a decrease in traffic of about 15% in the densely populated area inside the A86 outer ring road (5-AIR). The corresponding vehicle fleets were determined using a fleet simulation model. Traffic pollutant emissions were computed with the COPERT4 European methodology and hourly traffic data over the Île-de-France road network. Particulate matter (PM10, PM2,5 and PM1,0), particles number (PN), black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOC), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were considered. Emissions for other sectors were taken from a regional inventory. Emissions outside the Île-de-France region (Europe and France) were derived from the European and French emission inventories. Pollutant concentrations (PM2,5, PM10, organic and inorganic PM10, PN, BC, NO2 and O3) were simulated over nested domains (Europe, France and Île-de-France) using the Polyphemus platform for two scenarios (2-BAU and 3-PET). Methodological aspects and results for Île-de-France are discussed here. All scenarios led to a sharp decrease in traffic emissions in Île-de-France (−30% to −60%) by 2025. The decline in diesel induced a stronger renewal of the fleet. PM and NOx emissions were more strongly reduced than VOC or NH3. Traffic reduction reduced all emissions in the densely populated area within the A86 outer ring road (−20% to −45% for exhaust particles and gaseous pollutants). The 2-BAU and 3-PET scenarios lowered annual average concentrations, especially for NO2 and BC, and more strongly influenced daily-peak than daily-average concentrations. In Île-de-France, PM of diameter &lt;10 μm (PM10), and NO2 concentrations, decreased in the most densely populated areas. The entire population would benefit from a PM10 annual mean concentration decrease of ≥0.4 μg/m3, and the annual mean NO2 concentration would decrease by ≥ 10 μg/m3 for 40–50% of the population. For other pollutants (PM2.5, secondary pollutants, etc.), reductions were more limited, due to the other activity sectors and atmospheric chemistry. Ozone concentrations might even increase in urban locations, suggesting an increase in oxidants and thus an increase in secondary aerosol formation if precursors were not reduced. Differences between 2-BAU and 3-PET scenarios were slight. For PM and NO2 concentrations, the petrol scenario was slightly more favorable than the “business-as-usual” scenario with diesel vehicles and DPF; differences were strong for primary particles and NO2 and weak for secondary compounds. This slight advantage was due to lower emissions and accelerated fleet renewal (higher proportion of Euro 5 &amp; 6). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Concentration; COPERT; Pollutant emission; Polyphemus; Road traffic; Scenario; Simulation; Vehicle fleet; Vehicle technology","Air quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Electric automobiles; Fleet operations; Fog; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Simulation platform; Volatile organic compounds; Annual average concentration; Average concentration; Diesel particulate filters; Emission inventories; Methodological aspects; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Pollutant concentration; Reference situation; Particles (particulate matter); ammonia; black carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; gasoline; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; organic matter; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; ammonia; black carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; electric vehicle; emission control; emission inventory; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxides; road traffic; aerosol; air pollutant; air quality; Article; concentration (parameter); diesel engine; exhaust gas; France; methodology; motor vehicle; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; precursor; priority journal; simulation; urban area; France; Ile de France; Polyphemus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090405663

This could lead to excessive pressure buildup, overlapping induced pressure fronts, and pressure interference with neighboring uses of the subsurface. Extracting the in situ brine from the storage formation could be necessary to relieve pressure constraints; control migration of the CO2 plume, displaced brine, and the induced pressure front; and sequester more CO2 while reducing potential risks. Such active pressure management could be very costly, and it could present a formidable economic constraint on the feasible scale of deployment of CCS. Alternatively, there may be high-injectivity zones (“storage sweet spots”) where a significant volume of CO2 could be stored without producing brine. For simulated deployment of CO2 storage sites across the Illinois Basin, the results of this study suggest that brine production could be required to sequester 20 % or more of the regional CO2 emissions of major stationary sources in the Mount Simon Sandstone saline formation. In some cases, brine production could expand pressure-limited CO2 storage capacity enough to more than compensate for the additional costs of pressure management, but only if produced brine could be cheaply reinjected onsite for disposal in an overlying geologic formation. With or without brine production, this study found that the lowest-cost deployment option was to inject CO2 only into a potential storage sweet spot of the Mount Simon Sandstone. © 2020 The US Geological Survey","Basin-scale; Brine production; CO2 storage costs; Geologic CO2 storage; High-injectivity zone; Pressure management; Pressure-limited dynamic storage capacity","Carbon dioxide; Sandstone; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Economic constraints; Geologic formations; Pressure build up; Pressure constraints; Pressure interferences; Pressure management; Stationary sources; Carbon capture; brine; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; sandstone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091965852

However, as emissions have continued to rise, so these models have come to increasingly rely on the extensive deployment of highly speculative negative emissions technologies (NETs). Moreover, in determining the mitigation challenges for industrialized nations, scant regard is paid to the language and spirit of equity enshrined in the Paris Agreement. If, instead, the mitigation agenda of ‘developed country Parties’ is determined without reliance on planetary scale NETs and with genuine regard for equity and ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’, the necessary rates of mitigation increase markedly. This is evident even when considering the UK and Sweden, two nations at the forefront of developing ‘progressive’ climate change legislation and with clear emissions pathways and/or quantitative carbon budgets. In both cases, the carbon budgets underpinning mitigation policy are halved, the immediate mitigation rate is increased to over 10% per annum, and the time to deliver a fully decarbonized energy system is brought forward to 2035-40. Such a challenging mitigation agenda implies profound changes to many facets of industrialized economies. This conclusion is not drawn from political ideology, but rather is a direct consequence of the international community’s obligations under the Paris Agreement and the small and rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. Key Policy Insights Without a belief in the successful deployment of planetary scale negative emissions technologies, double-digit annual mitigation rates are required of developed countries, from 2020, if they are to align their policies with the Paris Agreement’s temperature commitments and principles of equity. Paris-compliant carbon budgets for developed countries imply full decarbonization of energy by 2035-40, necessitating a scale of change in physical infrastructure reminiscent of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan. This brings issues of values, measures of prosperity and socio-economic inequality to the fore. The stringency of Paris-compliant pathways severely limits the opportunity for inter-sectoral emissions trading. Consequently aviation, as with all sectors, will need to identify policies to reduce emissions to zero, directly or through the use of zero carbon fuels. The UK and Swedish governments’ emissions pathways imply a carbon budget of at least a factor of two greater than their fair contribution to delivering on the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-2°C commitment. © 2020 The Author(s).

An easy and economically feasible way to mitigate this is to introduce a Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS) in the urban area. However, the lack of knowledge about the geological and hydrogeological setting hampers the use of SUDS. In this study, 1315 ha of high-density electromagnetic (DUALEM-421S) data, detailed lithological soil descriptions of 614 boreholes, 153 infiltration tests and 250 in situ vane tests from 32 different sites in the Central Denmark Region were utilised to find quantitative and qualitative regional relationships between the resistivity and the lithology, the percolation rates and the undrained shear strength of cohesive soils at a depth of 1 meter below ground surface (m bgs). The qualitative tests enable a translation from resistivity to lithology as well as a translation from lithology to percolation rates with moderate to high certainty. The regional cut-off value separating sand-dominated deposits from clay-dominated deposits is found to be between 80 to 100 Ωm. The regional median percolation rates for sand and clay till is found to be 9.9 × 10−5 m/s and 2.6 × 10−5 m/s, respectively. The quantitative results derived from a simple linear regression analysis of resistivity and percolation rates and resistivity and undrained shear strength of cohesive soils are found to have a very weak relationship on a regional scale implying that in reality no meaningful relationships can be established. The regional qualitative results have been tested on a case study area. The case study illustrates that site-specific investigations are necessary when using geophysical mapping to directly estimate lithology, percolation rates and undrained shear strength of cohesive soils due to the differences in soil properties and the surrounding environment from site to site.

The buildings are planned to compensate for the embodied energy in their materials by using low-emission materials and generating emission-free energy. Embodied energy is minimized while energy generation is maximized. However, embodied energy calculations seldom consider the risk of building defects that require repairs or early replacement of building elements. As such, a building's sustainability is often calculated under the assumption that significant defects do not happen, which is known to rarely be the case. In this article, the material and monetary costs of repairing building defects are analysed. Findings suggest that certain building defects, like major roof leaks, have a significant carbon footprint. A large portion of this footprint can be attributed to the drying of the building after a leak is discovered. Building defects are common enough that the risk should not be neglected in life cycle analyses. Likewise, measures taken to reduce the risk of building defects, such as avoiding design solutions known to pose difficulties, may be considered as means to improve the sustainability of a building as well as reducing economic costs. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Adapting to climate uncertainty requires trialing out new experiments in water governance and establishing processes to learn from those experiments. Social learning is regarded as an important aspect that supports the transformation of water governance systems. Understanding where and how social learning is occurring is critical to improving adaptation outcomes of water management in an uncertain climate. Yet, there is little research asserting the scope of social learning processes in a wide variety of empirical contexts. This article examines social learning in water management in Western Australia. Two specific case studies involving the state-of-the-art experiments in surface and groundwater management are used to illustrate and to understand the institutional dynamics and barriers of social learning. The cases depict single-loop learning to a larger extent and double-loop learning to a lesser extent. The findings emphasize the importance of dealing with learning externalities, the mismatch of ecological and administrative scales, and facilitating actor networks and multilevel interaction in order to embed social learning in climate adaptation.

The use of high fuel sulfur content (FSC) bunker oil by ocean going vessels (OGVs) has been identified as a major source of sulfur dioxide (SO2). Government authorities all over the world, including Hong Kong government, have implemented air pollution control regulations to cap FSC of fuel used by OGVs to 0.5%, from the existing 3.5%, to reduce SO2 emissions. However, the lack of efficient screening tools to identify non-compliant OGVs has prevented effective enforcement. This study developed and evaluated an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne lightweight (750 g) microsensor system (MSS), which is capable of measuring ship plume SO2, NO2, NO, CO2, CO, and particulate matter in real-time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the sensor system to evaluate its performance during laboratory and field operations. The effects of cross-sensitivity and meteorological conditions were studied and incorporated to account for the measurement conditions in dispersed ship plumes. The SO2 to CO2 concentration ratio-based FSC expression was formulated as per the 2016 European Union Directive and Regulations. Furthermore, the impact of plume dilution on the accuracy of FSC measurement was investigated at different stages using the MSS, with and without the UAV in both simulated conditions and real-world scenarios, maintaining a safe distance from the OGV exhaust stacks. The study demonstrates the robustness of using UAV-borne sensor system for ship emission sniffing and FSC determination. The results will assist in development of a technological framework for effective enforcement of ship emission control regulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fuel sulfur content; Microsensor system; Ocean going vessels; Sulfur dioxide; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Carbon dioxide; Drones; Emission control; Fuels; Microsensors; Satellites; Ships; Sulfur dioxide; Emission inventories; European Union Directive; Government authorities; Measurement conditions; Meteorological condition; Ocean going vessels; Protocol development; Technological framework; Sulfur determination; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; emission inventory; pollution control; regulatory framework; sensor; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; tanker ship; unmanned vehicle; accuracy; air pollution; algorithm; Article; calibration; dilution; government; Hong Kong; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; plume; pollution control; priority journal; reaction time; ship; simulation; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088629569

This work quantifies how structural uncertainties in those relationships translate to uncertainties in reconstructions of past climate. We develop and apply a data assimilation uncertainty quantification approach to paleoclimate networks and observational uncertainties representative of data for the last millennium. We find that structural uncertainties arising from uncertain spatial covariance relationships typically contribute 10% of the total uncertainty in reconstructed temperature variability at small (∼200 km), continental, and hemispheric length scales, with larger errors (50% or larger) in regions where long-range climate covariances are least certain. These structural uncertainties contribute far more to errors in uncertainty quantification, sometimes by a factor of 5 or higher. Accounting for and reducing uncertainties in climate model dynamics and resulting covariance relationships will improve paleoclimate reconstruction accuracy. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

This study evaluated the soil carbon sequestration potential of these CSVs compared to the control land use that did not have CSA practices. At the one-meter depth, soil carbon stocks increased by 20–70%, 70–86%, and 51–110% in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda CSVs, respectively, compared to control. Consequently, CSVs contributed to the reduction of emissions by 87–420 Mg CO2 eq ha−1. In the topsoil (0–15 cm), CSVs sequestered almost twice more soil carbon than the control and subsequently emissions were reduced by 42–158 Mg CO2 eq ha−1 under CSVs. The annual increase in carbon sequestration under CSVs ranged between 1.6 and 6.2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and substantially varied between the CSA land use types. The forests sequestered the highest soil carbon (5–6 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), followed by grasslands and croplands. The forest topsoil also had lower bulk density compared to the control. The findings suggest that CSA practices implemented through the CSVs approach contribute to climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration. © 2020 by the authors.

Inadequate sub-national level information is a significant lacuna for planning spatially targeted climate change adaptation investments. A fixed-effect panel regression analyses of 19 states from 2001 to 2015 assess the impacts of exposure to floods and droughts on the growth of gross state domestic product (GSDP) and human development index (HDI) in India. The flood and drought exposure are estimated using satellite data. The 19 states comprise 95% of the population and contribute 93% to the national GDP. The results show that floods indeed expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impacts at the sub-national level. The most affected GSDPs are in the non-agriculture sectors, positively by the floods and negatively by droughts. No significant influence on human development may be due to substantial investment on mitigation of flood and drought impacts and their influence on better income, health, and education conditions. Because some Indian states still have a large geographical area, profiling disasters impacts at even smaller sub-national units such as districts can lead to effective targeted mitigation and adaptation activities, reduce shocks, and accelerate income growth and human development. © 2020 by the authors.

In a few cases protoplanets have been directly imaged, but for the vast majority of systems, disk gaps and cavities-seen especially in dust continuum observations-have been the strongest evidence of recent or ongoing planet formation. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of a nearly edge-on (i = 75°) disk containing a giant gap seen in dust but not in 12CO gas. Inside the gap, the molecular gas has a warm (100 K) component coinciding in position with a tentative free-free emission excess observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using 1D hydrodynamic models, we find the structure of the gap is consistent with being carved by a planet with 4-70 MJup. The coincidence of free-free emission inside the planet-carved gap points to the planet being very young and/or still accreting. In addition, the 12CO observations reveal low-velocity large-scale filaments aligned with the disk major axis and velocity coherent with the disk gas that we interpret as ongoing gas infall from the local interstellar medium. This system appears to be an interesting case where both a star (from the environment and the disk) and a planet (from the disk) are growing in tandem. © 2020.

This paper assesses the challenges and opportunities for climate policy integration in the Gulf states of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman, examining the interaction between their climate policy and their political–economic regimes. It adopts a novel analytical framework that integrates insights from climate policy integration and the political–economic theory of rentier states. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and relevant policy documents, it reveals modest progress in integrating climate policy into economic development plans in the UAE but major impediments to climate policy integration in Oman. Both countries face significant shortfalls in climate-related financial and human resource capacities. Climate policy integration efforts have focused on the energy sector with the purpose of protecting rents from oil exports rather than advancing a low-carbon transformation of their economies. This has created structural ambiguity in the climate policy integration advanced in the UAE and Oman. Key policy insights The availability, quality and accessibility of climate-related data are serious challenges for policy makers in the UAE and Oman. Both countries have evolving institutional architectures conducive to climate policy integration. However, these are more symbolic than substantive, lacking clear policy integration strategies across the governments. The UAE and Oman both face significant shortfalls in climate-related financial and human resource capacities. Support for climate policy integration by the ruling elites in the UAE and Oman is significantly shaped by rentier interests: most climate-related initiatives have addressed the energy sector, aiming to protect rents from oil exports by reducing the domestic dependence on fossil fuels. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; climate policy integration; energy; Oil-producing countries; Oman; UAE","climate change; economic development; energy market; energy planning; environmental policy; fossil fuel; oil production; Oman; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087148973

In addition, limited studies are reported to compare the optimal envelope design with those stipulated in standards and codes, considering the 3Es: energy, economic and environment. This study employs a computational approach for optimizing envelope design for housing in hot climates using a genetic algorithm (GA) technique, and a life cycle cost (LCC) analysis coupled with the EnergyPlus simulation program. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a verified housing model to determine the upper and lower limits of the optimization search domain. Several envelope design strategies were evaluated including walls and roof insulation, thermal mass, air tightness, window's areas, types of glazing, and window's shading. The optimization was then conducted for the subsidized and unsubsidized energy cost scenarios under three representative hot climates of Oman. The results indicated that window's shading is thermally and economically attractive across all climates. Depending on the energy cost scenario, 2.5 cm–5 cm more of thermal insulation is cost-optimal for envelope systems in hot climates when compared to warm-humid climate. The optimized cases were then compared to design cases following four prevalent regional thermal regulations; the Saudi code, the Estidama requirements, the Kuwaiti code, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) thermal regulations. Similar to the cost-optimal design, the GCC design case is proven to be economically attractive across all climates.

This work focused on assessing the effectiveness of supplemental irrigation to improve the actual soil moisture content in arid ecosystems and considering climate change impacts on soil moisture. The study was conducted at two fenced protected sites in Kuwait. The first site is naturally covered with Rhanterietum epapposum, whereas the other study site is a supplemented irrigated site, containing several revegetated native plants. The results showed that supplemental irrigation highly improved soil moisture (∆SM) during the winter season by >50%. However, during the summer season, the rainfed and irrigated site showed low ∆SM due to the high temperature and high evapotranspiration (ET) rates. We also found that ∆SM would negatively get impacted by climate change. The climate change projection results showed that temperature would increase by 12%–23%, ET would increase by 17%–19%, and precipitation would decrease by 31%–46% by 2100. Such climate change impacts may also shift the current ecosystem from an arid to a hyper-arid ecosystem. Therefore, we concluded that irrigation is a practical option to support the ∆SM during the low-temperature months only (spring and winter) since the results did not show any progress during the summer season. It is also essential to consider the possibility of future shifting in ecosystems and plant communities in restoration and revegetation planning. © 2020 by the authors.

Extreme events can modify water availability and agricultural production, making climate change planning an essential task. The National Institute for Space Research (INPE in Portuguese) in Brazil has made a large dataset of regional climate model outputs (simulations and projections) available, which opens up many possibilities of carrying out high-resolution climate change studies. However, there is still no performance evaluation of the model-derived rainfall output against high-resolution ground-based observation data considering the Brazilian biomes. This paper attempts to fill this gap and evaluates the simulated precipitation throughout Brazil. We used gridded observed precipitation data and historical climate simulations from the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5) and from the Hadley Center Global Environment Model, version 2 (HadGEM2-ES), which were downscaled by the Eta RCM (Regional Climate Model). For the overlapping period (1980–2005), there is good agreement (PBIAS up to 10%) of downscaled annual simulations for the Amazon and Cerrado biomes and large biases (reaching 40%) in the Pampa biome, compared to the observations. Our results showed that HadGEM2-ES is capable of representing long-term mean monthly precipitation for large areas well, such as the Amazon and Cerrado. Furthermore, the Eta RCM has considerably improved the driving GCM MIROC5 simulations. In conclusion, we recommend using the HadGEM2-ES simulations for the Amazon, Eta/HadGEM2-ES for the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Pampa, and Eta/MIROC5 for the Caatinga and Pantanal. Our study provides an overview of two downscaled simulation datasets in Brazil that may help verify the models' suitability for further climate change assessments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; General circulation model; Rainfall; Regional climate model","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Electric power system interconnection; Large dataset; Precipitation (meteorology); Space research; Agricultural productions; Climate change assessment; Climate simulation; Ground-based observations; Interdisciplinary research; Precipitation data; Regional climate modeling; Water availability; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; computer simulation; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; regional climate; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085206941

We study households of the UK, Germany, Spain and Finland, and calculate the overall effects of the diffusion of such changes and innovations. The ‘lifestyle’ of households is divided into four different ‘Domains’—Living, Food, Mobility and Energy. For each change, the model shows the linked effects of adoption, and total household input requirements (materials, energy etc.), household and food wastes and CO2 emissions.

Successful responses require more integrated approaches to policy making at all levels of government, so that economic, social and environmental actions reinforce each other rather than compete. They also require effective coordination across levels of government to manage shared responsibilities, mutual dependence and common challenges. This commentary highlights the progress in the multi-level governance concept since its first use, and focuses on some current dynamics driving multi-level governance, in particular the trend towards differentiated subnational governance. It then highlights that the way multi-level governance systems are designed has a direct impact on policy outcomes, hence the imperative to strengthen multi-level governance systems.

In contrast, according to the United Nations Environmental Programs (UNEP), regenerative agriculture (RA) practices, such as, no-till (NT) has helped reduce emission of 241 Tg of carbon dioxide (CO2) since the 1970s. U.S. Farm Bills and other international policies have helped encourage adoption of RA practices, such as NT, but major challenges remain, if a potential climate change impact of CONVA is to be reduced. One approach would be to adopt more efficient and robust production systems such as RA. Regenerative agriculture is designed to minimize external inputs and off-site impacts, and has globally been adopted on ∼180 M ha, with the most common U.S. practice being NT on 22.6% of the cropland. Currently, the economic benefits of RA are the most evident on smallholder farms, where higher yields and decreased labor for land preparation including weeding (9 and 19 d ha−1, respectively) have been recorded. A greater RA return to labor compared with CONVA suggests it may be an efficient low-input farming approach that requires less energy and reduces waste while sustaining productivity and perhaps increasing profitability within a semi-closed system. No-till is used here to illustrate the proposed system because it reduces CO2 release into the atmosphere and increases surface-layer SOC storage. Globally, there is significant room for RA improvement, confirming the need for additional research and technology transfer along with robust policy articulation. © 2020 The Authors.

Hence, improved understanding of why individuals make these choices is crucial for environmental and population health improvements. Using household survey data, we investigated determinants of carbonated soft drink and bottled water consumption in a low-income community in Nicaragua that lacks resources to deal with both the environmental and health consequences of those consumption choices. A total of 398 households were included in the final analysis. Results indicate that 9.4% of respondents consumed bottled water on a regular basis and 77% of the respondents drank carbonated soft drinks. Estimated logit models suggested that households’ resort to bottled water as a substitute for tap water, due to aesthetic characteristics of tap water and perceived health risks.

The use of biostimulant products plays a fundamental role in mitigating the negative effects of climate change and reducing the use of conventional fertilizers. Many of these products are formulated with amino acids (AAs). This study was conducted to elucidate the effects of the foliar application of tyrosine (Tyr) (15 mM), lysine (Lys) (15 mM), methionine (Met) (15 mM), and a Tyr + Lys + Met (15 mM + 15 mM + 15 mM) mixture on the physiological and metabolic processes, vegetative growth, and nutritional state of Optima variety tomato plants. The results showed that application of the AAs, individually and combined, was beneficial for the growth of the aerial part, net assimilation of CO2, and water use efficiency (WUE). Application of Tyr resulted in the best WUE. The metabolomics study revealed that AA treatments increased the concentration of proline, fructose, and glucose, whose role was to stimulate glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Thus, the plants could have greater reduction power and energy, as well as more carbon molecules for their growth processes. © 2020 by the authors.

Large-scale empirical evidence for alternative stable states is limited, however, and comes mostly from the multimodal distribution of structural aspects of vegetation. These approaches have been criticized, as structure alone cannot separate out wetter savannas from drier forests for example, and there are also technical challenges to mapping vegetation structure in unbiased ways. Here, we develop an alternative approach to delimit the climatic envelope of the two biomes in Africa using tree species lists gathered for a large number of forest and savanna sites distributed across the continent. Our analyses confirm extensive climatic overlap of forest and savanna, supporting the alternative stable states hypothesis for Africa, and this result is corroborated by paleoecological evidence. Further, we find the two biomes to have highly divergent tree species compositions and to represent alternative compositional states. This allowed us to classify tree species as forest vs. savanna specialists, with some generalist species that span both biomes. In conjunction with georeferenced herbarium records, we mapped the forest and savanna distributions across Africa and quantified their environmental limits, which are primarily related to precipitation and seasonality, with a secondary contribution of fire. These results are important for the ongoing efforts to restore African ecosystems, which depend on accurate biome maps to set appropriate targets for the restored states but also provide empirical evidence for broad-scale bistability. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This component has attribution with excess fuel consumption, resulting in an increase in the global warming potential (GWP). Several research have been conducted to model and quantify the PVI effect based on pavement roughness and deflection. These models estimate excess fuel consumption considering traffic loading, engineering properties of pavement materials and pavement design specifications. However, a big question remains unanswered: how do various climatic parameters including precipitation, temperature, and freezing index influence the PVI and subsequent GWP? Canada is the second largest country in the world and different climate regions can be found in each of its ten provinces and three territories. Therefore, a new, climate-based clustering approach—rather than geometric boundaries is introduced for climate impact analysis from road system. Twenty-two Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) road sections located in the Canadian highways have been selected for this study. These road sections were clustered based on homogenous climate conditions, using a statistical approach. The research finds that a combination of high precipitation, freezing index and medium temperature are associated with an accelerated rate of International Roughness Index (IRI) and consequent GWP because of a high PVI for poor pavement surface. GWP for roughness is found to be very low where high temperature and a low freezing index exist. Very high traffic loading and low subgrade stiffness, when combined, produced the highest GWP emissions because of deflection based PVI. It was also found that the PVI effect in terms of GWP for both roughness and deflection is always dominant for heavy vehicles over light vehicles traffic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deflection; Global warming potential; International roughness index; Pavement vehicle interaction","Freezing; Global warming; Life cycle; Traffic surveys; Vehicles; Engineering properties; Geometric boundaries; Global warming potential; International roughness index; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Long-term pavement performance; Statistical approach; Vehicle interactions; Pavements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088125663

It has anisotropic carrier effective mass in zigzag and armchair directions. Therefore, the study of the anisotropic performance of tellurene FETs is a timely topic. In this work, the authors study the transport mechanism and performance metrics of tellurene n-channel and p-channel transistors using a quantum simulation. Heavy carrier mass in the armchair direction effectively blocks the tunnelling current and the transport is governed by thermionic emission over the potential barrier. On the other hand, lighter carrier mass in the zigzag direction results in a mixed tunnelling and thermionic transport mechanism. The n-channel transistor has an on-state current of 894 μA/μm, a sub-threshold slope of 62 mV/dec, a 9.27 mS/μm transconductance, a 0.129 ps delay, and a 0.046 fJ/μm dynamic power loss.

In this context, the present research proposes two scenarios to obtain a biomass-fueled power plant with limited CO2 emissions. A novel combination of a downdraft gasifier (DG), internally fired gas turbine, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and cryogenic separation unit, is proposed (named scenario 1) and it is compared to a system in which a bottoming steam cycle (SBC) was used instead of the ORC (named scenario 2). To have a deeper insight into the performance of the integrations, a sensitivity analysis and comparative study have been developed in this research in terms of their thermodynamic and economic performance. Sensitivity analysis explores the effects of significant variables on the proposed system performance: fuel cell current density, fuel cell steam to carbon ratio, gas turbine inlet temperature, and CO2 and fuel utilization factors. Exergy and exergoeconomic analyses reveal that the air-preheater in scenario 1 and gasifier in scenario 2 are identified as the component with maximum exergy destruction rate (21% and 14% of total respectively) and HRU in scenario 1 and SBC condenser have the lowest value of the exergoeconomic factor (3.76% and 0.01% respectively) due to high thermodynamic inefficiencies, while MCFC in both scenarios has the highest exergoeconomic factor 87.29% and 80.67% respectively due to its high investment cost. Also, scenario 1 achieves the amount of 83.86 (USD/MWeh) for LCOE that is 55.76 (USD/MWeh) more than the reference case and 3.55 (USD/MWeh) less than the scenario 2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage; Exergoeconomic analysis; Exergy analysis; Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell; Municipal Solid Waste; Waste to energy","Air preheaters; Biomass; Bottoming cycle systems; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Cryogenics; Exergy; Factor analysis; Gas fuel analysis; Gas turbines; Investments; Nuclear fuels; Rankine cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Steam engineering; Cryogenic separation; Economic performance; Exergoeconomic analysis; Gas turbine inlet temperature; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Significant variables; Steam-to-carbon ratio; Thermodynamic inefficiencies; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089262717

Dark CO2 fixation, the microbial process by which pore space CO2 is reduced to organic matter, may recycle and trap some of the CO2 respired in soils before it can escape to the atmosphere. To evaluate its potential significance for global temperate forest soil carbon stocks, we quantified dark CO2 fixation rates in a temperate beech forest soil down to 1 m depth over a range of 2–20% (v:v) headspace CO2 concentrations, by tracing incorporation of a13C–CO2 label into microbial biomass carbon and soil organic matter. We found that fixation rates under a concentration of 2% CO2 decreased with depth from 0.86 to 0.06 μg C normalized to g(dw) soil−1 d−1. However, when dark CO2 fixation rates were normalized to soil microbial biomass carbon, no significant differences between depths were observed. Higher CO2 concentrations increased fixation rates, with a linear 2-fold increase between 2% and 10% CO2. Molecular analysis revealed the dominance of heterotrophs, along with the presence of autotrophs mainly employing the Calvin Benson Bassham (CBB) pathway followed by the reductive citric acid (rTCA) pathway. Although community composition varied with depth, the relative fraction of autotrophs determined by qPCR of RuBisCO (cbbL IA, cbbL IC) and ATP-citrate lyase (aclA) genes remained stable at approximately 0.5% of the total community. Dark CO2 fixed carbon accounted for up to 1.1% of microbial biomass carbon and up to 0.035% of soil organic carbon after 28 days. We estimated a fixation flux of 25 ± 7.2 g C m−2 yr−1 to 1 m depth for the Hainich forest soil under field conditions. Without this process, Hainich forest soil CO2 emissions would be 5.6% higher, recycling a fraction of carbon large enough to potentially affect carbon isotope signatures in SOC. If this is held for all temperate forest soils globally, the annual rate of dark CO2 fixation would be 0.26 ± 0.07 Pg C yr−1 to a depth of 1 m, without considering contributions from other biomes. In conclusion, microbial biomass carbon and CO2 concentration appear to be the main drivers of dark CO2 fixation in temperate forest soils, and dark CO2 fixation may maintain Hainich forest soil carbon stocks by moderating a significant fraction of soil CO2 emissions annually. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","13CO2 labelling; Dark CO2 fixation; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil organic matter; Temperate forest soil","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Organic carbon; Polymerase chain reaction; Recycling; Ruthenium compounds; Soils; Community composition; Microbial biomass; Microbial biomass carbon; Molecular analysis; Relative fraction; Soil microbial biomass carbons; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matters; Soil pollution; air-soil interaction; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); coniferous forest; forest soil; microbial activity; soil organic matter; Germany; Hainich; Thuringia; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090705085

India’s transport sector consumes oil products for more than 95% of its energy needs and is a significant contributor to environmental deterioration in urban areas. Therefore, we examine the driving factors of transport CO2 emissions in India, incorporating road transport energy, economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, oil prices, and road infrastructure, over the period 1980 to 2015. The findings indicate that economic growth and road sector energy use cause an upsurge in transport emissions. Likewise, industrialization and road infrastructure stimulate transport emissions. Urbanization mitigates transport emissions, while oil prices have no influence on transport emissions. One-way causality is shown from economic growth, urbanization, and road sector energy to transport emissions. Finally, suitable policy implications are proposed to reduce transport CO2 emissions for a sustainable environment. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Economic growth; India; Oil prices; Transport CO2 emissions; Urbanization","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; empirical analysis; energy use; industrialization; mitigation; pollutant transport; road transport; urbanization; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088945984

Existing autoclaves are mostly unaffordable by rural healthcare practitioners, and when they managed to procure them, the electricity supply to power the autoclaves is epileptic. The solar-powered autoclave alternatives are too bulky with a very high initial cost. Hence, low-cost biofuel-powered autoclave becomes an attractive option, and this study sought to present the design, development and clinical evaluation of the device performance. With the global drive for the adoption of green energy, biofuel will not only reduce greenhouse gas emission but also provide revenue for local producers and reduce biomass associated health complications. The theoretical energy requirement for the sterilisation process was calculated. The standard pressure and temperature needed for sterilisation were tested to be 121 °C and 15 psi. The device was also clinically tested with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria obtained from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital using Brain heart Infusion Broth, MacConkey and Blood agar as cultured media. No bacteria growth was observed when the samples containing the bacteria colony were autoclaved by the designed autoclave and incubated at 37 °C for 2 d. Hence, the device met the mechanical and biological validation standards for effective sterilisation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","autoclave; biofuel; rural health care centres; sterilisation; Surgical site infection","Autoclaves; Biofuels; Blood; Costs; Developing countries; Energy policy; Greenhouse gases; Health care; Hospitals; Medical Microbiology; Pressure vessels; Surgical equipment; Biological validations; Brain heart infusions; Clinical evaluation; Energy requirements; Health complications; Pressure and temperature; Sterilisation process; Surgical site infections; Bacteria; biofuel; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; energy resource; health care cost; instrument sterilization; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; rural health care; Staphylococcus aureus; surgical infection; atmospheric pressure; cost; devices; economics; equipment design; human; reproducibility; rural health; surgical infection; temperature; Atmospheric Pressure; Biofuels; Costs and Cost Analysis; Equipment Design; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Health; Sterilization; Surgical Wound Infection; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094657385

The problem is defined for a new company planning to locate some new facilities (chain stores) in a geographical region where some other competitors have already located their facilities. We aim to propose a new model that the attractiveness function of each facility is developed based on the sustainable aspects. The attractiveness is based on the two aspects of sustainable development measurements called flexibility in supplying diverse products by a facility and the productivity of services in a facility. The objective is to maximize the profit in which the revenue is based on the amount of market share captured by the new facilities and the cost includes the cost of locating new facilities, the total tax paid to the government due to emissions of pollutants, and the cost of customers’ dissatisfaction. The last type of cost occurs once a customer has to wait too long to receive services. Therefore, for providing justice in servicing, a chance constraint is proposed to control this dissatisfaction according to the Jackson Markov network. For an illustrative case study, the new company can capture 61.49% of the market share and 38.51% of the market remains for the existing companies. This can show that the current methodology leads to capture more market share in a competitive environment. An accelerated Benders’ decomposition is used to solve the model, which is enhanced by disaggregating cuts, valid inequalities, and Pareto-optimal cuts. The proposed solution approach can improve the solution about 10% against the best previous method. Managerial implications and numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the mathematical model and the solution approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accelerated benders’ decomposition; Competitive location problem; Flexibility and productivity; Jackson queue network; Sustainable development","Commerce; Competition; Location; Pareto principle; Sustainable development; Chance constraint; Competitive environment; Competitive facility location; Managerial implications; Markov networks; Pareto-optimal; Solution approach; Valid inequality; Markov chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088136543

A whole country panel of 29 provinces as well as region sub-panels of China, for the period 1999 to 2018, are estimated employing common correlated effects mean group approach (CCEMGA), which offers robustness against heterogeneous characteristics and cross-sectionally dependent series. From the theoretic modeling aspect, the intensity of electric power consumption and urbanization have been introduced as the determinants of water-based pollutant emissions in the STIRPAT modeling framework. Based on empirical results, first, GRP growth has shown appealing behavior in the form of its heterogeneous impacts on water-based pollutant emissions growth in the case of different regions. For instance, its impact is noted to be positive and statistically significant for the western region, which turned positive but statistically insignificant for the intermediate region. And it further turned significantly negative in the case of the eastern region. We call this phenomenon as “development level-based emission mitigation effect.” Second, in terms of the impact of GRP growth on urbanization, the “development-based urbanization ladder effect” has been found. Based on heterogeneous causal links, firstly, the existence of a positive bilateral causal link between the intensity of electric power consumption and GRP growth and urbanization and GRP growth has been validated. Secondly, a positive unidirectional causal link emerged from urbanization to the intensity of electric power consumption and water-based pollutant emissions growth. Thirdly, the causal connection between GRP growth and water-based pollutant emissions growth remained very interesting and of mixed nature. Based on empirical findings, useful policies are extended.

The research underscores need for climate responsive planning for megacities in India with an example of National Capital Territory of Delhi, the capital of India whose trends and policies often form a blueprint for others to follow. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted in six distinct, yet inter-related stages: literature review, data collection, data analysis at four levels – city, zonal, planning division and flood plains inhabited by climate vulnerable population with least adaptive capacity, formulating alternative scenarios of future development, evaluation of scenarios, conclusions and recommendations. Findings: India has approximately 8,000 urban centres. Less than 2% of these centres have a planning document. Less than 1% of these documents acknowledge climate change as a phenomenon let alone a challenge to urban future. It is therefore a priority to address the challenge from a planning perspective for India. Research limitations/implications: Methodologies for evaluating the multiplier effect are still in their pre-final stage and there exist uncertainties and margin of error. Practical implications: Aligned with pre-tested methodologies, the research through extensive empirical and spatial-temporal analysis indicates severity and irreversibility of socio-economic and environmental losses. Originality/value: Risks and vulnerabilities to climate change and climate induced disasters exhibit multiplier effect that varies spatially across a region's demography. Quantitative analysis of multiplier effect on the secondary environment is rarely explored in climate studies. The paper addresses this lacuna by examining climate risks to Indian megacities with a case example of Delhi. The findings suggest that urbanization, climate risks and natural environment are interlinked, where an impact of one generates ripples across other two and their secondary environment plus sectors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","At-risk communities; Built environment; Economics of climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088314902

Previous assessment of the relation between urban structure and satellite-based Land Surface Temperature (LST) has generally been limited to single-city cases. Here, examining 25 European cities (June–August 2017), we estimated the statistical association between surface parameters—the impervious fraction (λimp), the building fraction (λb), and the building height (H)—and the neighborhood scale (1000 × 1000 m) LST variations, as captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, and spatial regression were used. As expected, λimp had a consistent positive influence on LSTs. In contrast, the relation of LST with λb and H was generally weaker or negative in the daytime, whereas at night it shifted to a robust positive effect. In particular, daytime LSTs of densely built, high-rise European districts tended to have lower values. This was especially the case for the city of Athens, Greece, where a more focused analysis was conducted, using further surface parameters and the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. For the urban core of the city, the canyon aspect ratio H/W had a statistically significant (p &lt;0.01) negative relationship with LST by day (Spearman’s rho = −0.68) and positive during nighttime (rho = 0.45). The prevailing intra-urban surface thermal variability in Athens was well reproduced by a 5-day numerical experiment using the meteorological Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) model and a modified urban parameterization scheme. Although the simulation resulted in some systematic errors, the overall accuracy of the model was adequate, regarding the surface temperature (RMSE = 2.4 K) and the near-surface air temperature (RMSE = 1.7 K) estimations. © 2020 by the authors.

Green infrastructure provides a wide range of environmental, social, cultural, climate change adaptation, and mitigation benefits. However, for green infrastructure to do so, it needs to be integrated into national policy and city-planning strategies in ways that recognize its value and importance. Consequently, consistency and coherence between policy sectors and levels is essential. The more prominent urban green infrastructure is in national level policy, the easier it will be to ensure coherence and consistency between sectors and levels, as well as avoid national and local initiatives hindering each other's effectiveness. Integrating urban green infrastructure into planning processes should be a priority for all cities, but even more so for those in sub-Saharan Africa, which are undergoing rapid expansion. Here we focus on Malawi, one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We collated and reviewed national-level and city-level policies and strategies, ranging from housing to transport to biodiversity, in order to determine, based on vertical and horizontal integration processes, whether urban greenspaces and green infrastructure have been incorporated into planning and management priorities. We found little evidence that urban greenspaces and green infrastructure are incorporated into national-level decision-making processes.

This raises fundamental questions concerning how governing arrangements support or constrain climate hazard management. The paper assesses existing approaches to adapting to climate hazards in Calabar metropolis in Nigeria, where flooding is a major hazard. The governance systems adopted in the context of flood adaptation and their implication for practice is further investigated, and the strategies necessary for an improved implementation of climate hazard adaptation at the local governance level examined. Data for the study is collected from a stakeholder workshop and document analysis. Despite calls for decentralized governance and prevalence of a hierarchical system, other forms of governing coexist alongside these systems in Calabar. Five key strategies which should form the basis of urban climate hazard adaptation in practice, as identified by stakeholders, are synergy of activities among stakeholders; enforcement devoid of politics and bureaucracy, capacity building and information/data availability; increased focus on international cooperation and funding; and consideration of connections between flooding and other urban processes. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cities; Climate hazard; developing countries; flood adaptation; governance; informal interaction","adaptive management; flood; flooding; governance approach; stakeholder; urban climate; Calabar; Cross River [(STT) Nigeria]; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076931953

While the theoretical and empirical discussions remain inconclusive and controversial, the question of whether transport energy consumption and urbanization induce emissions of carbon dioxide in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains unclear. This study contributes to the ensuing debate on sustainable transportation and urban development, focusing on the link between transport energy consumption, urbanization and carbon emissions in 19 SSA countries over 31 years (1980–2011). Using the IV-GMM estimator that accounts for endogeneity and cross-sectional dependence inherent in panel dataset, three key findings emerge from the study. First, we find substantial evidence that CO2 emission increases with transport energy consumption and decreases with urbanization. Second, factors such as electricity consumption and population growth rate worsen CO2 emission, whereas regulatory quality and FDI significantly reduce carbon emission in the region. Third, the predicted effect of urbanization and transport energy consumption on CO2 emission vary quite dramatically across SSA countries. We argue for drastic policies tailored towards reducing carbon emission in SSA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Environmental degradation; Pollution; Transport energy; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Growth rate; Population statistics; Urban growth; Cross sectional dependence; Electricity-consumption; Environmental quality; Population growth rates; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable transportation; Transport energy; Urban development; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; environmental quality; sustainability; sustainable development; urban transport; urbanization; Africa south of the Sahara; agriculture; Article; carbon emission; carbon footprint; controlled study; cross-sectional study; economic development; electricity; energy consumption; environment; human; mathematical model; policy; population growth; prediction; priority journal; traffic and transport; urbanization; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088303780

This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average.

The solar plant comprises 144 LCPV/T collectors based on a hybridized version of a local parabolic trough technology. Dynamic thermal and electrical performance analyses were performed in the TRNSYS simulation studio. The results showed that the solar field could cover up to 72% of the hot water demand of the building during the summer season and 24% during the winter season. The hybrid system could annually save 7185 USD, accounting for heat (natural gas boiler) and electricity generation. However, the payback time was of 19.23 years, which was mainly attributed to a reduced natural gas price in Monterrey, Mexico. A new approach to evaluating the equivalent levelized cost of heat (LCOHeq), is proposed. This results in an LCOHeq of 0.065 USD/kWh, which is nearly equivalent to the LCOH of a natural gas-fired boiler (0.067 USD/kWh). Finally, the hybrid plant could achieve a specific CO2e emission reduction of 77.87 kg CO2e per square meter of the required installation area. © 2020 by the authors.

The hydraulic insufficiency of spillways is the most hazardous related risk that directly threatens the dams’ safety. Thus, the Piano Key Weir (PKW) technology may be a cost-effective solution for adapting the spillways of the existing dams and enhancing their resilience against climate change. This paper aims to provide the state of knowledge regarding the climate change issues related to dams with a focus on Morocco. It aims also to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing the PKW in 27 large Moroccan dams in order to increase the flood release capacity. This work has determined, first, the climate change impacts on water resources and dams, and has discussed the adaptation measures including the implementation of PKW. Then, a detailed case study has been conducted to evaluate the interest of implementing the PKW in Morocco, at the scale of each hydraulic basin, with a comparison to the international experience. Results have revealed that the PKW allows increasing the global discharge capacity of Moroccan spillways by 70%, at a total cost of about 600 MMAD. Souss Massa Draa basin has accounted more than 40% of the total discharge capacity increase, and the best cost-effectiveness values have been identified in Loukkos, Oum Er Rbiaa and Sebou basins.

Liming also modulates the production and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in soils, but the direction and strength of such effects are largely unknown. Since lime application is not a dichotomous variable (application or not), but rather can be dosed according to crop requirements, a critical research gap is whether liming effects on GHG emissions are linear or follow alternate relationships. Based on two-years of data from a long-term field-liming experiment (initiated in 1942), we show that the relationship between an established soil pH gradient (pH of 3.77, 4.92, 6.39, and 6.84 in 1 M KCl extracts) and the emission of GHGs deviates from linearity. Liming increased carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from ecosystem respiration, but there were no differences between limed treatments. The increased respiration was due to higher plant carbon (C) inputs and root respiration, enhanced decomposition activity (β-glucosidase) and increased abundance of specific microbial groups (e.g., cellulose-decomposing bacteria). Liming decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to increased N2O reduction via denitrification and by promoting plant growth. Compared with native acidic soil, lime application stimulated methane (CH4) oxidation, but the highest liming rate was least stimulatory. This aligned with the soil CH4 oxidation potential, which was modified by liming-induced changes in soil microbial structure as indicated by phospholipid fatty acid analyses. There were no differences in soil organic C (SOC) content between liming levels, apparently because increased ecosystem respiration rates compensated for higher plant C inputs from limed plots. Overall, our results reveal a fundamental ecological trade-off: applying lime at a rate that maximizes crop yield with low N2O emissions may increase CO2 emissions (not compensated by higher SOC in a sandy soil) and decrease CH4 oxidation compared to liming applications below this level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem respiration; Liming; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Soil functioning; Soil pH","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Crops; Decomposition; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Gas emissions; Lime; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Phospholipids; Potassium compounds; Soils; Agricultural practices; Beta glucosidase; Critical researches; Ecosystem respiration; Microbial structures; Phospholipid fatty acid analysis; Production and consumption; Root respiration; Greenhouse gases; crop yield; denitrification; enzyme; enzyme activity; fatty acid; greenhouse gas; liming; microbial activity; microbial community; pH; relative abundance; trade-off; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorine Compounds; Ecosystems; Farm Crops; Fatty Acids; Lime; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090740620
