This two-track approach is important to maximizing and accelerating shipping's reduction in GHG emissions. LNG's environmental footprint is significantly better than alternative fuels, e.g., distillates and heavy fuel oils, having almost no sulfur or particulate emission and significantly less nitrous oxide emission, leading to considerably less local pollution around ports and port cities. Specifically, life-cycle assessment of GHG emissions has found LNG to be up to 33% less than traditional heavy fuel oils, a performance which includes any methane slip along the life cycle value chain. Combining LNG as a marine fuel with energy deficient design and operations can make a vessel compliant with IMO 2050 targets.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098329014

An important component of this concept is the use of one starter generator (SG) instead of two separate electric machines for starting the engine and powering on-board consumers. Permanent magnet (PM) machines are good candidates for use as SG in an automobile due to advantages such as high power density, torque, and energy efficiency. This article presents a thermal analysis of the generator mode of SG operation. First, the necessity of conducting such a study in order to obtain a forecast of the maximum temperatures of the winding and magnets is justified. Next, we describe the formulation of the problem of 2-D modeling of the temperature field in convective heat exchange with the environment under conditions of natural heat removal and forced blowing of the finned housing. As a result of FE modeling, the temperature state of the active parts of the SG is estimated and recommendations are given for the choice of insulating and magnetic materials. © 2020 IEEE.","electric transport; FE modeling; starter-generator; temperature field","AC generator motors; Electric drives; Electric generators; Electric windings; Energy efficiency; Fuel consumption; Ignition; Magnetic materials; Thermoanalysis; Continuous operation; Convective heat; High power density; Maximum temperature; On-board systems; Permanent-magnet machine; Starter generators; Thermal condition; Permanent magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098858314

A first analysis on projections of the SAT by the state-of-the-art regionally coupled atmosphere-ocean model ROM, including exchanges of momentum, heat, and water fluxes between the atmosphere (Regional Model) and ocean (Max Planck Institute Ocean Model) models, shows the following results: (i) In both seasons, the highest SAT occurs over the southern coastal area while the lowest over the northern mountains. The highest warming magnitudes are located in the northwestern part of the ICP. The regionally averaged SAT over the ICP increases by 2.61 °C in the wet season from short- to long-term future, which is slightly faster than that of 2.50 °C in the dry season. (ii) During the short-term future, largest SAT trends occur over the southeast and northwest ICP in wet and dry seasons, respectively. On regional average, the wet season is characterized by a significant warming rate of 0.22 °C decade−1, while it is non-significant with 0.11 °C decade−1 for the dry season. For the long-term future, the rapid warming is strengthened significantly over whole ICP, with trends of 0.51 °C decade−1 and 0.42 °C decade−1 in wet and dry seasons, respectively. (iii) In the long-term future, more conspicuous warming is noted, especially in the wet season, due to the increased downward longwave radiation. Higher CO2 concentrations enhancing the greenhouse effect can be attributed to the water vapor–greenhouse feedback, which, affecting atmospheric humidity and counter radiation, leads to the rising SAT. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; atmospheric forcing; climate modeling; seasonal variation; surface temperature; temperature effect; Indochina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088840386

In this study, we investigated in detail the role of the Cu-CeO2 interactions for methanol synthesis, emphasizing the role of the copper surface and interface sites between copper and ceria for the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO. A combined CO2-N2O titration approach was developed to quantify the exposed metallic copper sites and ceria oxygen vacancies in reduced Cu/CeO2 catalysts. Extensive characterization shows that copper dispersion is strongly enhanced by strong Cu-CeO2 interactions in comparison to Cu/SiO2. CO2 hydrogenation activity data show that the Cu/CeO2 catalysts displayed higher methanol selectivity compared to a reference Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The improved methanol selectivity stems from inhibition of the reverse water-gas-shift activity. The role of CO in CO2-to-methanol conversion was studied by steady-state and transient cofeeding activity measurements together with (quasi) in situ characterization (TPH, XPS, SSITKA, and IR spectroscopy). The Cu-CeO2 interface provides active sites for the direct hydrogenation of CO to methanol via a formyl intermediate. Cofeeding of small amounts of CO2 to a CO/H2 mixture poisons these interfacial sites due to the formation of carbonate-like species. Methanol synthesis proceeds mainly via CO2 hydrogenation in which the metallic Cu surface provides the active sites.

Researches on green and low-carbon power have attracted increasing attention. In this paper, we analyze and compare the carbon emissions from thermal power sector in 30 Chinese provinces, divided into three main regions. Based on the panel data over the period 2002–2016, we use a slacks-based measurement (SBM) model to measure the carbon emission efficiency of China’s power sector. The results show that the carbon emission efficiency of the system is relatively low, with marked differences among regions. Based on the Moran’s I, we further found spatial heterogeneity in carbon emission efficiency of provincial power sector. Policies for adaptation and mitigation of climate change should have regional differences. Interregional collaboration also plays a key role in adapting to and mitigating climate change. For China, it is an important issue to develop clean coal-fired power generation and vigorously develop renewable energy.

Tritons were generated by the D-D reaction in the core plasma during the plasma discharges. To remove the tritium in plasma facing surfaces for safety in maintenance, hydrogen (H) plasma experiments were performed for one month after the four months of D plasma experiments. In this study, the removal effect of the tritium by H plasma discharges was investigated. Six stainless steel (SUS316L) samples were introduced into a position of the first-wall of the LHD in the last month of the D experiments, which were exposed to the D plasma for one month and then, three samples were continued to exposure to the following H plasma for another one month. The experimental results showed that one-half of the tritium in the surface region of the SUS sample was removed, which was measured by the TIPT (Tritium imaging plate technique). Further, hydrothermal treatments were performed and the results showed that the tritium retention in the bulk of the SUS materials was also reduced. Meanwhile, the carbon content in the near-surface region was also reduced after H plasma experiments, which reduces the possibility of the formation of the C–H chemical bond. © 2020","First wall; Hydrothermal; Imaging plate; Plasma discharge; Tritium","Hydrogen; Tritium; Experimental campaign; Hydrothermal treatments; Large Helical Device; Near surface regions; Plasma experiments; Plasma facing surfaces; Tritium imaging plate techniques; Tritium retention; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087938384

The biosurfactant produced by Y2 could reduce surface tension of water from 72.2 mN/m to 30.2 mN/m with a CMC value of 187.5 mg/L and showed strong tolerance against wide ranges of pH (2–12), temperatures (4–100 °C), and salinity (0–100 g/L). Through thin layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, the biosurfactant was characterized as lipopeptide. Inoculation of Acinetobacter sp. Y2 into HF-FPW greatly increased the activity and growth of the microcosm. Meanwhile, it significantly (P < 0.05) promoted the removal of chemical oxygen demand (reduction from 6646.7 mg/L to 1546.7 mg/L), and the degradation of n-alkanes (reduction from 2635.4 mg/L to 159.7 mg/L) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (reduction from 918.6 μg/L to 209.6 μg/L) in 7 days. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the inoculation of indigenous biosurfactant producer modified the bacterial community structure and enriched the hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms including Pseudomonas sp. and Rhizobium sp. The real-time quantitative PCR results showed that the expression of several key functional genes was greatly enhanced by Y2 addition and was significantly correlated with Acinetobacter sp.

Despite the increasing number of investigations into the carbon leakage induced by emission trading, there is a lack of empirical research on the specific leakage channels related to the emission trading market. This paper develops a difference-in-difference-in-differences model to identify carbon leakage directions in emission trading pilots in China. The issue of whether market participation and industrial transfer are the specific leakage channels related to emission trading is also examined. Emission trading pilots lead to reverse carbon leakage, which moves from the non-pilot region to the pilot region. Market participation and industrial transfer are confirmed to be the specific leakage channels in emission trading. Of the two channels, market participation is the one that determines the reverse direction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon leakage channel; Carbon leakage direction; Difference-in-difference-in-differences model; Emission trading; Shift-share method","Carbon; Emission control; Channel identification; Difference-in-difference-in-difference; Emission mitigation; Emission trading markets; Empirical research; Industrial transfers; Leakage channels; Market participations; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088648992

These policies largely focused on reducing emissions of major air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and primary aerosols. However, changes in such pollution also affect radiative forcing. To understand the climate consequences of these clean air actions in China, we evaluate the near-equilibrium climate response to sustained changes in aerosol (and precursors) emission rates equivalent to those that occurred in China between 2006 and 2017. During this period, China's SO2 emissions declined by ∼70%, and black carbon emissions declined by ∼30%. Climate simulations that used a fully coupled ocean and atmosphere climate model indicate that China's reductions in aerosol emission rates from 2006 to 2017 may exert a net increase in global radiative forcing of 0.09 ± 0.03 W m−2 and a mean warming of 0.12 ± 0.01 ◦C in the Northern Hemisphere; and may also affect the precipitation rates in East Asia and in more distant regions. The success of Chinese policies to further reduce aerosol emissions may bring additional net warming, and this 'unmasked' warming would in turn compound the challenge and urgency of international climate mitigation efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the impacts of this conversion on the contribution of fungi to N2O emission and on fungal community structure remain unclear. In this study, we determined the soil N2O emission rate, N2O production by fungi, associated fungal community diversity, and related ecological factors in chronological changes of tea crop systems (3, 36 and 105 years old tea orchards named T3, T36 and T105, respectively), and in an adjacent soil from a natural forest. The results indicate that the tea plantations significantly enhanced soil N2O production compared with the forest soil. Tea plantations significantly decreased soil pH and C/N ratio, but increased soil inorganic nitrogen (N). Furthermore, they increased the fungal contribution to the production of soil N2O, but decreased the bacterial counterpart. We also observed that fungal community and functional composition differed distinctly between tea plantations and forest. Additionally, most of the fungal groups in high N2O emission soils (T36 and T105) were identified as the genus Fusarium, which were positively correlated with soil N2O emissions. The variation in N2O emission response could be well explained by NO3−-N, soil organic carbon (SOC), C/N, and Fusarium, which contributed to up to 97% of the observed variance. Altogether, these findings provide significant direct evidence that the increase of soil N2O emissions and fungal communities be attributed to the conversion of natural forest to tea plantations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acidic soil; Cash crops; Fusarium; Land use change; Nitrous oxide","Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Tea; Tropics; Ecological factors; Functional compositions; Fungal community; Inorganic nitrogen; Natural forests; Soil microbial community; Soil organic carbon; Subtropical forests; Fungi; carbon; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil organic carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; carbon; community dynamics; forest soil; fungus; microbial community; nitrous oxide; plantation forestry; soil emission; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; species diversity; tea; tropical forest; Article; chronology; controlled study; crop; fungal community; Fusarium; land use; microbial diversity; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; plantation; soil; soil acidity; tea; tropical rain forest; forest; fungus; microbiology; mycobiome; tea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Fusarium; Carbon; Forests; Fungi; Mycobiome; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086939172

As the capacity of renewable electricity grows, however, so does the renewable electricity that is generated but cannot be used when supply exceeds demand, which is referred to as curtailment. Curtailment is a growing concern that deteriorates the economic viability of renewables. This paper evaluates the idea of migrating workloads between data centers to reduce curtailment. Our analysis shows that using the underutilized capacity of data centers during the hours of excessive electricity supply can reduce curtailment and greenhouse gas emissions at negative costs. Applying this idea on a global scale has the potential to address the growing challenges of renewable curtailment and climate change in a cost-effective manner. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.As the share of variable renewable energy (VRE) grows in the electric grid, so does the risk of curtailment. While energy storage and hydrogen production have been proposed as solutions to the curtailment problem, they often pose technological and economic challenges. Here, we analyze the potential of data center load migration for mitigating curtailment and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using historical hourly electricity generation, curtailment, and typical data center server utilization data, we simulate the effect of migrating data center workloads from the fossil-fuel-heavy PJM to the renewable-heavy CAISO. The results show that load migration within the existing data center capacity during the curtailment hours in CAISO has the potential to reduce 113–239 KtCO2e per year of GHG emissions and absorb up to 62% of the total curtailment with negative abatement costs in 2019. Our study demonstrates the overlooked role that data centers can play for VRE integration and GHG emissions mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Rapid growth of variable renewable energy comes with increasing risk of curtailment. This is the first study that examines the potential of workloads migration between data centers in reducing curtailment and greenhouse gas emissions.

This study investigated the variations in chemical compositions, source contributions, and regional transport of fine particles (PM2.5) during January 23–February 22 of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 72.9 μg m−3 (2019) to 45.9 μg m−3 (2020), by 27.0 μg m−3. It was predominantly contributed by the emission reduction (92.0%), retrieved from a random forest tree approach. The main chemical species of PM2.5 all decreased with the reductions ranging from 0.85 μg m−3 (chloride) to 9.86 μg m−3 (nitrate) (p &lt; 0.01). Positive matrix factorization model indicated that the mass contributions of seven PM2.5 sources all decreased. However, their contribution percentages varied from −11.0% (industrial processes) to 8.70% (secondary inorganic aerosol). Source contributions of PM2.5 transported from potential geographical regions showed reductions with mean values ranging from 0.22 to 4.36 μg m−3. However, increased contributions of firework burning, secondary inorganic aerosol, road dust, and vehicle emissions from transboundary transport were observed. This study highlighted the complex and nonlinear response of chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 to air pollution control measures, suggesting the importance of regional-joint control. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical composition; COVID-2019; Fine particle; Random forest tree; Regional transportation; Source apportionment","Air quality; Chlorine compounds; Decision trees; Emission control; Factorization; Geographical regions; Chemical compositions; Emission reduction; Industrial processs; Mass concentration; Non-linear response; Positive matrix factorization models; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Source contributions; Aerosols; ammonia; calcium; carbon monoxide; chloride; chromium; coal; magnesium; manganese; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; potassium; sodium; sulfur dioxide; chemical composition; concentration (composition); emission control; particulate matter; pollutant source; respiratory disease; urban area; viral disease; air pollutant; Article; atmosphere; biomass; chemical composition; China; combustion; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dust; exhaust gas; geography; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; secondary inorganic aerosol; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; particulate matter; virus pneumonia; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Air Pollutants; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086401720

In a two-sector economic model with endogenous growth, we construct a 7-dimensional nonlinear system and then linearize the nonlinear system to derive the expression of the SCC containing the damage function. We find that the selected damage function has significant impacts when we calculate the SCC. In our model, the long run SCC per unit of output is the discount flow of the damage function caused by temperature rise and it is also affected by temperature adjustment rate and some other parameters. The specific form of damage function directly affects the social evaluation of the externality of pollution. The concavity of the SCC in the time path depends on second derivative of the damage function in infinite time. Higher-order damage function increase the SCC. We find that when the society is in an optimal state, the long-term economic growth rate can still be guaranteed to be positive when the convex damage function is chosen. The key of mitigation and adaptation strategies is the development of effective climate policies. Thus, as global recommendations for mitigation and adaptation strategies, we recommendation policy makers to use a highly convex damage function to calculate the SCC. We suggest policy makers consider carbon tax policies based on SCC. This makes the economic view of pollution closer to the mitigation target of climate policy-makers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Damage function; Economic growth rate; Endogenous growth; The social cost of carbon","adaptive management; climate effect; cost analysis; economic growth; mitigation; policy making; pollution policy; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076861421

However, current debates about urbanization and carbon emissions generally do not take into account the heterogeneities in urbanization and economic development levels. The goal of this study is to revisit the urbanization–emissions nexus by considering such heterogeneities in the Chinese context. The results reveal that there is significant heterogeneity in the total factor carbon emission performance index across provinces. Specifically, the relationship between carbon emission performance and urbanization reflects a U-shaped curve. Urbanization is found to have a stronger inhibiting effect on carbon emission performance when economic development levels improve. The results suggest that tailoring policies to each region’s conditions, promoting investments in energy-saving and emissions-reducing technologies, and improving the use of public transportation could be mitigation strategies for global change that lead to low-carbon urbanization. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emission performance; Economic development heterogeneity; Non-radical direction function; Threshold effect; Urbanization heterogeneity","carbon emission; economic development; emission control; global change; heterogeneity; performance assessment; public transport; transportation; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089070904

However, the relationship between carbon materials and the microbial community needs further clarification. In this study, a novel nickel-doped magnetic carbon material was produced to compare its role in biohydrogen (bioH2) production under mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) conditions. Material characterization showed that NiFe2O4 and Ni(OH)2 were well doped into the activated carbon without obviously reducing its specific surface area. A moderate amount (200–600 mg/L) of magnetic carbon boosted bioH2 production, while excess magnetic carbon inhibited bioH2 evolution. The highest H2 yields of 260 and 192 mL/g glucose were found at 600 mg/L (37 °C) and 800 mg/L magnetic carbon (55 °C), which were 46.9% and 60.0% higher than the control yields, respectively. The microbial community revealed that such magnetic carbon significantly increased the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (57.91%) in the mesophilic process, and Clostridium sensu stricto 7 (24.29%), 8 (7.39%) and 10 (24.85%) were the dominant bacteria in thermophilic fermentation.

Here, we consider the CO reduction step on Cu(111), which is critical to understanding reaction selectivity. We optimize embedding potentials at the periodic plane-wave DFT level using density functional embedding theory (DFET). All possible adsorption sites (adsites) for each adsorbate then are screened with ECW theory at the catalytically active site to refine the local electronic structure. Unsurprisingly, DFT and ECW theory predict different adsite preferences, largely because of DFT's inability to properly situate the CO 2π∗ level. Differing preferred adsites suggest that different reaction pathways could emerge from DFT versus ECW theory. Starting from these preferred ECW theory adsites, we then obtain reaction pathways at the plane-wave DFT level using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method to determine minimum energy paths. Thereafter, we perform ECW calculations at the catalytically active site to correct the energetics at each interpolated structure (image) along the reaction pathways. Via this approach, we confirm that the first step in CO reduction via hydrogen transfer on Cu(111) is to form hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) instead of formyl (*CHO). Although the prediction to preferentially form*COH is consistent with that of DFT, the two theories predict quite different structural and mechanistic behaviors, suggesting that verification is needed for other parts of the mechanism of CO2 reduction, which is the subject of ongoing work.

The identification and quantification of plant water uptake from precipitation, soil and groundwater remain challenging along large climatic gradient. Methods: Stable oxygen isotope compositions of xylem water, soil water and groundwater were analyzed to assess seasonal and spatial patterns of water uptake of 11 major plant species along the Heihe River Basin. Conclusions: In the upper reaches, soil water recharged by precipitation was the main plant water source, and plants extracted water from the shallow soil water in wet season while used more deep soil water in dry season. In the middle reaches of desert-oasis ecotone, the water sources of shrubs shifted between soil moisture and groundwater depending on variations of precipitation and groundwater level, while shrubs at Gobi relied on deep soil water and shallow soil water after rainfall. In the lower reaches, the driest part of the region, groundwater and deep soil water were main water sources for the riparian plants. Groundwater was stable water source for shrubs growing on the planted shrubland, and soil water was stable water sources for shrubs growing at Gobi. Our results also revealed that water use strategies of the same species were plastic under different groundwater level and precipitation. This study identified water use patterns of different plant species along a climatic gradient and provided scientific implication for water management of different ecosystems of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Groundwater; Heihe River Basin; Hydrogen isotope; Oxygen isotope; Plant water source; Soil water","dry season; oxygen isotope; semiarid region; shallow soil; soil moisture; soil water; water uptake; water use; wet season; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090157636

However, there is still a lack of research on the temporal and spatial changes of CO2 emissions in long-term series and their relationship with land surface temperature. In this study, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) data, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) composite data, energy consumption statistics data and nighttime land surface temperature are selected to realize the spatial informatization of long-term series CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Delta region, which reveals the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of CO2 emissions, spatial autocorrelation distribution patterns and their impacts on nighttime land surface temperature. According to the results, CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Delta region show an obvious upward trend from 2000 to 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 6.26%, but the growth rate is gradually slowing down. In terms of spatial distribution, the CO2 emissions in that region have significant regional differences. Shanghai, Suzhou and their neighboring cities are the main distribution areas with high CO2 emissions and obvious patch distribution patterns. From the perspective of spatial trend, the areas whose CO2 emissions are of significant growth, relatively significant growth and extremely significant growth account for 8.78%, 4.84% and 0.58%, respectively, with a spatial pattern of increase in the east and no big change in the west. From the perspective of spatial autocorrelation, the global spatial autocorrelation index of CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Delta region in the past 18 years has been greater than 0.66 (p &lt; 0.01), which displays significant positive spatial autocorrelation characteristics, and the spatial agglomeration degree of CO2 emissions continues to increase from 2000 to 2010. From 2000 to 2017, the nighttime land surface temperature in that region showed a warming trend, and the areas where CO2 emissions are positively correlated with nighttime land surface temperature account for 88.98%. The increased CO2 emissions lead to, to a large extent, the rise of nighttime land surface temperature.

This work developed a new strategy for sewage sludge treatment involving the integration of hydrothermal treatment (HT) with anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD), particularly on the feasibility of mesophilic AcoD of anaerobically digested sludge (DS) hydrolysate and waste activated sludge (WAS). Results show that AcoD of DS hydrolysate from HT 170℃ for 30 min with WAS achieved the highest CH4 production of 205.39 mL CH4/g-VSfed. By adopting the new AD-HT170-AcoD strategy, 61.88 mL CH4/g-tVSfed higher CH4 yield and 22.2% more total solids (TS) reduction were obtained in addition to much better sludge settleability and 7.6% wt. less sludge cake production compared to the conventional mono AD. Although negative energy gain was obtained, the proposed AD-HT170-AcoD strategy is promising, economically feasible, and sustainable when the final sludge disposal of WAS is concerned in the context of whole WWTP. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic co-digestion; Anaerobically digested sludge; Energy balance; Hydrothermal treatment; Waste activated sludge","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge disposal; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic co-digestion; Anaerobically digested sludges; Feasibility assessment; Hydrothermal treatments; Sewage sludge treatment; Sludge management strategy; Waste activated sludges; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; concentration (composition); feasibility study; sewage; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; article; energy balance; feasibility study; hydrolysis; sludge disposal; sludge treatment; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; feasibility study; sewage; waste water; methane; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Feasibility Studies; Methane; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087210449

Northeast China is one of the major contributors to domestic burning emissions in China; however, the high-resolution emissions inventories of domestic biomass and coal burning in Northeast China are lacked, which are needed to estimate the extent of its impact. In this study, we established a town-level emissions inventory of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM) from domestic biomass and coal burning, based on per household consumption in each town in rural region of Northeast China. The results revealed that biomass burning was the major domestic burning source over the region in 2016. Domestic biomass burning is the major contributor to PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions, while coal burning is the major contributor to SOP2 emissions. High emissions intensities were concentrated around the cities of Harbin, Suihua, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Chifeng, each with emissions intensity for PM2.5 and VOCs of more than 2000 Mg per 27 km × 27 km grid cell. Additionally, there are three burning peaks (6–7 am, 12 pm and 4–7 pm) during both the heating (from October to April) and non-heating seasons (from May to September), due to cooking and heating. The burning peaks in the non-heating season were more notable than those in the heating season. These results suggest that the government should pay more attention to domestic biomass and coal burning in rural areas, in order to reduce pollutant emissions and control regional haze during the heating season. © 2020, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","indoor air pollution; particulate matter (PM); residential emission; source contribution; spatiotemporal distribution","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; emission control; emission inventory; haze; household energy; indoor air; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098461848

The bulk Richardson number method is used to derive the PBLH at hourly scales from the AMDAR profiles. It is found that the estimated PBLH is sensitive to the value of the critical bulk Richardson number and to the consideration of the surface friction effect, especially under stable and near-neutral conditions. Parameters constrained by field campaign observations are finally selected to estimate the PBLH. The results reveal that the diurnal climatology of PBLH exhibits seasonal and spatial variations, with greater diurnal variations in spring and summer and in the western regions. It is demonstrated that the traditional twice-daily radiosonde data may roughly capture the diurnal amplitude of PBLH in the western but not the eastern CONUS. Compared to the AMDAR data, the ERA5 reanalysis product overestimates the daytime PBLH throughout the CONUS by 18–41% and shows an earlier peak time by 1–2 hr in the western regions and a later peak time by 1 hr in the eastern regions. ©2020.

Herein, by varying the pretreatment temperature of iridium/titanium oxide (Ir/TiO2) catalysts, the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to sole production of CO can be finely tuned. The change of product selectivity is achieved in such a way that the selectivity greatly depend on the formation of a reduced TiOx overlayer around Ir nanoparticles (NPs) as originated from the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). With only a weak reduction treatment, the exposed Ir NPs without a TiOx coating promote CH4 production exclusively. After the catalyst undergoes a high temperature reduction, the evolution of the TiOx coating over Ir NPs shows a preference for CO production with an inhibition of further methanation. This study not only provides insights into the regulation of CO2 hydrogenation by SMSI, but also serves as an effective approach to tuning other catalytic processes.

In this study, we estimate the contribution of BC and dust to glacial melting in Central Asia. Average BC and dust concentrations in the surface snow of the Muz Taw glacier are 1788 ± 1754 ng g−1 and 172 ± 178 μg g−1, respectively. Simulation using the Snow Ice and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model indicates that the combined effect of BC and dust reduces the snow albedo by approximately 6.24% to 50.4% relative to clean snow. Radiative forcing (RF) induced by BC and dust deposited in snow ranges from 1.61 to 32.69 W m−2, with an average of 16.74 W m−2 for the central scenario. Thus, glacier melting can be enhanced by 36.37 cm w.e. by BC and dust in snow, accounting for about 16.3% of the total glacier melt. LAIs deposited on the Muz Taw glacier mostly originate from Central Asia, West Siberia and local emissions during the study period. More than 80% of BC deposited is attributed to anthropogenic emissions. These results strengthen the important role of BC and dust in glacier melting in Central Asia, and further highlights the potential benefits of mitigation of BC emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Central Asia; Glacier; Mineral dust; Radiative forcing; Snow albedo","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Glacial geology; Melting; Particulate emissions; Snow; Aerosol radiation; Anthropogenic emissions; Combined effect; Dust concentrations; Glacier melting; Local emissions; Potential benefits; Radiative forcings; Dust; black carbon; snow; albedo; anthropogenic source; black carbon; concentration (composition); glacier; mineral dust; radiative forcing; snow; air pollution; Article; Asia; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; glacier; melting point; mineral dust; priority journal; radiative forcing; Russian Federation; seasonal variation; simulation; Central Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086892741

For reliable plant operation, and to improve the economics of the process, secure co-feedstock supply (ideally as a waste-stream) is important. To this end, this study investigated the feasibility of co-digesting microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) with potato processing waste (potato discarded parts, PPWdp; potato peel, PPWp) and glycerol, while monitoring the response of the methanogenic community. In this semi-continuous study, glycerol (1 and 2% v/v) added to mixtures of C. vulgaris : PPWdp enhanced the specific methane yields the most, by 53-128%, whilst co-digestion with mixtures of C. vulgaris : PPWp enhanced the methane yields by 62-74%. The microbial communities diverged markedly over operational time, and to a lesser extent in response to glycerol addition. The acetoclast Methanosaeta was abundant in all treatments but was replaced by Methanosarcina in the potato peel with glycerol treatment due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation.

This study used the DPSIR (Driver–Pressure–State–Impact–Response) framework as a conceptual basis to explore the relationship between water footprint (WF) trends and climate change and agricultural-economic variation. With the aim of mitigating water crisis and ensuring robust responses to the uncertainty of the future, an uncertainty-based multivariate statistical approach was proposed for WF prediction by using various scenarios combined with multiple linear regression and Monte Carlo simulation. Lake Dianchi in China was used as the case study area. The results indicate that (1) the total WF had an increasing trend of 394.39 m3 ton−1 year−1; the WFgreen (the precipitation used in the crop production process) had a decreasing trend, while the WFblue (the irrigation water withdrawn from the ground or surface water) and WFgrey (the water used to dilute the load of pollutants, based on existing ambient water quality standards) exhibited an increasing trend; (2) the total WF showed a distinct increasing trend under climate change and agricultural-economic variation due to the increase of the WFgrey during 1981–2011; and (3) the impact of agricultural-economic factors on WF trends, especially on the WFblue and WFgrey, far outweighed the impact of climatic factors under the alternative scenarios. Our results suggest that adaptive management of anthropogenic activities should be prioritized to mitigate water stress under climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; DPSIR framework; Lake Dianchi Basin; Monte Carlo simulation; Water footprint","agricultural application; agricultural economics; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; crop production; hydrological response; Monte Carlo analysis; multivariate analysis; nature-society relations; numerical model; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis; water footprint; water management; water use; weather forecasting; China; Dianchi Basin; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087789411

This work aims to evaluate the health and associated economic impacts of changes in air quality induced by heat wave, stagnation, and compound extremes under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition is applied to estimate health and related economic impacts of changes in surface O3 and PM2.5 levels due to heat wave, stagnation, and compound extremes over the continental U.S. during past (i.e., 2001–2010) and future (i.e., 2046–2055) decades under the two RCP scenarios. Under the past and future decades, the weather extremes-induced concentration increases may lead to several tens to hundreds O3-related deaths and several hundreds to over ten thousands PM2.5-related deaths annually. High mortalities and morbidities are estimated for populated urban areas with strong spatial heterogeneities. The estimated annual costs for these O3 and PM2.5 related health outcomes are $5.5–12.5 and $48.6–140.7 billion U.S. dollar for mortalities, and $8.9–97.8 and $19.5–112.5 million for morbidities, respectively. Of the extreme events, the estimated O3– and PM2.5–related mortality and morbidity attributed to stagnation are the highest, followed by heat wave or compound extremes. Large increases in heat wave and compound extreme events in the future decade dominate changes in mortality during these two extreme events, whereas population growth dominates changes in mortality during stagnation that is projected to occur less frequently. Projected reductions of anthropogenic emissions under both RCP scenarios compensate for the increased mortality due to increased occurrence for heat wave and compound extremes in the future. These results suggest a need to further reduce air pollutant emissions during weather extremes to minimize the adverse impacts of weather extremes on air quality and human health. © 2020 The Author(s)","Continental U.S.; Morbidity; Mortality; O3; PM2.5; Weather extremes","Air quality; Climatology; Diseases; Extreme weather; Population statistics; Quality control; Adverse health effects; Air pollutant emission; Anthropogenic emissions; Climate scenarios; Environmental benefits; Extreme weather events; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Spatial heterogeneity; Economic and social effects; air quality; atmospheric pollution; economic impact; extreme event; health expenditure; health impact; heat wave; morbidity; mortality; ozone; particulate matter; pollution effect; weather; air pollutant; air quality; article; climate; heat wave; human; morbidity; mortality; population growth; urban area; adverse event; air pollution; analysis; particulate matter; toxicity; weather; United States; ozone; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087294962

An assessment of long-term hydroclimate change in those regions remains unquantified at a global scale as of yet. By integrating lake records, PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations and modern observations, we assess the wet-dry status of global closed basins during the Last Glacial Maximum, mid-Holocene, pre-industrial, and 20th and 21st century periods. Results show comparable patterns of general wetter climate during the mid-Holocene and near-future warm period, mainly attributed to the boreal summer and winter precipitation increasing, respectively. The long-term pattern of moisture change is highly related to the high-latitude ice sheets and low-latitude solar radiation, which leads to the poleward moving of westerlies and strengthening of monsoons during the interglacial period. However, modern moisture changes show correlations with El Niño-Southern Oscillation in most closed basins, such as the opposite significant correlations between North America and southern Africa and between central Eurasia and Australia, indicating strong connection with ocean oscillation. The strategy for combating future climate change should be more resilient to diversified hydroclimate responses in different closed basins. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

Different types of plants exhibit different functional leaf traits, which can affect the dry deposition velocity (Vd). However, the most crucial leaf traits of coniferous and broadleaved trees remain unidentified. In this study, we selected 18 typical plants from the subtropical monsoon regions, where PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter of ≤2.5 μm) concentrations are relatively high, and classified them into coniferous and broadleaved categories. Subsequently, we analyzed the relationships between Vd and leaf surface free energy (SFE), single leaf area (LAs), surface roughness (SR), specific leaf area (SLA), epicuticular wax content (EWC), and width-to-length ratio (W/L). The results indicated that most coniferous trees exhibited a high Vd. The correlation analysis revealed that SFE, SR, LAs, and W/L were the key factors that affected the Vd of all the tested species. SFE and SLA had the strongest influence on the Vd of broadleaved trees, whereas LAs and SLA had the strongest effect on that of coniferous trees. Most coniferous trees had a high SLA, which can reduce water loss and hinder particle deposition. However, the stiff leaves of coniferous trees fluttered less, resulting in a larger leaf area that enhanced the capture efficiency. The leaf structure of broadleaved trees is more flexible, resulting in erratic flutter, which may impede deposition and lead to high resuspension. Coniferous and broadleaved trees may have different dominant leaf traits that affect particle deposition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deposition velocity (Vd); Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Single leaf area; Specific leaf area; Surface free energy","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Deposition; Free energy; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Surface roughness; Tropics; Airborne particulate matters; Capture efficiency; Correlation analysis; Dry deposition velocities; Epicuticular waxes; Fine particulate matter; Particle depositions; Surface free energy; Forestry; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; coniferous tree; dry deposition; monsoon; particulate matter; article; dry deposition; leaf area; particulate matter; velocity; particulate matter; plant leaf; plant seed; tree; vascular plant; Coniferales; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Seeds; Tracheophyta; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086132999

We questioned whether the addition of N and C, two important soil elements, would have different effects on plant functional groups and on the main plant species in an alpine steppe meadow ecosystem at an altitude of 4700 m. Methods: A two-factor completely randomized design study was used, with the addition of three levels of N (0, 50 and 100 kg N ha−1; urea as N source) and three levels of C (0, 60 and 120 kg C ha−1; sucrose as C source) and four replicates, each year from 2011−2014. Effects at the community, plant functional groups and species levels were examined in an alpine steppe meadow. Results and discussion: With N and C as a single additive, biomass of grasses increased while forbs decreased. Sedges remained unchanged with N addition and increased with C addition. These results may be due to competition among Stipa purpurea, Poa alpigena, Kobresia humilis and forbs for light resources. This effect could be explained by the increase in cover of the major gramineous species, Stipa purpurea, while the cover of the sedge, Kobresia humilis, tended to decrease or showed no change with N addition. High level of N addition alone produced highest biomass in a year of low natural primary production (without C and/or N addition). After the addition of N and C together, the biomass of the three plant functional groups did not change or even decreased compared with either C or N addition. Furthermore, C addition increased community stability but N addition did not. Conclusions: The effects of N and C addition on the biomass of plant functional groups were complicated by the interaction between N and C, as well as by a major effect of initial standing biomass. With the addition of both N and C, the biomass of grasses increased and forbs decreased, especially in low natural primary production years. With C as a single additive, the biomass of sedges increased as did community stability. Consequently, management of plant biomass using N and/or C addition depends on both the plant functional group target and the species within the group, as well as the natural primary production. Predicting environmental factors that potentially affect primary production are crucial in a decision-making nutrient management system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine steppe-meadow; Carbon addition; Community stability; Nitrogen addition; Northern Tibet; Plant functional groups; Primary production","alpine environment; carbon; fertilizer application; functional group; grassland soil; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phytomass; primary production; sedge; soil chemistry; steppe; temporal analysis; China; Xizang; Carex; Kobresia humilis; Poa pratensis subsp. alpigena; Poaceae; Stipa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087982299

Data from five upwind stations in the US, which are within 310 km (i.e., Allen Park and Lansing in Michigan, Erie, National Trail School, and Delaware in Ohio), were included to assess the regional characteristics of O3. The five US stations showed high degrees of similarity with O3 concentrations in Windsor, with overall strong correlations (r = 0.567–0.876 for hourly O3 and r = 0.587–0.92 for 8 h max O3 concentrations) and a low degree of divergence, indicating that O3 pollution in the study area shares regional characteristics. Meteorological conditions played important roles in O3 levels in Windsor. High O3 concentrations were associated with southerly and southwesterly air mass from which polluted and hot air mass was transported and that enhanced local photochemical O3 production. In contrast, northerly flows brought in clean, cool, and dry air mass, and led to low O3 concentrations. Strong correlations were found between numbers of days with 8 h max O3 concentrations greater than 70 ppb and numbers of days with daily max temperature greater than 30◦ C, as well as between daily max temperatures and 8 h max O3 concentrations. Nearly half (45%) of the high O3 days (≥90th percentile) occurred in dry tropical weather during 1996–2015, and the 90th percentile 8 h max O3 was associated with dry tropical weather. Occurrences of both southerly flow hours and dry tropical weather type in the smog season increased during the study period.

However, considering the high ash content and low heat value of sludge, co-combustion of sludge and MSW in GF may lead to combustion instability and an increase of fly ash (FA) production, which further aggravates ash deposition and corrosion of heating surfaces. Besides, semi-dried sludge powder with tiny particle size may cause dust explosion and increase the clinker ignition loss of slag ash due to the leakage in grates. In this study, semi-dried sludge powder is compressed into pellets through a rotary ring die granulator to investigate the effect of sludge pellets addition on gaseous pollutant emissions, combustion characteristics and ash behavior (e.g., ash fusion temperature and the clinker ignition loss of slag ash). The results show that the ratio of FA produced from sludge pellets incineration is lower than that of sludge powder. The clinker ignition loss of slag ash of sludge pellets increases with the increase of its compressive strength. The highest clinker ignition loss under the low combustion temperature is 11.9% which is far beyond the limit (5%) for GF. The addition of desulfurizer (CaO, mass ratio: 1%) in sludge pellets is found useful to reduce sulfur dioxide emission with the maximum 84% desulphurization rate at the combustion section. The decrease of ash flow temperature from co-combustion of sludge and MSW is less than 10 °C compared to that from mono-combustion of MSW, which suggests that co-combustion of sludge with the mixing ratio of 10% in municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI) has little impact on fly ash slagging characteristics.

Based on national and provincial apple production data from 1978 to 2016, this study used the apple production concentration index to analyse the evolution characteristics of regional apple production patterns in China. A theoretical analysis framework was established and a spatial econometric model was used to quantitatively explore the influencing factors of China's apple production layout. The results showed that, first, since the reform and opening-up policy, a general trend of fluctuating growth was found for apple production in China. The centre of apple production layout moved in the southwest direction, with the shift from the Bohai Bay region to the Loess Plateau region. Second, apple production had a significant spatial correlation, while the degree of spatial agglomeration gradually decreased. Third, these changes were significantly influenced by apple comparative income, infrastructure, policies, and climatic conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue optimizing and adjusting the apple spatial layout to enhance the technological progress and economic effect of the apple industry and to ensure the stability and balance of regional supply and demand. © 2020 Zhang et al.

Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) carbon inventory method, the network approach and the environmentally extended multiregional input–output model, our study quantifies Beijing's production-, supply- and consumption-based electricity-related carbon emissions in 2007–2015. Additionally, methods of decomposition analysis are used to assess the impacts of the driving factors. The results show the following: (1) In 2015, Beijing obtained 45.6 million tons and 38.9 million tons of net inflow of electricity-related carbon emissions through electricity trade and regional trade, respectively. (2) Beijing obtained a large amount of electricity-related carbon emissions by purchasing heavy industrial products from Hebei, while Beijing's electricity-related carbon emissions flowing to Tianjin and Hebei consisted mainly of service industry products. (3) The fuel structure and energy efficiency contributed to the decline in Beijing's production-based emissions. Interprovincial electricity transmission offset the growth of supply-based emissions in Beijing. Improved electricity efficiency and production technology helped reduce consumption-based emissions, and the consumption volume was the major driver of the growth in consumption-based emissions. This study not only enhances our understanding of the environmental impacts associated with urban electricity consumption but also provides a basis for cross-regional environmental responsibility allocation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Carbon emissions; Electricity; Multiregional input–output model","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Commerce; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Industrial emissions; Service industry; Carbon inventories; Decomposition analysis; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity transmission; Electricity-consumption; Environmental responsibility; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Production technology; Electric power generation; carbon emission; electricity; energy efficiency; environmental impact; input-output analysis; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; numerical model; power generation; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087220263

As an industrial sector with high energy consumption, the construction sector is facing enormous pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Given the continuous integration of the world economy, the construction sector in each country has extensive linkages with other sectors and countries. By using a multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model and hypothetical extraction method (HEM), this paper aims to further decompose the CO2 emission linkages of the global construction sector from consumption-based and production-based perspectives in order to identify the key sectors and regions related to global trade. Based on data from the World Input–Output Database from 1995 to 2009, the results indicate that the average internationalization ratios of the net backward linkage and the net forward linkage of the global construction sector increased from 37% to 46% and from 16% to 20%, respectively. The global construction sector mainly imported CO2 emissions from secondary industry and the transportation industry. The construction sector exported small amounts of CO2 emissions to other sectors both domestically and internationally. The CO2 emission flows embodied in the international trade of the construction sector mainly occurred between the USA, China, Russia, Germany, and the Rest of the World (ROW). The construction sectors of the ROW imported the largest amount of CO2 emissions from China (32.72 Mt). The largest exported CO2 emission flow was between the construction sectors of the USA and the ROW, with a value of 0.091 Mt. Based on these findings, some corresponding countermeasures are suggested, such as optimizing international trade structures, establishing a mechanism for both consumers and producers to share responsibility for carbon emission reduction, applying new environmental materials, and upgrading industrial structures by reducing dependence on high-pollution sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Construction sector; Hypothetical extraction method; Inter-regional linkage; Inter-sectoral linkage; Internationalization; Multi-regional input–output model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Global warming; International trade; Carbon emission reductions; Construction sectors; Continuous integrations; Environmental materials; Global warming and climate changes; High energy consumption; Industrial structures; Transportation industry; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086588327

However, the leakage of global timber carbon stock is prominent, calling for unveiling the flow patterns of global trade-embodied timber carbon stock to scientifically allocate the contributions of cooperative emission reduction among nations. This study employed the multi-regional input-output model based on the Eora database to calculate the volume of timber carbon stock and analysed the spatial and temporal characteristics of 190 nations between 1990 and 2015 from the perspectives of production, consumption, and trade. Furthermore, it identified the directions of the timber carbon stock flow of critical nations. Based on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, we explored the allocation of timber carbon stock between suppliers and consumers. The results of this study show that developed nations consume a high volume of the timber carbon stock from developing and undeveloped economies through international trade.

However, the value of timber carbon stocks has been neglected for a long time, which has led to overemphasize the production yields of timber. This approach is detrimental to increasing forest carbon sinks. Therefore, quantifying the economic value of the timber carbon stocks and incorporating it into timber prices have great practical significance for sustainable forest development and climate change mitigation. Moreover, the leakage of the global timber carbon stock value (TCSV) is prominent, and the flow patterns of the global trade-embodied TCSV should be determined to precisely evaluate the forest assets of individual economies. Based on the Exiobase database and a multi-regional input-output model, this study calculated the TCSV of 43 economies and 5 regions from 1995-2011 considering the cross-border transfer of TCSV. Furthermore, the effects of incorporating TCSV into timber prices on various product prices were explored. The results show that the top 10 surplus economies regarding the accumulated TCSV between 1995 and 2011 are the major contributors of production-based timber carbon stock value, and the top 10 deficit economies are dominated by developed economies with large net import-embodied TCSV. The ripple effect of the rising price of timber caused by TCSV as an environmental cost mainly influenced harvested wood products and energy-fuel products. The research findings provide a scientific assessment of the TCSV and contribute to advancing the timber pricing mechanism to increase forest carbon sinks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental value; Input-output price model; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Price ripple effect; Timber carbon stock","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Forestry; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Developed economies; Environmental costs; Forest carbon sinks; Harvested wood products; Input output model; Pricing mechanism; Sustainable forest; Costs; carbon; carbon storage; climate change; environmental economics; forestry production; input-output analysis; pricing policy; sustainable development; Article; carbon storage; climate change; economic aspect; environmental parameters; forest; sustainable development; timber; timber carbon stock value; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086111566

To formulate targeted and effective emission mitigation policies, we need to fully understand the characteristics of the distribution and evolution of per capita HCEs and their urban-rural and regional heterogeneity. This paper explores the transitional dynamics of per capita HCEs in China by employing the distribution dynamics approach with panel data compiled at the household level. We find that the overall per capita HCEs are unimodal distribution in the long run and the distribution dynamics of the per capita HCEs between the urban and rural areas or among the regional subgroups are quite different. However, the speed of convergence has accelerated over time. Moreover, our findings indicate that the per capita HCEs in the urban areas will achieve convergence to an emission level much higher than that of the rural areas.

To exclude the contribution of adventitious carbon, monitoring the time course of 13CO2 conversion into 13C-fuel is essential, but has been rarely reported. In the present work, a composite of Au nanoparticles with ZrO2 was found to be effective in converting 13CO2 into 13CO at a rate of 0.17 μmol h−1 gcat−1 in the presence of H2 and UV–vis light. The detected 12CO as a minor byproduct (11.9 %) was identified as due to adsorbed 12CO2 from the air. The 12C ratio in the total amount of CO2 was evaluated based on a 13CO2 photoexchange reaction (8.7 %). The discrepancy between these values suggested a slower exchange reaction step between the chemisorption site for CO2 reduction and the physisorption site for CO2 compared to the reduction step to CO. Furthermore, based on in-profile kinetic studies using sharp-cut filters and control reactions in the dark, the contribution ratio for CO2 conversion was determined to be via charge separation at the band-gap of ZrO2 (λ &lt; 320 nm): 69 % and via ambient heat ([Formula presented]): 31 %. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of Au and infrared absorption in the range of λ &gt; 320 nm did not promote catalysis. The LSPR absorption was further investigated by Au L3-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Ambient heat on the Au nanoparticles should have promoted H2 activation enough, supplying protons to the CO2 reduction sites over ZrO2; however, a temperature increase of 26 K on the Au surface was marginal for further H2 activation. CO2 photoconversion with added moisture was also attempted; the CO formation rate using ZrO2 under these conditions was 0.15 μmol h−1 gcat−1. However, 47 % was characterized as 12CO originating from chemisorbed 12CO2, and H2 was also formed at a comparable rate of 0.14 μmol h−1 gcat−1 from a competing reaction. The addition of Au to ZrO2 was found to suppress CO formation and promote H2 formation, and Mg2+ addition to Au–ZrO2 effectively suppressed H2 formation directing to the CO formation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient heat; CO2 photoconversion; Extended X-ray absorption fine structure; Gold; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Zirconium oxide","Absorption spectra; Atomic physics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Chemical activation; Chemisorption; Energy gap; Extended X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; Gold nanoparticles; Light absorption; Magnesium compounds; Nanoparticles; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; X ray absorption; Zirconia; Adventitious carbon; Ambient heat; Contribution ratios; Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis; Extended X-ray absorption fine structures; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photoconversion; Temperature increase; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081330166

This paper evaluates the poverty alleviation impact of China's pilot carbon emissions trading schemes (ETS) at the provincial level before and after the program, which was implemented from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, we measure poverty alleviation in terms of rural residential income growth and rural job creation. By exploiting the quasi-experimental variation in whether provinces were affected by this pilot ETS policy, our analysis finds that the ETS policy resulted in increases in rural residential income and employment. We find the estimated effects correspond to an increase of approximately 752.6 yuan in annual rural residential income and 2.35% in the ratio of rural employed population to the total employed population, accounting for 9.5% of the rural residents' income and 7.11% of the rural employment, specifically. The results imply that the implementation of ETS is beneficial to income growth and job creation for rural areas of China, which mean the ETS policy may be conducive to poverty alleviation in affected provinces. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions trading; China; Difference-in-Differences; Poverty alleviation","compensation system; emissions trading; employment generation; environmental economics; environmental policy; experimental study; poverty alleviation; rural area; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; controlled study; economic development; employment; environmental policy; household income; human; poverty; quasi experimental study; railway; rural population; sustainable development; urban population; China; income; China; carbon; Carbon; China; Humans; Income; Poverty; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086905739

Plant biomass and soil chemical properties were also analyzed to understand the patterns of spatial variability of structure and function of denitrifier communities across the studied gradients. Results indicated that total, bacterial and fungal potential denitrification rates (TDR, BDR and FDR) were 5.5, 3.5 and 1.5 times greater respectively in the Mono soil than in the Nat soil. Denitrifying bacterial richness, evenness and α-diversity were 2.0, 1.3 and 1.3 times greater in the Mono soil than those in the Nat soil, while only the richness among denitrifying fungal community parameters was 1.4 times greater in the Mono soil than that in the Nat soil.

This article takes Diaoluo Mountain Forest Area as an example. Inventory calculation of forest resources with the help of the calculation method of the provincial greenhouse gas inventory compilation guide. Carbon sink measurement model is constructed in Diaoluo Mountain Forest Area. Changes in forest carbon storage and carbon emissions in five different periods from 1998 to 2018 were calculated. The results show that the forest carbon storage in Diaoluo Mountain Forest Area was 6.4 T, 1.1T, 1.2 T, 1.5 T and 2.1 Tons in the past five periods. Arbor forest has the largest proportion of carbon storage and is dominant; Carbon emissions in the five periods were 497T, 545 T, 263 T, 21T and 19 Tons. The moral is that,the total amount of forest net carbon has increased continuously, arbor forest is an important dominant position of carbon storage,the main gas absorbed and emitted by forest carbon sinks is carbon dioxide,the trend of increasing carbon storage and reducing carbon emissions is significant.It is suggested to continuously improve the community structure and promote the development of the forest carbon sink industry through the establishment of national parks and scientific management. Social capital participates in protecting national parks.

However, present noncontact measurement approaches based on diffractive groove arrays fabricated by imprinting have some limitation, e.g., the grooves should be processed before the solidification of soft materials or the depth and period of grooves cannot be flexibly adjusted. Here, a flexible and high-efficiency fabrication approach carbon-assisted laser interference lithography (CLIL) for periodical groove structures with structural color is proposed. This technique is to irradiate the interference laser on the PDMS surface coated by a carbon layer, which is used for enhanced laser absorption. The processing parameters are systematically studied and optimized to achieve a bright structural color. Benefiting from the advantages of CLIL, the structural color can be processed on a solidified transparent surface with controllable characteristics such as groove period and depth. Lastly, the motion of an electric-driven actuator can be real-time quantified by calibrating the relationship between the observation angle and the observed structural color.

Previous studies have focused on prediction and mapping of CH4 emission flux using process-based models, while application of statistical-empirical models for upscaling spatially sparse in situ measurements is scarce. In this study, we developed an empirical remote sensing upscaling approach to estimate CH4 emission flux in the Everglades using limited in situ point-based CH4 emission flux measurements and Landsat data during 2013–2018. We spatially and temporally linked in situ data with Landsat surface reflectance based on temporally composite data sets and developed an object-based machine learning framework to model and map CH4 emission flux. An ensemble analysis of two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), shows that the upscaling approach is promising for predicting CH4 emission flux with a R2 of 0.65 and 0.87 based on a fivefold cross-validation for a dry season and wet season estimation, respectively. We generated emission flux map products that successfully revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CH4 emission within the dominant freshwater marsh ecosystem in the Everglades.

In this study, lightweight reduced oxide graphene/carbon nanotube/natural rubber (rGO/CNT/NR) composites were fabricated by a facile and cost‐effective approach, which consists of rGO assembling on rubber latex particles and hydrogels formation due to the interaction network established between carbonaceous fillers and subsequent mild‐drying of the resulting hydrogels. Thanks to the amphiphilic nature of GO sheets, which can serve as a surfactant, the hydrophobic CNTs were easily dispersed into water under ultrasound. On the basis of both the high stable rGO and CNTs suspension and the assembling of rGO on rubber latex, a three‐dimensional segregated network of CNT and rGO were easily constructed in macro‐porous composites.

However, countries such as Brazil and Argentina have seen some of the most aggressive increases in individual country CO2 emissions over the last two decades. Given that 80% of Latin America’s population lives in cities, where we can expect the greatest increases in demand for energy and predicted growth in built floor space, it is necessary to ensure that these do not result in an overall growth in carbon emissions. Hence, we present the first review of the various “green building” rules developed in this region to curtail energy or carbon. This covers nine countries representing 80% of the region’s population. We find that these countries in Latin America have developed 94 different green building rules, though to different extents. Many pertain to domestic buildings that are known to contribute 17% of the overall carbon emissions. Subsidies and tax incentives are most common, whereas innovative carbon market schemes have only been adopted in Mexico and Chile. In Argentina and Chile, regulations are similar to their European cold-climate counterparts but are poorly enforced.

However, in recent years the levels have stalled, and there is evidence that the production of secondary pollutants may have started to rebound. Similar responses to changes in O3 precursors observed in other urban areas suggest major changes in atmospheric reactivity and O3 production P(O3), prompting the introduction of new emission control policies. In this study, we evaluate the changes in VOC-OH reactivity and P(O3) using data of O3, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) collected from the 1990s to 2019 by the local air quality monitoring network and during two dedicated 6-week field measurement campaigns in the MCMA. The results show a reduction of VOC-OH reactivity from 38 s−1 in 2003–2006 to about 19 s−1 in 2018 within the urban core, a slight increase from around 8 s−1 to 9 s−1 for the northern peripheral urban sites in the same period, and a small decrease from about 18 s−1 to 15 s−1 during 2014–2016 in the south of the city. Alkanes are still key contributors to VOC-OH reactivity, whereas the contribution from aromatic and alkene species has decreased, in agreement with reductions of VOC emissions from mobile sources. Changes in P(O3) suggest that increases in the relative contributions from highly oxygenated volatile chemical products from solvents consumption, personal care and other products are responsible for sustained high O3 levels in recent years. We also found that there is a marked spatial dependency of P(O3) in the northern, central, and southern areas of the city, suggesting spatially different VOC and NOx sensitivity regimes. Finally, significant increases in NO2/NO ratios suggest changes in the pathways for the nighttime accumulation of HOx radicals and NOy species that could impact the morning photochemistry and radical budgets for secondary aerosol formation. These results strongly suggest a need for new measurements of radical budgets in the MCMA, the expansion of a continuous measurement network of VOCs with the addition of oxygenated species, and the use of these data to support comprehensive modeling studies for the design of effective emission control strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emission controls; Mexico City air quality; Oxygenated VOCs; Ozone production; Urban air pollution; VOC-OH reactivity","Air quality; Budget control; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality monitoring networks; Comprehensive model; Continuous measurements; Mexico City metropolitan areas; Oxygenated species; Relative contribution; Secondary aerosols; Spatial dependencies; Quality control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; alkene; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; emission control; metropolitan area; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; urban atmosphere; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmosphere; chemical composition; chemoluminescence; controlled study; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; limit of detection; mathematical model; Mexico City; photochemistry; photolysis; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; temperature dependence; urban area; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087366493

Plants respond to atmospheric CO2 concentrations in several ways that can alter surface energy and water fluxes and thus surface climate, including changes in stomatal conductance, water use, and canopy leaf area. These plant physiological responses are already embedded in most Earth system models, and a robust literature demonstrates that they can affect global-scale temperature. However, the physiological contribution to transient warming has yet to be assessed systematically in Earth system models. Here this gap is addressed using carbon cycle simulations from phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to isolate the radiative and physiological contributions to the transient climate response (TCR), which is defined as the change in globally averaged near-surface air temperature during the 20-yr window centered on the time of CO2 doubling relative to preindustrial CO2 concentrations. In CMIP6 models, the physiological effect contributes 0.128C (s: 0.098C; range: 0.028–0.298C) of warming to the TCR, corresponding to 6.1% of the full TCR (s: 3.8%; range: 1.4%–13.9%). Moreover, variation in the physiological contribution to the TCR across models contributes disproportionately more to the intermodel spread of TCR estimates than it does to the mean. The largest contribution of plant physiology to CO2-forced warming—and the intermodel spread in warming—occurs over land, especially in forested regions. Ó 2020 American Meteorological Society.

Migration has long been touted as a strategy for adapting to climate change, but there is limited understanding of which aspects of climate change will have greatest influence on peoples’ decision to move somewhere they consider safer or stay somewhere safe. Here, we present results from two online surveys about mobility decisions from one low (Philippines) and one high (Australia) income country within the Asia-Pacific region with similar vulnerabilities to natural hazards. Online surveys with about 1100 respondents each were conducted in both countries. Results showed that natural hazards played a strong role in the mix of reasons for mobility, particularly in the Philippines. Sudden onset hazards had the greatest influence. Results of ordered probit models showed that the perception of personal damage from hazards was strongly positively associated with mobility decisions of respondents in both countries. Mobility decisions of people in Australia were further influenced by their experience with the specific hazards: those with greater experience of slow onset hazards were more likely, and those who had experience with sudden hazards less likely, to consider these when moving or staying somewhere. People in Australia might only react to sudden onset hazards with temporary relocation since experience had shown that they can adapt to them. This suggests that slow onset climate change related impacts such as heat waves and sea level rise, as well as environmental degradation and pollution, may have more sustained effects on long-term mobility than sudden events. In the Philippines, personal characteristics such as gender, income, and health had the greatest impact while experience with hazards had almost none. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Australia; Climate change adaptation; Environmental migration; Online survey; Philippines","Global warming; Sea level; Surveys; Asia Pacific region; Natural hazard; Online surveys; Ordered probit model; Personal characteristics; Philippines; Sea level rise; Sudden events; Health hazards; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision analysis; global warming; natural hazard; risk assessment; social mobility; strategic approach; vulnerability; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090311876

However, there areknowledge gaps in our understanding of the quantity and distribution in tropical regions. Specifically, Mexican wetlands have not been considered in global carbon budgets or carbon balances for a number of reasons, such as: (1) the lack of data, (2) Spanish publications have not been selected, or (3) because such balances are mainly made in the English language. This study analyzes the literature regarding carbon stocks, sequestration and fluxes in Mexican forested wetlands (Forest-W). Soil carbon stocks of 8, 24.5 and 40.1 kg cm−2 were detected for flooded palms, mangroves, and freshwater or swamps (FW) wetland soils, respectively, indicating that FW soils are the Forest-W with more potential for carbon sinks (p = 0.023), compared to mangroves and flooded palm soils. While these assessments of carbon sequestration were ranged from 36 to 920 g-C m−2 year−1, C emitted as methane was also tabulated (0.6–196 g-C m−2 year−1). Subtracting the C emitted of the C sequestered, 318.2 g-C m−2 year−1 were obtained. Such data revealed that Forest-W function is mainly as carbon sink, and not C source. This review can help to inform practitioners in future decisions regarding sustainable projects, restoration, conservation or creation of wetlands. Finally, it is concluded that Forest-W could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change through carbon storage. However, new studies in this research line and public policies that protect these essential carbon sinks are necessary in order to, hopefully, elaborate global models to make more accurate predictions about future climate. © 2020 by the authors.

It may relate to pre-seismic processes associated with the accumulation and relaxation of lithospheric stress and strain producing earthquakes. This approach assumes that meteorological influences on physico-chemical parameters are limited at depth since its strength diminishes with the increase of the overlay layer thickness. Hence, the monitoring of natural gases in deep boreholes above the water table enables to reduce the climatic-induced periodic contributions, and thus to identify the specific portion of the radon signals that could be related to regional tectonic pre-seismic activity. The plausible pre-seismic local movement of the two gases at depth - is identified by the appearance of discrete, random, non-cyclical signals, wider in time duration than 20 h and clearly wider than the sum of the width of the periodic diurnal and semidiurnal signals driven by ambient meteorological parameters. These non-cyclical signals may precede, by one day or more, a forthcoming seismic event. Hence, it is plausible to conclude that monitoring of any other natural gas that is present at depth may show a similar broadening signal and may serve as a precursor too. The necessary technical conditions enabling to distinguish between anomalous signals of gases that may be induced locally by pre-seismic processes at depth, and the relatively low periodic signals that are still established at depth related to external climatic conditions, are presented in detail. © Copyright © 2020 Zafrir, Barbosa, Levintal, Weisbrod, Ben Horin and Zalevsky.","barometric pumping; borehole monitoring; earthquake precursors; radon monitoring; thermal flow in porous media","borehole; carbon dioxide; earthquake precursor; monitoring; porous medium; radon isotope; tectonics; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100118386

Primitive carbon has a reducing power likely due to incompletely oxidized functional groups on the surface. We aim to control this reducing power by chemical treatment and apply for the spontaneous deposition of nanoparticles (NPs). Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was initially treated with a reducing agent, NaBH4 or an oxidizing agent, KMnO4, for 5 min. Subsequently, the pretreated carbon was immersed in a platinum (Pt) precursor. Unexpectedly, SEM images showed that the reducing agent increased spontaneous PtNPs deposition while the oxidizing agent decreased Pt loading more as compared to that of using bare carbon. However, the amount of Pt on the carbon obviously decreased by NaBH4 treatment for 50 min. Secondly, spontaneous reduction on pretreated glassy carbon (GC) was investigated using the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). GC electrode treated with NaBH4 for a short and long time showed small (onset potential:-640 mV vs. MSE) and large overpotential for the HER, respectively. Although the mechanism is unclear, the elec-trochemistry results correspond to the optical data. As a proof-of-concept, these results demonstrate that chemical treatments can be used to design the shapes and amounts of deposited catalytic metal on carbon by controlling the surface state. © 2020, Korean Society of Industrial Engineering Chemistry.

In a firmly controlled rhizosphere system, we added a glucose solution through artificial roots to soils collected from two subalpine coniferous forests (an approximately 200-year-old spruce-fir forest and an approximately 70-year-old spruce plantation) with the soils subsequently incubated over 25 days. The results showed that the addition of glucose significantly increased the concentrations of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) bound in both metal-organic complexes (MOCs) and short-range order phases (SROs) by 45%, 68%, 31% and 38%, respectively (soil-averaged), which indicated that glucose addition enhanced the formation of physicochemical-protected SOM. The induced protection of SOM mainly resulted from the stimulation of interactions of the microbial residues with soil minerals and/or metal cations, as indicated by the concurrently increased microbial communities and zeta potential after glucose addition. Moreover, the glucose-induced absolute changes in MOCs at the spruce-fir site were higher than those at the spruce plantation site, whereas the changes in SROs exhibited an opposite trend to that observed for MOCs. This discrepancy is presumably due to the higher organic matter content with more extractable metals at the spruce-fir site being more beneficial for supporting microbial stabilization of glucose and subsequent necromass sequestration as MOCs. In addition, more clay minerals at the spruce plantation site had larger surface areas and more binding sites to bind microbial-derived organic molecules as SROs. Collectively, our findings provide robust evidence that the input of labile C to soils could facilitate the formation of physicochemical-protected SOM, which is potentially involved in transformation into microbial residues and subsequent interaction with metal cations and/or minerals and may also be mediated by soil properties. The formation of protected SOM may potentially offset native SOM decomposition and thus has ecologically important implications for long-term terrestrial C storage. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Clay; Metal-organic association; Microbial community; Rhizosphere process; Subalpine coniferous forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089409951

Our previous results showed that electric potential application (−0.5 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) accelerated subsoil NO3− reduction efficiently, but nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were also elevated with the application of the electric potential. Biochar has previously been considered to act as an electron shuttle to mitigate soil N2O emission. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate if, and how, a combined amendment of electric potential and biochar could simultaneously accelerate soil NO3− reduction and suppress N2O emission. The results showed that the electric potential application alone (E) significantly increased the soil N2O emission by 144% compared with soil only (CK), whereas the co-application of electric potential and biochar (E + BC) markedly decreased the soil N2O emission by 83%, which was more than two times higher than the efficiency of biochar amendment alone (BC) on soil N2O mitigation (35%). Moreover, the E + BC treatment further decreased the N2O/(N2O + N2) emission ratio by 62% on average at the end of the experiment compared with the BC treatment. These results indicate that there is an interaction between biochar and electric potential on soil N2O mitigation. Contrary to the E + BC treatment, the combined amendment of electric potential and H2O2-oxidized biochar (E + BC_H2O2) increased the soil N2O emission by 151% compared with the BC treatment. The cathode coulombic efficiency did not differ significantly between the E + BC_H2O2 and E treatments, but the cathode coulombic efficiency in the E + BC treatment was almost double that of the E treatment. Besides, the abundance of Proteobacteria, which include most electrotrophic microorganisms, and the nosZ/(nirS + nirK) gene ratio were higher in the E + BC treatment than that in other treatments. These results indicate that the biochar interacts with electric potential treatment via shuttling electrons from electrodes to soil electrotrophic denitrifying consortia and consequently accelerates soil NO3− reduction and decreases the N2O/(N2O + N2) emission ratio. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Electron transfer efficiency; N2O/(N2O+N2); Soil denitrification; Soil microbial community","Cathodes; Denitrification; Efficiency; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Biochar amendments; Coulombic efficiency; Electron shuttle; Emission ratio; Groundwater nitrates; Nitrate removal; Proteobacteria; Standard hydrogen electrodes; Electric potential; biochar; electricity; emission; nitrate; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; reduction; soil microorganism; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089544390

Due to the co-occurrence of multiple N2O transformation pathways, it is, however, challenging to use isotopic information to quantify the contribution of distinct processes across variable spatiotemporal scales. Here, we present an overview of recent progress in N2O isotopic studies and provide suggestions for future research, mainly focusing on: analytical techniques; production and consumption processes; and interpretation and modelling approaches. Comparing isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS), we conclude that IRMS is a precise technique for laboratory analysis of N2O isotopes, while LAS is more suitable for in situ/inline studies and offers advantages for site-specific analyses. When reviewing the link between the N2O isotopic composition and underlying mechanisms/processes, we find that, at the molecular scale, the specific enzymes and mechanisms involved determine isotopic fractionation effects. In contrast, at plot-to-global scales, mixing of N2O derived from different processes and their isotopic variability must be considered. We also find that dual isotope plots are effective for semi-quantitative attribution of co-occurring N2O production and reduction processes. More recently, process-based N2O isotopic models have been developed for natural abundance and 15N-tracing studies, and have been shown to be effective, particularly for data with adequate temporal resolution. Despite the significant progress made over the last decade, there is still great need and potential for future work, including development of analytical techniques, reference materials and inter-laboratory comparisons, further exploration of N2O formation and destruction mechanisms, more observations across scales, and design and validation of interpretation and modelling approaches. Synthesizing all these efforts, we are confident that the N2O isotope community will continue to advance our understanding of N2O transformation processes in all spheres of the Earth, and in turn to gain improved constraints on regional and global budgets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089159038

Results showed that, WSD reduced the NH3 and N2O emissions by 25.9% and 34.98%, respectively, compared with CK. WSD also reduced the abundances of nitrifying (bacteria amoA) and denitrifying (nirS, nirK, and nosZ) genes during composting, which were significantly positively correlated with N2O emissions (P &lt; 0.01). The most important nosZ denitrifying microorganisms belonged to Proteobacteria. Redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors could affect the succession of the denitrifying bacterial community during composting. Based on these results, structural equation modeling demonstrated that the reduction in N2O emissions under WSD was related to the lower accumulation of NO3–-N utilized by denitrifying microorganisms during the compost maturation period. © 2020","Composting; Denitrifying bacterial community; Lignocellulose-degrading microorganism; N2O; Nitrogen functional gene","Ammonia; Biodegradation; Cellulose; Composting; Denitrification; Genes; Lignin; Nitrogen; Aerobic composting; Bacterial community; Denitrifying microorganisms; Environmental factors; Maturation periods; Nitrogen conversion; Redundancy analysis; Structural equation modeling; Bacteria; ammonia; lignocellulose; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; lignin; lignocellulose; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; biotechnology; cellulose; composting; denitrification; inoculation; lignin; microbial community; nitrifying bacterium; reduction; succession; aerobic metabolism; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; composting; controlled study; denitrifying bacterium; environmental factor; high throughput sequencing; inoculation; microbial community; microbial degradation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; poultry manure; priority journal; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; redundancy analysis; structural equation modeling; bacterium; denitrification; genetics; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; Bacteria; Composting; Denitrification; Genes, Bacterial; Lignin; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086700928

We present a compact radiometer concept, Trutinor (meaning “balance” in Latin), with two broadband channels, shortwave (0.2–3 µm) and longwave (5–50 µm), capable of continuing the CERES record by flying in formation with an existing imager on another satellite platform. the instrument uses a three-mirror off-axis anastigmat telescope as the front optics to image these broadband radiances onto a microbolometer array coated with gold black, providing the required performance across the full spectral range. Each pixel of the sensor has a field of view of 0.6◦, which was chosen so the shortwave band can be efficiently calibrated using the Moon as an on-orbit light source with the same angular extent, thereby reducing mass and improving measurement accuracy, towards the goal of a gap-tolerant observing system. the longwave band will utilize compact blackbodies with phase-change cells for an absolute calibration reference, establishing a clear path for SI-traceability.

Thus, the administration of ABP induces supraphysiological levels of components necessary for orchestrating reparative efforts in currently difficult-to-treat medical conditions.

Previous researches mainly focus on relationship between global average CO2 concentrations and surface air temperature (SAT). Carbon satellites have proven that CO2 concentrations have non-uniform spatio-temporal distributions. The relation between CO2 concentrations from satellite observations and SAT is seldom reported. Climate network approaches have been successful to uncover topology structure and dynamics in the climate system. Here, we construct CO2 concentrations network and SAT network based on the climate network approaches. By comparing the similarity of the properties between CO2 concentrations network and SAT network, their relation has been investigated. We show that negative and positive links in CO2 network have a strong correlation with that in the SAT network. These statistical structures yield a clear association with the pattern of Rossby waves. It is shown that the peaks of phase speeds associated with significant positive and negative weight links are similar, and are arranged in the group velocities of Rossby waves. Further analysis shows their strong correlations and similarity spatial patterns if the equator regions are excluded. In addition, their teleconnections follow similar climate processes, where Rossby waves exhibit dominance in the Southern Hemisphere. The results demonstrate the similar network properties between CO2 and SAT can be partly related to the function of Rossby waves. Our work provides a new perspective with which to understand the relation between CO2 concentrations and SAT, as well as climate system.

We investigated the relationship of soil N2O emission with nitrifying enzyme activity (NEA), denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and the abundances of N2O-producing and N2O-reducing functional genes, in response to three grazing intensities (none, light, intensive) over two growing seasons on an alpine grassland on Kunlun Mountain in semi-arid North China. Compared to the non-grazed control, light and intensive grazing treatments increased the 2-yr total N2O emissions by 27.5% and 68.1%, respectively. Daily N2O flux rate correlated positively with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), temperature, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but not with the abundances of nitrifiers (AOB, AOA, Nitrobacter-like nxrA), nitrate reducers (narG) and denitrifiers (nirS, nirK, and nosZ). These results suggest that soil environmental factors rather than nitrifier, N2O-producer and N2O-reducer abundances were more important in determining the grazing enhancement of N2O emissions from the alpine grassland in semi-arid areas. The abundance of AOB and Nitrobacter-like nxrA but not AOA correlated positively with NEA, indicating they are good indicators for the potential nitrification in this arid alpine grassland. Reducing grazing intensity from intensive to light resulted in more above-ground biomass and N uptake in both years and less N2O emissions in 2018. These results highlight the importance of establishing a proper grazing intensity to reduce N2O emissions from the degraded grassland while maintaining productivity for livestock. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine grassland; Denitrifier; Grazing; Microbial functional genes; Nitrifier; Quantitative PCR","Agriculture; Denitrification; Enzyme activity; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Above ground biomass; Alpine grasslands; Denitrifying Enzyme Activity (DEA); Dissolved organic carbon; Environmental factors; Grazing treatment; Potential nitrification; Soil physicochemical characteristics; Nitrification; alpine environment; dissolved organic carbon; enzyme; enzyme activity; grassland; grassland soil; growing season; microbial community; nitrifying bacterium; nitrous oxide; nutrient uptake; physicochemical property; semiarid region; China; Kunlun Mountains; Nitrobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086142379

Herein, an aqueous ZIC with superior performance is fabricated by employing an oxygen-rich porous carbon cathode. Excellent capacitance and energy density are obtained thanks to the electric double-layer capacitance of porous carbon, and additional pseudocapacitances originating from the variation in oxidation states of oxygen functional groups and the reversible electrochemical hydrogen adsorption and desorption during each round-trip charge–discharge cycle. Moreover, the cycling stability of ZIC is effectively prolonged by suppressing zinc dendrite growth with a simple surface carbon coating strategy. The assembled ZIC delivers a high capacitance of 340.7 F g−1, a high capacity of 179.8 mAh g−1 in a wide voltage window of 0–1.9 V, a maximum energy density of 104.8 Wh kg−1, and an ultrahigh power density of 48.8 kW kg−1. Furthermore, the as-fabricated aqueous ZIC exhibits an ultralong cycle life of 30 000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 99.2%.

Given the continuing expansion of air traffic, mitigation of aviation’s climate impact becomes challenging but imperative. Among various mitigation options, hybrid-electric aircraft (HEA) have drawn intensive attention due to their considerable potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., CO2). However, the non-CO2 effects (especially contrails) of HEA on climate change are more challenging to assess. As the first step to understanding the climate impact of HEA, this research investigates the effects on the formation of persistent contrails when flying with HEA. The simulation is performed using an Earth System Model (EMAC) coupled with a submodel (CONTRAIL), where the contrail formation criterion, the Schmidt–Appleman criterion (SAC), is adapted to globally estimate changes in the potential contrail coverage (PCC). We compared the HEA to conventional (reference) aircraft with the same characteristics, except for the propulsion system. The analysis showed that the temperature threshold of contrail formation for HEA is lower; therefore, conventional reference aircraft can form contrails at lower flight altitudes, whereas the HEA does not. For a given flight altitude, with a small fraction of electric power in use (less than 30%), the potential contrail coverage remained nearly unchanged. As the electric power fraction increased, the reduction in contrail formation was mainly observed in the mid-latitudes (30◦ N and 40◦ S) or tropical regions and was very much localized with a maximum value of about 40% locally. The analysis of seasonal effects showed that in non-summer, the reduction in contrail formation using electric power was more pronounced at lower flight altitudes, whereas in summer the changes in PCC were nearly constant with respect to altitude. © 2020 by the authors.

A study was conducted to investigate carbon stock and woody species diversity patterns along the church age gradient in Addis Ababa city. We hypothesized that the carbon stock would relate to the church age gradient. Thus, the study was conducted in forests belonging to churches that were selected in a stratified random sampling from four age categories with the year of establishments ranging from 1897 to 1993. Counting of all the woody species and DBH and height measurement of all individuals with DBH of 5 cm and above was carried out. Carbon stock and different diversity indices were computed, and the relationships between church age and tree parameters were evaluated. Results showed that the forests were characteristically small (0.6 ± 0.57 ha), and the tree species with the highest total carbon stock were Juniperus procera, Eucalyptus globulus and E. camaldulensis. The mean amount of carbon stock contained in each church forest was 156 ± 92 t ha-1. A total of 50 indigenous and 40 exotic woody species were identified. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) among the four Strata was revealed for the carbon stock of native trees. Correlation analysis also revealed a significant positive relationship between church age and native trees’ carbon stock. We conclude that the church forests have a very important role in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation, and thus scaling up the long-term maintenance and management of such small-sized forests in urban green spaces is vital. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Diversity indices; Urban forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082976162

To restore structures to their original form, the historical changes that have been made over time are researched, and by identifying the original material characteristics it becomes possible to preserve the load-bearing members, thus prolonging their service life. This paper presents a detailed description of the restoration works, which were based on the original geometric and material properties, carried out on a historical masonry building that started out in life as a hospital building in the 1840s, but was later remodeled to become a military prison building and currently serves as the Faculty of Political Sciences of Istanbul University. The study is presented in three stages, namely: i. a research of the historical timeline of alterations of the examined building, ii. a field study, and iii. laboratory analyses. The historical research identifies the structural changes that the building has undergone since its construction, while the field study includes a three-dimensional laser scanning process and the taking of representative samples from different points of the building. In the laboratory stage, the gathered samples are subjected to chemical and mineralogical analyses. The mortar and plaster mixture ratios used in the construction were ascertained through physical and chemical tests to samples taken from the building, and subsequently, all non-original binder materials have been removed and the original mortar-plaster mixture ratios have applied. After a review of the data collected within the scope of this study, it was determined that the two reinforced concrete buildings to the north and south of the site, which were built later in the history of the investigated building, as well as the temporary partition walls to each story, should be removed. Furthermore, it is recommended that the modified facade and interior window forms, together with the blocked-off doorways, should be restored to their original state. The contribution this study makes to literature is based on its focus on a historical masonry building that has lost its original form over time, having been refunctioned for different purposes, that is to be restored back to its original form in terms of its geometric and material properties. The building itself is of particular interest, being the first on the historical peninsula of Istanbul to be constructed using industrial bricks during the Ottoman period. The proposed restoration project can be considered a novel, practical and appropriate approach to authentic restoration. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","3D-laser scan; first masonry brick building; lab analyses; Ottoman era; restoration","Binders; Brick; Chemical analysis; Concrete buildings; Image reconstruction; Laboratories; Masonry construction; Mixtures; Mortar; Plaster; Reinforced concrete; 3D laser scan; Durability of materials; Geometric and material properties; Lab analysis; Material characteristics; Mineralogical analysis; Ottoman era; Three-dimensional laser scanning; Restoration; climate conditions; durability; environmental restoration; field method; historic building; laboratory method; laser method; masonry; Ottoman empire; Istanbul",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065415680

This study fills this gap assessing flows, emissions reduction and other environmental benefits of decentralized composting, based on a pilot composting facility implemented in the municipality of Tiassalé in Côte d’Ivoire. Primary data collected at the site were visualized with the STAN version 2.6 software developed at the Vienna University of Technology (Austria), for material flows, while carbon emissions reduction was estimated using the UNFCCC methods. Results show that in 2017, from the 59.4 metric tons of organic waste processed by this pilot station, 14.2 metric tons of mature compost was produced, which correspond to 24% of the input mass (on wet weight basis). On dry weight basis, mature compost represents 36% of the input mass.

Here we assessed the likely challenges for the China's winter wheat production under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C increase of global temperature, with four wheat crop models (CERES-Wheat, Nwheat, WheatGrow, and APSIM-Wheat) and the latest climate projections from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts project (HAPPI). Instead of using average “winter type” wheat cultivar, and same management and soil inputs for whole region, location-specific winter wheat cultivars with local agronomic information were calibrated for each of the representative wheat growing area of China, allowing a better spatial agronomic representation of the whole wheat planting area. The mean growing season temperature (GST) during the winter wheat vegetative stage was projected to increase by 0.6 to 1.4 °C for the 1.5 °C scenario, and 0.9 to 1.8 °C for the 2.0 °C scenario, while during the reproductive stage was decreased between 0 and 0.9 °C for the 1.5 °C scenario and -0.3 and 1.1 °C for the 2.0 °C scenario. Growing season duration (GSD) for the whole period was shortened by 6 to 15 days for the 1.5 °C scenario and 8 to 18 days for the 2.0 °C scenario, as a result of higher GST under global warming. Increase in GST and decrease in GSD was more obvious in the Southwest Subregion (SWS) than subregions in the north. The shortening GSD for the whole wheat growth period was mostly from the shortening vegetative period, as no appreciable difference in number of days from anthesis to maturity was found for the whole regions. Although there is variability among models, the indication is that wheat yields were projected to increase in the North Subregion (NS), the Huang-Huai Subregion (HHS), and the Middle-lower Researches of Yangzi River Subregion (MYS), but to decrease in the SWS under two warming scenarios. The effects of elevated CO2 concentration were mostly beneficial and tended to offset the negative impacts of increasing temperature at both global warming scenarios, with a rate of 7-14% yield increase per 100-ppm, except for locations with GST of baseline higher than 11 °C. Aggregating to regional wheat production, the total winter wheat production of China was projected to increase by 2.8% (1.6% to 3.0%, 25th percentile to 75th percentile) and 8.3% (7.0% to 9.6%, 25th percentile to 75th percentile) under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios, and most of increase was observed in the north subregions due to the largest wheat planting area. Our results will lay the foundation for developing adaptation strategies to future climate change to ensure China and global wheat supply and food security. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change impacts; Crop model ensemble; Growing season duration; Potential yield changes; Total production; Winter wheat","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop production; crop yield; global warming; growing season; high temperature; strategic approach; wheat; China; Ceres; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089147319

Specifically, we analyze the time trend, persistence, and seasonality properties of the series using I(d) fractional integration framework, an approach that is found to be robust in dealing with climatological series. Antipersistence is observed in the rainfall series of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam while long memory is found in the rainfall series of the remaining countries. Thus, those countries with antipersistent rainfall are prone to erratic rainfall distribution which could lead to flooding or drought. Long memory is observed in the distribution of rainfall across all countries with increasing trend found in some cases. Both climatic variables display evidence supporting seasonality with stronger seasonality observed in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

We determine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), considering historical weather data for specific locations to model our PV system, and optimize its size compared to the electrolyzer.

This study deals with the development of a routine method using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for rapid analysis of primary and secondary organic compounds distributed among three classes: (i) benzene polycarboxylic acids; (ii) nitroaromatic acids and (iii) nitrophenols in ambient particles. Using an UPLC HSS T3 column with a mobile phase consisting of formic acid/acetonitrile under gradient elution, all target analytes were eluted within a total time of 12 min. Although some targeted analytes with different m/z were not resolved, a quantitation of these compounds was carried by distinct multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Quality parameters of the method were established. The method was proven to be sensitive with limits of detection ranged from 0.02 to 0.89 ng/mL. Together with a simple sample preparation and the use of labeled internal standards, the method was confirmed to be robust and reliable to determine a large number of organic tracers in atmospheric particulate matter samples. The analytical procedure was also applied to assess the abundance and characteristics of target analytes in PM2.5 emitted from diesel and gasoline-powered engines, and Urban Dust and Diesel Particulate Matter Standard Reference Materials (SRM 1649b and SRM 1650b, respectively). The obtained results suggest that trimellitic, 4-hydroxyphthalic and 4-nitrophthalic acids may be used as potential tracers for diesel engine emissions.

Because dust has serious environmental and human health effects, predictions of dust concentrations and their contribution to PM surface concentrations are essential for atmospheric research and the implementation of air quality programs and rules. This study aims to assess dust contributions to PM2.5 in Tehran in order to provide guidance for air quality management systems as well as validate the updated Dust Regional Atmospheric Model version 2 (BSC-DREAM8b) and the NMMB/BSC-Dust model using chemical speciation of ground-based measurements of PM2.5. Accurate and reliable measurements are necessary to determine the sources of pollutants as well as to confirm, validate, and improve models. For this purpose, dust concentration and contribution were calculated from chemical speciation of PM2.5 samples that were obtained on a 6 day basis for a whole year from February 2014 to February 2015. The comparison of the dust observations to the model products revealed that model outputs were in good agreement for the monthly averaged values. However, for the daily averaged values, models and ground observation showed a considerable difference. In order to understand possible reasons for the discrepancy, differences between neighboring grid cells were investigated, as well as the effect of sampling frequency. It is found that agreement between models and observations was sensitive to sampling duration and frequency but not to spatial variability between grid cells. This study is the first validation of model outputs with the calculated dust concentration from ground-based chemical speciation of PM2.5 rather than using total PM or aerosol optical depth measurements as a proxy for dust concentrations. © 2020","Air pollution; BSC-DREAM8b; Dust; NMMB/BSC-Dust; PM2.5; Tehran",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089014326

In this study, we continuously measured the Rs of moss-dominated biocrust (biocrust and biocrust covered soil) and bare soil, together with soil temperature and moisture, for ~100 days each in a semiarid climate on the Chinese Loess Plateau. We modeled Rs across a two-year period, based on its relationship with soil temperature and moisture. Using the model, the seasonal variation of the Rs was simulated for biocrust and bare soil, and their annual CO2 efflux were further estimated. We also obtained samples of the biocrust layer and bare soil surface and analyzed their physicochemical properties and enzyme activities to explain the biocrust effects on Rs. Our results showed that the measured Rs of the biocrust and bare soil ranged from 0.05 to 7.62 and 0.02–2.73 μmol m−2 s−1, respectively, and was closely exponentially related to the dynamics of soil temperature and moisture (in threshold relationships). The variations of Rs in both the biocrust and bare soil were strongly predicted in a regression model by R2 ≥ 0.50 and P &lt; 0.001. Through this model, we simulated the seasonal variations of Rs, which averaged 1.03 ± 0.01 and 0.54 ± 0.01 μmol m−2 s−1 (F = 225.51, P &lt; 0.001) across all seasons for the biocrust and bare soil, respectively. We further estimated that the annual CO2-C efflux through respiration of the biocrust was 390 g m−2 yr−1 and that of the bare soil was 203 g m−2 yr−1, indicating that the presence of the biocrust layer annually contributed 91.8% (187 g m−2 yr−1) more soil respiration in comparison to the bare soil. Moreover, the main correlates with Rs shifted from largely abiotic, e.g. soil texture and total phosphorus content, in bare soils to biotic, e.g. indicators of carbon and nitrogen content, in biocrust soils. This finding implies that the contribution of the biocrust to Rs is linked to the carbon fixed and organic nutrients stored in the biocrust layer. In conclusion, moss-dominated biocrust highly accelerates soil respiration and increases gross soil CO2 efflux, possibly through regulating soil temperature and moisture, improving soil physicochemical properties, increasing soil enzyme activities, and accelerating decomposition of biocrust-fixed and -stored carbon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biological soil crust; Chinese Loess Plateau; Soil carbon efflux; Soil carbon storage; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Enzymes; Logistic regression; Moisture; Organic carbon; Physicochemical properties; Temperature; Textures; Carbon and nitrogen; Chinese Loess Plateau; Organic nutrients; Seasonal variation; Semi-arid climate; Soil enzyme activity; Soil physico-chemical properties; Soil respiration rates; Soils; bare soil; carbon dioxide; enzyme; enzyme activity; nitrogen; phosphorus; regression analysis; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil texture; China; Loess Plateau; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087613356

Assuming emission changes during lockdown, back-to-work and post-lockdown stages of COVID-19, climate model simulations show a surface warming over continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In January–March, there was an anomalous warming of 0.05–0.15 K in eastern China, and the surface temperature increase was 0.04–0.07 K in Europe, eastern United States, and South Asia in March–May. The longer the emission reductions undergo, the warmer the climate would become. The emission reductions explain the observed temperature increases of 10–40% over eastern China relative to 2019.

However, majority of the low-temperature air source heat pumps operate under a single and fixed mode, which may not be suitable for residential applications in regions with varied climates. Therefore, herein, a multimode single-fluid cascade air source heat pump (MSC-ASHP) is proposed, which includes the following modes: cascade compression heating, single-stage compression heating, and single-stage compression regeneration modes. To investigate variable-speed characteristics and control strategy of the two heating modes, the experiments and simulations are performed at different evaporating temperature and lower-stage compressor speed. The results demonstrate that the heating capacity in two modes can be enhanced effectively by adding the lower-stage compressor speed. The coeffinient of performance (COP) of cascade compression heating mode increases first and subsequently decreases along with the increasing of the lower-stage compressor speed. Under a condensing temperature of 46 °C and evaporating temperature of −35 °C, the COP is higher than 1.8, the discharge temperature is lower than 120 °C, and the compression ratio in each stage does not exceed 5.0, indicating this system functions safely and steadily in cold climates. The control strategies for the compressor speed and mode switch are summarized synthetically based on the simulation and experimental results. New heat pump system prolongs the year-round applications period of the low-temperature air source heat pump. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COP; Evaporating temperature; Heat pump; Heating capacity; speed","Air; Compressors; Heating; Housing; Pumps; Speed; Temperature; Compression heating; Condensing temperature; Control strategies; Discharge temperature; Electricity policy; Evaporating temperature; Low temperature air source heat pumps; Residential application; Air source heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087918657

This study first employed a circuity index to measure the path efficiency of residents' trips based on 2015 survey data in Guangzhou and developed a generalized additive model (GAM) to investigate the relationship between the path efficiency and travel distance for different purposes of trip and different travel modes. On this basis, it further evaluated the time efficiency of different travel modes for each trip. The results showed that there is a complex and nonlinear relationship between the path efficiency and travel distance, which differs between different purposes of trips and different travel modes. In general, trips by non-motorized transport have a lower circuity index and higher path efficiency than those by cars or public transport. Moreover, non-motorized transport is the time-efficiency optimal mode for almost half of the trips, especially for daily shopping trips. However, people prefer to choose public transport on their trips even though public transport is not the time-efficiency optimal mode for these trips. Generally, only about half of the residents chose the time-efficiency optimal mode for their trips. Those who did not choose the time-efficiency optimal mode tended to choose the modes with higher carbon-intensity. The conclusions of this study indicate that for improving travel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions from transport, more efforts should be focused on the non-motorized travel environment and developing relevant policies to encourage more walking and cycling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circuity index; Generalized additive models (GAMs); Non-motorized transport; Path efficiency; Time efficiency","cycle transport; public transport; sustainable development; transportation mode; transportation system; travel behavior; urban transport; walking; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089707016

In order to more comprehension of the effect of population aging on carbon emissions, this study explores the nonlinear relationship between population aging and carbon emission through empirical analysis of ten selected provinces in China from 2000 to 2016 using the panel threshold model. In the proposed panel threshold model, carbon emission is set as the explained variable, population aging is set as the core explanatory variable, the levels of population aging and trade openness are set as threshold variables, the levels of economic development, energy consumption structure, industrial structure, and technological innovation are set as the controlling variables, respectively. The results show that population aging has a threshold effect on curbing carbon emission. The levels of population aging and trade openness are two key factors that affect the relationship between population aging and carbon emission. Whether the level of popultion aging is lower or higher than the threshold value of 0.12937, the population aging has a negative coefficient on carbon emissions. Moreover, the higher the level of population aging, the greater the offsetting effect of population aging on carbon emission. When the level of trade openness is below the threshold value of 0.30990, the effect of population aging on carbon emission is negligible. When the level of trade openness is higher than the threshold value of 0.30990, the offesetting effect of population aging on carbon emission begins to appear. In other words, population aging has an offsetting effect on carbon emission when trade openness is in relatively high level, whereas the offsetting effect disappears when trade openness is lower than threshold value. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; Carbon emissions; China; Opening up; Panel threshold model","Commerce; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Empirical analysis; Energy consumption structure; Explanatory variables; Industrial structures; Linear relationships; Negative coefficients; Non-linear relationships; Technological innovation; Carbon; aging population; carbon emission; economic development; empirical analysis; energy use; industrial structure; innovation; nonlinearity; numerical model; panel data; threshold; trade openness; aging; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; economic development; empirical research; energy consumption; industry; mathematical model; priority journal; technology; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086825658

The length scales of these regions are on the order of the Kolmogorov scale or smaller, where molecular diffusion dominates over turbulent mixing irrespective of the large-scale turbulent Reynolds number. A strain-sensitivity parameter is proposed to identify such species. A Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach (SSTA) is then developed to model this differential transport in the nonpremixed flamelet equations. Specifically, the strain-sensitive species are modeled with their non-unity molecular effective Lewis numbers, while the remaining species are modeled with unity effective Lewis numbers. An a priori analysis of nonpremixed flamelet solutions reveals that the flame temperature and strain-insensitive species (e.g., major products of combustion, acetylene, etc.) profiles from the proposed SSTA closely match those from the unity effective Lewis number approach, but the mass fractions of strain-sensitive species (e.g., naphthalene) are significantly modified compared to the unity effective Lewis number approach and are consistent with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. This new SSTA model is implemented within a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) framework, applied to a series of laboratory-scale turbulent nonpremixed sooting jet flames, and validated via comparisons with experimental measurements of temperature and soot volume fraction. Both the unity effective Lewis number approach and SSTA model provide temperature predictions in good agreement with the experimental data, but the non-unity molecular effective Lewis number approach overpredicts the flame length. Compared to the unity effective Lewis number approach, the spatial distribution of soot volume fraction predicted by SSTA is in better agreement with the experimental measurements in terms of the upstream growth of the soot volume fraction and the location of its peak value along the centerline, both of which strongly depend on accurate predictions of the PAH mass fraction. The maximum soot volume fraction is minimally influenced and in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Finally, with this new SSTA model, the influence of global strain rate on turbulent nonpremixed sooting jet flames is analyzed to find that, even though PAH is inversely proportional to the global strain rate, the soot volume fraction may not be inversely proportional to the global strain rate due to an increase in the acetylene surface growth rate coefficient with global strain rate. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Differential diffusion; Effective Lewis numbers; Large Eddy Simulation (LES); Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH); Soot","Acetylene; Combustion; Computational complexity; Dust; Large eddy simulation; Lighting; Mineral oils; Naphthalene; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reynolds number; Soot; Volume fraction; Accurate prediction; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Scalar dissipation rate; Soot volume fraction; Temperature prediction; Turbulent non-premixed; Turbulent reacting flows; Turbulent Reynolds number; Strain rate; acetylene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Article; diffusion; flame; heat loss; molecular diffusivity; priority journal; simulation; soot; stoichiometry; surface area; surface property; temperature; turbulent flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087943303

Herein, Pt-loaded Ti sheets were prepared by sputter-deposition and Pt4+-reduction methods, and their catalytic activities on both photocatalytic CO2 reduction and electrochemical hydrogen evolution were fully demonstrated. The surface chemical states were completely examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy before and after CO2 reduction. Gas chromatography confirmed that CO, CH4, and CH3OH were commonly produced as CO2 reduction products with total yields up to 87.3, 26.9, and 88.0 μmol/mol, respectively for 700 °C-annealed Ti under UVC irradiation for 13 h. Pt-loading commonly negated the CO2 reduction yields, but CH4 selectivity was increased. Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity showed the highest activity for sputter-deposited Pt on 400 °C-annealed Ti with a HER current density of 10.5 mA/cm2 at −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The activities of CO2 reduction and HER were found to be significantly dependent on both the nature of Ti support and the oxidation states (0,II,IV) of overlayer Pt. The present result could provide valuable information for designing efficient Pt/Ti-based CO2 recycle photocatalysts and electrochemical hydrogen production catalysts. © 2020 by the authors.

As a proof-of-concept application, using this material, a fully automated and self-sustainable solar-powered SmartFarm device is developed. The Cu-complex harvests atmospheric water during the night, stores the adsorbed water within, and efficiently releases the adsorbed water during the day when the device is exposed to sunlight. The water harvesting and irrigation process can be fine-tuned to suit different types of plants and local climates for an optimal cultivation.

(ii) When the compensation standard increased, the ratio of newly added C2G heating area and newly reduced pollutant emissions increased non-linearly. To achieve an environmental goal of reducing particulate matter by 40%, the government will need to compensate each household by 3.56 CNY/m2 per month, which is 1.35 times the current compensation standard. When the monthly compensation is 9 CNY/m2, the comprehensive best economic and environmental benefits can be achieved.

The advancement in time of spring phenology due to climate warming is well documented. However, although the progressive warming process is asymmetrical across seasons in temperate and boreal regions, the consistency of spring phenological response to non-uniform seasonal warming has not been well studied. Furthermore, the different responses of budburst and leaf unfolding to seasonally uneven warming have not been fully explored. We investigated the responses of budburst and leaf unfolding in two-year-old larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) seedlings to seasonally asymmetric warming treatments (with passive warming applied in open-top chambers) in northern China. We found that spring warming significantly advanced budburst and leaf unfolding by 7 and 2 days, respectively; year-round warming advanced budburst by 4 days but had no impact on the timing of leaf unfolding. Summer and winter warming had no effects on the timing and duration of spring phenophases. Notably, spring leaf unfolding was significantly delayed, by 2 days, following an autumnal warming, i.e., there was a carry-over effect (a 1-day delay in leaf senescence delayed leaf unfolding by 0.3 day in the next spring). The temperature sensitivities of budburst and leaf unfolding in the spring warming treatment (9.56 days/°C and 2.66 days/°C, respectively) were significantly greater than those in the year-round warming treatment (6.43 days/°C and 0.66 days/°C, respectively). We also found a trade-off relationship between the durations of budburst and leaf unfolding in the spring and year-round warming treatments.

Herein, an artificial reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (rGO/CNT) microlattice aerogel was constructed using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology and further adopted as a sodium metal host. With its specially designed architecture, the 3D rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel can effectively reduce the local current density and provide abundant active nucleation sites, resulting in homogeneous sodium deposition to overcome the issue of dendrite formation. As a result, the Na@rGO/CNT microlattice anode enables an areal capacity of 1 mA h cm−2at 2 mA cm−2with a small nucleation overpotential of 17.8 mV, with a stable cycling performance for 640 cycles at a high current density of 8 mA cm−2. The experimental and simulation results show that the improved performance can be attributed to the rational design of the hierarchical rGO/CNT microlattice aerogel with tuned surface kinetics. Finally, a full battery using a 3D Na@rGO/CNT microlattice as an anode was assembled and delivered a capacity of 67.6 mA h g−1at 100 mA g−1after 100 cycles.

We highlight defining periods of ecological challenges encompassing the production recovery sustainability initiative phase solely driven by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)—a governmental body responsible for production, processing and marketing of cocoa, coffee and sheanut. During the period, major initiatives were driven by non-governmental organisations in collaboration with COCOBOD to implement the climate-smart agriculture scheme in the cocoa sector.

It is considered that strong chromospheric activity is driven by the dynamo processes generated by stellar rotation. In contrast, several researchers have pointed out that the chromospheres of PMS stars are activated by mass accretion from their protoplanetary disks. In this study, the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) emission lines were investigated utilizing medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. The observations were conducted with Nayuta/MALLS and Subaru/HDS. Additionally, archive data obtained by Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES, and VLT/X-Shooter were used. The small ratios of the equivalent widths indicate that Ca II IRT emission lines arise primarily in dense chromospheric regions. Seven PMS stars show broad emission lines. Among them, four PMS stars have more than one order of magnitude brighter emission line fluxes compared to the low-mass stars in young open clusters. The four PMS stars have a high mass accretion rate, which indicates that the broad and strong emission results from a large mass accretion. However, most PMS stars exhibit narrow emission lines. No significant correlation was found between the accretion rate and flux of the emission line. The ratios of the surface flux of the Ca II IRT lines to the stellar bolometric luminosity, R_ IRT, of the PMS stars with narrow emission lines are as large as the largest R_ IRT of the low-mass stars in the young open clusters. This result indicates that most PMS stars, even in the classical T Tauri star stage, have chromospheric activity similar to zero-age main-sequence stars. © The Author(s) 2020.","Activity-stars; Chromospheres-stars; Pre-main sequence-techniques; Spectroscopic; Stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096651012

Current agricultural management practices (energy-intensive, inefficient external and natural input use, and crop biomass burning) are negatively impacting the ecosystem services which are the principal drivers for food security and human survival. Hence, there is a need to shift from unsustainable production practices to cleaner production systems. Energy use, carbon footprint (CF), and economic sustainability are important indicators of any clean production systems. Thus, a hypothesis was formulated that no-till (NT) cultivation along with mulching can provide an environmentally clean crop production practice that can enhance energy use efficiency, economic profitability, and reduce the CF. Therefore, the present experiment was conducted for four consecutive years (2012–15) to evaluate the energy budget, CF, and economics of NT along with bio-mulching for a cleaner upland rice production system. The experiment comprised of two tillage practices i.e., conventional tillage (CT) and NT in main plots and four bio- mulches in subplots i.e., rice straw mulch (RSM), Gliricidia sepium mulch (GLM), brown manuring mulch (BMM) of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and no mulch (NM) as a control. Results revealed that the adoption of NT curtailed energy use by 48.50%, specific energy by 49.63%, CF by 16.48%, and cost of cultivation by 35% in addition to enhancing energy use efficiency and benefit to cost ratio in comparison to CT. It was also observed that mulching, particularly the BMM, boosted the energy use efficiency, economic productivity, net returns, and benefit to cost ratio over NM. The results suggested that NT with BMM is an environmentally clean production technology to enhance the energy use efficiency, besides reducing the CF of direct-seeded upland rice production system in the Eastern Himalayas and similar eco-regions of the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clean production technology; Conservation agriculture; Economic productivity; Fragile hill ecosystem; Green house gas intensity","Agricultural robots; Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Emission control; Food supply; Landforms; Profitability; Sustainable development; Agricultural management practice; Agricultural production system; Benefit to cost ratios; Economic productivity; Economic profitability; Economic sustainability; Energy-use efficiency; Rice production systems; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088392296

As such, it is valuable to analyze the driving mechanism of CEI from a provincial view, and to explore a coordinated emission mitigation mechanism. Based on spatial econometrics, this study conducts a spatial-temporal effect analysis on CEI, and constructs a Spatial Durbin Model on the Panel data (SDPM) of CEI and its eight influential factors: GDP, urbanization rate (URB), industrial structure (INS), energy structure (ENS), energy intensity (ENI), technological innovation (TEL), openness level (OPL), and foreign direct investment (FDI). The main findings are as follows: (1) overall, there is a significant and upward trend of the spatial autocorrelation of CEI on 30 provinces in China. (2) The spatial spillover effect of CEI is positive, with a coefficient of 0.083. (3) The direct effects of ENI, ENS and TEL are significantly positive in descending order, while INS and GDP are significantly negative. The indirect effects of URB and ENS are significantly positive, while GDP, ENI, OPL and FDI are significantly negative in descending order.

As a result, research insights gained in urban climate study can be applied to improve urban sustainability. Although the Local Climate Zones (LCZ) scheme was originally proposed to provide a standardized classification of landscapes to study urban air temperature, its use was not limited to the study of urban heat islands. This study explores the applications of LCZ scheme in various research domains by conducting a bibliometric analysis in CiteSpace on over 800 articles that cites the original article of LCZ. These articles cover a wide range of research categories including meteorology, atmospheric science, environmental science, remote sensing, building technology, civil engineering, ecology, urban studies, etc. The LCZ scheme facilitates urban climate data collection by refining monitoring network, providing reasonable modelling input, and improving database documentation. In addition to the study of urban heat islands, the LCZ scheme was applied in studies of urban thermal comfort, human health, building energy consumption, and carbon emission. The diffusion of the LCZ scheme to other research domains offers an example that the development of urban climate research advances sustainable urban development.

Reducing CO2 to value-added products is an attractive solution to this severe problem, along with addressing the energy crisis, to which the catalysts being employed are of vital importance. Due to their high porosity and tunable compositions, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential in energy conversion systems. By thermal or chemical treatment methods, the MOFs are easily turned into MOF-derived carbon nanomaterials. The much higher level of conductivity enables MOF-derived carbon nanomaterials to be employed in CO2 conversion processes.

The results show that a carbon emission trading policy, economic development, technical research level, and opening to the outside world can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emission intensity and promote carbon emission reduction. By contrast, the industrial structure and environmental protection planning hinder the carbon emission reduction process, while the forest coverage rate has no significant effect on carbon emission reduction.

Here, we analyze regional and global ΔSOC from 1861 to 2099 based on five terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) simulations of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2b. The TBMs were driven by harmonized gridded land use change and bias-adjusted climate forcing data from different general circulation models (GCMs) for climate scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0. Between 2005 and the end of this century, we estimated an increase of SOC for two scenarios with large uncertainty, which is dominated by differences between TBMs. We present a new emergent constraint approach to constrain future modeled ΔSOC over natural vegetation from RCP 6.0 simulations using recent observed trends of net primary productivity as a proxy of litter inputs to soil pools. Our results showed that the uncertainties in constrained ΔSOC can be reduced in comparison with the original model ensemble, but constrained values of ΔSOC depend on the choice of a GCM and climate regions. For the reduction of the SOC density in areas where cropland expanded (Δsoccropland expansion) over natural vegetation as a result of land use change, the constrained Δsoccropland expansion still features large uncertainties due to uncertain observed data. Our proposed emergent constraint approach appears to be valuable to reduce uncertainty on SOC projections, but it is limited here by the small number of models (five) and by the uncertainty in the observational data. Applications to larger ensembles from Earth System Models should be tested for the future. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

There has been a dearth of research on community resilience to urban floods, especially among transient communities, and therefore there is a need to conduct further empirical studies to improve our understanding, and to identify appropriate interventions. Thus, this work combines two existing resilience assessment frameworks to address these issues in three different types of transient community, namely an urban village, commercial housing, and apartments, all located in Wuhan, China. An analytic hierarchy process–back propagation neural network (AHP-BP) model was developed to estimate the community resilience within these three transient communities. The effects of changes in the prioritization of key resilience indicators under different environmental, economic, and social factors was analyzed across the three communities. The results demonstrate that the ranking of the indicators reflects the connection between disaster resilience and the evaluation units of diverse transient communities. These aspects show the differences in the disaster resilience of different types of transient communities. The proposed method can help decision makers in identifying the areas that are lagging behind, and those that need to be prioritized when allocating limited and/or stretched resources. © 2020 by the authors.

This study examines the impact of different charging strategies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity generation and EV batteries in Europe in 2050. To consider indirect emissions and potentially additional battery degradation due to V2G, a model coupling concept is applied to link Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with the electricity system model, PERSEUS-EU. Overall, EV could reduce the GHG emissions by 36% by simply replacing conventional cars. Controlled unidirectional charging and V2G add another 4 or 11 percentage points on the European level.

The empirical results show that economic growth, financial capacity, and energy intensity all have a “pull first, then restrict” inverted U-shaped nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions. However, the influencing mechanisms of these three influencing factors are different and need to be paid attention by relevant government departments. More complicated, the impact of urbanization on CO2 emission shows a gentle “M-shaped” pattern. In addition, an inverse “N-shaped” nonlinear link exists between trade openness and CO2 emissions.

By taking advantage of the structure features of MOFs (e.g. hybrid structure, porosity) and the various luminescence origins of LMOFs, different emission sources can be designed and combined with each other into a homogeneous solid-state LMOF phase with the desired emission properties. This feature article reviews the recent development of multi-emitter LMOFs, and focuses on the design strategies for creating multi-emitter LMOFs based on at least two emission centers. The design strategies are classified into and discussed along six categories: Type I metal-linker emitters, Type II multi-metal emitters, Type III multi-linker emitters, Type IV chromophore@LMOF (chromophore incorporated into an already luminescent MOF), Type V chromophores@MOF (multichromophores embedded into a non-emissive MOF) and Type VI multi-heterostructure LMOF emitters. The new class of Type VI includes core-shell structured LMOF*LMOF and nanostructured LMOF/LMOF thin films on a substrate.

How to determine the control target of PM2.5 concentration for each city according to their local conditions becomes the key to prevent and control PM2.5 pollution. Based on a series of index data selected from the aspect of land, industry, energy, population, technology and economic factors in 2016, this study determines allocation schemes of control targets for PM2.5 concentration in 28 cities of atmospheric pollution transmission channel in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei district under the IT-1 (35 μg/m³), IT-2 (25 μg/m³), IT-3 (15 μg/m³) and AQG (10 μg/m³) scenarios using various methods. The results show that: (1) The combination of the Super-slacks based measure (Super-SBM) model with undesirable outputs, Gini coefficient method, contribution coefficient method and Gini coefficient minimization model can inified evaluation indexes and increase the ability to systematize and compare the allocation schemes formulated based on different regulation principles. (2) The economic development performance level under the constraint condition of PM2.5 pollution and the fairness of PM2.5 emissions corresponding to different factors exhibit significant differences among all the cities. Although the allocation scheme determined based on the equity principle can improve the fairness of PM2.5 emissions compared with the base year, the unfairness characteristic of PM2.5 emissions do not fundamentally change. (3) Regional allocation schemes of control target for PM2.5 concentration under the IT-1 scenario based on the efficiency principle or equity principle are feasible while the scheme determined based on the principle of efficiency and equity is not. The allocation schemes determined under the IT-2, IT-3 and AQG scenarios based on the equity principle are feasible while the schemes determined based on other principles are not.

This study is trying to extract the co-benefit on air quality, public health and economic costs in China and worldwide from China's GHGs mitigation policy. We construct two scenarios, with moderate climate mitigation action worldwide, versus more stringent climate mitigation action in China. We use the GAINS model to predict the GHGs and air pollutants emissions in the two scenarios, and a state-of-the-art global chemical transport model to simulate the annual PM2.5 concentrations. We then use IMED|HEL, which is a health assessment model, to estimate the health impacts and economic cost of PM2.5 pollution in each country. Results show China's mitigation has significant impact on both air quality and health improvement in eastern China and eastern Asia, a little bit impact in the rest of Asia. The improved air quality could avoid 0.37 million premature deaths due to ambient PM2.5 exposure by 2050s globally, with the majority happening in China. We use the willingness to pay method to estimate the economic benefits from the improved air quailty, and find that the reduced ambient PM2.5 concentration could avoid $406 billion and $1206 billion economic costs by 2030s and 2050s globally, with China the largest fraction of 98.5% (400billion)and99.5%(1200 billion), respectively. The reduced ambient PM2.5 exposure can also avoid 11.3 million cases morbidity globally by 2050s, due to asthma attacks and hospital admissions.

This study provides new ideas for economic development by measuring the decoupling index of CO2 emissions within the power industry from 1985 to 2017 based on the Tapio decoupling model. Next, this study determines the key influencing factors of the decoupling index in the long- and short-term based on the autoregressive distributed lag model. The results show that: (1) In the past 30 years, the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development has exhibited synchronization within the power industry; the base for the decoupling state is expansive negative decoupling and weak decoupling, and the strong decoupling state has existed for only five years. (2) The estimation results for the long-term effect indicate that coal-fired power generation efficiency and terminal energy intensity can effectively reduce the decoupling index with a coefficient of 3.0422 and 2.4822, respectively. (3) The estimation results for the short-term effect imply that decreasing terminal energy intensity reduces the decoupling index the most followed by energy consumption, and the two show coefficients of 9.5986 and 2.6404, respectively.

The science research building of China State Construction Technical Center (CSCTC) has been labeled as the benchmark for energy conservation. Rendering the first-hand data, this study employs an ecological input-output model to analyze its life cycle energy and environmental performance. It further introduces scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis to study the critical factors that affect its energy consumption over its 50-year lifespan. This study has reached several conclusions. First, embodied energy and emissions dominate the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a green building. Whilst higher replacement frequency dominates increasing energy consumption, it is indispensable to maintain the well-being of research buildings. Second, installing a rooftop solar photovoltaic system could triple the effect of reducing emissions than that of changing power mix. Moreover, it is imperative to take the functional and safety requirements of research buildings into account when formulating policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle analysis; Research building","Buildings; Construction; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Energy and emissions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental performance; Life cycle energies; Reducing emissions; Safety requirements; Scientific researches; Solar photovoltaic system; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087520692

They are beneficial to traffic congestion mitigation, air pollution reduction, and public health promotion. Hence, examining and comparing the built environment correlates of the propensity of walking and cycling is of great interest to urban practitioners and decision-makers and has attracted extensive research attention. However, existing studies mainly look into the two modes separately or consider them as an integral (i.e., active travel), and few compare built environment correlates of their propensity in a single study, especially in the developing world context. Thus, this study, taking Xiamen, China, as a case, examines the built environment correlates of the propensity of walking and cycling simultaneously and compares the results wherever feasible. It found (1) built environment correlates of the propensity of walking and cycling differ with each other largely in direction and magnitude; (2) land use mix, intersection density, and bus stop density are positively associated with walking propensity, while the distance to the CBD (Central Business District) is a negative correlate; (3) as for cycling propensity, only distance to CBD is a positive correlate, and job density, intersection density, and bus stop density are all negative correlates. The findings of this study have rich policy implications for walking and cycling promotion interventions. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the effectiveness of various conservation agriculture practices with respect to crop production is a controversial subject. In addition, calculating the overall effect of conservation agriculture in terms of crop production improvement by averaging the whole dataset is not uncommon, but field results should be weighted by the geographic regions and the effectiveness of various conservation agriculture combinations on crop cleaner production improvement based on weighted cropping region areas should be evaluated. In this study, we assessed and compared the effectiveness of various conservation agriculture practices in different cropping regions and among different crop types, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of how the combinations of conservation agriculture practices could potentially impact on crop yield improvement and carbon emission in China. The results showed that conservation agriculture practices were highly region-dependent: single conservation agriculture component was more suitable for the South, whereas straw mulching itself or combined with tillage reduction including no tillage and reduced tillage had significantly extraordinary performance in the North. Conventional tillage with straw mulching was the only conservation agriculture practice that led to significant increase of crop yield in all the cropping regions across China. We further found that the previously reported positive correlation between relative changes of yield and prolonged experimental duration could only be applied to conservation agriculture practices that had positive impact on crop production. The negative relationship between crop yield changes and annual precipitation was actually only observed for no tillage with straw mulching. These results demonstrate the different responses of conservation agriculture practices to various cropping region, crop types, climatic conditions, and application duration. Moreover, the results showed that the optimal combination of conservation agriculture for yield had a huge potential to increase crop production by 21.49% across China, which was higher than any of the single conservation agriculture practices. However, if the improper conservation agriculture practices were combined, it may lead to a crop yield decline by −2.30%. The combination for clean production could lead to an increase of crop yield by 6.89% and carbon emission reduction by 75%. Overall, this study illustrates that using single conservation agriculture practice is very likely to underestimate the increase potential of crop production, and the conservation agriculture management should thus be regarded as a package of tillage practices determined by yield improvement and carbon emission reduction according to cropping regions of different climatic conditions and crop types. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Combination; Conservation agriculture; Crop cleaner production","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Cultivation; Emission control; Annual precipitation; Carbon emission reductions; Climatic conditions; Comprehensive evaluation; Conservation agricultures; Conventional tillage; Optimal combination; Positive correlations; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086450680

Recent literature has evaluated China's seven pilot regions on design aspects of the ETS, and yet little is known about the potential recovery of economic output loss through introducing the ETS. This study considers the recovery of industrial value added loss and thus measures the abatement cost savings from trading to evaluate the necessity and feasibility of China's pilot ETSs. The analysis develops a parametric and nonparametric combined technique to calculate the opportunity abatement cost savings (i.e., potential abatement cost savings and unrealized abatement cost savings) and marginal abatement cost savings (i.e., changes on carbon shadow prices) in China's pilot ETSs during 2011–2015. It additionally provides an estimation of potential carbon emissions reduction from ETS. Both cross-industrial trading and intertemporal trading are considered, and three simulations, defined as no trading, cross-industrial trading, and cross-industrial and intertemporal trading, are conducted. We found that, i) 1–16% potential abatement cost savings and 2–12% unrealized abatement cost savings would be identified in China's pilot ETS regions. ii) 0.5–33% and 1.6–25% carbon emissions reduction potential would be realized respectively by introducing ETS and eliminating the operational inefficiency of the ETS. iii) Marginal abatement cost savings would both exist in almost all regions if the ETS were implemented and if the ETS were fully operational. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","By-production approach; Carbon emissions permit trading; Carbon shadow prices; Directional distance function (DDF)","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon; abatement cost; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; carbon footprint; China; cost control; employee; environmental impact; industrial area; pollutant; pollution; simulation; China; cost control; greenhouse gas; industry; China; Carbon; China; Cost Savings; Greenhouse Gases; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086749590

This paper focuses on analyzing trends in energy consumption changes along the timeline for 30 regions in China. Using the Hybrid Input-Output Model, this paper decomposes energy consumption in 30 regions in 2007, 2012 and 2016 into energy embedded of final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, inflow and outflow. We use these four dimensions as coordinates to draw a regional radar map. According to the changing characteristics of the radar map, 30 regions are divided into three groups. By analyzing the reasons for the changes in three regions, we draw the following conclusions. For regions where energy consumption is mainly inflow, the economically developed regions have to form a low energy consumption environment while achieving economic growth. The economically underdeveloped regions need to carry out energy conservation and emission reduction as well as ensuring the level of economic development. For some outflow regions with moderately economic development, it is necessary to balance the economic development and energy consumption control according to regional characteristics. For resource-rich regions which are in the process of transformation from agriculture to industrialization, they have to maintain the rapid development speed and strengthen their infrastructure with less energy consumption of buildings. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy structure decomposition; Hybrid Input-Output Analysis; RAS method; Regional energy consumption","Agricultural robots; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Radar; Developed regions; Economic growths; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Input output analysis; Input output model; Low energy consumption; Regional characteristics; Regional disparities; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093091531

However, land and carbon issues are often considered as isolated factors when mitigating urban carbon emissions. In this study, we proposed a spatial land-carbon nexus framework for exploring the interwoven connections of carbon emission and land-use changes. The land-related carbon transitions were accounted by the land-use conversion matrix and carbon transfer density. Then, the ecological relationships among various land-use changes were explored using ecological network analysis (ENA). A land-carbon nexus rate was proposed to depict the integrated effect of land-use changes on carbon balance. A case study was also conducted for cities in Zhejiang Province during the periods of 1995–2000, 2000–2005, 2005–2010 and 2010–2015, showing their positive and negative land-related carbon transitions, and the variations of ecological relationships as well. The results showed that: (1) The dominant negative and positive carbon transitions exhibited in land-use changes from CL (Cultivated land) to I&T (Indusial and Transportation land) and I&T to CL. (2) Spatially, natural land-use type including wetland and forest exhibited competition relationships in the urban fringe area, while others embracing I&T and UCL (Urban construction land) with mutualism relationships scattered in the central urban area. (3) The dominate driving weight contributions for 8 cities were transformed from CL to I&T from 1995 to 2015, whereas the major pulling force weight contributions were always induced by natural land-use types with carbon sequestration functions. The land-carbon nexus approach presents great potential for bridging nexus analysis with resilient spatial planning to reduce the pressure in support of low carbon transitions through urban land management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon transitions; Ecological network analysis; Land-carbon nexus; Land-use changes; Resilient spatial planning","Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Urban planning; Carbon sequestration; Ecological network analysis; Ecological relationships; Integrated effects; Low-carbon transitions; Transition process; Urban construction; Zhejiang Province; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087501920

Eight representative provinces with different power supply structures and generation portfolios carry out simulated operations as initial pilot spot markets. The balancing market, a significant section of the spot market that addresses fair transaction settlements to eliminate system imbalance in real time, is diverse among these pilot spot markets. Therefore, effective methodological support is needed to analyse the interaction between balancing market design and participant behaviour considering the market environment in China. Based on the incentive compatibility of the market design with the actual situation in China, this paper assigns wind power producers as market participants, since wind power integration aggravates real-time imbalances due to its natural uncertainty and fluctuation. This study first summarizes the key elements of balancing market design in China that exert great influence on wind power producers; then, an offering strategy model of wind power producers is proposed embedding into the balancing market clearing model to reveal the interactive effect between balancing market design and the behavioural decisions of market participants and to investigate the adequacy of the entire market.

To provide a theoretical and practical framework of this process, we argue that the combination of the multi-level perspective (MLP) and agent-based modeling (ABM) enables us to reach a deeper and detailed analysis of low-carbon transitions. As an extensively applied theoretical form, MLP conceptualizes low-carbon transitions as a nonlinear process and allows a system to be analyzed and organized into multiple dimensions (landscape, regime, and niche). However, MLP cannot explain the many details of complex transitions, whereas ABM can estimate the influence of interacting behaviors in a complex system. Therefore, the main advantages of the combined approach for the analysis of low-carbon transition are verified: the MLP can contribute to the overall design of ABM, and ABM can provide a dynamic, continuous, and quantitative description of the MLP. To construct this combination framework, this paper offers a guiding principle that combines the two perspectives under a low-carbon transitional background to create an integrated strategy using three procedures: defining the common concepts, their interaction, and their combination. Through the proposed framework, the goal of this work was to reach a better understanding of social system evolution from the present high-carbon state to a low-carbon state under the pressure of ambitious climate goals, providing specific policy recommendations. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, selecting a development path that could both meet the temperature targets and economic growth is essential and worth investigating. We propose an optimization model to analyze China's carbon dioxide emission paths from 2010 to 2050 in three scenarios, namely baseline, and 1.5 °C and 2 °C target scenarios. The marginal cost of carbon abatement in China's 30 provinces (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Tibet) were also calculated using the quadratic directional distance function model, and the quotas of carbon dioxide emission among provinces were allocated. Carbon dioxide emission peak will occur in 2040 under the 2 °C target scenario and in 2030 under the 1.5 °C target scenario. The marginal cost of carbon abatement to achieve the 1.5 °C goal is approximately 1.6 times more expensive than the 2 °C goal. We suggest to implement emission reduction policies in the Eastern coastal areas of China and to allocate greater carbon dioxide emission quotas in under-developed areas in the Central and Western regions. Provincial quota allocation may also help to balance regional development and achieve the mutually beneficial goal of economic growth and carbon emission reduction in China. Our findings provide practical guidance on achieving carbon dioxide emission reduction and critical enlightenments on policymaking. © 2020","Carbon dioxide emission reduction; Optimal emission path; Paris agreement; Quadratic directional distance function model; Quotas allocation; Temperature control threshold","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; international agreement; optimization; reduction; regional development; temperature profile; Article; calibration; carbon allocation; carbon footprint; China; economic development; mathematical model; parameters; process optimization; seashore; thermoregulation; China; France; Hong Kong; Macao; Taiwan; temperature; Tibet; China; Hong Kong; Macau; Taiwan; Xizang; Carbon Dioxide; China; Hong Kong; Macau; Paris; Taiwan; Temperature; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087688682

Study focus: This study develops watershed management alternatives which can ensure optimal climate change adaptation benefits under different climate scenarios. The climate scenarios were developed using the statistically bias corrected, multi-model ensemble mean and the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The hydrological impact of climate change was assessed using a multi-gauge calibrated and validated the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Watershed management alternatives were prioritized using a multi-criteria decision analysis which intercompared watershed management criteria and alternatives through the Analytic Hierarchy Process. New hydrological insights: The findings showed a consistent decline of rainfall, surface runoff and total water yield under all climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios. Water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternatives to reduce climate change impacts. More than half of the watersheds of the Jemma sub-basin are highly and optimally suitable for in-situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios. Observed terrace and anticipated in-situ water harvesting structures significantly (p < 0.05) reduced surface runoff and thereby significantly increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios. However, both in-situ and ex-situ water harvesting structures caused an insignificant change in the total water yield under climate scenarios. We conclude implementing in-situ water harvesting structures can help to increase green water without a decline in blue water. © 2020 The Authors","Blue Nile Basin; Climate change; Jemma sub-basin; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Watershed management scenarios",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088980363

Political will is a critical component of the ambitious climate action equation. The current level of political will observed for many national governments is considered inadequate, with numerous political leaders yet to commit to climate action commensurate with the projected risks and responsibilities for their respective jurisdictions. Under the leadership of the Obama administration, however, the United States of America arguably provided an example to the contrary. Strategically utilising an available legislative lever, the Obama administration pursued comparatively ambitious climate change mitigation policies, with health as a core motivation. Analysis of Obama-led climate policies and policy-making strategies provides valuable insight into the utility of health as a motivator for climate action. It also reaffirms that strong political leadership constitutes an essential element in the pursuit of increasingly ambitious climate change policies, particularly in the face of strong opposition. © 2020 The Author(s).

This frame serves to mobilize communities and attribute responsibility to relevant authorities while countering the San Joaquin Valley Air District's narrative that places blame on the public and unalterable aspects of the physical environment, characterizing the problem as largely unchangeable. Core questions are: How did advocates facilitate frame construction and sustain resonance across time and place? How did this frame compel urgent action, including representational change in the Valley Air District Governing Board through the adoption of Senate Bill 719? Findings show that advocates counter the San Joaquin Valley Air District's frame by shifting the focus on the negative impacts to public health and quality of life, particularly in disproportionately impacted environmental justice communities. Building and leveraging a resonant frame required strategic “stretch” in capacity while cultivating collective identity and solidarity. Within the Valley Air District, the change in governing board composition has measurably impacted dialog and provided a more welcoming reception of public participation at meetings, with the doctor and scientist appointees providing critical perspectives and contributing to subtle shifts in the agency's dominant messaging and decision making.

Although it has been shown that oxy-fuel combustion results in lower carbon dioxide emissions at a lower cost of carbon dioxide captured compared to the mature amine scrubbing process, its implementation still results in high economic penalties. This study proposes to replace the conventional steam cycle in the state-of-the-art oxy-combustion coal-fired power plants with the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle to reduce both economic and efficiency penalties. In addition, in order to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions, biomass is considered as a replacement fuel for coal in the oxy-fuel combustion power plant and the proposed process becomes a type of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. The process models were developed in Aspen Plus™ to assess techno-economic feasibility of the considered processes. The results showed that on replacement of the conventional steam cycle with the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle, the efficiency penalties were reduced by up to 2% points and the levelised cost of electricity was reduced up to 4.6% (4.1 €/MWh). Moreover, when biomass was used as a fuel, the net efficiency penalties increased by 0.5% points and the levelised cost of electricity increased by 24.4 €/MWh. Although techno-economic performance in this case was less favourable under no carbon tax conditions, using biomass resulted in significant negative carbon dioxide emissions (-3.70 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per annum). Such negative emissions can offset carbon dioxide emissions from other sources that are relatively difficult to decarbonise. If the carbon tax is above 24 € per tonne of carbon dioxide, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage became more economically feasible than fossil fuel with carbon capture and storage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-energy and carbon capture and storage; Feasibility assessment; Oxy-fuel combustion; Process modelling; Supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle; Techno-economic assessment","Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide process; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coal storage; Economic analysis; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Global warming; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Supercritical fluid extraction; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cost of electricity; Economic penalty; Oxyfuel combustion; State of the art; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Techno-economic assessment; Techno-economic feasibility; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087679380

The variability of haze days combined with dynamic circulation was investigated using meteorological observation data and ERA-5 reanalysis data. The results show that large-scale and mountain-valley circulation, local meteorological factors and mountains affected the variability of severe haze events. The GZB is surrounded by complicated mountain conditions, with the Loess Plateau in the north, the Qinling Mountains in the south, highlands in the west and a valley plain in the east. The analysis showed that the formation and development of long-lasting severe haze events rely largely on the persistent south and east winds at a large scale. Owing to the complex effects of terrain, a weak convergence-stable stratification-divergence distribution is formed in the GZB in the vertical profile from the surface to the middle troposphere. A stable stratification exists near 850 hPa with features of near-zero vertical speed and an evident inversion layer. In this atmospheric environment, air pollution worsens until the northwest wind intensifies. In addition, mountain-valley circulation plays an important role in the diurnal variability of haze. During the day, the valley breeze dissipates pollutants, decreasing the PM2.5 concentrations.

Crossbred steer calves (n =120) were stratified by birth date, birth weight, and dam age and assigned randomly to one of four treatments: 1) no technology (NT; control), 2) antibiotic treated (ANT; NT plus therapeutic antibiotics and monensin and tylosin), 3) implant treated (IMP; ANT plus a series of 3 implants, and 4) beta-agonist treated (BA; IMP plus ractopamine-HCl for the last 30 d prior to harvest). Weaned steers were fed in confinement (dry lot) and finished in an individual feeding system to collect performance data. At harvest, standard carcass measures were collected and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Yield Grade and Quality Grade were determined. Information from the cow-calf, growing, and finishing phases were used to simulate production systems using the USDA Integrated Farm System Model, which included a partial life cycle assessment of cattle production for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil energy use, water use, and reactive N loss. Body weight in suckling, growing, and finishing phases as well as hot carcass weight was greater (P < 0.05) for steers that received implants (IMP and BA) than non-implanted steers (NT and ANT). The average daily gain was greater (P < 0.05) for steers that received implants (IMP and BA) than non-implanted steers during the suckling and finishing phases, but no difference (P = 0.232) was detected during the growing phase. Dry matter intake and gain:feed were greater (P < 0.05) for steers that received implants than non-implanted steers during the finishing phase. Steers that received implants responded (P < 0.05) with a larger loin muscle area, less kidney pelvic and heart fat, advanced carcass maturity, reduced marbling scores, and a greater percentage of carcasses in the lower third of the USDA Choice grade. This was offset by a lower percentage of USDA Prime grading carcasses compared with steers receiving no implants. Treatments did not influence (P > 0.05) USDA Yield grade. The life cycle assessment revealed that IMP and BA treatments reduced GHG emissions, energy use, water use, and reactive nitrogen loss compared to NT and ANT. These data indicate that growth promoting technologies increase carcass yield while concomitantly reducing carcass quality and environmental impacts. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

With current techniques falling short in terms of performance, cost, and environmental integrity, novel CO2 utilization has the potential to create a multi-billion dollar commodity market that is capable of sequestering large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. To achieve this, significant development in terms of government funding, policy change, and research is needed. This review highlights the current state of novel CO2 utilization technologies. The paper evaluates their future prospects by drawing parallels with two successfully developed hardware-heavy technologies of the last 50 years, namely the solar and the automobile industries.

Imaging spectroscopy is a promising technique to create spatially accurate topsoil maps based on hyperspectral remote sensing data. We tested the application of a local partial least squares regression (PLSR) to airborne HySpex and simulated satellite EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) data acquired in north-eastern Germany to quantify the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The approach consists of two steps: (i) the local PLSR uses the European LUCAS (land use/cover area frame statistical survey) Soil database to quantify the SOC content for soil samples from the study site in order to avoid the need for wet chemistry analyses, and subsequently (ii) a remote sensing model is calibrated based on the local PLSR SOC results and the corresponding image spectra. This two-step approach is compared to a traditional PLSR approach using measured SOC contents from local samples. The prediction accuracy is high for the laboratory model in the first step with R2 = 0.86 and RPD = 2.77. The HySpex airborne prediction accuracy of the traditional approach is high and slightly superior to the two-step approach (traditional: R2 = 0.78, RPD = 2.19; two-step: R2 = 0.67, RPD = 1.79). Applying the two-step approach to simulated EnMAP imagery leads to a lower but still reasonable prediction accuracy (traditional: R2 = 0.77, RPD = 2.15; two-step: R2 = 0.48, RPD = 1.41). The two-step models of both sensors were applied to all bare soils of the respective images to produce SOC maps. This local PLSR approach, based on large scale soil spectral libraries, demonstrates an alternative to SOC measurements from wet chemistry of local soil samples. It could allow for repeated inexpensive SOC mapping based on satellite remote sensing data as long as spectral measurements of a few local samples are available for model calibration. © 2020 by the authors.

Then, we developed two econometric models to quantify the wastewater discharge allowance and eco-compensation of investigated cities, respectively. The results specifically reveal the inverted U-curve effects of GRP (gross regional product) on industrial wastewater discharge, which displays an evidence of EKC in the field of transboundary water pollution in China. Moreover, our results verify the polluter pays principle that polluter should be responsible for its pollution behavior through paying of eco-compensation.

China announced its local test cycle in 2019: CLTC (China light-duty vehicle test cycle). To evaluate vehicle emission under different cycles, one conventional gasoline vehicle and its hybrid counterpart were tested on the chassis dynamometer following CLTC, WLTC, and RDE (Real Driving Emission). The fuel consumption between WLTC and RDE is at the same level. While for the conventional, CLTC fuel consumption is 8.41% higher than WLTC and for the hybrid, it's 20.23% lower than WLTC. To get better vehicle fuel efficiency, vehicle application scenarios must be considered. Frequent re-start and longer warm-up time of the hybrid leads to high CO emission than the conventional. High engine speed could result in instantaneous CO spikes and with these spikes, 25% of the total CO could be emitted in less than 10 s. For the conventional, NOx emitted during engine warm-up occupied 85.39%, 87.02%, 43.06%, 31.98%, and 55.43% of the total NOx respectively for CLTC, WLTC and three RDE tests. NOx emitted from the hybrid is less than 10% of the conventional due to lower engine load and less fuel enrichment. Hybrid particle emission is under good control with the equipment of the gasoline particle filter, but the regeneration might increase thin particle exposure to the public. For most pollutants, CLTC doesn't close the gap between laboratory tests and real driving. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CLTC; Fuel consumption; Hybrid vehicle; Real driving simulation; Regulated emissions; WLTC","Dynamometers; Engines; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicle performance; Chassis dynamometers; Conventional gasoline; Emission performance; Hybrid particles; Light duty vehicles; Vehicle applications; Vehicle emission; Vehicle fuel efficiencies; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087055417

However, little is known about the magnitude of soil N2O emissions from global tea plantations. Based on a global meta-analysis of field experimental data collected from major tea growing countries, we quantify annual N2O emissions, calculate direct emission factors (EFd) and identify key environmental controls of emissions from tea plantations. However, most data are from China and Japan, which is to be expected given that tea plantations in these countries represent &gt;60% of the global area and the vital environmental research community in both countries. Results suggest that annual N2O emissions from soils of global tea plantations are on average 17.1 kg N ha−1 (or 8008 kg CO2-eq ha−1), being substantially greater than those reported for cereal croplands (662–3757 kg CO2-eq ha−1). The global mean EFd for N applications to tea plantations equals 2.31% (with a 95% confidence interval of 1.91%–2.71%), being two times higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default value of 1%. Across tea plantations worldwide, total N2O emissions are estimated to be 57–84 Gg N yr−1, or 1.5%–12.7% of total direct cropland N2O emissions. Given that tea plantations account for only 0.3% of total cropland area, our finding highlights that tea-planted soils are global hotspots for N2O emissions and that these systems might be prime targets for climate change mitigation in the agricultural sector.

In this article, an integrated scheme is developed based on the assumption that in a specific climatic region, the similarity of environmental conditions related to precipitation (SEP) in two locations is positively correlated to the similarities of occurrence and magnitude of precipitation between them. First, the QTP was divided into the northwestern arid, middle semi-arid/semi-humid, and southeastern humid climatic sub-regions by grouping analysis. Second, based on modified weighted k-nearest neighbour model, daily precipitation of target locations in these climatic sub-regions were predicted by weighted regression of a group of gauge observations that have the largest SEP with the target locations. SEP was calculated by the following auxiliary environmental factors: longitude, latitude, elevation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, relative humidity, and CMORPH (Climate Prediction Center's morphing technique) daily precipitation estimates (original CMORPH). The validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Compared with the original CMORPH and PDF-calibrated CMORPH (CMORPH calibrated by probability density function matching plus optimal interpolation method) at daily, monthly, and yearly scales, the scheme improves the rain/no rain detection capacity and the accuracy of daily precipitation estimates. In addition, the daily precipitation estimates obtained from this scheme can present significant discrimination over specific geographic units, particularly the Qaidam Basin, the great bend of the Brahmaputra River, and Hengduan Mountain. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","daily precipitation estimates; environmental conditions; similarity; the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau","Gages; Location; Nearest neighbor search; Probability density function; Climate prediction centers; Daily precipitations; Environmental conditions; K-nearest neighbour models; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optimal interpolation; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; similarity; Rain; environmental conditions; environmental factor; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; Brahmaputra River; China; Hengduan Mountains; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091738187

This paper reflects on practice, lessons, and experience developing and delivering climate services in China for disaster risk re-duction, agriculture, water, energy, urbanization, and major engineering projects. Four key aspects of successful climate services are highlighted: the transition of climate research to operational climate services; delivering relevant, tailored, and usable climate information; effective engagement between users and providers of climate services; and building interdisciplinary professional teams. Key challenges and opportunities for climate services are recognized in this paper: a growing gap between climate science and services capa-bility and societal need, a lack of awareness in user communities of the climate service value for their ac-tivities, and the important need for closer and more meaningful interactions between users and providers of climate services.

The paradigm of HRB energy consumption is characterized by high-density energy consumption, severe peak effects and a limited site area for integrating renewable energy, which constitute a hindrance to the low-carbon transition. This review paper investigates low-carbon transition efforts in the HRB sector from the perspective of urban energy systems to get a holistic view of their approaches. The HRB sector plays a significant role in reducing carbon emission and improving the resilience of urban energy systems. Different approaches to an HRB low-carbon transition are investigated and a brief overview of potential solutions is offered from the perspectives of improving energy efficiency, self-sufficiency and system resilience. The trends of decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization in the HRB sector allow a better alignment with transitioning urban energy systems and create cross-sectoral integration opportunities for low-carbon transition. It is also found that policy tools are powerful driving forces in China for incentivizing transition behaviors among utilities, end users and developers. Based on a comprehensive policy review, the policy implications are given. The research is geared for the situation in China but could also be used as an example for other developing countries that have similar urbanization patterns.

In this study, we use the bottom-up model approach to predict the penetration rate of room ACs in the residential building sector of China at the provincial level, with the consideration of the urban-rural heterogeneity. In addition, we assess co-benefits associated with enhanced energy efficiency improvement of AC systems and the adoption of low-global-warming-potential (low-GWP) refrigerants in AC systems. The results indicate that the stock of room ACs in China grows from 568 million units in 2015 to 997 million units in 2030 and 1.1 billion units in 2050. The annual electricity saving from switching to more efficient ACs using low-GWP refrigerants is estimated at almost 1000 TWh in 2050 when taking account of the full technical energy efficiency potential. This is equivalent to approximately 4% of the expected total energy consumption in the Chinese building sector in 2050 or the avoidance of 284 new coal-fired power plants of 500 MW each. The cumulative CO2eq mitigation associated with both the electricity savings and the substitution of high-GWP refrigerants makes up 2.6% of total business-as-usual CO2eq emissions in China over the period 2020 to 2050.

Although we are aware that both litter quality and the efficiency of decomposers within soil communities (hereafter, “soil ability”) are important drivers of HFA effects, we know little on variation in HFA effects and underlying processes of these changes across years with varying climates. In order to address these questions, we repeated four years with varying climates (two mild years, 2016 & 2018 and two stressed years, 2017 & 2019) a reciprocal transplant experiment with four litter types, crossing vegetation structure and soil fertility contrasts of both litter and ecosystems (forest and grassland litters from both fertile and unfertile soils). We used the Decomposer Ability Regression Test for both types of years to search for evidence of HFA effects and conducted ANOVAs on the cross effects of vegetation structure and soil fertility contrasts to further identifying the underlying processes of changes in HFA across climates. HFA effects were only significant for the most recalcitrant litter of Pinus pinaster, and much more significant during the mild years. Litter quality was stable across species and years, whereas differences in soil ability among ecosystems of the four species were strongly affected by climate, with highly significant differences among ecosystems occurring only during the mild years. Changes in soil ability across climates (decreasing HFA effects during stressed years) were explained by an overall increase in litter decomposition in forests as compared to grasslands during the stressed years, due to the facilitation of soil decomposers by forest canopies. Our study showed that HFA effects vary across climates as a result of changes in soil ability and that forest canopies may buffer the negative effects on litter decomposition of increasing stress with climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climatic variability; Forest; Grassland; Home-field advantages effects; Litter quality; Soil ability","Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Vegetation; Vehicles; Climate condition; Forest and grassland; Forest canopies; Litter decomposition; Pinus pinaster; Regression tests; Soil community; Vegetation structure; Soils; climate change; climate conditions; coniferous tree; decomposition; forest ecosystem; litter; microbial activity; soil fertility; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; vegetation structure; Pinus pinaster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088323621

The results show the following. First, in 2007–2012, the average carbon emissions caused by inter-provincial demand and inter-provincial exports account for about 35.4% and 8% of total production-based carbon emissions, respectively, which indicates that carbon transfers between provinces are widespread. Second, total carbon transfers caused by inter-provincial demand keep increasing, and in 2012, 19 provinces show net carbon outflows, and provinces located in the northern and central regions receive most net carbon inflows. By contrast, net carbon outflows induced by inter-provincial export keep decreasing and are concentrated in eight provinces in the Beijing–Tianjin, eastern, and southern coastal areas. Third, the scale and structural effects increase net carbon transfers between provinces in 2007–2010 and 2010–2012, respectively, whereas the technological effect reduces net carbon transfers between provinces in 2007–2012.

Recently, thermochemical conversion of seaweeds is in industrial focus to obtain high-value products with more potential applications than the conventional raw material. Beside biofuel production and due to their autotrophic growth, seaweeds are receiving a great attention in the field of bioremediation. Thus, pyrolysis of seaweeds is a promising approach for renewable bio-oil production with positive environmental impacts. However, a pretreatment drying step is required to improve the conversion process of the biomass. Application of electro-osmotic dewatering as well as on-site mechanical dewatering methods prior to the drying process were reported as useful techniques to reduce the energy requirements. On the other hand, the bio-oil produced from pyrolysis of seaweeds usually has high contents of oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, which should be as minimum as possible to enhance the bio-oil stability and reduce NOx and SOx emissions. The present review introduces a suggested route combining a number of technologies that create an economically-feasible process for conversion of seaweeds to high-grade crude bio-oil through pyrolysis. In addition, the paper sheds light on the environmental impacts and economic feasibility of the crude bio-oil production from seaweeds. The current status and challenges related to pyrolysis, as well as future perspectives for enhanced conversion and upgraded bio-oil production, are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crude bio-oil; Environmental impacts; Macroalgae; Pyrolysis; Sustainability","Biofuels; Bioremediation; Dewatering; Drying; Fossil fuels; Pyrolysis; Seaweed; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Economic feasibilities; Electro-osmotic dewatering; Future perspectives; Global energy demand; Mechanical dewatering; State-of-the art reviews; Sulphur containing compounds; Thermochemical Conversion; Petroleum industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088941547

It aims to understand how human final demands affect an economy's water consumption and carbon emissions by contrasting the similarity and dissimilarity of China's carbon footprint and water footprint. The results show that >90% of China's carbon and water footprints are embodied in trade, and China was a net exporter of embodied carbon and virtual water from 1990 to 2010. This could mean that China is burdened with more environmental pollution and resource pressures in the global supply and demand chain. We find that China's main net export destination of carbon-water-intensive products are developed areas such as North America and Europe, while China's main net import sources are developing areas such as Africa and Southeast Asia. Heavy industry and transportation contain the most carbon footprint in China, while agriculture, fishery and light industry contain the most water footprint. Also, China's embodied carbon and virtual water in diverse sectors in different years vary from region to region. The similarities and differences between China's carbon and water footprints should be considered when making decisions to better governance of climate change and water crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Environmental pressure; Multi-regional input-output model; Trade; Water footprint","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Emission control; International trade; Time series analysis; Carbon emissions; Embodied carbons; Environmental pollutions; Heavy industries; Input output model; Resource pressure; Supply and demand chains; Water consumption; Carbon footprint; carbon footprint; decision making; environmental impact assessment; governance approach; human activity; input-output analysis; international trade; time series analysis; water footprint; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; commercial phenomena; environmental factor; fishery; mathematical model; pollution; priority journal; traffic and transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086478143

However, previous studies applying global regression have been unable to capture such variation. We aimed to employ a geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) to estimate the RRs of LCM among the elderly (≥65 years) related to long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the LCM attributable to PM2.5 at the county level in China. Methods: We obtained annual LCM in the elderly between 2013 and 2015 from the National Death Surveillance. We linked annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 between 2000 and 2004 with LCM using GWPR model at 148 counties across mainland China, adjusting for smoking and socioeconomic covariates. We used county-specific GWPR models to estimate annual average LCM in the elderly between 2013 and 2015 attributable to PM2.5 exposure between 2000 and 2004. Results: The magnitude of the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and LCM varied with county. The median of county-specific RRs of LCM among elderly men and women was 1.52 (range: 0.90, 2.40) and 1.49 (range: 0.88, 2.56) for each 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5, respectively. The RRs were positively significant (P &lt; 0.05) at 95% (140/148) of counties among both elderly men and women. Higher RRs of PM2.5 among elderly men were located at Southwest and South China, and higher RRs among elderly women were located at Northwest, Southwest, and South China. There were 99,967 and 54,457 lung cancer deaths among elderly men and women that could be attributed to PM2.5, with the attributable fractions of 31.4% and 33.8%, respectively. Conclusions: The relative importance of long-term exposure to PM2.5 in LCM differed by county. The results could help the government design tailored and efficient interventions. More stringent PM2.5 control is urgently needed to reduce LCM in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Geographically weighted Poisson regression; Lung cancer; PM2.5; Relative risk; Spatial variation","Biological organs; Annual average; Attributable fraction; Long term exposure; Lung cancer mortality; Mainland chinas; Poisson regression; Relative risks; Term associations; Diseases; cancer; health risk; long-term change; mortality; particulate matter; regression analysis; spatial variation; aged; Article; cancer mortality; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; demography; disease association; environmental exposure; female; geographic distribution; human; lung cancer; magnitude estimation method; male; particulate matter; Poisson distribution; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; social status; lung tumor; particulate matter; spatial regression; Aged; China; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Particulate Matter; Smoking; Spatial Regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086821206

The fraction and distribution of melt ponds have considerable impacts on Arctic climate and ecosystem by reducing the albedo. There is an urgency to obtain improved accuracy and a wider coverage of melt pond fraction (MPF) data for studying these processes. MPF information has generally been acquired from optical imagery. Conventional MPF algorithms based on high-resolution optical sensors have treated melt ponds as features with constant reflectance; however, the spectral reflectance of ponds can vary greatly, even at a local scale. Here we use Sentinel-2 imagery to demonstrate those previous algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance greatly underestimate MPF. We propose a new algorithm (“LinearPolar”) based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance features and calculates MPF across the vector between melt pond and bare ice axes. The angular coordinate θ of the polar coordinate system, which is only associated with pond fraction rather than reflectance, is used to determinate MPF. By comparing the new algorithm and previous methods with IceBridge optical imagery data, across a variety of Sentinel-2 images with melt ponds at various stages of development, we show that the RMSE value of the LinearPolar algorithm is about 30% lower than for the previous algorithms. Moreover, based on a sensitivity test, the new algorithm is also less sensitive to the subjective threshold for melt pond reflectance than previous algorithms. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Because both carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions mainly stem from fossil energy use, a co-control strategy is simulated and compared with single control in China, using an integrated assessment model (Global Change Assessment Model-Tsinghua University (GCAM-TU)) in this paper. We find that end-of-pipe (EOP) control measures play an important role in reducing air pollution in the near future, but in the long run, optimizing the energy system is an effective way to control both emissions. Reducing air pollutant might take a “free-ride” of decarbonizing the energy system. Compared with a single control of air pollutants, a co-control strategy is likely to reduce the requirement of EOP control measures. The result guides the Chinese government to consider a systemic and scientific plan for decarbonizing the energy system and co-controlling CO2 and air pollutant, in order to avoid duplicate investments in infrastructure and lockup effect. The solution could be extended to many other developing countries, such as India and Africa, which is helpful to realize the goals of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Agenda. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; China; Co-control; CO2 emissions; Integrated assessment model","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; living standard; optimization; pollution control; strategic approach; sustainable development; United Nations; Africa; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068113242

Here we employed a novel strategy to demonstrate triplet-triplet energy transfer from an organic room-temperature phosphor (RTP) with persistent luminescence to an organic molecule with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). We illustrated this approach by preparing heavy-atom-free composite crystals of an RTP with a long-lifetime emission and a red emissive organic fluorophore with TADF to yield materials with emission above 650 nm. The emission arose from the triplet excited state of an acceptor undergoing thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to the emissive S1 state.

China is currently the single largest emitter of CO2, responsible for approximately 27 per cent (2.67 petagrams of carbon per year) of global fossil fuel emissions in 20171. Understanding of Chinese land biosphere fluxes has been hampered by sparse data coverage2–4, which has resulted in a wide range of a posteriori estimates of flux. Here we present recently available data on the atmospheric mole fraction of CO2, measured from six sites across China during 2009 to 2016. Using these data, we estimate a mean Chinese land biosphere sink of −1.11 ± 0.38 petagrams of carbon per year during 2010 to 2016, equivalent to about 45 per cent of our estimate of annual Chinese anthropogenic emissions over that period. Our estimate reflects a previously underestimated land carbon sink over southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces) throughout the year, and over northeast China (especially Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces) during summer months. These provinces have established a pattern of rapid afforestation of progressively larger regions5,6, with provincial forest areas increasing by between 0.04 million and 0.44 million hectares per year over the past 10 to 15 years. These large-scale changes reflect the expansion of fast-growing plantation forests that contribute to timber exports and the domestic production of paper7. Space-borne observations of vegetation greenness show a large increase with time over this study period, supporting the timing and increase in the land carbon sink over these afforestation regions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; afforestation; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sink; emission control; estimation method; fossil fuel; plantation forestry; afforestation; air temperature; Article; biomass; biosphere; carbon balance; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; China; Chinese; controlled study; Eucalyptus; land use; nonhuman; plantation; priority journal; seasonal variation; vegetation; atmosphere; building material; carbon sequestration; chemistry; data analysis; environmental monitoring; Far East; geographic mapping; plant; satellite imagery; theoretical model; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Guizhou; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Yunnan; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; China; Construction Materials; Data Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Far East; Fossil Fuels; Geographic Mapping; Models, Theoretical; Plants; Satellite Imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094201422

In this study, we analyze the effects of vehicle emission control measures on ambient air pollution and associated deaths attributable to long-term exposures of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and O3based on an integrated research framework that combines scenario analysis, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. We find that the total impact of these control measures was substantial. Vehicular emissions during 1998-2015 would have been 2-3 times as large as they actually were, had those measures not been implemented. The national population-weighted annual average concentrations of PM2.5and O3in 2015 would have been higher by 11.7 μg/m3and 8.3 parts per billion, respectively, and the number of deaths attributable to 2015 air pollution would have been higher by 510 thousand (95% confidence interval: 360 thousand to 730 thousand) without these controls. Our analysis shows a concentration of mortality impacts in densely populated urban areas, motivating local policymakers to design stringent vehicle emission control policies. The results imply that vehicle emission control will require policy designs that are more multifaceted than traditional controls, primarily represented by the strict emission standards, with careful consideration of the challenges in coordinated mitigation of both PM2.5and O3in different regions, to sustain improvement in air quality and public health given continuing swift growth in China's vehicle population. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

However, most current research focuses on increasing platform revenue instead of improving drivers' revenue in a centralized dispatch taxi system just like DiDi, which results in a slower driver income growth and greater difficulties for recruiting drivers. To solve this problem, we propose a strategy of deep reinforcement learning based on driver mode. Firstly, the sequence selection process of drivers is modeled as markov decision-making process in driver mode. Then, we propose a learning scheme based on deep Q network to optimize the driver's decision-making strategy. We know that the real selection of historical taxi drivers is very helpful to the selection of current taxi drivers, so we choose the historical record of the current location as the edge data to update the edge network. Finally, we used a real data set generated by more than 1,400 taxis in Changsha. The simulation experiments show that our scheme reduced cruising time of taxis and improved the driver's income by 4-5%. The carbon emissions are obviously reduced by saving almost 6% fuel consumption, which contributes significantly to green mobility. © 2013 IEEE.","client recommendation; edge data; reinforcement learning; Revenue efficiency","Behavioral research; Decision making; Efficiency; Reinforcement learning; Taxicabs; Carbon emissions; Decision-making strategies; Efficiency optimization; Historical records; Learning schemes; Markov decision; Rapid expansion; Reinforcement learning approach; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100825747

It is important to objectively measure its evolution characteristics and identify its key impact factors. Based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model and the connotation of SCPC, this paper constructs a comprehensive SCPC evaluation system from the dimensions of resources, technology, safety, environment and benefits. Furthermore, this paper proposes an integrated analysis method to evaluate and identify the evolutionary characteristics and key influencing factors of SCPC from 2000 to 2016. The results show that, a) China's SCPC assessment system reflects the current state of pressure drive, operational state and regulatory response of China's coal overcapacity and its interaction mechanism. b) The integrated assessment method of SCPC can effectively remedy the deviation caused by the method of constant power evaluation and improve the accuracy of the evaluation method and the reliability of the evaluation results. c) China's SCPC tends to improve overall during the period of 2000-2016, but its development is slow. The reason is that the operation state of SCPC and its response mechanism are improved, and the impact of the pressure-driven factors of SCPC still exists and has not be improved. d) The obstacle factors of the pressure-subsystem of SCPC mainly involve coal transportation and carbon mitigation constraints. The obstacle factors of the state-subsystem are mainly coal quality, employee health and asset operation ability, and the obstacle factors of the response-subsystem are market regulation and demand-side response mechanisms. The key to improving China's SCPC in the future is to strengthen the construction of coal transportation channels, achieve clean utilization of coal resources, pay attention to employee health, improve asset operation efficiency and promote coal market reform. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal production capacity; Exponential variable weight; Obstacle factor; PSR evaluation System; TOPSIS method","Coal; Coal deposits; Coal transportation; Commerce; Decision making; Personnel; Sustainable development; Demand side response; Evolution characteristics; Integrated assessment; Interaction mechanisms; Key influencing factors; Operation efficiencies; Pressure state response (PSR); Transportation channels; Coal industry; coal production; coal supply; decision making; demand-side management; efficiency measurement; energy market; policy reform; regulatory framework; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088920514

Yet effective action is still lacking. Dominant policy approaches have failed to generate action at anywhere near the rate, scale or depth needed to avoid potentially catastrophic futures. This is despite 30 years of climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and wide-ranging actions at national, transnational and sub-national levels. Practitioners and scholars are, thus, increasingly arguing that also the root causes of the problem must be addressed – the mindset (or paradigm) out of which the climate emergency has arisen. Against this background, we investigate decision-makers’ views of the need for a different mindset and inner qualities that can support negotiating and activating climate action, along with factors that could enable such a mindset shift. Data were collected during participatory workshops run at the 25th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP25) in 2019, and comprise surveys, as well as social media communication and semi-structured interviews with COP attendees. Our results underline vast agreement among participants regarding the need for a mindset shift that can support new ways of communication and collaboration, based on more relational modes of knowing, being and acting. They also suggest the emergence of such a mindset shift across sectors and contexts, but not yet at the collective and systems levels. Finally, they highlight the importance of transformative skills and the need for experimental, safe spaces. The latter are seen as a visible manifestation and enabler that can support agency for change through shared self-reflection, experience and practice. We present a transformative skills framework, and conclude with further research needs and policy recommendations. © 2020 The Authors","Beliefs; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Conference of the parties; Inner capacities; Inner qualities; Inner transformation; Mindsets; Paradigm shift; Paris agreement; Personal sphere of transformation; Relationality; Subjectivity; Sustainable development; Values; Worldviews","adult; climate change; conference paper; France; human; interpersonal communication; physician; semi structured interview; skill; social media; sustainable development; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087109014

Wildlife (including fish) are chronically exposed to PACs through air, water, sediment, soil, and/or dietary routes. Exposures are highest near industrial or urban sites, such as aluminum smelters and oil sands mines, or near natural sources such as forest fires. This review assesses the exposure and toxicity of PACs to wildlife, with a focus on the Canadian environment. Most published field studies measured PAC concentrations in tissues of invertebrates, fish, and birds, with fewer studies of amphibians and mammals. In general, PAC concentrations measured in Canadian wildlife tissues were under the benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) guideline for human consumption. Health effects of PAC exposure include embryotoxicity, deformities, cardiotoxicity, DNA damage, changes to DNA methylation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired reproduction. Much of the toxicity of PACs can be attributed to their bioavailability, and the extent to which certain PACs are transformed into more toxic metabolites by cytochrome P450 enzymes. As most mechanistic studies are limited to individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly BaP, research on other PACs and PAC-containing complex mixtures is required to understand the environmental significance of PAC exposure and toxicity. Additional work on responses to PACs in amphibians, reptiles, and semi-aquatic mammals, and development of molecular markers for early detection of biological responses to PACs would provide a stronger biological and ecological justification for regulating PAC emissions to protect Canadian wildlife. © 2020This paper reviews literature on the exposure and effects of PACs on wildlife and ecosystems, with a special focus on Canadian invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and small mammals. © 2020","Cytochrome P450; Embryotoxicity; Forest fire; Petroleum products; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)","Alkylation; Aromatization; Barium compounds; Biochemistry; Birds; Cell proliferation; Deforestation; Ecology; Fish; Histology; Mammals; Metabolites; Oil sands; Tissue; Toxicity; Urban growth; Biological response; Cytochrome p450 enzymes; Endocrine disruption; Environmental significance; Mechanistic studies; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Toxic metabolites; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; heat shock protein 70; lipid peroxide; polycyclic aromatic compound; superoxide dismutase; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic hydrocarbon; amphibian; bird; ecosystem response; fish; invertebrate; PAH; pollution effect; pollution exposure; reptile; small mammal; toxicity; alkylation; animal tissue; bioavailability; biotransformation; Canada; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA methylation; embryo; embryotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental management; enzyme metabolism; halogenation; lipid peroxidation; lipophilicity; methylation; molecular weight; nonhuman; oxidative stress; rat; reproduction; Review; sedimentation; signal transduction; tissue distribution; wildlife; animal; environmental monitoring; oil and gas field; wild animal; Canada; Amphibia; Aves; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia; Animals; Animals, Wild; Canada; Environmental Monitoring; Oil and Gas Fields; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Polycyclic Compounds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086867845

One of the cornerstones of that plan is the development of a greenhouse gas inventory and emission reduction opportunity assessment for Ho Chi Minh City. This provides a basis for the roadmap towards green growth in Ho Chi Minh City, one of Vietnam's largest cities. Marginal costs of 38 emission reduction measures were determined for two main economy sectors, namely energy (32 measures) and agriculture, forestry, and other land use (6 measures). From that analysis, a marginal abatement cost curve was compiled for the energy sector. The total emission reduction opportunities available in 2020 are estimated to be 8.97 million tCO2e, which represents a 14.7% reduction compared to business as usual. Even when the city only implements reduction measures with negative marginal costs (i.e., abatement that saves money), significant reductions of 5.25 MtCO2e (8.6% reduction compared to business as usual) would be achieved. There are significant similarities in abatement opportunities between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, Vietnam's capital.

Thereafter, the number of infected people increased rapidly, and the outbreak turned into a national crisis, with infected individuals all over the country. The COVID-19 global pandemic produced extreme changes in human behavior that affected air quality. Human mobility and production activities decreased significantly, and many regions recorded significant reductions in air pollution. The goal of our investigation was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the concentrations of the main air pollutants in the urban area of Palermo (Italy). In this study, the trends in the average concentrations of CO, NO2, O3, and PM10 in the air from 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020 were compared with the corresponding average values detected at the same monitoring stations in Palermo during the previous five years (2015–2019). During the lockdown period (10 March–30 April), we observed a decrease in the concentrations of CO, NO2, and particulate matter (PM)10, calculated to be about 51%, 50%, and 45%, respectively.

The EU28 NDC includes a commitment for emission reductions in 2030 but also refers to an economy-wide effort towards 2050 so as to contribute effectively to the long-term mitigation of climate change. We discuss the respective EU28 emission pathways in the context of a well below 2 °C global climate stabilization target and estimate the macroeconomic impacts for the EU28 economy by considering alternative levels of climate action for major non-EU emitters. We employ two models, the technology-rich energy system model PRIMES, and the global large-scale hybrid computable general equilibrium model GEM-E3. The two models are soft linked so as to ensure a consistent and robust framework of analysis. We find that emission reductions in the energy supply sector are dominant up to 2030 while transport takes the lead in 2050. Transport and non-CO2 emissions are the main remaining emitting sources in 2050. We present the key decarbonization pillars and confirm that the impacts on the EU28 economy largely depend on the level of mitigation action adopted by the rest of the world and by the relative carbon intensity across regions. Due to asymmetric ambition of climate policies, a global implementation of NDCs results in economic losses for the EU28 when compared with a “pre-Paris” policy reference scenario, despite positive effects on energy-intensive and clean technology exports. On the contrary, we find that the region registers economic gains in the case of coordinated 2 °C global climate action. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Decarbonization; Emission control; Large scale systems; Losses; Stabilization; Carbon intensity; Clean technologies; Climate stabilization; Computable general equilibrium model; Emission reduction; Emitting sources; Energy system model; Macroeconomic impact; Climate change; climate change; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; global climate; macroeconomics; policy implementation; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065412653

Here, we review the recent literature on future air quality scenarios and projected changes in effects on human health, crops and ecosystems. While there is overlap in the scenarios and models used for future projections of air quality and climate effects on human health and crops, similar efforts have not been widely conducted for ecosystems. Few studies have conducted joint assessments across more than one sector. Improvements in future air quality effects on human health are seen in emission reduction scenarios that are more ambitious than current legislation. Larger impacts result from changing particulate matter (PM) abundances than ozone burdens. Future global health burdens are dominated by changes in the Asian region. Expected future reductions in ozone outside of Asia will allow for increased crop production. Reductions in PM, although associated with much higher uncertainty, could offset some of this benefit. The responses of ecosystems to air pollution and climate change are long-term, complex, and interactive, and vary widely across biomes and over space and time. Air quality and climate policy should be linked or at least considered holistically, and managed as a multi-media problem.

However, chemical fractionation can potentially significantly alter this ratio and in fact observations of carbon fractionation within the same galaxy has been found to vary from species to species. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the carbon fractionation for selected abundant carbon-bearing species in order to determine the conditions that may lead to a spread of the 12C/13C ratio in external galaxies. We find that carbon fractionation is sensitive to almost all the physical conditions we investigated, it strongly varies with time for all species but CO, and shows pronounced differences across species. Finally, we discuss our theoretical results in the context of the few observations of the 12C/13C in both local and higher redshift galaxies. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","galaxies: ISM; ISM: abundances; ISM: molecules",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096956044

The work is intended as a standalone book in a series covering the activities of the Internet of Things European Research Cluster (IERC) - including research, technological innovation, validation, and deployment. The book chapters build on the developments and innovative ideas put forward by the IERC, the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme and the IoT European Security and Privacy Projects - presenting new concepts, ideas and future IoT trends and ways of integrating open data frameworks and IoT marketplaces into larger deployment ecosystems. The IoT and Industrial Internet of Things technologies are moving towards hyperautomated solutions - combining hyperconnectivity, artificial intelligence (AI), distributed ledger technologies and virtual/augmented extended reality, with edge computing and deep edge processing becoming an assertive factor across industries for implementing intelligent distributed computing resources and data to keep the efficient data exchange and processing local to reduce latency, exploit the sensing/actuating capabilities and enable greater autonomy. Expanding the adoption of consumer, business, industrial and tactile IoT requires further development of hyperautomated IoT concepts for collaborative solutions involving machines and humans to expand augmented creativity at the application level using AI to optimise the industrial processes and progress towards a symbiotic economy based on distributed federated cloud/edge infrastructure allowing resource sharing in the form of computing, memory and analytics capabilities. The advances of autonomous IoT applications delivering services in real-time encompasses development in servitisation, robotisation, automation and hyperconnectivity, which are essential for the rapid evolution of industrial enterprises in the new digital era. The rise of digital twins integrated into IoT platforms as fully interactive elements embedded into the simulation and optimisation environment, as well as the embedment of AI techniques and methods, enhances the accuracy and performance of models in the various IoT and Industrial Internet of Things applications. The convergence of technologies to provide scalable, interoperable IoT-enabled applications pushed the requirements for high bandwidth, low latency and robust and dependable connectivity to support the industry's demand for deeper integration and improved analytics to deliver sustainable competitive advantage products and services, enabling digital transformation with a focus on new business models. Safety and security are interlinked for the next wave of IoT technologies and applications and combined, prove a greater value for rapid adoption. The new IoT technologies are essential for facilitating sustainable development, reducing energy consumption and, by supporting the optimisation of products and processes, mitigating unnecessary carbon emissions - thereby reducing the environmental impact through real-time data collection, analysis, exchange, and processing. © 2020 River Publishers.

Simultaneously, it is a strategic sector for the economy but generates increasing debate in the community regarding the social aspects mainly related to the use of resources and the food-feed competition of livestock involving the reduction of human-edible crops. In this general framework, this study aims to compare four different dairy farming scenarios characterized by different use of environmental resources in the Alpine area, considering as a case study the production of the Toma di Lanzo cheese (a traditional cheese produced in the mountainous regions of Piedmont—Northwest Italy). The study envisaged the integrated use of three methodologies: Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing and the assessment of human-edible feed conversion efficiency to jointly analyze environmental, economic and social aspects. The main results of this research highlighted how the utilization of local breeds, which maximize the efficiency in the use of territory resources, such as grasslands in a mountain environment, allowed dairy production to reduce emissions, when compared to the high-input traditional breeding systems. Although the mountain livestock systems have several critical issues mainly linked to social factors such as low generational turnover, work schedules, modest life quality of families, it is however possible to earn more income than in lowland scenarios. At the same time, this production system allows the Toma di Lanzo cheese-making heritage to be preserved. This mountain pasture cheese, to which superior organoleptic and nutritional characteristics are attributable, when compared to cheeses from the valley floor, incorporates traditional values, a link to the territory and the transmission of knowledge. With reference to food-feed competition in livestock involving the reduction of the use of human-edible crops and feedstuffs in animal diets, we found that grazing and grass-based feeding systems were one of the most sustainable ways to produce milk. © Copyright © 2020 Verduna, Blanc, Merlino, Cornale and Battaglini.","cheese production; dairy farming; human-edible feed conversion efficiency; life cycle assessment; life cycle costing; mountain environment; sustainability","alpine tundra; Article; breeding method; carbon footprint; case study; cheese; cheesemaking; competition; cost; dairying; economic aspect; economic evaluation; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; family; feed efficiency; generational turnover; grassland; grazing; human edible feed conversion efficiency; income; information dissemination; intermethod comparison; knowledge; life cycle assessment; life cycle costing; livestock; nutritional parameters; organoleptic property; pasture; quality of life; social aspect; toma di lanzo cheese; work schedule",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093920410

Applied economics responds to diversity by a variety in technologies, institutions, products, policies, for meeting the demands of differentiated actors. Nevertheless, neoclassical economics states that climate change can be regulated most efficiently by installing a global uniform carbon price. This position is based on many assumptions, such as full substitutability, negligible transaction costs, and boundless scale economies. However, diversity is relevant for designing well functioning carbon pricing policies. Diversity is a gradual property for cataloging homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. When categories are incompatible, substitutability is problematic, and transaction costs are high, respecting diversity is beneficial, not costly. Negating heterogeneity (strong diversity) by applying uniform approaches triggers subsequent remedial ad-hoc policies to anyhow address relevant differences. Ex-ante consideration of diversity prevents the flaws of remedial policies. By opting for diverse, case specific financial incentives, economics would well partner with other social sciences in search for realistic, effective, efficient and just climate policies. The global uniform carbon price is a theoretical concept, unlikely to ever be realized, hence escaping decisive assessment of its actual performance. We suggest a substitute indicator for UNFCCC monitoring of countries’ efforts to financially incentivize climate actions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Diversity; Emissions trading; Financial incentives; Global uniform carbon pricing","carbon; Article; climate; climate change; commodification; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; environmental policy; human; priority journal; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087723694

To overcome these limitations a NonLinear Quadratic Regulator (NLQR) system for the High Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (HP-EGR) loop of a turbocharged diesel engine has been developed to control the intake O2 concentration and the Intake MAnifold Pressure (IMAP). This model-based control approach exploits the prediction of two dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to compute the command actions for the HP-EGR valve and VGT (Variable Geometry Turbocharger) rack position. Engine speed, engine load, HP-EGR and VGT valves positions together with the intake O2 concentration and IMAP feedbacks are the inputs used by the RNN to compute the predictions. In order to select the next HP-EGR and VGT control actions the effect of different command combinations, retrieved from a discretized action space, are evaluated through a quadratic objective function to be minimized. Two different transient profiles have been used to test the designed control system against the steady-state map approach. The developed control system has shown a satisfactory performance improvement over the map control. Therefore it is suitable for the subsequent assessment on the real engine. © 2020 Institute of Control, Robotics, and Systems - ICROS.","Diesel engine; Neural Network models; NonLinear Quadratic Regulator control; Pollutant reduction","Computational geometry; Control systems; Diesel engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Internet protocols; Recurrent neural networks; Control actions; Dynamic recurrent neural networks; Model based controls; Pollutant emission; Quadratic objective functions; Quadratic regulators; Turbocharged diesel engine; Variable geometry turbocharger; Pressure control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098063089

This consideration offers a good alternative to the standard empirical quantile mapping (EQM) method during colder climate states in which the orography strongly deviates from the present-day state, e.g. during glacial conditions such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Such a method is needed in the event that absolute precipitation fields are used, e.g. as input for glacier modelling or to assess potential human occupation and according migration routes in past climate states. The new bias correction and its performance are presented for Switzerland using regional climate model simulations at 2km resolution driven by global climate model outputs obtained under perpetual 1990 and LGM conditions. Comparing the present-day regional climate model simulation with observations, we find a strong seasonality and, especially during colder months, a height dependence of the bias in precipitation. Thus, we suggest a three-step correction method consisting of (i) a separation into different orographic characteristics, (ii) correction of very low intensity precipitation, and (iii) the application of an EQM, which is applied to each month separately. We find that separating the orography into 400m height intervals provides the overall most reasonable correction of the biases in precipitation. The new method is able to fully correct the seasonal precipitation bias induced by the global climate model. At the same time, some regional biases remain, in particular positive biases over high elevated areas in winter and negative biases in deep valleys and Ticino in winter and summer. A rigorous temporal and spatial cross-validation with independent data exhibits robust results. The new bias-correction method certainly leaves some drawbacks under present-day conditions. However, the application to the LGM demonstrates that it is a more appropriate correction compared to the standard EQM under highly different climate conditions as the latter imprints present-day orographic features into the LGM climate. © 2020 Author(s).",,"empirical analysis; glacier advance; Last Glacial Maximum; orography; precipitation assessment; sampling bias; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; Switzerland; Ticino",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095431086

It is considered by the National Development Plan of Colombia 2018e2022 as an economic agent that boosts development in the region and one that requires the strengthening of its policies and environmental liability. Therefore, this paper aims to show the importance of implementing methodologies based on the logic of nature (exergy) that objectively indicate the environmental impact of an extractive gold activity, such as open-pit gold mining. The extractive activity or process to be studied consists of the following stages: topsoil removal by using machinery and explosives to create craters and to access the mineral present in the subsoil; the physical transformation of the extracted material through crushing, grinding, gravimetric separation, flotation, leaching, adsorption, elution, and electrodeposition, along with smelting and casting to obtain gold and silver ingots. Thus, this paper analyzes the exergy performance of each unit process of the open-pit extractive process. The obtained results are used in a sensitivity analysis, which determines the system efficiency, by assuming the increase of gold in the extracted material in the exploitation stage, by using the same supplies and input of the current process. In other cases, the open-pit mining process is analyzed by changing its technologies in the mining process and assuming that this change reduces the inlet ore to 60%, by discarding 40% of material without gold and by reducing supply consumption by 25%. By improving the system efficiency, the exergy destroyed is reduced and the emissions to the environment diminish. Therefore, this method may be implemented as a basic guideline when it comes to decision-making processes in the planning of the extractive processes by integrating the environmental component with gold production. © Central Mining Institute, Katowice, Poland.

Carlos III s/n, Toledo, 45071, Spain","The enhanced vulnerability of insular regions to climate change has been recently recognized by the European Union, which highlights the importance of undertaking adaptation and mitigation strategies according to the specific singularities of the islands. In general, islands are highly dependent on energy imports which, in turn, feature a marked seasonal demand. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in these regions can therefore fulfill a twofold objective: (i) to increase the renewable energy share for global decarbonization and (ii) to reduce the external energy dependence for isolated (or interconnected) systems in which this can only be achieved with an increase of the renewable energy share. However, the increase in renewable technologies makes energy generation more dependent on future climate and its variability. The main aim of this study is to analyze future projections of wind and photovoltaic potential, as well as energy productivity droughts, on the main Euro-Mediterranean islands. Due to the limitations in land surface available in the islands for the installation of renewable energy capacity, the analysis is extended to offshore wind and photovoltaic energy, which may have an important role in the future increases of renewable energy share. To that end, we use climate variables from a series of simulations derived from Euro-CORDEX (Coordinated Downscaling Experiment) simulations for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A special effort is performed to normalize projected changes and the associated uncertainties. The obtained normalized changes make it easier the intercomparison between the results obtained in the different islands and constitute condensed and valuable information that aims to facilitate climate-related policy decision making for decarbonization and Blue Growth in the islands. © 2020 by the authors.

Plant-based meat alternatives, designed to mimic the sensory experience and nutritional value of red meat, have recently been introduced into consumer markets. Plant-based meats are marketed under the premise of environmental and human health benefits and are aimed appeal to a broad consumer base. Meat production is critiqued for its overuse of water supplies, landscape degradation, and greenhouse gas emission, and depending on production practices, environmental footprints may be lower with plant-based meat alternatives. Life-cycle analyses suggest that the novel plant-based meat alternatives have an environmental footprint that may be lower than beef finished in feedlots, but higher than beef raised on well-managed pastures. In this review, we discuss the nutritional and ecological impacts of eating plant-based meat alternatives vs. animal meats. Most humans fall on a spectrum of omnivory: they satisfy some nutrient requirements better from plant foods, while needs for other nutrients are met more readily from animal foods. Animal foods also facilitate the uptake of several plant-derived nutrients (zinc and iron), while plant nutrients can offer protection against potentially harmful compounds in cooked meat. Thus, plant and animal foods operate in symbiotic ways to improve human health. The mimicking of animal foods using isolated plant proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals likely underestimates the true nutritional complexity of whole foods in their natural state, which contain hundreds to thousands of nutrients that impact human health. Novel plant-based meat alternatives should arguably be treated as meat alternatives in terms of sensory experience, but not as true meat replacements in terms of nutrition. If consumers wish to replace some of their meat with plant-based alternatives in the diet (a “flexitarian approach”) this is unlikely to negatively impact their overall nutrient status, but this also depends on what other foods are in their diet and the life stage of the individual. © Copyright © 2020 van Vliet, Kronberg and Provenza.","climate change; diet; meat; nutrition; plant-based meat; sustainability; vegetarian and non-vegetarian diet",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093840978

Atmospheric N deposition impacts ecosystem C storage, but the direction of response varies between systems. Phosphorus limitation may constrain C storage response to N, hence P application to increase plant productivity and thus C sequestration has been suggested. We revisited a 23-yr-old field experiment where N and P had been applied to upland heath, a widespread habitat supporting large soil C stocks. At 10 yr after the last nutrient application we quantified long-term changes in vegetation composition and in soil and vegetation C and P stocks. Nitrogen addition, particularly when combined with P, strongly influenced vegetation composition, favouring grasses over Calluna vulgaris, and led to a reduction in vegetation C stocks. However, soil C stocks did not respond to nutrient treatments. We found 40% of the added P had accumulated in the soil. This study showed persistent effects of N and N + P on vegetation composition, whereas effects of P alone were small and showed recovery. We found no indication that P application could mitigate the effects of N on vegetation or increase C sequestration in this system. © 2020 The Authors.

In order to characterize the seasonal dynamics of hydrochemical characteristics of surface water, a total of 72 surface water samples were collected from 24 locations in the Limbang River and its tributaries for three different sampling periods (November 2016 (S1), March 2017 (S2), and September 2017 (S3)). Physical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity), nutrients (sulfate, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate), major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, HCO3), and trace metals (Co, Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu) were analyzed using standard procedures and the results were statistically processed through Pearson correlation and factor analysis. Gibbs diagram, Piper plot, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and saturation index of carbonate minerals were also employed to determine the geochemical characteristics and dominant processes operating in the river basin. Higher mean EC value of 129.28 μS/cm in S3 and higher mean pH (6.77) in S1 were observed. The results show spatial and temporal variations in analyzed parameters but are within tolerable limits of the Malaysian water quality and WHO standards. A decreasing order of HCO3- &gt; Cl- &gt; Na+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt; Ca2+ &gt; K+ was noted in the mean concentration of major ions, whereas the mean concentration of trace metals follows the order of Fe &gt; Ni &gt; Pb &gt; Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Co &gt; Cu &gt; Cd. Higher mean concentration of HCO3 (47.09 mg/L) in S2 and higher mean concentration of Fe (1.77 mg/L) in S1 were observed. The Pearson correlation test (r ≥ ± 0.70) shows varying relationships among the parameters and is different in three sampling periods. Piper diagram revealed two distinct chemical facies such as mixed Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- and Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- irrespective of seasons. At the same time, Gibbs plots indicated dominant control of precipitation (rainfall) with an influence of mineral dissolution over the surface water chemistry. An increasing trend of log pCO2 values from upstream to downstream shows the direct recharge of rainwater with lower log pCO2 values in the upstream side and mixed water with higher log pCO2 in the downstream side. The saturation index indicates the under-saturated state of the carbonate minerals in the order of SIMagnesite &gt; SICalcite &gt; SIAragonite &gt; SIDolomite and suggesting the effect of dilution through monsoon rainfall. Factor analysis revealed the dominance of high sediment load in response to severe rainfall, weathering, leaching and dissolution of bed rocks, hydrolysis of organic nitrogen through decomposition of microorganisms, and the aerobic decomposition of organic nitrogenous matter and atmospheric fallout as the major contributors of surface water geochemistry. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Factor analysis; Hydrochemistry; Limbang; Saturation index; Weathering","climate change; concentration (composition); fallout; hydrochemistry; physicochemical property; precipitation (chemistry); rainfall; river basin; river water; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; trace metal; Borneo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091157220

Emission reduction and, more generally, ecosystem restoration can be enhanced by raising the water table using canal or drain blocks. When restoring large areas, the number of blocks becomes limited by the available resources, which raises the following question: in which exact positions should a given number of blocks be placed in order to maximize the water table rise throughout the area? There is neither a simple nor an analytic answer. The water table response is a complex phenomenon that depends on several factors, such as the topology of the canal network, site topography, peat hydraulic properties, vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions. We developed a new method to position the canal blocks based on the combination of a hydrological model and heuristic optimization algorithms. We simulated 3 d dry downs from a water saturated initial state for different block positions using the Boussinesq equation, and the block configurations maximizing water table rise were searched for by means of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. We applied this approach to a large drained peatland area (931 km2) in Sumatra, Indonesia.

It accounts for a large proportion of Vietnam’s anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a paddy water management practice recognized as a promising CH4 mitigation option and may increase rice yield. However, AWD may also increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and its implementation is troublesome for farmers. Therefore, a simplified form of AWD (referred to here as “multiple drainage,” MD) is often adopted in An Giang Province, where full dike systems are prevailing, in the Mekong Delta. To evaluate the effects of MD on rice yield and emissions of CH4 and N2O in An Giang Province, we carried out 2-year field experiments at three remote sites each surrounded by the dike systems. We compared MD and continuous flooding (CF) at each site under conventional agronomic practices through six consecutive rice growing seasons. Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured by a closed chamber method. MD was achieved with varying degrees of success at each site, except during heavy rainfall events. Rice yield was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased (by 22%) in MD plots relative to CF plots. Seasonal total CH4 emissions were significantly reduced (by 35%) in MD plots, but no difference was found in N2O emissions. These results indicate that MD, if adequately implemented, can increase rice yield and decrease CH4 emissions in paddy fields in An Giang Province, Vietnam. © 2021, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.","Alternate wetting and drying; Full dike systems; Greenhouse gas; Triple cropping systems","Levees; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Water management; Agronomic practices; Closed-chamber method; Field experiment; Management practices; Methane emissions; Mitigation options; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); WETTING AND DRYING; Hydraulic structures; agricultural emission; crop yield; drainage; growing season; implementation process; methane; paddy field; rice; An Giang; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110301538

Recent studies examined the impact of dietary strategies on enteric methane emissions, however, tradeoffs between enteric methane and manure related GHG emissions have not been determined. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the carry-over effects of dairy cow breed and diet on manure composition and manure GHG emissions during storage and after field application. The GHG emissions were measured using static chamber method for 50 days (d) during storage and 50-d after field application (30-d in the fall and 20-d in the following spring) of manure collected from four Holstein and four Jersey cows fed either alfalfa silage or corn silage based diets containing low forage neutral detergent fiber (FNDF) or high FNDF. None of the interactions among treatment factors were significant (P &gt; 0.10). Manure composition was affected by both FNDF level and FNDF source but not cow breed. For example, manure pH was lower for low FNDF-fed than high FNDF-fed cows and concentrations of organic matter, total carbon, and neutral detergent fiber were greater in manure of corn silage-fed than alfalfa silage-fed cows. Except for starch (which was in low concentration), all the measured manure characteristics changed during the storage period. Treatments did not affect either hourly CO2, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, nor cumulative emissions (over 50-d of storage or over 50-d after land application), except for a tendency (P &lt; 0.10) to emit 22% lower manure CO2 by high FNDF-fed cows than low FNDF-fed cows. Cumulative methane and nitrous oxide emissions were respectively 25 times greater and 19 times lower during the 50-d manure storage period than the subsequent 50-d after field application. Cumulative field nitrous oxide emission was 17 times greater during spring than fall. Depending on mode of expression (emissions per kg manure or per kg milk or per cow basis), manure of low FNDF-fed cows tended to emit 51 to 72% greater 100-d (combined storage and field) non-CO2 GHG emissions than high FNDF-fed cows. However, in this study, neither cow breed nor FNDF source affected the 100-d combined non-CO2 GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alfalfa silage; Corn silage; Forage level; Forage source; Holstein; Jersey","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Dairies; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Springs (components); Carry-over effects; Cumulative emissions; Enteric methane emissions; Land applications; Low concentrations; Neutral detergent fiber; Nitrous oxide emissions; Static chamber method; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086630898

Such a negative impact is the ammonia waste produced that pollutes the environment and can cause even the death of aquatic biota. One way to reduce this waste is to utilize the bacterial community that exists on bamboo biofilms. The purpose of this study is to isolate and identify bacteria on bamboo biofilms and analyze the ability of these bacteria to degrade ammonia. The bacterial isolation method used was poured plate. The bacterial identification was carried out biochemically and molecularly (16S rRNA), and the analysis of ammonia was conducted using the Nessler method. The results of sample isolation showed 3 bacterial isolates (A1, A2, and A3) in the form of coccus and bacilli. Biochemical identification shows that the 3 isolates can produce the cytochrome oxidase enzyme and catalase enzymes, with positive results in the oxidase and catalase tests. The molecular identification results show that isolate A1 has a similarity of 94.35% with Bacillus subtilis, the sample code A2 has a similarity of 99.22% with Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, and the sample code A3 has a similarity of 91.16% with bacteria included in the genus Sphingomonas. According to the results of the analysis of ammonia, Bacillus subtilis reduced ammonia levels by 2.03%, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus by 4.12% and Sphingomonas did not reduce ammonia levels. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

The constructed MRF enabled prediction of the optimum seed source to achieve good performance in terms of height growth at every planting site on a fine scale. Background and objectives: Because forest tree species are adapted to the local environment, local seeds are empirically considered as the best sources for planting. However, in some cases, local seed sources show lower performance in height growth than that showed by non-local seed sources. Tree improvement programs aim to identify seed sources for obtaining high-quality timber products by performing provenance trials. Materials and methods: Range-wide provenance trials for one of the most important silvicultural species, Abies sachalinensis, were established in 1980 at nine transplanting experimental sites. We constructed an MRF to estimate the responses of tree height at 10 years after planting at eight climatic variables at 1 km × 1 km resolution. The model was applied for prediction of tree height throughout Hokkaido Island. Results: Our model showed that four environmental variables were major factors affecting height growth—winter solar radiation, warmth index, maximum snow depth, and spring solar radiation. A tree height prediction map revealed that local seeds showed the best performance except in the southernmost region and several parts of northern regions. Moreover, the map of optimum seed provenance suggested that deployment of distant seed sources can outperform local sources in the southernmost and northern regions. Conclusions: We predicted that local seeds showed optimum growth, whereas non-local seeds had the potential to outperform local seeds in some regions. Several deployment options were proposed to improve tree growth. © 2020 by the authors.

Remote sensing data from multiple satellites covering the 2003–2019 period were analyzed. The planting dates in rain-fed paddies ranged from April to August, with large spatial variations and year-to-year fluctuations. In years when planting was suppressed in April and May, planting was extensively enhanced in June and August compared to normal years, and vice versa. Over the northeastern side of Tonle Sap Lake and south of Phnom Penh city, the areas planted in April and May were found to have positive correlations with rainfall and soil moisture, suggesting that wetter-than-average conditions encouraged farmers to plant earlier in the season. In contrast, this relationship was unclear on the western side of Tonle Sap Lake, where the rainfall amounts were larger throughout the year than in other areas in Cambodia. In this region, the relationship between the planting area and soil water availability was either unclear or was even slightly negative from June to August. Since more frequent dry spells have been detected after the onset of the rainy season in recent years, further studies and disseminations of potential changes in dry spells are important for the agronomic adaptation of planting dates under climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agronomic adaptation; AMSR; Empirical knowledge; GSMaP; MODIS; Planting date","Agriculture; Climate change; Drought; Lakes; Plants (botany); Rain; Remote sensing; Empirical knowledge; Multiple satellites; Planting areas; Positive correlations; Potential change; Remote sensing data; Soil water availability; Spatial variations; Soil moisture; adaptive management; farmers knowledge; paddy field; plantation; rainfall; rainfed agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; soil moisture; Cambodia; Phnom Penh; Tonle Sap Lake; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109255252

We calculated the energy spectra of secondary electrons generated along carbon ion tracks in liquid water in the Bragg peak region. The calculation was done using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS) in carbon track structure mode. This mode enables simulation of inelastic collisions along a carbon ion track based on the cross sections considered in the Monte Carlo code KURBUC. To understand the biomolecular dissociation processes in our previous MeV-SIMS experiments with microdroplet targets of glycine solution, we calculated the collision spectra of secondary electrons produced near liquid surfaces using PHITS. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the secondary electron energy and formation of positive and negative glycine fragments. The results showed that the formation of methylene amine cations is caused by secondary electrons with energies of 13–100 eV. The formation of glycine-related negative ions such as cyanide anion, formate anion, and deprotonated glycine was found to be caused by low-energy (less than 13 eV) secondary electrons. These ions are known products of dissociative electron attachment.

The structure of YtfE has a two-domain architecture, with a diiron-containing C-terminal domain linked to an N-terminal domain, in which the function of the latter is enigmatic. Here, by using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, we show that YtfE exists in two conformational states, one of which has not been reported. Under high osmotic stress, YtfE adopts a homogeneous conformation (C state) similar to the known crystal structure. In a regular buffer, the N-terminal domain switches between the C state and a previously unidentified conformation (C′ state), the latter of which has more space at the domain interface to allow the trafficking of NO molecules and thus is proposed to be a functionally active state. The conformational switch between the C and C′ states is pivotal for facilitating NO access to the diiron core. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Conformations; Crystal structure; Interface states; Magnetic moments; C-terminal domains; Conformational state; Conformational switches; Domain interfaces; High osmotic stress; Iron-sulfur clusters; N-terminal domains; Two-domain architecture; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093539111

The Ag nanopillars have been grown by glancing angle deposition with DC magnetron sputtering. Some samples have been covered by a gold capping layer to reduce oxidation and aging effects. The secondary emission yield of the surfaces of these samples has been measured and compared to those of flat Ag and Au reference samples. The results show that high aspect ratio surface roughness at the nanometer scale significantly reduce the secondary emission yield of the surface. This reduction is more important for low electron energies, which is the most influencing energy range of electrons for multipactor. The multipactor region for the nanopillar coating presenting the best secondary emission yield properties has been simulated, finding practical suppression of multipactor effect. The high-frequency surface resistance of these samples has also been estimated from published computations for similar surface roughness patterns.

This work surveys the potential reduction in energy consumption and carbon emissions gained from RED integration in 20 medium-to-large-sized seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants spread worldwide. Using the validated RED system’s model from our research group, we quantified the grid mix share of the SWRO plant’s total energy demand and total emissions RED would abate (i) in its current state of development and (ii) if captured all salinity gradient exergy (SGE). Results indicate that more saline and warmer SWRO brines enhance RED’s net power density, yet source availability may restrain specific energy supply. If all SGE were harnessed, RED could supply ~40% of total desalination plants’ energy demand almost in all locations, yet energy conversion irreversibility and untapped SGE decline it to ~10%. RED integration in the most emission-intensive SWRO plants could relieve up to 1.95 kg CO2-eq m−3 . Findings reveal that RED energy recovery from SWRO concentrate effluents could bring desalination sector sizeable energy and emissions savings provided future advancements bring RED technology closer to its thermodynamic limit. © 2020 by the authors.

Sanitation approaches for these settings remain understudied, particularly regarding multidimensional social-ecological outcomes. Guided by a conceptual framework (developed in parallel with this study) re-envisioning sanitation as a human-derived resource system, here we characterize existing and alternative sanitation scenarios in an informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. Combining two core research approaches (household survey analysis, process modeling), we elucidate factors associated with user satisfaction and evaluate each scenario's resource recovery potential, economic implications, and environmental impacts. We find that existing user satisfaction is associated with factors including cleaning frequency, sharing, and type of toilets, and we demonstrate that alternative sanitation systems may offer multidimensional improvements over existing latrines, drying beds, and lagoons. Transitioning to anaerobic treatment could recover energy while reducing overall net costs by 26-65% and greenhouse gas emissions by 38-59%. Alternatively, replacing pit latrines with container-based facilities greatly improves recovery potential in most cases (e.g., a 2- to 4-fold increase for nitrogen) and reduces emissions by 46-79%, although costs increase. Overall, this work illustrates how our conceptual framework can guide empirical research, offering insight into sanitation for informal settlements and more sustainable resource systems.

In the last decade, many scientific studies have demonstrated how bioenergy crops have the potential to be grown profitably on this land and can therefore offer a source of income to local populations while contributing to achieving the targets of the new Renewable Energy Directive (REDII). In this context, the paper analyses the main agronomic and techno-economic aspects affecting the uptake of cellulosic ethanol or second generation (2G ethanol) production on MUC lands in the Ivankiv Region of Ukraine, a lower-middle income country, and in the Sulcis area of Sardinia in Italy, a high-income country. The use of MUC lands for the production of 2G ethanol mitigates negative impacts on food security by reducing the risk of indirect land use change (iLUC). The findings suggest that 2G ethanol would be produced at a cost of EUR 936/ton in Italy and EUR 758/ton in Ukraine, with a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Furthermore, the study describes the main barriers and obstacles to the market uptake of 2G ethanol and analyses the effects of existing policies on the economic feasibility of the fuel production in those countries. Current policies do not allow the production of 2G ethanol to be competitive on the market; the study highlights the need to provide consistent and stable long-term bioenergy policies, including but not limited to financial support, to facilitate market penetration and competitiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced biofuels; Circular economy; Marginal land; Renewable energy","Biofuels; Commerce; Crops; Economic analysis; Ethanol; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Bioenergy policies; Economic feasibilities; Indirect land-use changes; Market penetration; Middle-income countries; Renewable energies; Scientific studies; Substantial reduction; Cellulosic ethanol; bioenergy; biomass power; cellulose; energy market; European Union; food security; implementation process; profitability; technical efficiency; Italy; Sardinia; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089753076

Our findings show that the real GRP of each region will decline by 20–30% relative to 2005 given climate change in a society experiencing depopulation. Moreover, the national equivalent variation will decrease by 71.5 trillion yen, and the equivalent variation per capita will decrease by 812,000 yen in the case of mean value. On the other hand, long-term climate change has different impacts in each region and expands regional economic disparities. Also, to mitigate the influence of climate change, three simulations were carried out in three scenarios for an import policy, a technological innovation policy of rice, and a labor substitution policy. When evaluating the results, a technological innovation policy was preferable to an import policy and a labor substitution policy. Therefore, by including other rice crops and their increases, we must promote aggressive R&D investments for agricultural production from the early stage before being affected by global warming. © 2020, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.","Depopulating regional economy; Global warming-induced climate change; Import policy; Japan’s rice production; Labor substitution policy; Spatial CGE model; Technological innovation policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100612556

The use of smart technologies such as solar panels or cool roofs helps to reach energy and climate targets. This work presents a flexible methodology based on the use of geographical information systems that allow evaluating the potential use of roofs in a densely built-up context, estimating the roof areas that can be renovated or used to produce renewable energy. The methodology was applied to the case study of the city of Turin in Italy, a 3D roof model was designed, some scenarios were investigated, and priorities of interventions were established, taking into account the conditions of the urban landscape. The applicability of smart solutions was conducted as a support to the review of the Building Annex Energy Code of Turin, within the project ‘Re-Coding’, which aimed to update the current building code of the city. In addition, environmental, economic, and social impacts were assessed to identify the more effective energy efficiency measures. In the Turin context, using an insulated green roof, there was energy saving in consumption for heating up to 88 kWh/m2 /year and for cooling of 10 kWh/m2 /year, with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 193 tCO2eq /MWh/year and 14 tCO2eq /MWh/year, respectively.

About 85% of the cancer patients receiving particle therapy are irradiated with protons, which have physical advantages compared to X-rays but a similar biological response. In addition to the ballistic advantages, heavy ions present specific radiobiological features that can make them attractive for treating radioresistant, hypoxic tumors. An ideal heavy ion should have lower toxicity in the entrance channel (normal tissue) and be exquisitely effective in the target region (tumor). Carbon ions have been chosen because they represent the best combination in this direction. Normal tissue toxicities and second cancer risk are similar to those observed in conventional radiotherapy. In the target region, they have increased relative biological effectiveness and a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio compared to X-rays. Some radiobiological properties of densely ionizing carbon ions are so distinct from X-rays and protons that they can be considered as a different “drug” in oncology, and may elicit favorable responses such as an increased immune response and reduced angiogenesis and metastatic potential. The radiobiological properties of carbon ions should guide patient selection and treatment protocols to achieve optimal clinical results. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Traditionally, percentile-based indices, such as Q95 (the flow exceeded 95% of time), have been used by the hydrological community. Recently, the use of anomaly indices such as the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), a probability index-based approach adopted from the climatological community, has increased in popularity. The SSI can be calculated based on various (non)parametric methods. Up to now, there is no consensus which method to use. This study aims to raise awareness how the inherent sensitivity of the SSI to the used method influences derived drought characteristics. We compared SSI time series computed with seven different probability distributions and two fitting methods as well as with different nonparametric methods for 369 rivers across Europe. Results showed that SSI time series and associated drought characteristics are indeed sensitive to the method of choice. A resampling experiment demonstrated the sensitivity of the parametric SSI to properties of both the low and high end of the sample. Such sensitivities might hinder a fair comparison of drought in space and time and highlight the need for a clear recommendation which method to use. We could recommend overall suitable methods, for example, from the parametric approaches, the Tweedie distribution has several advantageous properties such as a low rejection rate (2%) and a lower bound at zero.

Nitrogen (N) fertiliser and commonly irrigation are integral to European vegetable cropping. Applications of N and irrigation are generally based on the experience of growers and technical advisors. Commonly, applications of both exceed crop requirements causing nitrate (NO3−) leaching. This can result in NO3− contamination of underlying aquifers, which can also contribute to eutrophication of natural surface water bodies. Various agronomic characteristics of vegetable crops such as shallow roots, low density planting and multiple cropping exacerbate the risk of NO3− leaching. Because of health and environmental concerns related to NO3− contaminated groundwater and eutrophication, there is appreciable and increasing societal pressure to reduce these environmental impacts. Additionally, there is increasing societal pressure to reduce emissions of phosphorus and plant protection products to water bodies. The European Union (EU) has passed several Directives to reduce contamination of water bodies from agriculture. Member States of the EU are required to comply and implement these legislations. European consumers are increasingly concerned that their food is produced with minimal environmental impact. Product certification schemes, with requirements or recommendation for N and irrigation management, are required in order to sell vegetables through many European supermarket chains. Because of legislative and consumer pressure, European vegetable growers will increasingly need to adopt science-based management approaches to reduce contamination of water bodies from their farming operations. The virtual Special Issue “Reducing contamination of water bodies from European vegetable production systems” consists of eight review papers that revise the options available to European vegetable growers. The issues facing particular European vegetable production systems are also addressed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquifer; European Union; Eutrophication; Horticulture; Nitrate contamination; Nitrate leaching; Phosphorus; Plant Protection Products",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085761856

This was a remarkable institutional adjustment for a regime that had always maintained a strict distinction between developed and developing countries and imposed meaningful obligations only on the former. To better understand this change, I look at the negotiations surrounding the issue of ‘differentiation’. The rising emissions of the emerging economies created a demand for institutional change on the part of key industrialized countries; however, they faced resistance from the increasingly assertive BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China). The challengers ultimately adopted strategic cooptation as their main negotiation strategy, offering compromises in the areas of climate finance and the legal form of new commitments. The climate case sheds light on the impact of power shifts in the domain of global environmental governance and illustrates that calls for change sometime comes from established rather than rising powers. © 2020 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096049106

It formulated the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid ) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme in 2015 to promote the manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle technology and to ensure sustainable growth of the same. However, the adoption rate was not satisfactory. One of the main reasons for the slow pace of adoption of electric vehicles by the customers was the lack of supporting charging infrastructure. In order to plan for charging stations, it is important to forecast the energy demand and design the system using renewable sources of energy.

One of the major issues that the aviation industry is facing today is pollution around the airports, which has an effect both on human health and on the climate. Although noise emissions do not have a direct impact on climate, variations in departure and arrival procedures influence both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions. In addition, design choices made to curb noise might increase CO2 and vice versa. Thus, multidisciplinary modeling is required for the assessment of these interdependencies for new aircraft and flight procedures. A particular aspect that has received little attention is the quantification of the extent to which early design choices influence the trades of CO2, NOx, and noise. In this study, a single aisle thrust class turbofan engine is optimized for minimum installed SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption). The installed SFC metric includes the effect of engine nacelle drag and engine weight. Close to optimal cycles are then studied to establish how variation in engine cycle parameters trade with noise certification and LTO (Landing and Take-Off) emissions. It is demonstrated that around the optimum a relatively large variation in cycle parameters is allowed with only a modest effect on the installed SFC metric. This freedom in choosing cycle parameters allows the designer to trade noise and emissions. Around the optimal point of a state-of-the-art single aisle thrust class propulsion system, a 1.7 dB reduction in cumulative noise and a 12% reduction in EINOx could be accomplished with a 0.5% penalty in installed SFC. © 2020 by the authors.

The modifications consist of adding rock-beds, ceramic grates or metal grates to open fires. In both traditional and modified stoves, cooking pots are supported over the fire using iron bars, which is a common practice in rural Vietnamese households. The modifications increase airflow through the combustion zone and improve combustion efficiency. The rocks and grate also decrease the distance between the fire and cooking pot, improving heat transfer. These low-cost modifications improve stove performance in many categories: 38–58% reduction in wood consumption and 51–84% reduction in emissions measured in WBTs; 34–37% reduction in wood consumption during simulated cooking with CCTs; and 31–45% reductions in per capita wood consumption measured during KPTs. Grates performed better than rock-beds in nearly all tests. Surveys implemented in parallel with KPTs indicated favorable user perceptions of all low-cost options. The modifications result in lower fuelwood consumption and emissions, resulting in social and environmental benefits, but they are unlikely reduce health impacts, which many policies and programs now prioritize. Nevertheless, there are numerous situations in which these options may be appropriate. In remote, rural or otherwise marginalized communities, clean cooking options may be inaccessible for the foreseeable future. Low-cost modifications like rock beds and grates, which require minimal training and changes in cooking habits, could reduce the impacts of open fires. Similarly, in places where clean cooking options are accessible, but stove “stacking” with open fires persists, these options could present a cost-effective way to achieve a “cleaner stack”. © 2020 The Authors","Cookstoves; Emissions; Fire grates; Fuelwood; Rock beds; Stove performance; Vietnam","Combustion; Cost effectiveness; Fires; Heating; Rocks; Rural areas; Stoves; Wood; Combustion efficiencies; Fuelwood consumption; Minimal training; Performance tests; Social and environmental; User perceptions; Water Boiling Test; Wood consumption; Cost reduction; combustion; cooking appliance; cost analysis; emission control; fuel consumption; fuelwood; health impact; rural population; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089848837

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most important pollutants in air, due to their elevated concentrations and toxicity. Plants can act as filters of PAHs and as “chemical reactors” for pollutant removal, therefore reducing air concentrations. Here, the first assessment of photo- vs. biodegradation of PAHs on leaves of urban trees is presented. A dynamic air-vegetation-soil model (SoilPlusVeg) was improved to simulate the fate of two representative PAHs with contrasting physico-chemical properties (phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene). Simulations were performed for two different environmental scenarios from Italy (Como and Naples), selected for their dissimilar meteorological parameters, plant species and emission levels. The effect of photo- and biodegradation on leaf concentrations and fluxes towards air and soil was investigated comparing deciduous (maple, cornel and hazelnut) and evergreen (holm oak) broadleaf woods. The results showed that biodegradation in the phyllosphere could not be neglected when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by urban trees, as this process contributed significantly to the reductions (up to 25% on average) in PAH leaf concentrations and fluxes to air and soil; however, the reductions revealed ample variations with time (up to more than two orders of magnitude) showing the dependence on meteorological parameters, air compartment structure, as well as type of woods. These findings permitted to improve the ecological realism of the simulations and obtain more accurate results when predicting organic contaminant uptake and release by plant leaves, including potential for food chain transfer and long-range transport. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Modelling; Pollutant; Tree; Urban","Air quality; Biodegradation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants (botany); Soil pollution; Soils; Air quality improvement; Elevated concentrations; Leaf concentrations; Long range transport; Meteorological parameters; Orders of magnitude; Organic contaminant; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; benzo[a]pyrene; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biodegradation; biological uptake; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; leaf; long range transport; PAH; photodegradation; physicochemical property; quantitative analysis; tree; urban area; air pollution; air quality; Article; biodegradation; biological model; comparative study; concentration (parameter); cornel; deciduous plant; food chain; hazelnut; Italy; maple; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; photodegradation; physical chemistry; plant leaf; prediction; priority journal; Quercus ilex; simulation; soil pollution; tree; urban area; vegetation; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; plant leaf; Campania [Italy]; Como; Italy; Lombardy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]; Acer; Corylus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Plant Leaves; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086395965

Species abundance distributions (SADs) are useful tools to describe patterns of commonness–rarity in ecological communities. Most studies assume field observations of species relative abundances are approximately equal to their true relative abundances, thus dismissing the potential for, and importance of unseen rare species. Here, we adopted the approach proposed by Chao et al. (Ecol, 96:1189–1201, 2015) to estimate the number and abundance of unseen species, and thus the true SADs, for tree species in 48 forest sites in Minas Gerais state, Brazil (4 rainforests, 35 semideciduous forests, and 9 deciduous forests). Also, we assessed the correlations between both unseen and rare species and sampling protocol and environment characteristics (climate, terrain, terrain heterogeneity). We found estimated true SADs invariably had higher species richness values than observed in the surveys, due to the increase in rare species. We estimate that up to 55.6% of tree species per site were unseen (8.5–55.6%), with an average of 26.6%. The estimated percentage of rare species per site was between 31.9% and 72.8%, with an average of 57.78%. We found rarity to be most strongly correlated with the percentage of unidentified trees, local terrain conditions and heterogeneity at site-level. Semideciduous forest and rainforest had similar higher percentages of unseen species (c. 27.2%) when compared to deciduous forests, probably due to the relatively higher local heterogeneity of these forests, which may provide more niches for rare species. Future studies should consider estimating true species abundances to better assess biodiversity. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó Zrt.","Forest ecology; Species abundance distribution; Species diversity; Species rarity; Tree species","abundance; biodiversity; deciduous forest; geographical distribution; heterogeneity; rainforest; rare species; species richness; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089686908

The district scale approach is one of the most effective approaches to accelerate this process of reducing the energy consumption in the building sector as increasing its renovation rates. In this context, the Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme of the IEA, IEA-EBC started in 2017 the project “Annex 75: Cost-Effective Building renovation at District Level Combining Energy Efficiency and Renewables” aiming to explore optimal opportunities of district renovations from a cost-benefit perspective. IEA Annex 75 is a co-operative effort of participants from 13 different countries: Austria, Belgium, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. In this paper, key elements of the methodology developed in Annex 75 project are presented. This methodology aims to facilitate the identification of optimal solutions in different European countries, enabling to explore similarities and differences amongst them, with a particular focus on the balance between energy efficiency measures and renewable energy measures. After a detailed description of the developed methodology, it is also applied to a case study located in Portugal and results obtained are analysed in detail. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the methodology for evaluating and identifying optimal solutions in renovations at district scale, as well as for successfully addressing the research questions investigated by the Annex 75 project. They also provide some insights regarding the specific case study, showing that, although district systems are not usual in the current Portuguese context, these centralised solutions in renovations at district level are cost-effective interventions that can lead to significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable primary energy use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-Effective; District renovation; Energy Efficiency in Districts; IEA-EBC Annex 75; Methodology; Renewable Energy in Districts","Buildings; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimal systems; Building renovation; Climate protection; Effective approaches; Efficiency measure; Energy in buildings; European Countries; Primary energy use; Research questions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087861727

However, and despite the actual growing of environment-related social movements, a kind of inertia still prevails in the social climate of our society. The media should play a key role in promoting, among common individuals, the adoption of new and more sustainable practices. However, it is argued that the media seems to be failing to effectively address the climate crisis. As such, this study aims to identify the main weaknesses of climate change media communication to further discuss possible opportunities of communication improvements. For that, 1609 news articles published between 2017 and 2018 in five European countries were analyzed in-depth, through quantitative content analysis. The news’ general characteristics, specifically reported themes, and the specificities of actors’ discourses were taken into account for the analysis. It was verified that the European media tends to report climate change by using distant (e.g., future-focused) and outcome (e.g., threatening messages) framings, based on non-resilient, scientific, and political narratives, whilst overlooking the role of civil society on adapting to climate change. These results demonstrate that instead of promoting society’s climate action, the media may be contributing to a widespread social apathy about the climate and the disengagement of individuals regarding environment-related matters. Evidence-based forms of improving the media’s communication on climate change will be further discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

The built landscape alone ranges from low-density, one-storey suburban settlements to high-density accumulations of skyscrapers. Models have repeatedly attempted to describe these various ‘city’ manifestations and to understand the processes that shape these spatial appearances and patterns. In this paper we analyze the morphological-spatial configurations of urban landscapes. We empirically examine 110 cities distributed around the globe. By using the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification scheme, we quantitatively describe morphologic variances of the built landscape within cities. We find seven city types (clusters) that capture the global diversity of spatial urban configurations. These seven types testify in parts to common geographic-cultural spaces. Some are largely congruent with well-known spatial units such as Europe or the Islamic world. In contrast to theoretical city models, however, we also find clusters that are more spatially complex such as African-American or Asian-African clusters. On the one hand, the study confirms that similar cultural, socio-economic, demographic or political conditions in fact do produce similar morphologic-spatial urban configurations. On the other hand, it also shows that there exist similar morphological configurations across geographic-cultural spaces. © 2020 The Authors","City models; Comparative urban research; Local Climate Zones; Patterns; Remote sensing; Urban morphology","cluster analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban development; urban morphology; urban planning; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086110653

The suite of instruments included a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), both coupled to a thermodenuder and an Aethalometer, a photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX405), and a single particle soot photometer (SP2). The average refractory black carbon (rBC) concentration during the campaign was 0.14 µg m−3, representing 3 % of the fine aerosol mass. The measured light absorption was two or more times higher than that of fresh black carbon (BC). Mie theory indicated that the absorption enhancement due to the coating of BC cores by nonrefractory material could explain only part of this absorption enhancement. The role of brown carbon (BrC) and other non-BC light-absorbing material was then investigated. A good correlation (R2 = 0.76) between the unexplained absorption and the concentration of extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) mass was found. © Author(s) 2020.

The use of renewable energy in heating can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A review of works in Russia on the use of solar energy in hot water supply and heating shows a constant trend towards an increase in the area of used solar collectors and the volume of the storage tank. This work looks for the maximum possible parameters for using solar energy in heating. The formula for calculating the temperature of a heat accumulator of the simplest spherical shape is given. A method is proposed for calculating the temperature of the heating agent in the system solar collector - water heat accumulator - an ordinary village house. The estimation of the calculation accuracy was made. As a first approximation, the total aperture area of solar collectors, the dimensions and mass of a water heat accumulator, which allow in regions with cold climates to completely replace the traditional fuel for heating a standard village house with solar energy, are determined. The overall efficiency of use of the annual energy of solar radiation has been obtained, and ways to further improve the efficiency of the solar heating system are shown. © 2020 IEEE.","greenhouse gases; heat accumulator; solar collector; solar heating","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic accumulators; Rural areas; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Water supply; Calculation accuracy; Heat accumulator; Hot-water supply; Overall efficiency; Solar heating system; Spherical shape; Traditional fuels; Use of renewable energies; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098918707

Only since the 90s of the last century, countries and international communities began to take concrete quantitative commitments to reduce emissions that directly affect climate change. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 [1], was ratified by the Russian Federation in 1994. To achieve the final goal of the said framework convention, a protocol was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto [2], signed by Russia in 1999 and ratified by it in 2004. According to Stage I of the Kyoto Protocol, the total average annual emissions of the Russian Federation must not exceed the average annual level of greenhouse gas emissions achieved in 1990. Penalties for withdrawal from the agreement and noncompliance were not provided. To achieve the final goal of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in connection with the end of the Kyoto Protocol in 2015, a climate agreement was adopted in Paris [3], signed by Russia in 2016 and ratified by it in 2019. According to the Paris Agreement, the volume of total average annual greenhouse gas emissions in the Russian Federation by 2030 should not exceed 75% of the 1990 baseline emissions. The so-called 'carbon tax', which was repeatedly mentioned in the documents of the Paris Climate Conference, was not included in the decisions of the Paris Agreement on climate change, but at present, the WTO rules do not directly prohibit the introduction of such taxes. In this regard, the methodology for choosing the type of an isolated power supply system taking into account the 'carbon footprint' becomes especially important. The article analyzes methodological approaches to the choice of the type of an isolated medium-power power system, taking into account greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 IEEE.","carbon tax; isolated power system greenhouse gas emissions","Carbon footprint; Electric power systems; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; International trade; Global climate changes; International community; International obligations; Isolated energy systems; Isolated power supplies; Methodological approach; Russian federation; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098914964

An array of 10 band-pass filtered photodiodes and a digital camera monitored changes in the impact flash intensity during the different phases of the emitting ejecta. Early-time emission spectra were also recorded to examine short-lived chemical species within the ejecta. Analyses of the impact flash from the varied frozen targets show considerable differences in temporal behavior, with a strong wavelength dependence observed within monitored near-UV to near-IR spectral regions. Emission spectra showed molecular bands across the full spectral range observed, primarily due to AlO from the projectile, and with little or no contribution from vaporized metal oxides originating from frozen regolith simulant targets. Additional features within the impact flash decay profiles and emission spectra indicate an inhomogeneity in the impact ejecta composition. A strong correlation between the density of water ice-containing targets and the impact flash rate of decay was shown for profiles uninfluenced by significant atomic/molecular emission, although the applicability to other target materials is currently unknown. Changes in impact speed resulted in considerable differences in the temporal evolution of the impact flash, with additional variations observed between recorded spectral regions. A strong correlation between the impact speed and the emission decay rate was also shown for CO2 ice targets. These results may have important implications for future analyses of impact flashes both on the lunar/Martian surface and on other frozen bodies within the solar system. © 2020 The Authors.

To objectively evaluate the impacts of the introduction of inter-regional transmission lines, especially the ultra-high voltage (UHV) grid, may clarify the disputes and benefit China's electricity policy reform. This work simulates an equilibrium model of China's electricity market through the mixed complementarity problems (MCP) method, to investigate the impacts of the construction of the UHV transmission lines on the deployment of clean power and reduction of carbon emissions under different scenarios. The results indicate that the introduction of the UHV grid has increased the competition in both power generation and consumption sides, but it has limited contribution to mitigate the curtailment of clean power and carbon emissions, and there may exist the hysteresis effect of the UHV grid. We propose the following suggestions to better the development of China's power system. (1) With regard to electricity market coupling, it is more appropriate to firstly connect the regional market in the central and eastern China. (2) Promoting the installed capacity of clean power in a short-run is a necessary auxiliary method to effectively reduce the carbon emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Clean power; Electricity market; Inter-regional power transmission; Ultra-high voltage","Carbon; Electric industry; Electric lines; Electric power transmission networks; Hydroelectric power; Power markets; Transmissions; UHV power transmission; China's electricities; Equilibrium modeling; Installed capacity; Mixed complementarity problems; Quantitative assessments; Transmission grids; UHV transmission line; Ultra high voltage; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088031498

Physisorption rather than chemisorption is preferred, because adsorbents can be more easily regenerated by either reducing the pressure or increasing the temperature. Carbon is a suitable adsorbent for SO2 capture and widely used, and therefore it is important to study SO2 adsorption onto carbon with the Monte Carlo simulation to provide microscopic details to demarcate the roles of the basal plane of the graphene layer and the functional groups in adsorption. SO2 is a polar molecule like water, as they both carry partial charges, but they interact differently with functional groups. Instead of 3D-clusters in the case of water, SO2 is localized around the functional groups and spreads over the basal plane to form 2D-molecular layers because of the strong dispersive interactions with graphite. The results indicate that the functional group has a negligible effect on the enhancement of adsorption and its role is to localize 2D-clusters of SO2 molecules. For non-graphitized carbon, we have found that the greater loadings at low pressure compared to the highly graphitized carbon is due to the presence of defects (crevices) on the basal plane surface. Finally, to describe better the experimental data, we have found that the reduction in the interactions between adsorbed molecules in the first layer is because of the repulsion of their dipoles pointing normal to the surface, a phenomenon called surface mediation and is widely used in the description of gas adsorption on surfaces.

With the forced diffusion of 5% CO2 in CBD, which confers an efficient attack of CO2 to RuBisCo, the CO2 assimilation increased from −5.03 to −2.63 g-CO2/g-DCW. Furthermore, boosted CO2 assimilation ability was observed by co-expression of GroELS chaperone with 71% reduction on CO2 release. By DNA sequencing and tandem MS/MS analysis, the toxicity of RuBisCo and PRK was identified to interfere the sugar metabolism and energy producing, while the cell morphology was changed and observed in RuBisCo-equipped E. coli.

Therefore, this study integrates the multi-index method and zero-sum gains–data envelopment analysis model to obtain a fair and efficient multi-criteria quota allocation scheme. To ensure the effectiveness of the scheme, the fairness and cost effect of the scheme are quantitatively tested. In addition, regional cooperation factors are introduced into the research framework to providing feasible practical measures. The results show that: (1) After optimization, the eastern region has the largest quota increment, accounting for 45% of the country’s quota. (2) The multi-criteria quota allocation scheme after secondary allocation is a more ideal scheme. The quota scheme not only meets the requirements of fairness and efficiency, but also has lower abatement costs. (3) Regional cooperation should be encouraged by China, especially the eastern region, which can alleviate the reducing emission pressure through cooperation. Although the western region needs to undertake additional emission reduction tasks, it can improve the utilization rate of local renewable resources and be conducive to long-term economic development. These results will provide a reference for China to achieve its carbon reduction targets. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the disproportionation effect of Mn2+ seriously affects the capacity retention of ZIBs during cycling. Here, the capacity retention of the Mn3O4 cathode is improved by effective valence engineering. The valence engineering of Mn3O4 is caused by bulk oxygen defects, which are in situ derived from the Mn-metal organic framework during carbonization. Bulk oxygen defects can change the (MnO6) octahedral structure, which improves structural stability and inhibits the dissolution of Mn2+. The ZIB assembled from bulk oxygen defects Mn3O4@C nanorod arrays (Od-Mn3O4@C NA/CC) exhibits an ultra-long cycle life, reaching 84.1 mAh g−1 after 12 000 cycles at 5 A g−1 (up to 95.7% of the initial capacity). Furthermore, the battery has a high specific capacity of 396.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Ex situ characterization results show that initial Mn3O4 is converted to ramsdellite MnO2 for insertion and extraction of H+ and Zn2+. First-principles calculations show that the charge density of Mn3+ increases greatly, which improves the conductivity. In addition, the flexible quasi-solid-state ZIB is successfully assembled using Od-Mn3O4 @ C NA/CC.

The improvement of both provisioning and regulating services in cultivated landscapes is crucial for the sustainable development of rural areas. Among the provisioning services offered, producing biogas from the anaerobic digestion of residual biomass is nowadays a promising option for decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while avoiding the land use conflicts related to the use of dedicated crops. Based on the available quantitative data at a regional level, provisioning and regulating services provided by the use of agri-food waste, livestock waste and agricultural residues were assessed for the case of Emilia Romagna region, the second biggest biogas producer in Italy. One provisioning service, i.e., bioenergy generation, and three regulating services were considered: (i) air quality improvement by the reduction of odors derived from direct use of waste, (ii) regulation of soil nutrients by reducing organic load and digestate spreading, and (iii) global climate regulation by saving GHG emissions. A potential further generation of 52.7 MW electric power was estimated at the regional level. Digestate spreading on fields may reduce odor impact by more than 90%, while containing a higher percentage of inorganic nitrogen, which is readily available to plants. The estimated GHG emission savings were equal to 2,862,533 Mg CO2eq/yr, mainly due to avoided landfilling for agri-waste and avoided replacing of mineral fertilizers for livestock waste and agricultural residues. The results suggest that bioenergy generation from lignocellulosic, livestock and agro-industrial residues may improve some regulating services in agro-ecosystems, while helping to reach renewable energy targets, thus contributing to overcoming the provisioning vs. regulating services paradigm in human-managed ecosystems. © 2020 by the authors.

These regions include, though are not exclusive, to health resorts, an important element of the healthcare industry. Poor air quality is mainly associated with the domestic sector, which is dominated by individual solid fuel and coal boilers. One option for reducing emissions is to use alternative energy sources for heating purposes. Therefore, the paper presents an analysis into the possibility of using low enthalpy (low temperature) geothermal energy in health resort areas. The main purpose of the article is to estimate the potential of soil and water as the lower source for a heat pump. The article presents analyses of geological and hydrogeological conditions based on which the thermal parameters of the rock mass were determined, which were thermal conductivity and unit heat output for 1800 operating hours per year. The calculated values were used to perform a spatial analysis of the data and create maps of the average thermal conductivity for horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHE) to a depth of 2 and 10 m and vertical ground heat exchangers (VGHE) in depth ranges up to 30, 60, and 90 m. The heating power of the intakes, located in the research area, were estimated using empirical formulas. In addition, a detailed analysis of the physicochemical parameters of groundwater in terms of the requirements indicated by four heat pump manufacturers is presented. The results of the presented research makes it possible to assess the potential of low-temperature geothermal energy and to characterize the suitability of the selected location for the use of HGHE, VGHE, and wells. As a result, the discussed area was found to have a high potential for the use of ground source heat pumps and a moderate potential for the use of low-temperature systems based on groundwater. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Groundwater; Low enthalpy geothermal; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development","Air quality; Coal; Coal industry; Enthalpy; Fuels; Geothermal fields; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Pumps; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Alternative energy source; Geothermal resources; Healthcare industry; Horizontal ground heat exchangers; Hydrogeological conditions; Low temperature geothermal energies; Physicochemical parameters; Vertical ground heat exchangers; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092431747

Methods to localize and spatially granulate the regional ESL (sub-annual to 500-year) probabilities and their uncertainties are presented to help planners of often-remote Pacific Basin communities assess (ocean) flood risk of various threshold severities under current and future sea levels. Downscaling methods include use of local TG observations of various record lengths (e.g., 1–19+ years), and if no in situ data exist, tide range information. Low-probability RFA ESLs localized at TG locations are higher than other recent assessments and generally more precise (narrower confidence intervals). This is due to increased rare-event sampling as measured by numerous TGs regionally. For example, the 100-year ESLs (1% annual chance event) are 0.15 m and 0.25 higher (median at-site difference) than a single-TG based analysis that is closely aligned to those supporting recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments and a third-generation global tide and surge model, respectively. Height thresholds for damaging flood levels along Pacific Basin coastlines are proposed. These floods vary between about 0.6–1.2 m or more above the average highest tide and are associated with warning levels of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The risk of a damaging flood assessed by the RFA ESL probabilities under contemporary sea levels have about a (median) 20–25-year return interval (4–5% annual chance) for TG locations along Pacific coastlines. Considering localized sea level rise projections of the IPCC associated with a global rise of about 0.5 m by 2100 under a reduced emissions scenario, damaging floods are projected to occur annually by 2055 and >10 times/year by 2100 at the majority of TG locations. © Copyright © 2020 Sweet, Genz, Obeysekera and Marra.","extreme sea levels; flood risk; regional frequency analysis; sea level rise; tide gauges",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117693328

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were prepared using a focused-ion beam (FIB) for both longitudinal and transverse directions of carbon fibers. Measurements of the crystal size and orientation were estimated from X-ray scattering. TEM imaging of graphitic packing facilitated further comprehension of associations between processing and final material properties, which could enable customization of microstructures for property targets. Then the detailed microstructural information and their X-ray scattering properties were incorporated into the simulation model of an individual carbon fiber. Assuming that graphene properties are the same among different forms of carbon fiber, a reasonable physics-based explanation for such a drastic decrease in strength is the dislocations between the graphitic units. The model reveals critical defects and uncertainty of carbon fiber microstructures, including skin/core alignment differences and propagating fracture before ultimate failure. The models are the first to quantify microstructures at the crystal scale with micromechanics and to estimate tensile and compressive mechanical properties of carbon fiber materials, as well as potentially develop new fundamental understandings for tailoring carbon fiber and composites properties. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon fiber; Digital twin; Microscopy; Multiscale","Crystal orientation; Crystals; Digital twin; Fibers; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ion beams; Microstructure; X ray scattering; Carbon-fiber materials; Compressive mechanical properties; Critical defects; Fiber microstructures; Graphene properties; Microstructural information; Microstructure properties; Polyacrylonitrile (PAN); Graphite fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092430159

Methods: This study included 200 people who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for the first time. Healthy people (n = 100) and patients (n = 100) were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. In the intervention group, we used a ‘virtual experience’ as an intervention before the scan. We used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and satisfaction questionnaires for evaluation. Additionally, the image quality was analysed. Results: In the control group, more patients presented anxiety than healthy people (26(52%) versus 15(30%)) (P = 0.041). However, when the ‘virtual experience’ was provided, the number of cases of anxiety in the patient group decreased to 19(38%). Furthermore, patients in the intervention group had lower STAI-related scores than those in the control group (STAI-S: 37.08 ± 9.42 versus 43.34 ± 10.49, P = 0.109; STAI-T: 36.24 ± 9.55 versus 40.72 ± 9.00, P = 0.019). With respect to image quality, people who had higher STAI-related scores were more likely to have unqualified images. Conclusion: A ‘virtual experience’ provided by an audio-visual installation can ease patients’ anxiety and improve image quality. © 2020 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists","anxiety; healthy people; patients; Positron emission tomography; Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; x-ray computed tomography; anxiety; middle aged; patient satisfaction; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prevention and control; prospective study; psychology; total quality management; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; Anxiety; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prospective Studies; Quality Improvement; Radiopharmaceuticals; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087184802

Methane emissions from ruminants not only result in a loss of feed energy but also contribute to global warming. Previous studies showed that brassica forages, such as forage rape, lead to less methane emitted per unit of dry matter intake than grass-based forages. Differences in rumen pH are proposed to partly explain these low emissions. Rumen microbial community differences are also observed, but the causes of these are unknown, although altered digesta flow has been proposed. This paper proposes a new mechanism underlying the lower methane emissions from sheep fed brassica forages. It is reported that feeding brassica forages to sheep can increase the concentration of free triiodothyronine (FT3) in serum, while the intramuscular injection of FT3 into sheep can reduce the mean retention time of digesta in the rumen. The short retention time of digesta is associated with low methane production. Glucosinolates (GSLs) are chemical components widely present in plants of the genus Brassica. After ruminants consume brassica forages, GSLs are broken down in the rumen. We hypothesize that GSLs or their breakdown products are absorbed into the blood and then may stimulate the secretion of thyroid hormone FT3 in ruminants, and the altered thyroid hormone concentration may change rumen physiology. As a consequence, the mean retention time of digesta in the rumen would be altered, resulting in a decrease in methane emissions. This hypothesis on mitigation mechanism is based on the manipulation of animal physiological parameters, which, if proven, will then support the expansion of this research area. © Copyright © 2020 Sun.","digesta retention time; free triiodothyronine; greenhouse gas; physiological parameters; plant secondary compounds; rumen","glucosinolate; liothyronine; methane; Brassica; forage crop; foraging; free liothyronine index; intramuscular drug administration; metabolite; methanogen; methanogenesis; nonhuman; retention time; Review; rumen; rumen microorganism; ruminant; secondary metabolism; sheep; thyroid function; thyroid hormone release",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094129746

The dataset (VDMBC) is about the vertical distributions of SOC, SMBC, and soil microbial quotient (SMQ = SMBC/SOC) and their relations to environmental factors across five continents. Data were collected from literature, with a total of 289 soil profiles and 1040 observations in different soil layers compiled. The associated environment data collectd include climate, ecosystem types, and edaphic factors. We developed this dataset by searching the Web of Sciene and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure from the year of 1970 to 2019. All the data in this dataset met two creteria: 1) there were at least three mineral soil layers along a soil profile, and 2) SMBC was measured using the fumigation extraction method. The data in tables and texts were obtained from literature directly, and the data in figures were extracted by using the GetData Graph digitizer software version 2.25. When climate and soil properties were not available from publications, we obtainted the data from the World Weather Information Service (https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/home.html) and SoilGrids at a spatial resolution of 250 meters (version 0.5.3, https://soilgrids.org). The units of all the variables were converted to the standard international units or commonly used ones and the values were transformed correspondingly. For example, the value of soil organic matter (SOM) was converted to SOC by using the equation (SOC = SOM × 0.58). This dataset can be used in predicting global SOC changes along soil profiles by using the multi-layer soil carbon models. It can also be used to analyse how soil microbial biomass changes with plant roots as well as the composition, structure, and functions of soil microbial communities along soil profiles at large spatial scales. This dataset offers opportunities to improve our prediction of SOC dynamics under global changes and to advance our understanding of the environmental controls. © 2020 The Authors","deep soils; micorbial quotient; soil C/N ratio; soil clay content; soil organic carbon; soil profile",,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089534274

Results show that population size, GDP, civilian vehicle inventory, energy intensity, passenger transportation, freight turnover, and transport sector output are key factors inducing transportation carbon emission, while energy structure and transportation sector employees mitigate the overall transportation carbon emission.

This paper uses the International Vehicle Emission (IVE) model to obtain the localized emission factors, so that a dispersion model, CAL3QHC was introduced and modified to incorporate the vehicle acceleration and deceleration states. Two emission reduction schemes for urban signalized intersections, the Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system and the no-obstacle driveway design, were proposed, by taking the intersection of Wen'er West Road and Liangmu Road in Hangzhou, China as an empirical example. The overall performance and roadside emission dispersion were simulated using VISSIM software package, with the improved CAL3QHC model. The GLOSA system and the no-obstacle driveway design were found to mitigate the roadside CO concentration by 21.2% and 22.1%, respectively.

Microalgae are highly effective in nutrient recovery and have strong potential as a sustainable wastewater treatment technology. Here, nutrients from black water (toilet wastewater) were recovered as microalgal biomass, which was dried and assessed as a fertilizer in pot experiments compared with inorganic fertilizer. We deciphered the effects of microalgal biomass as a biofertilizer on plant growth and quality and the biological processes linked to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, we elucidated the assembly of the active microbiome in bulk soil and rhizosphere during barley development. Microalgal biomass application and inorganic fertilizer (NPK) resulted in similar plant productivity (16.6 g pot−1). Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 4.6-fold higher in the treatment amended with microalgal fertilizer (3.1% of applied N) than that with inorganic fertilizer (0.5% of applied N). Nitrification by bacteria was likely the main pathway responsible for N2O emissions (R2 = 0.7, p ≤ 0.001). The application of nitrogen fertilizers affected the structures of both the active bacterial and protozoan communities, but these effects were less obvious than the strong plant effect, as the recruited microbiota varied among different plant developmental stages. Both treatments enriched similar bacterial and protozoan taxonomic orders but with different distributions through time across the plant developmental stages. Furthermore, the bacterial community showed a clear trend of resilience from the beginning of the experiment until harvest, which was not observed for protozoa. Our results indicate that the use of microalgal biomass as a fertilizer is a viable option for recycling nutrients from wastewater into plant production. © 2020 The Author(s)","Bacterial community; Black water; N2O emission; Organic fertilization; Protist community; Sustainable strategy","Bacteria; Biomass; Ecology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Protozoa; Soils; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Bacterial community; Biological process; Developmental stage; Different distributions; Inorganic fertilizers; Microalgal biomass; Plant productivity; Sustainable wastewater treatments; Nitrogen fertilizers; ammonium nitrate; biomass; carbon emission; experimental study; fertilizer; greenhouse gas; growth response; microalga; nutrient; rhizosphere; soil pollution; wastewater; anaerobic sludge; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; Chlorella sorokiniana; controlled study; denitrification; environmental impact; environmental management; gene amplification; grain yield; gravimetry; ionization; microalga; microbial biomass; Netherlands; nitrification; nonhuman; plant growth; productivity; rhizosphere; RNA analysis; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil fertilization; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hordeum; Protista; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086923521

Despite the abrupt decreases in gaseous emissions caused by record-low anthropogenic activities, severe haze pollution occurred in northern China during the COVID lockdown. This paradox has attracted the attention of both the public and the scientific community. By analyzing comprehensive measurements of air pollutants, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and surface meteorology, we show that the severe air pollution episode over northern China coincided with the abnormally low PBL height, which had reduced by 45%, triggering strong aerosol-PBL interactions. After dynamical processes initiated the temperature inversion, the Beijing metropolitan area experienced a period with continuously shallow PBLs during the lockdown. This unprecedented event provided an experiment showcasing the role of meteorology, in particular aerosol-PBL interactions in affecting air quality. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Two sampling sites were selected in the hillside and floodplain habitats along the Lanzhou City, and the xylems of T. ramosissima and potential water sources were collected, respectively. The Bayesian mixture model (MixSIAR) and soil water excess (SW-excess) were applied to analyze the relationship on different water pools and the utilization ratios of T. ramosissima to potential water sources in two habitats. The results showed that the slope and intercept of local meteoric water line (LMWL) in two habitats were smaller compared with the global meteoric water line (GMWL), which indicated the existence of drier climate and strong evaporation in the study area, especially in the hillside habitat. Except for the three months in hillside, the SW-excess of T. ramosissima were negative, which indicated that xylems of T. ramosissima are more depleted in δ2H than the soil water line. In growing seasons, the main water source in hillside habitat was deep soil water (80~150 cm) and the utilization ratio was 63 ± 17% for T. ramosissima, while the main water source in floodplain habitat was shallow soil water (0~30 cm), with a utilization ratio of 42.6 ± 19.2%, and the water sources were different in diverse months. T. ramosissima has a certain adaptation mechanism and water-use strategies in two habitats, and also an altered water uptake pattern in acquiring the more stable water.

Studies have typically relied on relatively sparse environmental monitoring data that lack the spatial resolution to assess small-area improvements in air quality and health. Few studies have integrated multiple types of measures of an air pollutant into one single modeling framework that combines spatially- and temporally-rich monitoring data. In this paper, we investigated the differential effects of California emissions reduction plan on reducing air pollution between those living in the goods movement corridors (GMC) that are within 500 m of major highways that serve as truck routes to those farther away or adjacent to routes that prohibit trucks. A mixed effects Deletion/Substitution/Addition (D/S/A) machine learning algorithm was developed to model annual pollutant concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by taking repeated measures into consideration and by integrating multiple types of NO2 measurements, including those through government regulatory and research-oriented saturation monitoring into a single modeling framework. Difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to identify whether those living in GMC demonstrated statistically larger reductions in air pollution exposure. The mixed effects D/S/A machine learning modeling result indicated that GMC had 2 ppb greater reductions in NO2 concentrations from pre- to post-policy period than far away areas. The difference-in-difference analysis demonstrated that the subjects living in GMC experienced statistically significant greater reductions in NO2 exposure than those living in the far away areas. This study contributes to scientific knowledge by providing empirical evidence that improvements in air quality via the emissions reductions plan policies impacted traffic-related air pollutant concentrations and associated exposures most among low-income Californians with chronic conditions living in GMC. The identified differences in pollutant reductions across different location domains may be applicable to other states or other countries if similar policies are enacted. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Deletion/substitution/addition; Difference-in-difference; Emissions reduction plan; Land use regression; Nitrogen dioxide","Air quality; Emission control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Monitoring; Nitrogen oxides; Trucks; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollution exposures; Difference-in-differences; Environmental Monitoring; Machine learning models; Pollutant concentration; Pollution concentration; Scientific knowledge; Pollution detection; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; policy making; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; regulatory approach; traffic congestion; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; California; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; environmental planning; environmental policy; government regulation; learning algorithm; machine learning; motor vehicle; priority journal; air pollution; animal; environmental monitoring; human; Leporidae; particulate matter; policy; pollutant; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Policy; Rabbits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087729520

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We conducted a 2-yr, multi-factor experiment (warming (W), altered precipitation (+30% and − 30%) and nitrogen addition (N)) in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau to study how these factors affect ecosystem carbon fluxes. Surprisingly, no interactive effects of warming, altered precipitation and nitrogen addition were detected on parameters of ecosystem carbon fluxes, including net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and soil respiration (SR). Warming marginally reduced NEE and GEP mainly due to its negative effects on them in July and August. Altered precipitation significantly affected all parameters of carbon fluxes with precipitation reduction decreasing NEE, ER and GEP, whereas precipitation addition increasing SR. In contrast, nitrogen addition had little effect on any parameters of carbon fluxes. Soil moisture was the most important driver and positively correlated with ecosystem carbon fluxes and warming impacted ecosystem carbon fluxes indirectly by decreasing soil moisture. While plant community cover did not show significant association with carbon fluxes, semi-shrubs cover was positively related to NEE, ER and GEP. Together, these results suggest that soil water availability, rather than soil temperature and nitrogen availability, may dominate the effect of the future multi-faceted global changes on semi-arid grassland carbon fluxes on the Loess Plateau. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fluxes; Global change; Plant cover; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","Carbon; Landforms; Nitrogen; Sediments; Soil moisture; Ecosystem respiration; Global change factors; Gross ecosystem productivities; Net ecosystem co2 exchanges; Nitrogen availability; Nitrogen deposition; Semi-arid grasslands; Soil water availability; Ecosystems; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; soil water; carbon flux; climate change; global change; grassland; semiarid region; soil moisture; water availability; Article; climate warming; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; global change; grassland; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; plant community; precipitation; priority journal; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; water availability; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086074564

Depending on the conditions at ignition the outcome is either a collapse to a neutron star or a thermonuclear explosion with an ONeFe remnant. We have investigated the impact of two forbidden transitions on the ignition conditions using the MESA stellar evolution code. The 0+ ? 2+ transition between the ground states of 20Ne and 20F has been measured experimentally and is found to decrease the ignition density while pushing the point of ignition off-centre.

However, coal-fired power generation is responsible for the release of the largest quantities of SO2 emissions to the atmosphere and leads to detrimental health and welfare effects in communities in the proximity of coal-fired plants. The classical industrial SO2 abatement solution for the coal-fired power generation industry is wet flue gas desulphurization, which uses a limestone adsorbent and produces a gypsum by-product (WFGD L/G). In South Africa, due to the poor quality of the limestone the gypsum product is unsaleable and is co-disposed with coal ash. In comparison, the Sulfacid® process technology converts SO2 contained in industrial flue gas into saleable sulphuric acid using a catalytic process requiring only water and air. This process does not require limestone. The scale of the latest commercial applications of the Sulfacid® SO2 abatement technology in the chemical, fertilizer, and copper mining industries demonstrates the potential and readiness of this technology to be employed in the coal-fired electricity and steam production sectors. This paper provides a first-order direct comparison between the techno-economic aspects of the WFGD (L/G) and Sulfacid® technologies using the requirements specified for the 6 × 800 MWe Eskom coal-fired Medupi power station. The results indicate that affordable flue gas desulphurization technology exists that could be adopted by the South African industry to reduce SO2 emissions to legislative limits and beyond. © 2020 South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

In this study, Guabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.) plants were exposed in greenhouses to combustion gases emitted by a diesel engine over 120 days, with daily intermittent gas exposure. Every 30 days, leaf injury (chlorosis and necrosis), plant biomass and physiological/biochemical parameters (proteins, chlorophyll and peroxidase enzyme activity) were evaluated. The data obtained were used to construct a hierarchy of the sensitivity (and inversely, of the resistance or tolerance) of this higher plant species to the diesel oil combustion gases: peroxidase > biomass ≈ chlorophyll > protein > leaf injury. Variations in these parameters could be used for the early diagnosis of plant stress or as a marker for stress tolerance in trees. In the first case, a sensitive species could be used for the phytomonitoring of air quality and in the second case the lack of significant variations in these parameters would indicator tolerance of the plant species to air pollution. The results showed that Guabiroba, a plant native to the Atlantic forest, is sensitive to air pollution and could therefore be used for air quality monitoring, since all parameters analyzed were affected by the polluted air. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Automotive emissions; Guabiroba plant; Peroxidase; Urban afforestation","Air quality; Cell death; Chlorophyll; Combustion; Diagnosis; Diesel engines; Enzyme activity; Physiology; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Air quality monitoring; Atlantic forest; Atmospheric emission; Combustion gas; Early diagnosis; Plant species; Sensitive species; Stress tolerance; Physiological models; chlorophyll; diesel fuel; peroxidase; plant protein; gasoline; afforestation; atmospheric pollution; biochemistry; biomass; combustion; diesel engine; exhaust emission; greenhouse gas; leaf; physiological response; pollution effect; tree; urban forestry; afforestation; air pollution; air quality control; Article; biochemical composition; biomass; Campomanesia xanthocarpa; chemical parameters; chemical stress; chlorosis; combustion; controlled study; diesel engine; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; enzyme activity; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; nonhuman; plant defense; plant disease; plant leaf; plant leaf necrosis; plant parameters; plant physiology; plant stress; sensitivity analysis; urban area; vascular plant; air pollutant; air pollution; exhaust gas; Campomanesia xanthocarpa; Embryophyta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086947826

Elevated aluminium concentrations caused major environmental concern due to aluminium's toxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms and led to the extirpation of wild Atlantic salmon populations. Air pollution reduction legislation that began in the 1990s in North America and Europe successfully reduced acid deposition, and the aluminium problem was widely considered solved. However, accumulating evidence indicates that freshwater systems still show delays in recovery from acidification, with poorly understood implications for aluminium concentrations. Here, we investigate spatial and temporal patterns of labile cationic forms of aluminium (Ali) from 2015 to 2018 in 10 catchments in Nova Scotia, Canada; this region was one of the hardest hit by acid deposition, although it was not considered to have an aluminium problem due to its high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations that were expected to reduce Ali concentrations. Surprisingly, our results show the widespread and frequent occurrences of Ali concentrations that exceed toxic thresholds in all sampled rivers despite high DOC concentrations. Generalized linear mixed model results reveal that DOC, instead of being inversely related to Ali, is the strongest predictor (positive) of Ali concentrations, suggesting that the recruitment properties of DOC in soils outweigh its protective properties in streams. Lastly, we find that, contrary to the common conceptualization that high Ali levels are associated with storm flow, high Ali concentrations are found during base flow. Our results demonstrate that elevated Ali concentrations in Nova Scotia continue to pose a threat to aquatic organisms, such as the biologically, economically, and culturally significant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

We combined the recent approach of climate sensitivity functions with a revised hydrological 'bucket model' to improve predictions on how plant species will respond to changes in the mean and variance of groundwater resources. Methods: We leveraged spatiotemporal variation in long-term datasets of riparian vegetation cover and groundwater levels to build the first groundwater sensitivity functions for common plant species of dryland riparian corridors. Our results demonstrate the value of this approach to identifying which plant species will thrive (or fail) in an increasingly variable climate layered with declining groundwater stores. Important Findings: Riparian plant species differed in sensitivity to both the mean and variance in groundwater levels. Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizenii) cover was predicted to decline with greater inter-annual groundwater variance, while coyote willow (Salix exigua) and other native wetland species were predicted to benefit from greater year-to-year variance. No non-native species were sensitive to groundwater variance, but patterns for Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) predict declines under deeper mean groundwater tables. Warm air temperatures modulated groundwater sensitivity for cottonwood, which was more sensitive to variability in groundwater in years/sites with warmer maximum temperatures than in cool sites/periods. Cottonwood cover declined most with greater intra-annual coefficients of variation (CV) in groundwater, but was not significantly correlated with inter-annual CV, perhaps due to the short time series (16 years) relative to cottonwood lifespan. In contrast, non-native tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) cover increased with both intra- and inter-annual CV in groundwater. Altogether, our results predict that changes in groundwater variability and mean will affect riparian plant communities through the differential sensitivities of individual plant species to mean versus variance in groundwater stores. © 2020 The Author(s).","climate change; climate variability; cottonwood; New Mexico; Rio Grande; riparian; tamarisk; willow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097200714

These technologies often require prohibitively high upfront costs. One potential solution for these brewers is to market their product as sustainable and charge a premium to offset some of the costs. We undertake a stated preference choice experiment targeting a nationally representative sample of beer buyers and elicit preferences for multiple attributes related to environmental sustainability in beer. We find that, on average, beer buyers are willing to pay $0.70/six-pack for beer produced using water and wastewater reduction technologies, $0.85 for carbon reduction practices, and $0.98 for landfill diversion practices, though water sustainability practices appeal to a largest share of beer buyers. We also find that preferences for sustainability attributes are widely distributed among beer drinkers, largely irrespective of sociodemographic characteristics. The positive price premiums across sustainability attributes suggest beer buyers value sustainable brewing, and brewers could attract new consumers by simultaneously communicating their commitment to sustainability and differentiating their product [EconLit Citations: D12, L66, M31]. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","beer; choice experiment; consumer preference; environmental sustainability; willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087566328

A range of indicator-based frameworks have been developed, focusing on general city economic competitiveness, yet these are often disconnected from the actual city operation and processes relevant to the investment cycle of SE projects. This paper proposes an integrated methodology for developing a City Capability Assessment Framework focusing on city planning, financing, and implementation capacity for SE projects. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the results of a European city-survey to uncover areas highly relevant for the successful implementation of local SE projects. The insights gained aid policymakers to better understand implementation barriers, leading to the development of more effective actions and policy interventions towards the implementation of SE projects. The proposed framework can further enhance cities’ efforts with the implementation of local SE projects and guide potential investors to properly evaluate city capabilities and potential, when choosing local investment projects. © 2020 by the authors.

However, a warm Arctic is not novel. The Late Cretaceous fossil record of the region enables a detailed reconstruction of polar environmental conditions, and a thriving extinct ecosystem, during a previous 'hothouse' global climate. Using leaf form (physiognomy) and tree ring characteristics we reconstruct Cenomanian to Coniacian polar thermal and hydrological regimes over an average annual cycle at eight locations in NE Russia and northern Alaska.

However, the correlation between planar and SPECT findings and the optimal timing of image acquisitions remain uncertain. Methods: This is an analysis of 109 consecutive patients who underwent technetium pyrophosphate nuclear scintigraphy for the evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis. Patients were imaged at 1 and 3 hours after radiotracer injection using both planar and SPECT/CT, and the correlations between imaging protocols were compared. Results: In the overall cohort (median age 77 years, 75% male), 33 patients had radiotracer localized to the myocardium on SPECT/CT images. There was strong correlation between 1- and 3-hour planar heart-to-contralateral lung ratios (mean difference 0.07, r = 0.94). However, there was discordance between planar image interpretation (based upon semiquantitative score and H/CL ratio) and myocardial localization of radiotracer on SPECT/CT in 17 patients (16%). The pattern of SPECT/CT uptake was identical at 1 and 3 hours in all cases (32 diffuse, 1 focal). Conclusion: These data support the recommendation that SPECT/CT should be obtained in addition to planar images when performing nuclear scintigraphy for the detection of cardiac amyloidosis. A 1-hour planar and SPECT/CT protocol appears optimal. © 2020, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","amyloid heart disease; Cardiomyopathy; heart failure; image analysis; image interpretation; SPECT","creatinine; pyrophosphate technetium tc 99m; aged; analytical parameters; Article; ATTR amyloidosis; cardiac imaging; cardiac muscle; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; diagnostic accuracy; female; heart scintiscanning; heart to contralateral lung ratio; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; planar imaging; priority journal; single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography; time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084756276

The amount of consumed energy has an obvious influence on the consumption of natural resources, the extraction and use of which for energy production has an impact on the environment. Implementation of the measures aimed at improving the energy efficiency of facilities, by reducing the electricity and heat consumption, translates into greater care for the environment. The article discusses the legal conditions and possible ways to improve the energy efficiency of facilities. It also presents the beneficial impact of reducing the final energy consumption on the environment. The analysis of the energy efficiency improvements made concerns public utilities as well as residential buildings, which constitute a highly energy-intensive sector. The article also discusses the advantages and validity of using the RES systems in construction to improve the energy efficiency of the facilities. The analysis based on the RES installations showed a reduction of the harmful compounds emission to the environment by increasing the energy efficiency of the facilities. Such a process is possible because the limitations in the final energy consumption have a direct impact on reducing the emissions of, among others, carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the reduction of consumption of the fossil fuel resources. The measures aimed at improving the energy efficiency of facilities are regulated by national and international laws, directives and regulations. Environmental protection is also enforced by various legal regulations, issued by states and organizations. As inhabitants of the Earth, we should not wait for proper orders and prohibitions, but we should take care of our planet's future as well as limit its exploitation and poisoning. © 2020 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).","Energy efficiency; Energy saving; Environmental protection; RES",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090029120

Cities have not only been a major contributor to these emissions but are also in locations that will experience the impacts most intensely. Accounting for more than half of the world's population, most built assets and economic activity is concentrated in cities - factors that make these environments highly vulnerable to climate change. The impacts caused by climate change are already being felt in urban centers and have been increasing in recent years. The main problems involving climate change for cities are rising temperatures, rising sea levels, heat islands, floods, and extreme events. Most Brazilian cities already have environmental problems associated with development patterns and transformation of geographical areas. Exacerbated changes in the hydrological cycle by reason of global warming tend to accentuate the existing risks such as floods, landslides, heat waves, and limitations on the supply of potable water.

In this context, positive-energy districts laboratories could take the role of urban drivers toward innovation and sustainability in cities. These urban labs can provide real-life facilitieswith innovative co-creation processes and, at the same time, provide testing, experimenting, and prototyping of innovative technologies. In this scope, the authors of this work want to share the very first results of an empirical study using the testing facilities provided by the members of the Joint Program on Smart Cities of the European Energy Research Alliance as positive-energy districts laboratories. Six climatic regions are studied as boundary conditions, covering temperate and continental climates. Four scales of action are analyzed: Building, campus, urban, and virtual, with building and campus scales being the most frequent. Most of these laboratories focus on energy applications followed by networks, storage systems, and energy loads characterization. Many of these laboratories are regulated by ICT technologies but few of them consider social aspects, lighting, waste, and water systems. A SWOT analysis is performed to highlight the critical points of the testing facilities in order to replicate optimized configurations under other conditions. This statistical study provides guidelines on integration, localization, functionality, and technology modularity aspects. The use of these guidelines will ensure optimal replications, as well as identify possibilities and opportunities to share testing facilities of/between the positive-energy district laboratories. © 2020 by the authors.","Factsheets; Positive energy districts labs; Statistical studies; Testing facilities","Data storage equipment; Social aspects; Software testing; Test facilities; Well testing; Continental climate; Empirical studies; Energy applications; Energy technologies; European Commission; Innovative technology; Living laboratories; Optimized configuration; Laboratories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094950676

In Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of dairy farming systems, dairy-beef production is often ignored or ‘allocated off’, which may give a distorted view of production efficiencies. This study combines LCA with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to develop an indicator of eco-efficiency for each of 738 UK dairy farms (3624 data points in 15 years) that aggregates multiple burdens and expresses them per unit of milk and dairy-beef produced. Within the DEA framework, the importance (weight) of dairy-beef relative to milk is iteratively increased to quantify the environmental losses from heavily focussing on milk-production, via e.g. higher yields per cow, with consequent lower burdens per unit of milk, yet with lower dairy-beef production levels, where burdens for beef production are externalized. Then, the relationship between DEA eco-efficiency and a series of indicators of dairy farming intensity at animal- and farm-levels was studied with Generalized Additive Models (GAM). For all sets of DEA weights (proportion of deviance explained ranged between 68% and 82%) indicate that milk yield per cow and forage area, and larger dairy herds all have a positive effect on eco-efficiency, while concentrate fed per unit of milk and the forage area both have a negative effect (p < 0.05 for all modelled relationships). These findings suggest that more intensive and consolidated dairy farms can positively impact on eco-efficiency. However, as the DEA weight for dairy-beef relative to milk increases, the relationship between environmental efficiency and farming specialization (expressed as L milk per kg dairy-beef produced) reverses from positive to negative. In conclusion, dairy-beef production is pivotal in determining the wider environmental efficiency of dairy (and ruminant food) systems, and its under-representation in efficiency studies has generated a misleading approach to meeting emission targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Commercial farm panel data; Dairy-beef production; Data Envelopment Analysis; Generalized Additive Models; Life Cycle Assessment; Production intensity","consolidation; dairy farming; data envelopment analysis; emission control; food supplementation; forage; global perspective; life cycle analysis; meat; milk production; ruminant; specialization; agricultural land; animal experiment; animal model; article; cow; dairying; female; forage; herd; human; life cycle assessment; milk production; milk yield; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; specialization; agriculture; animal; bovine; milk; Animalia; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Farms; Female; Milk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087935644

Single atom catalysts (SACs) derived from metal–organic framework (MOF) are emerging extraordinary materials in electrochemical catalytic applications. Covering the merits of unique electronic structure, low-coordination environment, quantum size effect, and metal–support interaction, SACs promise enhanced electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity in the field of clean energy conversion. In this article, MOF synthesis routes to afford well-dispersed SACs along with the respective synthesis mechanism are systematically reviewed first, and typical examples of each strategy are carefully discussed. Then the characterization techniques in understanding the isolated and spatial distribution, local electronic structure, coordination environment for SACs, and insights into stable mechanisms provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are summarized. In addition, several important electrocatalytic applications and electrocatalytic mechanisms of the MOF-derived SACs, including for the oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, etc., are highlighted.

However, rational design and construction of defect structures in catalysts to meet the aim of enhancing photocatalytic performance in a simple and cost-effective way is still a challenge. In this contribution, we report a strategy to construct defect structures in graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) by simple copolymerizing of urea with polyethyleneimine (PEI). Among the prepared catalysts, u-0.05PEI presents the best photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, with CO and CH4 yields of 32.86 and 1.68 μmol g−1 in 4 h, which is about 3.2 and 2.5 times higher than that of g-CN, respectively. Characterization results show that both C and N defects are formed in the newly prepared catalysts. The C defects on the surface of u-xPEI result in the formation of more amino groups which are beneficial for CO2 adsorption. Meanwhile, the N defects inside the samples lead to the generation of midgap states between the valance band and conduction band of u-xPEI. The midgap states greatly enlarge the light absorption extent, and enable the use of light with energy lower than the intrinsic absorption of g-CN in the photoreduction of CO2. As confirmed by DRS, EPR, PL analysis, the excellent catalytic activity of u-0.05PEI is mainly attributed to the remarkably improved light utilization efficiency and fast charge transfer. Moreover, the reaction is performed in water without any additive or organic solvent, which makes it environmentally friendly. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 reduction; Defect structures; Midgap states; Photocatalysis; Porous structures","Carbon dioxide; Carbon nitride; Charge transfer; Cost effectiveness; Defect structures; Light absorption; Photocatalytic activity; Urea; CO2 adsorption; Cost effective; Intrinsic absorptions; Light utilization; Photo-reduction; Photocatalytic performance; Polyethyleneimine; Rational design; Catalyst activity; carbon; carbon dioxide; graphite; methane; nitrogen; polyethyleneimine; urea; Article; catalyst; electron spin resonance; light; light absorption; photocatalysis; polymerization; priority journal; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086308272

Search for suitable and efficient CO2 reduction electrocatalysts with high C2:C1 selectivity holds great promise. Herein, for the first time we have developed a molten salt oxidized method to modify the morphology and oxidation state of a Cu-foam catalyst. The catalyst displayed a current density of 30 mA cm−2 (−1.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and an ethylene/methane ratio of 870. We provide insight into the improved performance of the catalysts by cross section scanning transmission electron microscopy and quasi in situ soft X-ray spectroscope, which show that copper oxides are surprisingly reconstructed with Cu (I) and Cu (0) on the surface during the reaction. First principle calculations also demonstrate that the partly reduced Cu2O (111) surface has a high reactivity and selectivity for C2+ products. Furthermore, the molten salt treated catalysts could be applied to the direct synthesis of multi-carbon fuels, including C3-C4 compounds in high CO2 pressure electrocatalytic reduction. Our results demonstrate that molten salt are both the oxidizing agent and reaction medium, which is a promising approach for synthesis of highly active CO2 electrocatalysts, which may open a new way for industrial application. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO2 reduction reaction; Cu catalyst; Molten salt method; quasi in situ soft X-ray spectroscope; surface reconstruction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092593559

In 2017 the BER's carbon emission intensity outclassed the national average, the emission reduction situation was also grim. For clarifying the influence mechanism of the economy on carbon emission intensity, this paper explores the spatiotemporal regularity, the spatial correlation, and the spillover effect in carbon emission intensity employing the Moran index and the spatial Durbin model. The results indicate that the carbon emission intensity in the BER decreased year-by-year from 2006 to 2017. Shanxi and Inner Mongolia were emission hot spots, whereas Beijing and Tianjin were emission cold spots. And the Moran's I values all passed the significance test, which verified the spatial correlation of the carbon emission intensity in the BER is significant. Urbanization, energy intensity, population density, and industry structure have a biggish impact on such spatial distribution of the carbon emission intensity. The direct effect coefficient of the energy intensity is the highest, and the spillover effect of the industry structure is the most significant. Finally, this paper puts forward suggestions on the formulation of regional coordinated carbon reduction programs in the BER. © 2020","Energy intensity; Population density; Spatial dependence test; Spatial Durbin model; Urbanization","Economics; Emission control; Population statistics; Carbon emission intensities; Environmental problems; Industry structures; Influence mechanism; Population densities; Shanxi and inner mongolia; Spatial correlations; Spatial Durbin models; Carbon; carbon; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; emission inventory; industrial district; pollution monitoring; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; urbanization; Article; autocorrelation; carbon footprint; China; economic development; energy resource; geographic distribution; industry; population density; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Nei Monggol; Shanxi; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086827152

Cumulative forest soil NO emissions (148–350 ng NO-N g−1) were ~ 4 times larger than N2O emissions (37–69 ng N2O-N g−1). Contrary, agricultural soil NO emissions (21–376 ng NO-N g−1) were ~ 16 times smaller than N2O emissions (45–8491 ng N2O-N g−1).

As such high N deposition rates are not atypical in China, more attention should be paid on forest soil NO research. Comparing the fertilizers urea, ammonium nitrate, and urea coated with the urease inhibitor ‘Agrotain®,’ demonstrated that the inhibitor significantly reduced NO and N2O emissions. This is an unintended, not well-known benefit, because the primary function of Agrotain® is to reduce emissions of the atmospheric pollutant ammonia. Simulating a climate change event, a large rainfall after drought, increased soil NO and N2O emissions from both agricultural and forest soils.

Estimation of the total energy supply and capacity of renewables, variations in the energy from the grid, and CO2 emission would aid renewable energy policy evaluation. However, analyzing the collective effects considering the optimal energy system for each building in a city is difficult due to a large number of buildings (on the order of 105). Therefore, this study proposes a new framework for analyzing the city-wide impact of increased building-integrated renewables. To reduce the number of optimization, clusters of buildings with similar characteristics and one virtual representative building for each cluster are generated. For apartment buildings, the characteristics are the floor area and roof area per household. For non-residential buildings, the characteristics are the shapes of the monthly electricity and gas usages, the ratio between the annual gas and electricity usages, and normalized roof area. To generate clusters of similar non-residential buildings, k-Means Clustering Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm have been applied. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing the collective results from i) optimization of 4,425 actual apartment buildings and 2,779 actual non-residential buildings in an urban district; and ii) optimization of corresponding 957 representative apartment buildings and 176 representative non-residential buildings. Total energy supply and capacity of each renewable energy source, total monthly electricity and gas from the grid, and total hourly electricity from the grid show good agreement. As a demonstration, the proposed framework has been applied to the city of Seoul, Korea for a future scenario of building energy obligation – i) to estimate the total capacities and energy supply of the building-integrated renewables and the change in the energy from the grid; and ii) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the obligation based on the unit cost of CO2 reduction for varying renewable energy requirements for the buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building-integrated renewable energy; CO2 reduction; Energy policy; Genetic Algorithm; k-Means Clustering; Urban energy","Apartment houses; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Energy policy; Genetic algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Roofs; Apartment buildings; Building integrated; Collective effects; Electricity and gas; Renewable energies; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy source; Residential building; K-means clustering; alternative energy; building; carbon emission; energy policy; integrated approach; optimization; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087817085

Yet no one knew these existed until 45 years ago, when teeming communities of animals were found thriving at hydrothermal vents two and a half kilometers below the sea surface. The discovery of these lightless ecosystems revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel life on Earth. Animals thrive at vents because they live in a nutritional symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria that grow on chemical compounds gushing out of the vents, such as sulfide and methane, which animals cannot use on their own. The symbionts gain energy from the oxidation of these reduced substrates to fix CO2 and other simple carbon compounds into biomass, which is then transferred to the host. By associating with chemosynthetic bacteria, animals and protists can thrive in environments in which there is not enough organic carbon to support their nutrition, including oligotrophic habitats like coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Chemosymbioses have evolved repeatedly and independently in multiple lineages of marine invertebrates and bacteria, highlighting the strong selective advantage for both hosts and symbionts in forming these associations. Here, we provide a brief overview of chemosynthesis and how these symbioses function.

Motor-vehicles emissions are a major source of air pollution in urban areas and give significant adverse effects on human life. Aim: This study aimed to assess the change of expiratory carbon-monoxide levels after using four-type of masks in people around Universitas Sumatera Utara. Methods: This was an experimental study with a consecutive sampling technique involved 100 non-smoker subjects. They were divided into four groups based on masks given: fabric, surgical, carbon, and an N95 mask. Expiratory CO was measured by a smokerlyzer device. Data were analyzed using SPSS software with Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis Test. Results: There was a significant change of carbon-monoxide mean level after using the mask for 8 hours in a surgical mask, N95 mask, and carbon mask (p-value: 0.002; 0.000; 0.000). After analyzed using Kruskal Wallis Test, there was a significant difference in the change of mean of pre and post wearing mask (ΔCO) among four-type of masks with p-value < 0.001.

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results: Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO2e year-1 over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO2e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO2 increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO2e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for the Higher Recovery scenario in 2070. Conclusions: The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations. © 2020 The Author(s).","British Columbia; Climate change mitigation; Cost per tonne; Forest sector; GCBM; Socio-economic impact","carbon sequestration; climate change; cost analysis; environmental impact assessment; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092349231

These observations were made using the grism spectroscopy mode of the First Light Infrared TEst CAMera (FLITECAM) instrument during airborne science operations on board NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The goal of this study is to characterize the 3.3 and 5.25 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust emission in PNs and study the evolution of PAH features within evolved stars before their incorporation into new stellar systems in star-forming regions. Targets were selected from Infrared Astronomical Satellite, Kuiper Airborne Observatory and Infrared Space Observatory source lists, and were previously observed with FLITECAM on the 3 m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory to allow direct comparison between the ground and airborne observations. We measure PAH emission equivalent width and central wavelength, classify the shape of the PAH emission, and determine the PAH/aliphatic ratio for each target. The 3.3 μm PAH emission feature is observed in all three objects. PNG 093.9-00.1 exhibits NGC 7027-like aliphatic emission in the 3.4-3.6 μm region while IC 5117 and BD +30 3639 exhibit less aliphatic structure.

Quinney College of Natural Resources, Utah State University, Logan, UT, United States","The absence of federal action on climate change in the United States has motivated local and regional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of 100 percent net-renewable electricity resolutions. As of 2020, more than 150 cities, counties, and states have committed to such resolutions, with six U.S. cities having already achieved their goals. Implementing 100 percent net-renewable electricity resolutions, nevertheless, requires hurdling many significant obstacles, including developing and procuring sufficient renewable electricity resources from local utilities, navigating complex energy regulations, balancing costs with other community priorities, and convincing local citizens of the merits of renewable electricity and efficiency for their homes and businesses. Through semi-structured interviews with city, community, utility, and nongovernment environmental organization representatives and secondary sources, this article investigates how the cities of Salt Lake City, Park City, and Moab, the first three cities in Utah to enact 100 percent net-renewable electricity resolutions, have been tackling those challenges. It provides an overview of their most significant outcome thus far - passage of the Community Renewable Energy Act of 2019, which prompted several additional Utah cities and counties to also commit to 100 percent net-renewable electricity. Guided by frameworks of collaborative and transformational leadership, coupled with community-based social marketing, this article offers guideposts to help other communities chart a transition to 100 percent net-renewable electricity. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","100 percent net-renewable electricity resolutions; community engagement; community-based social marketing; leadership; renewable energy","alternative energy; business; climate change; complexity; emission control; greenhouse gas; leadership; local participation; marketing; regulatory framework; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094928204

The calculated adsorption isotherms of methanol revealed that these types of carbon-based nanoporous materials could be efficient for the adsorption of methanol. The calculations also revealed significant intermediate and large-scale fluctuations in the local intermolecular structure and orientational order of methanol under confinement at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. These fluctuations depend strongly on the adsorbent material and also affect the local dielectric properties of confined methanol. The dynamics of the local hydrogen bonding network as well as the transport, single, and collective dynamics of the confined methanol molecules also change significantly upon confinement, particularly in the case of the carbon nanotube networks. It was also revealed that the confinement affects more strongly the relaxation phenomena occurring at long-time scales, such as the dielectric relaxation and reorientational and intermittent hydrogen bond dynamics. ©",,"Adsorption isotherms; Dielectric properties; Dielectric relaxation; Graphene; Hydrogen bonds; Methanol; Molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Nanopores; Plasma interactions; Porous materials; Carbon nanotube network; Hydrogen bond dynamics; Hydrogen bonding network; Intermolecular structures; Molecular dynamics simulations; Orientational orderings; Structural and dynamic properties; Temperature and pressures; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096849504

The large density of interface states in the graphene-GaAs junction is partly formed by oxidation in air of the GaAs surface. A graphene transfer presented herein reduces the arsenic species in the GaAs oxide and maintains the reduction over a span of at least one year. The photoluminescence and terahertz emission spectra show reduced surface trapping of photogenerated carriers in GaAs with graphene-capped oxide. These findings demonstrate a 2D material transfer that passivates a 3D semiconductor surface. A consequence of the passivation is observed by photoreflectance modulation spectroscopy of graphene covered semi-insulating GaAs. The built-in surface field is sufficiently screened by optically pumped carriers to reveal an enhanced excitonic absorption just below the GaAs bandgap. The absorption critical point anomalously red shifts by 4-6 meV from the bulk exciton characteristic energy, an effect we attribute to the exciton absorption occurring closer to the graphene-GaAs interface and influenced by the near-surface GaAs dielectric polarization. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Charge carriers; Emission spectroscopy; Excitons; Gallium arsenide; Graphene; III-V semiconductors; Molecular spectroscopy; Optoelectronic devices; Red Shift; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconductor junctions; Carrier recombination; Characteristic energy; Density of interface state; Dielectric polarization; Photogenerated carriers; Photoreflectance modulation spectroscopy; Semi-conductor surfaces; Semi-insulating GaAs; Interface states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095421598

Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the unit root properties of variables (using Clemente–Montañés–Reyes unit root test with double mean shifts and AO model and augmented Dickey–Fuller test) for structural breaks at different levels. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and error correction model (ECM) methodology was used to estimate long- and short-run parameters among the selected variables in sample countries from 1965 to 2016. Vector error correction (VEC) and Granger causality approach was used to determine the direction of causality. Findings: The authors confirmed long-run relationship among the variables and highlighted high economic growth and energy consumption as the main causes of environmental degradation. While in India financial development and FDI inflows depict a negative association with environmental sustainability, however, such relationship was positive in the United Kingdom (UK), which is often considered as a benchmark for policymakers. The authors’ findings were in agreement with existing research insights in reporting FDI and financial development as the major contributors towards (unsustainable) sustainable environment through emissions in case of (developing country like India) developed country like UK. For other sample countries (China, Brazil, Japan, South Africa, United States of America (USA)), the authors’ model failed to capture financial development and FDI as significant contributors of carbon emissions. However, unidirectional causality running from energy to carbon emission was observed leading to the policy adoption of incentivizing alternative energy-based resources to increase energy efficiency across the energy value chain. Research limitations/implications: Manufacturing with renewable energy, in collaboration with private and foreign players, under an institutional framework is desirable. Policy instruments including mandatory administrative controls, economic incentives and voluntary schemes that promote energy efficiency building blocks need to be established. A sound legal system for implementing technological innovation, financial subsidy incentives, interest-free loan programmes and development of financial sector supports creation and thriving of energy efficient units, often a perquisite for accelerated development. Originality/value: By undertaking a comparative analysis, the authors address the research gap through revisiting EKC hypothesis with different set of trade policy and financial development framework. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, earlier studies were limited to one-country data analysis and did not consider the comparative data set of developed and developing countries with reference to financial development and FDI components. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; FDI and environmental degradation; Financial development; Foreign capital inflows",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089034300

Preparation of biochar from sewage sludge biochar has attained the attention of most of the researchers for their effectiveness in improving soil quality, reduction of uptake of heavy metals and potential benefits in agriculture fields to nourish the soil. In this review, an exhaustive list of sewage sludge biochar (SSBC) production from vast literature has compiled, and their characterization, application, quantification with risk assessment approach, impact on climate change, life cycle and cost analysis have been presented. The high cost of biomass disposal, (transportation, treatment and landfilling), is a serious concern.

The impacts have been assessed for the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) global warming scenario, and a corresponding geoengineered scenario (G3) from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, in which stratospheric aerosols are increased for 50 years from 2020 through 2069 to balance the global warming radiative forcing, and then aerosol precursor emissions are terminated. We used the period 2055–2069 (with the largest geoengineering forcing) and the period 2075–2089 (beginning 5 years into the termination phase) and evaluated winter chill and growing season heat accumulation. We found that although stratospheric geoengineering would be able to suppress the increase in temperature under an RCP4.5 scenario to some extent during both switch-on and switch-off periods, if the geoengineering was terminated, the rate of temperature increase would be higher than RCP4.5. The agroclimatically suitable area is projected to shift northeastwards (to higher elevations) under RCP4.5 as well as G3 during both periods. However, during the switched on period, geoengineering would restrict the shift, and areas of Shimla and Mandi districts (most suitable under the current climate) would not be lost due to global warming. Even during the switched off period, before the climate returned to RCP4.5 levels, the above areas would, although to a lesser extent, have reduced harmful climate effects from global warming. However, the area of suitable land (the intersection of soil and agroclimatic suitability) would decrease in both periods for RCP4.5 as well as G3, because as more high-elevation regions become agroclimatically suitable, they do not have suitable soils to support cultivation. Geoengineering could benefit deciduous fruit production by reducing the intensity of global warming; however, if geoengineering was terminated abruptly, the rate of change in temperature would be quite high.

Quality of air is undergoing continuous deterioration due to industrial and urban development. The present study aims at the seasonal investigation of air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index (API) of six commonly found plant species namely Ziziphus jujube (S1), Pithecellobium dulce (Sw.) DC (S2), Celosia argentea L. (S3), Ricinus communis L. (S4), Apluda mutica L. (S5) and Terminalia catappa L. (S6) growing along the industrial area (Chembur) of Mumbai. The air pollution tolerance indices were evaluated by using pH, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll content, the relative water content in the fresh leaves of plant species growing along the industrial and non-industrial area of Mumbai. The API was determined on combining the APTI values of the plant species with their biological and socio-economic parameters. The APTI of all the industrial zone plant species was found to be higher than the non-industrial zone plant species in all the three seasons. The rise in the mean of the three season’s APTI of S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 plant species from the polluted industrial zone over the less-polluted non-industrial zone was found to be 60.14, 76.59, 71.98, 82.30, 71.12, 65.52%, respectively. The higher API values obtained for the Pithecellobium dulce (Sw.) DC, Ricinus communis L. and Terminalia catappa L. plant species from polluted zone indicated higher air pollution tolerance and hence are recommended for green belt expansion in the Chembur industrial area. Terminalia catappa L. is an evergreen plant which can be planted in large number to develop green zone throughout the year around the Chembur industrial area. Similar studies can be performed globally to increase green zones around any industrial or residential area which will provide healthy living for the next generations on the earth. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution tolerance indices (APTI); Anticipated performance index (API); Ascorbic acid; pH; Relative leaf water; Total chlorophyll","Air pollution; Ascorbic acid; Deterioration; Plants (botany); Urban growth; Water pollution; Global challenges; Performance indices; Pithecellobium dulce; Relative water content; Residential areas; Tolerance indices; Total chlorophyll; Urban development; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100723491

Rapid reductions in fine particulate matter (PM2:5) concentrations and increased ozone concentrations occurred across China during 2015 to 2017. We used measurements of particulate matter with a diameter ≤ 2:5 μm (PM2:5) and ozone (O3) from more than 1000 stations across China along with Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) regional air quality simulations, to explore the drivers and impacts of observed trends. The measured nationwide median PM2:5 trend of 3:4μgm3 yr1 was well simulated by the model (3:5μgm3 yr1).With anthropogenic emissions fixed at 2015 levels, the simulated trend was much weaker (0:6μgm3 yr1), demonstrating that interannual variability in meteorology played a minor role in the observed PM2:5 trend. The model simulated increased ozone concentrations in line with the measurements but underestimated the magnitude of the observed absolute trend by a factor of 2. We combined simulated trends in PM2:5 concentrations with an exposure-response function to estimate that reductions in PM2:5 concentrations over this period have reduced PM2:5-attributable premature mortality across China by 150 000 deaths yr1. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

Our objective was to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of FCO2, temperature (Tsoil), moisture (Msoil) and air-filled pore space (AFPS), as well as their interactions, during the sugarcane field reform. The study was conducted on a 90 × 90 m sampling grid with 100 points at 10 m spacings. Ten assessments of FCO2, Tsoil and Msoil were carried out at each point over a 28-day period. The greatest mean values of FCO2 (0.74 g m−2 hr−1) and Msoil (31.7%) were obtained on Julian day 276, 2013, being associated with precipitation events at the study site. Also, the smallest values of AFPS (19.17%) and Tsoil (20.90°C) were observed on the same day. The spatial variability of FCO2, Tsoil, Msoil and AFPS was best described by an adjusted spherical model, although an exponential model better fitted some results. The spatial pattern of all soil attributes showed little temporal persistency, indicating a high complexity for FCO2 during precipitation. Correlation maps assisted in identifying regions where Msoil and AFPS better controlled the emission process and where Tsoil was important. A major challenge for world agriculture is to increase the efficiency of conventional soil management practices. We highlight the importance of the spatial pattern of soil properties that directly influence the CO2 emission dynamics. Future mitigation actions should involve less intense tillage and ensure homogeneous applications of soil inputs, thereby reducing production costs and the contribution of these activities to CO2 emissions during the sugarcane field reform. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","geostatistics; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil tillage","aeration; agricultural soil; air-soil interaction; carbon emission; management practice; precipitation (climatology); soil carbon; soil management; soil property; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar cane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092178443

Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycle is used for the conversion of heat to work. The plant runs on solar energy from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and to account for the fluctuations in the solar energy, the plant is equipped with an auxiliary heater operating on hot combustion gases from the combustion chamber. The capital city of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh) is chosen in this study and the solar insolation levels for this location are calculated using the ASHRAE clear-sky model. The solar collector (central receiver) receives solar energy reflected by the heliostats; therefore, a radially staggered heliostat field is generated for this purpose. A suite of code is developed to calculate various parameters of the heliostat field, such as optical efficiencies, intercept factors, attenuation factors and heliostat characteristic angles. S-CO2 Brayton cycle is simulated in commercial software, Aspen HYSYS V9 (Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). The cycle is mainly powered by solar energy but assisted by an auxiliary heater to maintain a constant net power input of 80 MW to the cycle. The heliostat field generated, composed of 1207 rows, provides 475 watts per unit heliostat’s area to the central receiver. Heat losses from the central receiver due to natural convection and radiation are significant, with an average annual loss of 10 percent in the heat absorbed by the receiver. Heat collection rate at the central receiver reveals that the maximum support of auxiliary heat is needed in December, at nearly 13% of the net input energy. Exergy analysis shows that the highest exergy loss takes place in the heliostat field that is nearly 42.5% of incident solar exergy. © 2020 by the authors.

Such impact events dominate the surface modifications of most of the airless bodies. Regardless of the destructive nature of impact events, the birth of few moons in the Solar System are known to be the by-products of impacts. Moreover, particle aggregation from relatively low velocity impacts (from nm to μm sized dust particles) are thought to be the reason behind the growth of planetesimals. While considering impact events in the colder regions of the Solar System the role of molecular ices in planetesimal aggregation cannot be neglected. Therefore, to understand the role of such small particle impacts over icy bodies, we investigated the sticking of dust particles on to ices in the higher velocity impact regime, 100–300 ​m ​s−1, using a modified hand driven shock tube (Reddy Tube). Grains of brick, basalt and powdered turmeric, graphite and fullerene soot particles were fired on to the CO2 ice targets. Meteorite samples (Sulagiri and Allende) were used to mimic the real micrometeorite impacts on to dry ice. The particles of different sizes and impact angle are found to significantly affect the sticking pattern. The impact area was observed to be coated by the impacting material. Lesser micron sized particles were observed to penetrate into the ice layers and the larger ones eroding them. Results suggest that astrochemical ices can be chemically enriched by high velocity dust/micrometeoroid impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ice; Impacts; Laboratory-Astrophysics; Micrometeorites; Sticking","Carbon dioxide; Dust; Ice; Meteor impacts; Shock tubes; Velocity; Different sizes; High-impact velocities; Low velocity impact; Micron-sized particles; Molecular ices; Particle aggregation; Small particles; Velocity impact; Agglomeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087282372

The present study investigated the 40-year (1970–2010) spatio-temporal variability in the discharge of the Krishna and Koyna River channels at Karad and Varunji gauging stations. Mean annual discharge (MAQ), mean decadal discharge (MDQ), standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and variance (R2) were calculated from the daily discharge data to know the spatio-temporal variability. Possible causes of discharge variability were investigated from rainfall, topography, drainage, and reservoir data. Rainfall data (1998–2000) were collected from the Indian meteorological department and satellite-derived tropical rainfall measuring mission to examine the hydrologic response to discharge. Similarly, shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model data were incorporated into ArcGIS software to generate relief, slope, drainage, reservoir, and basin data to quantify their relative influence with discharge. Results explored whether a significant variability existed in the 40-year historical discharge in the Krishna and Koyna River channels. Low MAQ for both the channels was recorded during 2000–2001, while it was maximum during 2006–2007. Krishna River’s MDQ was higher as compared to Koyna River. The highest SD value (2358.4 m3/s) was recorded for 2000–2010 and minimum (416.5 m3/s) for the 1970–1980 decade. The CV of the Varunji station was lower in 1970–1980 (0.2) while higher in 2000–2010 (0.7) with a rising trend from 1970–1980 to 2000–2010 decade. The Krishna and Koyna River flow regime has changed over the four decades due to variations in rainfall, relief, slope, drainage, reservoir, and basin area within both the basins. The results could be useful to the regional climate and flood forecasting centres not only in the Krishna and Koyna river basin, but also in other basins which have similar hydrogeological characteristics. © 2020, Shiraz University.","Climate change; Discharge variability; Hydrological changes; Water management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083391372

AUVs offer a lower operational cost and smaller carbon footprint with reduced ship usage, and they can provide higher resolution data when surveying the seabed at a closer distance if compared to ships. However, advancements are still needed to improve the data quality of AUV-based surveys. Unlike mobile robots with deterministic mapping performance, multibeam sonars used in AUV-based bathymetric mapping often yields inconsistent swath width due to the varied seabed elevation and surficial properties. As a result, mapping voids may exist between planned lawnmower transects. Although this could be solved by planning closer lawnmower paths, mission time increases proportionally. Therefore, an onboard path planner is demanded to assure the defined survey objective, i.e., coverage rate. Here in this paper, we present a new data-driven coverage path planning (CPP) method, in which the vehicle automatically updates the waypoints intermittently based on an objective function constructed using the information about the exploration preference, sonar performance, and coverage efficiency. The goal of the proposed method is to plan a cost-effective path on-the-fly to obtain high quality mapping result meeting the requirements in coverage rate and uncertainty. The proposed CPP method has been evaluated in a simulated environment with a 6DOF REMUS AUV model and a realistic seafloor topography. A series of trials has been conducted to investigate the performance affected by the parameters in the objective function. We also compared the proposed method with traditional lawnmower and spiral paths. The results show that the weight assignment in the objective function is critical as they affect the overall survey performance. With proper weight settings, the AUV yields better survey performance, coverage rate and coverage efficiency, compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily adjusted or modified to achieve different coverage goals, such as rapid data gathering of the entire region, survey of irregular workspace, or maintaining real time path planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Autonomous underwater vehicle; Bathymetric mapping; Coverage path planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092509612

This paper first improves the traditional environment Copeland-Taylor model by including the above two types of government-oriented environment instruments. Then, based on a comprehensive firm-level dataset, we examine the effects of government-oriented environmental instruments on firms’ water pollutant emission abatement in the Yangtze River Economic zone. We find robust evidence of a significant decrease of 2.99% in chemical Oxygen Demand(COD) discharge and of 3.55% in ammonia nitrogen(NH3) discharge of firms in response to the government environmental investment policy, whereas the command–control instrument shows little effect on firms’ water pollutant emission reduction. Our results are robust when using alternative measurements for two types of environmental instruments. Additionally, we also find there exist heterogeneous effects across sub-samples: (1)comparing with large and medium firms, small and micro firms are more liable to be influenced by the two types of government-oriented environmental instruments; (2) the effect of two types of government-oriented environmental instruments is obviously significant in the intensive-water-pollution industry, whereas it is not obvious in clean industry; (3) the effect of government environmental investment is obvious on state-owned enterprises and domestic joint ventures, whereas the command–control policy has effectively reduced the water pollutant discharge for domestic joint ventures and private firms.

Where there is high dependence on biomass energy, cleaner cooking transitions are key to REDD+'s success. Given the poor track record of efforts to promote clean cooking, more evidence is needed on the potential for REDD+ to reduce unsustainable extraction of biomass energy. We present a quasi-experimental impact evaluation of REDD+ in Nepal. Unsurprisingly, we find little evidence of impacts on forest carbon in just two years. We do find that REDD+ reduced forest disturbance as measured by four plot-level indicators (signs of forest fire, soil erosion, encroachment and wildlife) that are predictive of future changes in net carbon emissions and reflective of reduced extraction pressure by households. While our analysis of household survey data does not show that REDD+ reduced harvest of forest products, we find some evidence that it reduced household dependence on firewood for cooking, possibly by increasing use of biogas. Thus, communities in Nepal appear to have improved conditions in their forests without undermining local benefits of those forests. To secure progress towards reduced emissions and improved livelihoods, interventions must be designed to effectively meet household energy needs. © 2020 The Author(s).

It considers cooling and thermal load reduction and power generation over a one-year period. The paper focuses on energy efficiency retrofitting within the Middle Eastern climate. The methodological approach is based on analytical modeling of the temperature and velocity profiles between the outer and inner façades through thermodynamic and heat transfer phenomena. The paper describes how significant potential exists for cooling load reduction. The results of this study provide wider investigations on the thermal energy performance of the BIPVT system based on hourly and daily frequencies. According to the quantitative outputs, a suggested BIPVT-DSF system has the capability of reducing annual cooling and thermal loads by 251,623 (kWh) and 17,811 (kWh), respectively. In addition, the paper concludes that a photovoltaic system with the peak power of 10.6 (kW) (a) can generate grid connected electricity of 18,064 (kWh) annually and (b) can improve the energy performance index of the existing building by 34.3 percent. Thus, BIPVT-DSF can be considered as an appropriate energy efficiency solution for the building sector in the Middle East region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BIPVT-DSF; Building integrated photovoltaic thermal; Double skin façade; Energy efficiency; Quasi-dynamic energy analysis","Climate models; Heat transfer; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Thermal load; Building integrated photovoltaic; Energy performance; Energy performance indices; Methodological approach; Photovoltaic systems; Quasi dynamic model; Transfer phenomenon; Velocity profiles; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089086171

We have also synthesized two complexes with bidentate phosphines that demonstrate different types of coordination: 1) as chelating ligand (in case of 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene), that led to de-coordination of pyridine ring of N^N^C ligand and formation of a [Pt(N^C)dppb]+ complex; 2) as a bridging ligand (in case of bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) between two {Pt(N^N^C)} fragments in a dimeric complex of type [{Pt(N^N^C)}2dppm]2+. The complexes obtained were fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, and their ground-state structures and photophysical properties were studied by DFT and TD DFT methods. According to the data obtained the aromatic {benzoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine} fragment plays a key role in the photophysics of this type of complexes and the triplet 3LC state located at the N^N^C ligand proved to be the only emissive state in all the complexes prepared. Unexpectedly variations in the nature of the ligands occupying the fourth coordination position in the square-planar structural motif, changes in the mode of the N^N^C ligand coordination and even the Pt-Pt bond formation did not result in significant variations of the emission profile. The photophysical behavior of these complexes has been analyzed using DFT calculations, which are in complete agreement with the experimental data and confirmed that the lowest relaxed triplet configuration responsible for the phosphorescence in the complexes studied is located at the N^N^C ligand. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","NIR emission; Pincer ligands; Platinum complexes","Binary alloys; Chelation; Ground state; Infrared devices; Ligands; Phosphorus compounds; Photophysics; Platinum alloys; Pyridine; Spectroscopic analysis; Synthesis (chemical); 1 ,2bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene; Bidentate phosphines; Coordination position; Ground-state structures; Photophysical behavior; Photophysical properties; Photophysical studies; Spectroscopic method; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086127022

In so doing, we employed a bounds testing approach to cointegration accounting for structural breaks in the series. Key findings suggest the presence of a long-run association between underlying variables. The abundance of natural resources and economic growth of the US economy seem to weigh on environmental quality by increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Oil prices show a negative association with energy consumption as well as carbon emissions suggesting that a low oil prices regime can lead to an increase in carbon emissions and energy consumption. Interestingly, education seems to play an important role by reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, resultantly improving the US environmental quality.

Many cities in economically developed areas have developed from a single-center status to polycentricity. In this study, we used exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to identify the population centers, which identified 232 cities in China as having urban centers. COMP was used to represent urban agglomeration, and POLYD (representing how far is the city's sub-centers to the main center), POLYC (representing the number of a city's centers), and POLYP (representing the population distributed between the main center and the sub-centers) were used to indicate urban polycentricity. Night light data were used to determine the CO2 emissions from various cities in China. A mixed model was used to study the impact of urban aggregation and polycentric data on the CO2 emission efficiency in 2000 and 2010. The study found that cities with higher compactness were distributed in coastal areas, and the cities with higher multicentricity were distributed in the Yangtze River Delta and Shandong Province. The more compact the city was, the less conducive it was to improving CO2 emission efficiency. Polycentric development of the city was conducive to improving the CO2 emission efficiency, but the number of urban centers had no significant relationship with the CO2 emission efficiency. Our research showed that the compactness and multicentricity of the city had an impact on the CO2 emission efficiency and provided some planning suggestions for the low carbon development of the city. © 2020","Chinese cities; CO2 emission efficiency; compactness; polycentricity","Efficiency; Population statistics; Chinese cities; Exploratory spatial data analysis; Low-carbon development; Mixed modeling; Population centers; Shandong province; Urban agglomerations; Yangtze river delta; Carbon dioxide; agglomeration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; efficiency measurement; emission inventory; environmental economics; pollution monitoring; urban pollution; urbanization; China; Shandong; Yangtze Delta; carbon dioxide; China; city; river; urbanization; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Rivers; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084953107

Interactions of climate, site-hydrology, plant community, and groundwater chemical factors influence peatland development and functioning, including C dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes, but the role of microbial community composition is not well understood. To assess microbial functional and taxonomic dissimilarities, we used high throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) to determine bacterial and archaeal community composition in soils from twenty North American peatlands. Targeted DNA metabarcoding showed that although Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla on average, intermediate and rich fens hosted greater diversity and taxonomic richness, as well as an array of candidate phyla when compared with acidic and nutrient-poor poor fens and bogs. Moreover, pH was revealed to be the strongest predictor of microbial community structure across sites. Predictive metagenome content (PICRUSt) showed increases in specific genes, such as purine/pyrimidine and amino-acid metabolism in mid-latitude peatlands from 38 to 45° N, suggesting a shift toward utilization of microbial biomass over utilization of initial plant biomass in these microbial communities. Overall, there appears to be noticeable differences in community structure between peatland classes, as well as differences in microbial metabolic activity between latitudes. These findings are in line with a predicted increase in the decomposition and accelerated C turnover, and suggest that peatlands north of 37° latitude may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycling; Climate change; Microbiology; Peatlands","archaeon; bacterium; climate; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; Ontario; United States; wetland; Archaea; Bacteria; Climate; Microbiota; Ontario; Soil Microbiology; United States; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084492600

National policy responses to the epidemic heavily influence risk factors for HIV acquisition among this key group. Prior efforts to monitor national policy responses to HIV/AIDS among PWID were limited both in scope and coverage. In this paper we develop and validate the HIV-PWID Policy Index (HPPI) to benchmark and monitor national commitments to HIV prevention and treatment among PWID. Methods: Composite indicator was constructed employing fuzzy multilayer data envelopment analysis (FMLDEA). Model inputs based on data from 105 countries included 27 variables measured across six conceptual domains, including needle and syringe programs, opioid substitution treatment, testing and counseling, information and education, monitoring and evaluation, and legal and policy climate. Results: According to the HPPI, which ranges from 0 to 1, the top performing countries in policy commitments to HIV prevention and treatment among PWID were Spain (0.988), Switzerland (0.982), Luxembourg (0.970), Moldova (0.970), and Kyrgyzstan (0.945), whereas the poorest performing included Nicaragua (0.094), Japan, (0.094), Cape Verde (0.097), Syria (0.174), and Benin (0.185). Regionally, commitment to HIV services targeting PWID was highest among European countries (0.81) and lowest among African countries (0.50), with Oceania (0.76), Asia (0.66), and the Americas (0.56) in the mid-range. Subregional differences were even more prominent, with West and Central European nations (0.84) and Central American nations (0.22) earning the highest and lowest HPPI scores, respectively. Conclusions: The HPPI documented substantial national and regional variation in policy responses to the HIV epidemic among PWID.

We analyze the inter-county impacts of PM2.5 for 2008, 2011, and 2014 and find that even though emissions from point sources have fallen over this period, the share of PM2.5 attributable to pollution transported across county and state boundaries is still considerable in many localities. Importantly, the benefits of reduced emissions are not uniformly distributed nationwide, with 26% of counties—concentrated in the South, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest—experiencing worsening health damages since 2008. Around 30% of all US counties receive 90% of their health damages from emissions in other counties, and these damage-importing counties also tend to have lower median incomes.

Therefore, 32 pure castrated male Duroc (DU) and 32 entire male hybrid (F2) piglets were raised in a three-phase feeding regime. At each phase, two iso caloric diets differing in CP content, also known as normal protein (NP) and low protein (LP), were fed to the animals. LP diets had a fixed restriction (2%) in CP content in regards to NP ones throughout the phases of the experiment. At the end of third phase, fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis purposes and greenhouse gases emissions, together with ammonia, were tested. No changes were found in average daily feed intake (ADFI) of animals of two producing types (Duroc vs. F2) or those consumed different experimental diets (NP vs. LP) throughout the course of study. However, at the end of each experimental phase the average body weight (BW) of hybrid animals were higher compared to Duroc pigs, whereas a reverse trend was observed for average daily gain (ADG), where Duroc pigs showed greater values with respect to hybrid ones. Despite, greater CH4 and ammonia emissions in Duroc pigs with respect to F2, no significant differences were found in contaminant gases emissions between diets. Moreover, LP diets did not alter the microbial community structure, in terms of diversity, although some genera were affected by the dietary challenge. Results suggest that the impact of reducing 2% of CP content was limited for reduction in contaminant gases emissions and highlight the hypothesis that moderate change in the dietary protein levels can be overcome by long-term adaptation of the gut microbiota. Overall, the influence of the producing type on performance and digestive microbiota composition was more pronounced than the dietary effect. However, both producing types responded differently to CP restriction. The use of fecal microbiota as biomarker for predicting feed efficiency has a great potential that should be completed with robust predictive models to achieve consistent and valid results. © 2020 by the authors.

Many cities are experiencing air quality improvements due to human activity restrictions. The purpose of this study was to compare the air quality between 2020 and the previous three years, focusing on the two cities (Seoul and Daegu) where coronavirus is spreading the fastest in Korea. Significant decreases in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 were observed in both cities. In particular, compared to the same period of 2017-2019, in March 2020, PM2.5 showed remarkable reductions of 36% and 30% in Seoul and Daegu, respectively. The effects of social distancing have maximized improvements in air quality due to reduced transboundary pollutants. The PM2.5 /PM10 ratio was significantly reduced after social distancing, indicating that the contribution of traffic-related PM2.5 declined. Air quality improved overall from January to July, and the most noticeable drop in the air quality index (AQI) was observed in April. These findings indicate that relatively weak social distancing measures compared to a COVID-19 lockdown can help reduce air pollutant levels. At the same time, however, changes in air quality in the neighboring countries caused by COVID-19 control action are affecting Korea. © 2020 by the authors.

Reducing children's vulnerability and exposure to climate-related disasters is crucial to protect them against risks. Children as climate-change agents and future leaders at local, national and international level can obviously contribute to reduce vulnerabilities in families and communities and transfer knowledge to them. Moreover, children can advocate for climate change mitigation. In the long term, participation of children in the climate change mitigation programmes may lead to fewer disasters and, consequently, less risk to their health. As government policies have failed to fully address and respond to the drivers of climate-related disasters, disasters preparedness and education for children should be considered an essential activity to protect children from disaster's risks. Main factors in shaping children's behaviour and response to disaster are increasing the risk perception and knowledge of the children. When a child perceived likelihood, susceptibility and severity of a disaster (such as earthquake), then they would be able and willing to learn how to prepare for that. So far, disaster education programmes for children have mostly relied on offline school-based training. Different innovative approaches can be applied to continue education within online and digital formats including virtual reality, digital games and online platforms. However, an advocacy support by influential entities such as companies engaged in entertainment industry is required to raise the awareness of public and particularly the children about disaster preparedness. ©","adolescent health; health services research; information technology","adolescent health; awareness; child; child behavior; child health; climate change; disaster; earthquake; education program; female; government; health services research; human; human experiment; information technology; leadership; male; perception; review; virtual reality; wellbeing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092775406

In the 20th century, the integration of motorized transport expanded access to harvestable resources but created energy dependence intricately linking food with energy security. As remote communities became more vulnerable to fossil fuel price fluctuations, they also face new challenges related to climate change such as shorter winter seasons. The transitioning from fossil fuels to local renewable energy sources is widely considered both an adaptation and mitigation strategy. We empirically analyzed the food-energy nexus for nine Arctic and Subarctic communities using a Bayesian hierarchical model. We predict household-level gasoline consumption based on wild food harvest and vehicle type. We found that cars and trucks are the least energy efficient forms of transportation whereas snowmobiles are the most efficient. Also, communities with strong traditional wild food production and specialization are more likely to be energy efficient. The results suggest that indigenous culture is an important contributor to effective climate mitigation, energy, and food security. Our analysis supports community adaptation and planning for improved quantitative understanding of the food-energy nexus in rural Arctic communities. The study assists communities with energy transitions away from fossil fuels towards local renewable energy sources. © 2020 The Authors","Arctic; Bayesian modeling; Energy transition; Indigenous communities; Transportation; Wild food systems","alternative energy; Bayesian analysis; climate change; food production; food security; fossil fuel; hierarchical system; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085931832

Climate change and climate variability interact with political, economic, social, demographic, and other environmental drivers to change the scale and patterns of human migration 5. In the context of accelerating climate change and breaches to other planetary boundaries, there is an urgent need to better understand how migrant health can be protected and promoted in the context of a changing climate to manage safe and orderly migration 6. While research has focused on the separate dyads of (i) climate change and migration and (ii) climate change and health, limited consideration has been given to the nexus between climate change, migration, and health. This assessment synthesizes research that has investigated this relationship since 1990. Methods. Following an a priori protocol and with the assistance of a subject librarian, systematic searches were conducted in four academic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Global Health) and Google Scholar for empirical studies investigating migration and health in the context of climate change with any study design between 1990 and 2018. The search results underwent a two-stage screening process and the eligible studies were subjected to quality appraisal using a mixed methods appraisal tool. Data extraction and a meta-synthesis followed producing outputs deemed most useful for policy, practice, and further research. Findings. The registered protocol and search strategy revealed 1904 studies of which 180 were screened in full- text and 50 were included in the meta-synthesis. Overall, the methodological and reporting quality of the included studies was high. This assessment produced five main findings: (1) there is a paucity of empirical research investigating the climate-health-migration nexus; (2) the relationships between migration and health in the context of climate change are strongly heterogeneous and global findings are unlikely to emerge; (3) studies have examined diverse health issues associated with migration in the context of climate change including changing patterns of infectious disease, non-communicable disease, psychosocial conditions, and access to health care; (4) food and water security are important mediators between climate change, human mobility and health outcomes; (5) there is no consistent approach to integrating climate data in studies exploring migration and health in the context of climate change. Conclusions. Although migrant health and climate-related health risks are significant population health concerns, there has been limited consideration of the complex connections between climate change, migration, and health. This assessment indicates that there are potentially important intersections between climate-health- migration and that further research is required to better understand this nexus. To date and based on this assessment, it seems important that research and policy related to migration also consider the links between climate change and health and that migration is considered a determinant of health in climate change and health research. Given the diverse mobility patterns that arise in the context of climate change, responsive approaches are required that address the vulnerabilities of communities at risk of, or involved in forced migration, whilst supporting the adaptive potential of mobility responses. There is a need to develop policies that are responsive enough to protect health and health determinants especially food and water security regardless of the climate scenario. The degree to which climate data are meaningfully integrated into research exploring migration and health in the context of a changing climate warrants further consideration and analysis, to maintain quality in this emerging field of nexus research. Health systems that are migrant inclusive and climate-resilient have the potential to mitigate the worst health impacts of climate-related migration. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate variability; Health; Migration; Mobility","Diagnosis; Diseases; Health risks; Adaptive potential; Climate variability; Complex connections; Empirical research; Infectious disease; Non-communicable disease; Quality appraisals; Systematic searches; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; data assimilation; empirical analysis; health status; literature review; mental health; migratory population; nature-society relations; social impact assessment; water management; Scopus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092087201

Here we report that salt marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative tracer 226Ra at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the 2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m3 day−1. Dissolved CH4 fluxes of 27–1,200 μmol CH4 m−2 day−1 were calculated by multiplying the volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3–5.5 g CH4 m−2 year−1 with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m−2 year−1. This is equivalent to 125 (56–245) g CO2 m−2 year−1 assuming that CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to the 138 (1.1–260) g CO2 m−2 year−1 average calculated across other studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a combined total of ~30% of the global cooling potential derived from soil carbon sequestration. ©2020.

Often, a trade-off exists between reducing emissions and associated costs. In this article, a multi-objective optimization framework is proposed to determine this trade-off when operating a Community Energy Storage (CES) system in a neighbourhood with high shares of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation capacity. The Pareto frontier of costs and emissions objectives is established when the CES system would operate on the day-Ahead spot market. The emission profile is constructed based on the marginal emissions. Results show that costs and emissions can simultaneously be decreased for a range of solutions compared to reference scenarios with no battery or a battery only focused on increasing self-consumption, for very attractive CO2 abatement costs and without hampering self-consumption of PV-generated electricity. Results are robust for battery degradation, whereas battery efficiency is found to be an important determining factor for simultaneously decreasing costs and emissions. The operational schedules are tested against violating transformer, line and voltage limits through a load flow analysis. The proposed framework can be extended to employ a wide range of objectives and/or location-specific circumstances. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Community Energy Storage (CES); load flow analysis; marginal emission profiles; multi-objective optimization of costs and emissions; PV self-consumption","Climate change; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Battery degradation; Battery efficiencies; Community energy storages (CES); Economic objectives; Load flow analysis; Operational optimization; Photovoltaic electricities; Reducing emissions; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087755051

Production of hydrogen from natural gas pyrolysis has thus gained interest in research and energy technology in the near past. If the carbon by-product of this process can be used for material production or can be sequestrated, the produced hydrogen has a low carbon footprint.

While abundant data on individual advanced treatment technologies is available, there is limited knowledge regarding the removal performance of ozonation combined with multiple post-treatments and stand-alone membrane bioreactors. This is especially true for the removal of in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Therefore, we investigated the removal of 40 micropollutants and toxicity by a pilot-scale ozonation with four post-treatments: non-aerated and aerated granular activated carbon and biological filtration. In addition, two stand-alone membrane bioreactors fed with untreated wastewater and one MBR operating with ozonated partial flow recirculation were analysed. Aqueous and extracted samples were analysed in vitro for (anti)estrogenic, (anti)androgenic and mutagenic effects. To assess in vivo effects, the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum was exposed in an on-site flow-through system. Multiple in vitro effects were detected in conventionally treated wastewater including estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Ozonation largely removed these effects, while anti-estrogenic and mutagenic effects increased suggesting the formation of toxic transformation products. These effects were significantly reduced by granular activated carbon being more effective than biological filtration. The membrane bioreactor performed similarly to the conventional treatment while the membrane bioreactor with ozonation had a comparable removal performance like ozonation. Conventionally treated wastewater increased the growth of P. antipodarum. Ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic transformation products. In the post-treatments, these effects were compensated or remained unaffected. The effluents of the membrane bioreactors induced reproductive toxicity. Our results show that ozonation is effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutant concentrations. However, the formation of toxicity requires a post-treatment. Here, ozonation coupled to granular activated carbon filtration seemed the most promising treatment process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced wastewater treatment; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; On-site testing; Reporter-gene assays; Sewage; Transformation product","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Biofiltration; Bioreactors; Cell proliferation; Effluents; Granular materials; Membranes; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Sewage treatment plants; Toxicity; Biological filtration; Conventional treatments; Granular activated carbon filtration; Granular activated carbons; Reproductive toxicities; Transformation products; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; endocrine disruptor; ozone; charcoal; activated carbon; biofiltration; bioreactor; biotransformation; ozonation; pollutant removal; toxicity; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; ambient air; Article; bioassay; biofiltration; chemical analysis; controlled study; endocrine function; hydraulic retention time; in vitro study; in vivo study; mortality; municipal wastewater; mutagenic activity; mutagenicity; nonhuman; ozonation; Potamopyrgus antipodarum; priority journal; reproductive toxicity; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; sewage; snail; solid phase extraction; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water pollutant; bioreactor; filtration; membrane; waste water; Potamopyrgus antipodarum; Bioreactors; Charcoal; Filtration; Membranes; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089701054

However, data on microplastic effluent concentrations in WWTPs is collected with a broad range of methods, which impede comparisons across data sets. We provide an estimate of the annual emissions of microplastic particles by WWTPs into the ten major river basins of Germany. We analyze the concentration patterns of microplastics among different stream orders resulting from the spatial organization of WWTPs along the river network. The local in-stream microplastic concentrations are estimated through a network model that accounts for routing of microplastics through the entire fluvial network under the assumption of no losses by sedimentation, entanglement or degradation. Previous studies have observed microplastic concentrations in treated WWTPs effluents ranging several orders of magnitude. In 19 studies reviewed (2016–2020), the concentrations of observed microplastic concentrations (size range between 10 and 5000 μm) in 79 WWTP effluents ranged between 4 ∗ 100 and 4.5 ∗ 105 items/m3 with a median of around 6400 items/m3. The total, median microplastic load emitted by WWTPs in Germany is 7 ∗ 1012 items/year. The simulated microplastic concentrations, on average, tend to increase with increasing stream order suggesting that the WWTP effluent fraction accumulates with a higher rate than discharge. Simulated WWTP-derived in-stream concentrations are higher than observed concentrations with all sources of microplastic, not only those from WWTPs. Observed microplastic concentrations in rivers as well as the considerably higher simulated, WWTP-derived microplastic concentration, even for low flow conditions, are approximately one order of magnitude below currently known toxic effect levels. © 2018","Dilution; Environmental assessment; River ecotoxicology; Stream order; WWTP","Effluents; Particle size analysis; Rivers; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Concentration patterns; Effluent concentrations; Low flow condition; Microplastic particles; Orders of magnitude; Spatial organization; Wastewater treatment plant effluent; Wastewater treatment plants; Microplastic; microplastic; concentration (composition); effluent; plastic waste; point source pollution; river system; toxicity; wastewater treatment plant; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; ecotoxicity; effluent; Germany; priority journal; river; sedimentation; simulation; spatial analysis; stream (river); waste water treatment plant; water analysis; water flow; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085727748

In this study, two industrial non-premixed jet burner designs were experimentally and numerically analyzed for their sensitivity on NOx formation during the combustion of natural gas with pure oxygen and mixtures containing up to 10%v nitrogen in oxygen. The two burners differed by their design: (1) a high-momentum co-axial burner with changeable nozzle designs, and (2) a low-momentum fish-tail burner. The study revealed that the high-momentum burner design outperformed the fish-tail burner during operation in similar operating points since at 1320°C the NOx emissions could be reduced by 60% using 10%v N2 in oxygen as oxidizer and decreased by 75% during pure oxy-fuel combustion. At 1320°C, the NOx emissions could thus be reduced from 858 to 339mgkWh-1 (3%v O2 reference on a dry basis) using 10%v N2 in oxygen as oxidizer and could be lowered from 215 to 51mgkWh-1 during oxy-fuel combustion. In addition to the experiments, a fast-solving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, representing the experimental setups, was developed to analyze NOx formation. Steady-state simulations including a multi-step skeletal mechanism applicable for oxy-fuel combustion were conducted and the NOx emissions were calculated in a post-processing step. A mixture fraction-based model (PPSFM) was used to reduce the computational expense of the model and it was able to predict the NOx formation rates over the entire investigated experimental matrix with good accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Numerical and experimental study of NOx formation; Oxy-fuel and oxygen-enriched combustion systems; Scrutiny of jet and flat flame burners; Semi-industrial combustion chamber","Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Fish; Mixtures; Momentum; Natural gas; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nozzles; Oxygen; Residual fuels; Complex Processes; Computational expense; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Nitrogen content; Operating points; Oxyfuel combustion; Skeletal mechanism; Steady-state simulations; Nozzle design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085763388

A series of annual air quality model simulations corresponding to different emission reduction scenarios has been performed with a three-dimensional chemical transport modelling chain running at 3 km resolution. The emission reduction scenarios were used to develop bottom-up (locally produced) source-receptor relationships to perform a local source allocation analysis of the main atmospheric pollutants in a few polluted cities within the domain of interest. Results were compared with default top-down (EU-wide) source-receptor relationships, at roughly 7 km resolution. The results show the benefit of using the two sources of information in an integrated way. The analysis of the impacts of local emission reductions on concentrations and of the source allocation results reveals that nitrogen oxides concentrations are mostly affected by local emission sources, especially road transport and harbour related activities while the contribution of non-local sources is important for particulate matter (especially from industry and agriculture sources). For PM, larger scale modelling approaches (top-down) are necessary. Ideally, both a bottom-up approach for the characterisation of the local emission sources and a top-down larger scale approach to capture the impact of non-local sources would be necessary to perform an accurate source allocation, and provide support to the design of local air quality plans. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality models; CHIMERE; Inventory emissions; SHERPA methodology; Source allocation","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality modeling; Atmospheric pollutants; Bottom up approach; Modelling techniques; Nitrogen oxides concentration; Particulate Matter; Source-receptor relationships; Three dimensional chemicals; Atmospheric movements; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; coastal zone; design; emission control; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; source apportionment; top-down approach; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; controlled study; industry; Italy; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; priority journal; resource allocation; simulation; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090038106

Such corrugations are modeled as multiple regions with Rashba spin-orbit interactions, where concave and convex curvatures are treated as Rashba regions with opposite signs. Numerical examples for different separated Rashba-zone geometries calculated within the tight-binding approximation are provided. Remarkably, the spin-polarized current in a system with several Rashba areas can be enhanced with respect to the case with a single Rashba part of the same total area. The enhancement is larger for configurations with multiple regions with the same Rashba sign. This indicates that the increase of the spin polarization is due to the scattering of the electrons traversing regions with and without Rashba interaction. Additionally, we relate the appearance of the spin-polarized currents to novel symmetry relations between the spin-dependent conductances.

A 1-year multivariate assimilation experiment is performed to evaluate the impacts on analyses and forecast ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the integration of data improves surface analysis and forecast chlorophyll representation in a major part of the model domain, where the assimilated simulation outperforms the probabilistic skills of a non-assimilated analogous simulation. However, improvements are dependent on the reliability of the prior free ensemble. A regional diagnosis shows that surface chlorophyll is overestimated in the northern limit of the subtropical North Atlantic, where the prior ensemble spread does not cover the observation's variability. There, the system cannot deal with corrections that alter the equilibrium between the observed and unobserved state variables producing instabilities that propagate into the forecast. To alleviate these inconsistencies, a 1-month sensitivity experiment in which the assimilation process is only applied to model fluctuations is performed. Results suggest the use of this methodology may decrease the effect of corrections on the correlations between state vectors. Overall, the experiments presented here evidence the need of refining the description of model's uncertainties according to the biogeochemical characteristics of each oceanic region. © 2020 Author(s).",,"chlorophyll; ensemble forecasting; error correction; experimental study; multivariate analysis; satellite altimetry; satellite data; stochasticity; subtropical region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095736369

For a full utilization of visible light, however, a serious light scattering of the aqueous suspension of TiO2 in the visible region, which is generally experienced, should be avoided. Here, we report a preparation of optically transparent colloidal dispersion of TiO2 by the sol/gel reaction of TiCl4 through progressive hydrolysis/condensation under the basic condition without any calcination processes. The TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2(NPs)) obtained were characterized as an amorphous particle (∼10-15 nm) having a microcrystal domain of anatase within several nm by XRD, Raman spectroscopies, XRF, XAFS, TG/DTA, and HRTEM, respectively. The energy-resolved distribution of carrier electron traps in TiO2(NPs) as a fingerprint of TiO2 was characterized through reversed double-beam photo-acoustic spectroscopy to have a close similarity to that of TiO2(ST-01) as well as the observation of carrier traps by transient absorption spectroscopy. Though the powder TiO2(NP) itself was not dispersed well in aqueous solution, the wet TiO2(NPs) as prepared before being dried up provided a completely transparent aqueous dispersion under the acidic condition (1 M HCl). Addition of methanol enabled the colloidal dispersion (TiO2(NPs, MeOH/H2O, 0.1 M HCl)) to keep the optical transparency for longer than 1 year (550 days), which is the first example of TiO2 dispersion storable for such a long period. TiO2(NPs, MeOH/H2O) exhibited a moderate photocatalytic reactivity of H2 evolution with a quantum yield of ∼2.6% upon 365 nm light irradiation. An optically transparent thin film of TiO2(NPs, MeOH/H2O) was also successfully prepared on a glass plate to exhibit an enhanced hydrophilicity upon UV light irradiation.

Environmental disasters and cities’ high degree of exposure to these risks are well known. What is apparent is the close relationship between these disasters and the urban transformations generated by approaches which, quoting the writer Amitav Gohsh, can be defined as outcomes of the Great Derangement Era. Through our research and design project; we have outlined the need to break free from the uncanny feeling caused by the specific phenomena which make territories more fragile and vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events. The design process illustrated, which involved a small town in central-western Sardinia, is an example of how the construction of a new urban landscape and architecture can take place starting, not only from the contingent risks of emergency situations, but rather from the recognition of any potential risks. With the goal of setting up an open and sustainable territorial plan, the case study has been designed as an approach to climate adaptation even if in Sardinia the link between climate change and flood risk has not been studied in depth and no evidence of this link has yet emerged. The project scenarios of an urban plan for one of the local governments in Sardinia, highlighted in the paper, has been conceived as a path of coevolution between new urban transformations and ecological dynamics of the environment. © 2020 by the authors.

The amount of applied water and duration of the previous dry period are considered the main factors affecting the magnitude of the CO2 peak, but the preceding change in soil wettability, triggered by low soil water content, could also be an important contributor. We investigated the effect of soil water repellency (SWR, assessed by water drop penetration time test) on the short-term release of CO2 upon wetting of dry soils with different water quantities. The experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions using homogeneous and autoclaved soil from two locations in South Wales (UK) in both wettable and extremely water-repellent states. The CO2 efflux was measured using chambers above and below the samples. Upon wetting, CO2 efflux was up to 10 times lower in water-repellent soils as a result of rapid percolation through preferential pathways, with only a small amount of water (up to 10%) retained in the soil. Total CO2 efflux was proportional to the water retained in the soil after infiltration, suggesting that the release of CO2 occurred only from limited pore-spaces of the soil. The quick CO2 release suggests that chemical or biochemical processes, rather than microbial respiration, is the main source of CO2 efflux in this study. Part of the CO2 released was transported to the bottom chamber, which under natural conditions could enhance the entrapment of gas in the subsoil. This study shows that alterations in the water-filled pore-space as a result of SWR significantly reduced the CO2 efflux upon wetting and suggests that SWR could be a key factor when investigating and predicting C fluxes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Birch effect; C emissions; CO2 pulse; Hydrophobicity; Rain pulses; Soil degassing","Soil moisture; Solvents; Waterproofing; Wetting; Biochemical process; Laboratory conditions; Microbial respiration; Preferential pathways; Soil water repellency; Water drop penetration time; Water repellent soils; Water-filled pore space; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; soil carbon; soil water; subsoil; wetting; South Wales; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086080509

Optimum forest vegetation conditions for maximum nectar emission by Robinia flowers were defined. A number of methods defining taxation indices, sugar content in nectar, blooming intensity and honey productivity was used to solve the assigned tasks. Carried out comparative analysis of honey productivity indices showed that local topography influences the blooming terms of plants and nectar emission. So, the most productive locality for beekeeping is locality with gulches. It provides the best honey yield under favourable meteorology and forest vegetation conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Food products; Forestry; Meteorology; Productivity; Taxation; Topography; Vegetation; Adverse weather; Comparative analysis; Forest vegetation; Local topography; Number of methods; Productivity index; Robinia pseudo-acacia; Sugar content; Sugar industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096418632

This change can be supported by improving relations with relevant stakeholders, engaging comprehensively with them, and creating strong awareness about issues such as ecosystem protection, health-related safeguards, and the careful use of resources. In this regard, through stakeholder engagement and a review of traditional business models, the circular economy can contribute to transforming the corporate culture to ensure the concurrent enhancement of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. This study verified the role of stakeholder engagement in establishing and strengthening the sustainability culture in a company transitioning toward a circular economy. The case study research methodology was applied, referencing a single firm—operating in the oil and energy industry—representing one of the best practices in the international context, even if some efforts are still required to reduce downstream emissions. The findings underline the contributing role played by stakeholder engagement in establishing values and principles compliant with environmental protection and community wellbeing.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), isolated from the rhizosphere of halophile plants, for the growth, Na+/K+ balance, ethylene emission, and gene expression of wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under saline conditions (100 mmol L−1 NaCl) for 14 d. A total of 118 isolates obtained from saline soils of the deserts of Iran were tested for their capacity as PGPRs. Out of the 118 isolates, 17 could solubilize phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2), 5 could produce siderophores, and 16 could synthesize indole-3-acetic acid. Additionally, PGPRs were also evaluated for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the ability of 28 PGPR isolates to promote growth, regulate Na+/K+ balance, and decrease ethylene emissions in plants. The most efficient PGPRs were Arthrobacter aurescens, Bacillus atrophaeus, Enterobacter asburiae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Gene expression analysis revealed the up-regulation of H+-PPase, HKT1, NHX7, CAT, and APX expression in roots of Enterobacter-inoculated salt-stressed plants. Salt-tolerant rhizobacteria exhibiting plant growth-promoting traits can facilitate the growth of wheat plants under saline conditions.

However, the high-temperature treatment typically involved during the activation of Ni-N/C catalysts makes the origin of the high activity elusive. In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active sites and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits a ∼4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms the molecular Ni2+-N4 sites of NiPc into Ni+-N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+-N3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves breakage of Ni-N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni-N-C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with microkinetic modeling suggest that the Ni-N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy. In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further corroborate the importance of reduced Ni+ species in boosting the CO2RR activity.

Most studies have focused on the soot reduction potential of shorter carbon chain oxygenates, whilst longer carbon chain oxygenates are still relatively unexplored. In this work, the soot reduction potential of long carbon chain oxygenates having similar thermo-physical and chemical properties to those of diesel have been studied, viz., 2-octanone (ketone), 1-octanol (alcohol), hexyl acetate (ester) and octanal (aldehyde). These oxygenates were injected at high pressure into a constant volume chamber maintained at high ambient temperature conditions, and their spray flames were investigated using a high-speed, two-colour pyrometry system. It was found that for the same injected fuel mass, the oxygenates reduced the overall soot when compared to diesel. Small differences in sooting tendencies were observed between different oxygenated moieties but these were smaller than those relative to diesel. The absence of aromatic groups and the presence of oxygen directly bonded to carbon atoms seemed to have a larger effect on soot reduction than the oxygenated functional group. The oxygenates altered the local oxygen equivalence ratio in the spray, influencing the soot formation and its distribution in the flame. Under the high pressure conditions studied, the average sooting tendency of the long carbon-chain oxygenates studied increased in the order of: ester< aldehyde ~ alcohol<ketone. © 2020","Combustion fundamentals; Constant volume chamber; Oxygenates; Soot","Aldehydes; Carbon; Diesel engines; Dust; Esters; Flame spraying; Ketones; Oxygen; Soot; Combustion efficiencies; Constant volume chamber; Equivalence ratios; High-pressure condition; Long carbon chains; Oxygenated compounds; Physical and chemical properties; Temperature conditions; High pressure effects; alcohol; aldehyde; carbon; ester; functional group; ketone; oxygen; Article; chemical structure; combustion; controlled study; diesel engine; environmental temperature; flame; hyperbarism; oxidation; priority journal; pyrometry; signal noise ratio; soot; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087883014

To get some understanding of their adaptability, plantations of similar provenance but located in climatically contrasting sites can be compared. Here we study the growth dynamics and their relationship with climate and drought in two Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations located in the center (Sierra de Guadarrama, wetter site) and south (Sierra Nevada, drier site) of Spain, the latter situated at the southernmost distribution limit of the species. Our objectives are to quantify the trends in radial growth of these plantations, to quantify the influence of climate on growth, and to project the plantations growth as a function of forecasted climate. Results reveal that the plantations from the drier site show lower, and less responsive to climate, growth and greater resilience than those from the wetter site. Furthermore, if the current climate-growth relationships continue in the future, these plantations would maintain the current limited growth rate during the 21st century. On the contrary, plantations from the wetter site show higher growth rate and more resistance to drought, and they are projected to increase growth under the warmer conditions forecasted for the 21st century. Our study shows that plantations in drier sites may have a great capacity to acclimate to local climate conditions and would not be negatively impacted by the projected climate warming. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Dendroecology; Drought stress; Pinus sylvestris; Plantations; SPEI","adaptation; climate change; climate conditions; coniferous tree; drought; drought stress; growth; growth rate; plantation forestry; Spain; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089153088

This work presents a concept for heating demand and resulting CO2 emissions prediction based on a 3D city model in CityGML format in various scenarios under the consideration of a changing climate. Therefore, the Helsinki Energy and Climate Atlas, that provides detailed information for individual buildings conducting the heating demand, is integrated using the CityGML Energy Application Domain Extension (Energy ADE) to provide energy-relevant information together with the 3D city model based on a standardized data model stored in a CityGML database, called 3DCityDB. The simulation environment SimStadt is extended to retrieve the information stored within the Energy ADE schema, use it during simulations, and write simulation results back to the 3DCityDB. Due to climate change, a heating demand reduction of 4% per decade is predicted. By 2035, a reduction of 0.7 TWh is calculated in the normal and of 1.5 TWh in the advanced refurbishment scenario. Including the proposed improvements of the district heating network, heating CO2 emissions are predicted to be reduced by up to 82% by 2035 compared to 1990. The City of Helsinki's assumed heating demand reduction through the modernization of 2.0 TWh/a by 2035 is not achieved with a 3% refurbishment rate. Furthermore, the reduction of CO2 emissions is mainly achieved through lower CO2 emission factors of the district heating network in Helsinki. © 2020 by the authors.","3D city model; 3DCityDB; CityGML; CO2 emission; Energy demand prediction; EnergyADE; SimStadt",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092617783

Nitrogen oxides (NOx D NO C NO2) emissions induce an increase in ozone (O3) and a depletion of methane (CH4), leading to a climate warming and a cooling, respectively. In contrast to CO2, non-CO2 contributions to the atmospheric composition are short lived and are thus characterised by a high spatial and temporal variability. In this study, we investigate the influence of weather patterns and their related transport processes on composition changes caused by aviationattributed NOx emissions. This is achieved by using the atmospheric chemistry model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy). Representative weather situations were simulated in which unit NOx emissions are initialised in specific air parcels at typical flight altitudes over the North Atlantic flight sector. By explicitly calculating contributions to the O3 and CH4 concentrations induced by these emissions, interactions between trace gas composition changes and weather conditions along the trajectory of each air parcel are investigated. Previous studies showed a clear correlation between the prevailing weather situation at the time when the NOx emission occurs and the climate impact of the NOx emission. Here, we show that the aviation NOx contribution to ozone is characterised by the time and magnitude of its maximum and demonstrate that a high O3 maximum is only possible if the maximum occurs early after the emission. Early maxima occur only if the air parcel, in which the NOx emission occurred, is transported to lower altitudes, where the chemical activity is high. This downward transport is caused by subsidence in highpressure systems. A high ozone magnitude only occurs if the air parcel is transported downward into a region in which the ozone production is efficient. This efficiency is limited by atmospheric NOx and HOx concentrations during summer and winter, respectively. We show that a large CH4 depletion is only possible if a strong formation of O3 occurs due to the NOx emission and if high atmospheric H2O concentrations are present along the air parcel's trajectory. Only air parcels, which are transported into tropical areas due to highpressure systems, experience high concentrations of H2O and thus a large CH4 depletion. Avoiding climate-sensitive areas by rerouting aircraft flight tracks is currently computationally not feasible due to the long chemical simulations needed. The findings of this study form a basis of a better understanding of NOx climate-sensitive areas and through this will allow us to propose an alternative approach to estimate aviation's climate impact on a day-to-day basis, based on computationally cheaper meteorological simulations without computationally expensive chemistry. This comprises a step towards a climate impact assessment of individual flights, here with the contribution of aviation NOx emissions to climate change, ultimately enabling routings with a lower climate impact by avoiding climate-sensitive regions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air transportation; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; climate change; concentration (composition); methane; nitrogen oxides; ozone; traffic emission; weather; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095569676

In the study, we first collected statistical yearbooks, high resolution remotely sensed imageries, and 3895 usable questionnaires for the urban areas of Kaifeng; then measured the carbon emissions from household energy consumption, using the accounting method provided in the IPCC GHG Inventory Guidelines; and finally applied both exploratory and explanatory statistical methods to characterize the spatial pattern of carbon emissions at high resolution, identify key influencing factors, and gain better understanding of the spatial differentiation mechanism of urban residential carbon emissions. Our study reached the following conclusions: (1) Central heating facilities with controllable flow are important for carbon emissions reduction, but its spatial distribution shows unfairness; (2) Spatial clusters of high carbon emission areas were primarily located in the outer suburbs of the city, validated to some extent the hypothesis that urban sprawl has a driving effect on the increasing urban residential carbon emissions; (3) Factors like size of residential area, family structure, life style, personal preference and behavior rather than household income have significant impacts on household carbon emissions, implying that effective control of residential areas, promotion of family life and low-carbon lifestyle, and effective guidance of proper behaviors and preferences will play a crucial role in reducing urban residential carbon emissions; and (4) Most of the identified influencing factors exhibit clear and specific spatial patterns and gradients of impact, implying that measures for urban residential carbon emission reduction should be adapted to location conditions. The study has generated a set of concrete evidences and improved understandings of the spatially differentiated mechanisms upon which the formation and deployment of any effective strategies, policies and measures for reducing urban residential carbon emissions should be based. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Differentiation mechanism; GWR; Residential energy consumption; Spatial pattern","carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; empirical analysis; household energy; household income; residential energy; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; urban area; urban sprawl; accounting; Article; carbon footprint; China; embedding; empiricism; energy consumption; family; family life; family size; heating; household; household income; human; lifestyle; questionnaire; residential area; urban area; urban population; city; China; Henan; Kaifeng; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Heating; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087746908

The multi-model climate high-resolution projections for the baseline period (1961–1990) are validated against the observed climate variables from 8 meteorological stations in the region. The temperature projections from the GFDL CM2.1 model are found in good agreement with the observations; however, no single model investigated in the present study reasonably simulates precipitation and therefore multi-model ensemble is used for precipitation projections. The average annual temperature is projected to increase by 4.5 °C, 3.98 °C, and 6.93 °C by the end of the twenty-first century under A1B, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. In contrast, an insignificant variation in precipitation projection is observed under all the 3 scenarios. The analysis indicates that, unlike the 13 climate zones under the updated Köppen-Geiger climate classification scheme, the J&K Himalaya broadly falls into 10 main climate zones only namely, “3 subtropical (~ 11%), 4 temperate (~ 19%), and 3 cold desert (~ 70%) zones”. The projected climate change under the 3 emission scenarios indicates significant changes in the distribution of prevalent climate zones. The cold desert climate zone in the Ladakh region would shrink by ~ 22% and correspondingly the subtropical and temperate zones would expand due to the projected climate change.

Appropriate turbulence-chemistry interaction models are needed to address this combustion regime via computational modelling. Following a similar analysis to that used in the Extended EDC model (E-EDC), the purpose of the present work is to develop and test a Novel Extended Eddy Dissipation Concept model (NE-EDC) to be better able to predict flameless combustion. In the E-EDC and NE-EDC models, in order to consider the influence of the dilution on the reaction rate and temperature, the coefficients are considered to be space dependent as a function of the local Reynolds and Damköhler numbers. A comparative study of four models is carried out: the E-EDC and NE-EDC models, the EDC model with specific, fixed values of the model coefficients optimized for the current application, and the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) model with pure fuel and air as boundary conditions for flamelet generation. The models are validated using experimental data of the Delft Lab Scale furnace (9 kW) burning Natural Gas (T = 446 K) and preheated air (T = 886 K) injected via separate jets, at an overall equivalence ratio of 0.8. among the considered models, the NE-EDC results show the best agreement with experimental data, with a slight improvement over the E-EDC model and a significant improvement over the EDC model with tuned constant coefficients and the FGM model. © 2020","CFD; Eddy Dissipation Concept; Flameless combustion; Flamelet Generation Manifold; Lab-scale furnace; MILD combustion","Computational chemistry; Combustion efficiencies; Comparative studies; Computational modelling; Constant coefficients; Eddy dissipation concept; Flameless combustion; Flamelet generated manifolds; Turbulence-chemistry interactions; Combustion; fuel; natural gas; air; Article; chemical reaction; combustion; dilution; eddy diffusivity; furnace; mathematical model; prediction; priority journal; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087310088

This affects the health and life quality of citizens, especially in highly populated areas. Despite this situation, some cities have been very effective in controlling emission sources. According to the state of the art related to environment and private transportation, congestions taxes are powerful policies in terms of reducing the pollution generated by vehicles. However, when applying this kind of policies it is not easy to demonstrate emissions reduction, so that, its effectiveness is debated. Measuring vehicle emissions on the road is not an easy task. Hence, there are many models to approach emissions estimation. One of them is the International Emission Model (IVE), the problem with this and other models is the lack of data accuracy and the difficulties in the preprocessing of it. The objective of this study is to foster the development of emissions inventories from mobile sources using the IVE model, through making data processing easy. To this purpose, it was addressed the main problem concerning the low quality of velocity and altitude data registered with GPS and proposed the development of an application capable of automatically filtering the atypical route data and softening the curve data with the Smoothing Spline method. The application calculated the vehicle-specific power (VSP) Bins according to the IVE model and automatically exported the results to the database of the model. As a result, it was possible to show the importance of adequately processing the data from the GPS equipment and the significant variations in the results of the emissions calculations if no data correction is conducted. This application can motivate more cities to apply vehicle congestion policies, since the estimation of emissions is easy to get and provided with more accurate results. © 2020 IEEE.","Congestion pricing; GPS Errors; IVE Model; Vehicular Emissions app","Costs; Curve fitting; Data handling; Emission control; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Congestion pricing; Emissions estimation; Emissions inventory; Emissions reduction; Environmental pollutions; Private transportation; Smoothing spline; Vehicle specific power; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098553735

The aim of the thesis work is a primary school built in 1938 within the historical centre of Viterbo. The work touched on three different areas of design: the design of the internal and external spaces, annexed to the school building, finding solutions for a flexible and functional distribution in line with the theories of modern pedagogy, moving from a school of homologation to a school of diversity enhancement. This was joined by a study concerning the original elevations and constructive features, bearers of historical and aesthetic values, which resulted in the proposal for conservative restoration of the Terranova plaster and the original iron-window profiles. Finally, attention was paid to energy upgrading and efficiency, in line with regulatory provisions. The interventions did not only concern the building envelope (through a thermal upgrading of the original iron-windows, the insulation of the flat roof and the indoor thermal coat of the perimeter walls), but also the system (through the replacement of the boiler with a heat pump, integrated with the photovoltaic system placed on the roof, the inclusion of thermostatic valves and lighting design with the replacement of fluorescent lamps with LED ones). © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Architectural design; Climate change; Iron; Laws and legislation; Lighting; Photovoltaic cells; Roofs; Solar buildings; Thermal insulation; Aesthetic value; Building envelopes; Finding solutions; Historical analysis; Lighting designs; Photovoltaic systems; Primary schools; Window profiles; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097194819

The feasible interventions consist in improving the energy performance of the building envelope, in inserting efficient technological systems and using renewable energy sources where possible. The compatibility between the architectural constraints of the building and its more sustainable future use represents a crucial challenge. This work presents the interventions designed and realized on a small villa located in the Prati district, in Rome. Starting from the requests of the client, the primary objective was to create a comfortable house both in the winter and in the summer season, with widespread use of automation systems for managing the utilities. In line with the current energy scenario, the interventions were oriented to energy efficiency, the reduction of polluting emissions, the electrification of utilities and the use of renewable energy sources. The proposed solutions showed high gains in terms of energy saving even if the changes to the building envelope were limited by the desire to preserve the values of the cultural heritage. Therefore, a virtuous refurbishment can effectively respond to current energy efficiency goals. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Automation; Electric utilities; Historic preservation; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar buildings; Architectural constraints; Building envelopes; Energy performance; Historical buildings; Polluting emission; Renewable energy source; Technological system; Use of renewable energies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097185746

The project team adopted a variety of established and innovative engagement strategies including website and social media channels, an online platform, a physical community energy hub where meetings and workshops were held and an interactive virtual energy model could be accessed, and in-home smart voice-controlled and visual technologies. The influence of the project and the effectiveness of the engagement tools to generate behaviour changes were investigated through a survey, workshops and interviews.

It is therefore important to understand what shapes community acceptance and identify policy responses. This paper presents a case study of community acceptance of a large-scale solar farm in the UK, the first to be classified as 'nationally significant' infrastructure. In doing so, it provides the first empirical study of community acceptance of a large-scale solar farm in a developed country context, building on existing studies which use hypothetical approaches such as choice experiments, or surveys which measure general attitudes rather than responses to specific developments. The paper uses mixed methods (quantitative content analysis of online comments on the planning proposal; qualitative semi-structured interviews with local residents and key stakeholders; and participant observation) to identify determinants shaping community acceptance of large-scale solar farms. We discover 28 determinants which we group into eight categories: aesthetic, environmental, economic, project details, temporal, social, construction and process. We argue that these findings help to reveal broader issues underlying community acceptance of solar farms and other renewable energy infrastructure: 'green-on-green' tensions; issues of scale and place attachment; policy, process and justice. We also contribute a novel understanding of community acceptance as 'relational', by which we mean it is informed by the deployment of other energy technologies and the wider energy policy landscape, not just the specific project. We conclude with recommendations for how policymakers can respond to the issues identified by this article. © 2020","Community acceptance; Infrastructure; Mixed methods; Public acceptance; Renewable energy; Solar farm","Binary alloys; Climate change; Potassium alloys; Choice experiments; Developed countries; Energy technologies; Participant observations; Potential barriers; Quantitative content analysis; Renewable energies; Semi structured interviews; Uranium alloys; alternative energy; climate change; energy policy; policy making; questionnaire survey; solar power; stakeholder; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090572777

In this situation, the social mechanisms that play a role in any scientific endeavor become particularly exposed. By discussing historical, philosophical, and sociological (HPS) aspects of the field's current “cultures of prediction” together with the physical science community in a physical science journal, we aim to provide an entry point into HPS reasoning for climate scientists interested in reflecting on their field and science in general. This paper, first, introduces our perspective on “science as culture” and climate modeling as “regulatory science” and, second, highlights and connects relevant ideas from the three commentaries that follow it. In so doing, we hope to give a fuller picture of climate science, the interplay it engenders between HPS and the physical sciences, the distinctions that it gives rise to as compared to some of the more traditional, exact, sciences in which it is rooted and its place in society including its role in scientific policy advice. © 2020.

This study investigated the energy and environmental benefits for private passenger vehicles under various scenarios in Metro Manila, the Philippines. The findings are informative to design policy implications for energy and environmental benefits. The study applied the Gaussian copula-based multinomial logit (MNL)-linear regression to develop the household vehicle ownership and energy consumption model using the disaggregated data of 1,795 households collected in 2017. The simulated vehicle fleet and energy consumption were then adopted to extrapolate energy demand, emissions, and public health risks for a 2010–2050 horizon using the bottom-up approach. Under the baseline scenario, the energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will reach 5.45 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) and 16.93 million tonnes (Mt) in 2050, respectively. The amounts of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter 10 (PM10) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) emissions, and economic loss of health risks will be 6,214 tonnes (t), 62,136 t, 536 t, 10,550 t, 1,348 t, 996 t, and 237 Million USD, respectively, under the baseline scenario in 2050. Improvement of accessibility significantly reduces energy demand and CO2 emissions. Introduction of Euro 6 cars and Euro 4 buses and Public Utility Jeepneys noticeably improves public health.

For modern global high-resolution models with a horizontal resolution of tens of kilometers, this is an oversight since there are likely grid cells where the physical output of a climate model is compared with a statistically interpolated quantity instead of actual measurements of the climate system. In this paper, we quantify the impact of geographic sampling on the relative performance of high-resolution climate model representations of precipitation extremes in boreal winter (December–January–February) over the contiguous United States (CONUS), comparing model output from five early submissions to the HighResMIP subproject of the CMIP6 experiment. We find that properly accounting for the geographic sampling of weather stations can significantly change the assessment of model performance. Across the models considered, failing to account for sampling impacts the different metrics (extreme bias, spatial pattern correlation, and spatial variability) in different ways (both increasing and decreasing). We argue that the geographic sampling of weather stations should be accounted for in order to yield a more straightforward and appropriate comparison between models and observational data sets, particularly for high-resolution models with a horizontal resolution of tens of kilometers. While we focus on the CONUS in this paper, our results have important implications for other global land regions where the sampling problem is more severe. © Author(s) 2020.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092654285

In Dublin, a major source of PM2.5 is diesel exhaust, brake dust, and rubber tire particles from vehicles. Particulate matter can be deposited onto the surface of vegetation thereby removing it from the atmosphere. The presence of trees can increase the amount of surface area on which deposition can occur, but they can also alter wind flow in a way that increases local pollutant concentrations. This study assesses the effect of urban trees on removing PM2.5 using a novel combination of air quality monitoring and the i-Tree Eco (UFORE) deposition model during rush and non-rush hours with different traffic volumes. Monitoring was conducted in a tree alley and an area of no vegetation along the Drumcondra Road Lower in Dublin. Results indicated that there was no difference in PM2.5 concentrations outside of rush hours, but concentrations were significantly lower in the tree alley during rush hours compared to the street section with no trees. The i-Tree Eco model calculated that the tree alley could remove approximately 3 kg of PM2.5 on a yearly basis. Air monitoring found that the presence of trees resulted in a maximum air quality improvement of 126 %, more than double what was predicted by i-Tree Eco. While this study provides an initial exploration of trees and air quality in Dublin, further research combining these techniques with the measurement of local wind speed and direction would allow for a better understanding of how Dublin's trees can affect its air quality. The results from this study suggest that they do cause a degree of air quality improvement and can be used to inform national clean air strategies aimed at reducing pollutant emissions. © 2020 The Author(s)","i-Tree Eco model; PM2.5 air pollution; Public health and clean air policy; Traffic planning","Air quality; Deposition; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Tire industry; Vegetation; Wind; Air quality improvement; Air quality monitoring; Deposition modeling; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Initial exploration; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Wind speed and directions; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087406768

The Energetic Profile identifies energy-saving opportunities and defines the key energetic-architectural typologies of office buildings that are rarely incorporated in environmentally conscious standards. For each parameter, a methodology is presented to calculate the total energy impact (cooling, heating, and lighting). This is illustrated by an assessment of a theoretical office building located in a hot and humid climate.

In this work we develop an optimal vehicle scheduling approach for next generation PT systems, considering the instance of mixed electric / hybrid fleet. Our objective is that of investigating to what extent electrification, coupled with optimal fleet management, can yield operational cost savings for PT operators. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to address the problem of optimal scheduling of a mixed fleet of electric and hybrid / non-electric buses, coupled with an ad-hoc decomposition scheme aimed at enhancing the scalability of the proposed MILP. Two case studies arising from the PT network of the city of Luxembourg are employed in order to validate the model; sensitivity analysis to fleet design parameters is performed, specifically in terms of fleet size and fleet composition. Conclusions point to the fact that careful modelling and handling of mixed-fleet conditions are necessary to achieve operational savings, and that marginal savings gradually reduce as more conventional buses are replaced by their electric counterparts. We believe the methodology proposed may be a key part of advanced decision support systems for policymakers and operators that are dealing with the on-going transition from conventional bus fleets towards greener transport solutions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposition scheme; MILP; Mixed-fleet; Public transport optimization; Vehicle scheduling","article; cost control; decision support system; decomposition; human; Luxembourg; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066613199

However, cities have accumulated organic carbon in their soils and vegetation over centuries and offer important ecosystem services for the city through carbon storage. The aim of this study is to estimate the total carbon storage of the central European city of Berlin by combining the organic carbon (Corg) stored in soils and the carbon found in aboveground biomass. We used 432 soil samples that were taken across 18 different land uses in order to estimate the carbon content for each land use based on the laboratory findings of each sample. This large amount of data, which is excellent for such a study, provides an important basis for the evaluation and analysis of the carbon storage potential. Taking into account the degree of soil sealing, the carbon calculations for each individual land use were then transferred to the total area of Berlin in order to produce a spatially explicit carbon map. Soil carbon stocks are reported as units of carbon either as kg/m² or in t/ha for each block. The carbon storage was estimated for both topsoil and subsoil. In addition, we estimated the carbon stored in 596,975 street trees and park trees according to the biomass equations for each tree species. The results show that more than two-thirds of the carbon present is accounted for by soils, which makes them the largest carbon reservoir of the city. Park trees store the most carbon in urban trees apart from urban forest trees. The total carbon stock of Berlin was estimated to be 24,087,344 tons, which corresponds to an approximate quantity of 270 t/ha. The distribution of carbon storage across the city shows the highest values towards the city boundaries. This holds true for the soil as well as the vegetation. The greatest quantities of total carbon are stored in the subsoils of the city's suburbs. This study is the first of its kind to combine the carbon stocks of the soil and the vegetation in a city in order to estimate its carbon storage potential. It provides detailed soil carbon maps and biomass estimations, which can contribute to carbon storage investigations in other cities with similar climatic and ecological conditions. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Carbon dynamics; Soil organic carbon; Urban carbon storage; Urban vegetation","aboveground biomass; carbon storage; land use change; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil emission; soil organic matter; subsoil; topsoil; urban area; urban forestry; Berlin; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088025934

To meet the increasing socioeconomic development and sustainable demands for food supply, forestland conversion to cropland occurs around the world. However, the effects of forestland conversion to cropland as well as of tillage and fertilization practices on soil N2O emissions are still not well understood, especially in subtropical regions. Therefore, field experiments were carried out to continuously monitor soil N2O emissions after the conversion of forestland to cropland in a subtropical region in Southwest China. One forestland site and four cropland sites were selected: forestland (CK), short-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, NC-TF and NC-T), and long-term croplands (tillage with and without fertilization, LC-TF and LC-T). The annual cumulative N2O flux was 0.21 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in forestland. After forestland conversion to cropland, the annual cumulative N2O flux significantly increased by 76-491%. In the short-term and long-term croplands, tillage with fertilization induced cumulative soil N2O emissions that were 94% and 235% higher than those from tillage without fertilization. Fertilization contributed 63% and 84% to increased N2O emissions in the short-term and long-term croplands, respectively. A stepwise regression analysis showed that soil N2O emissions from croplands were mainly influenced by soil NO3- and NH4+ availability and WFPS (water-filled pore space). Fertilization led to higher soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, which thus resulted in larger N2O fluxes.

These anomalies, or Funny Looking Things (FLTs), occur in a confined spatial and temporal region of the seismic. They have a concave up seismic appearance along cross section. Bright seismic amplitudes can be a direct hydrocarbon indicator, or representative of strong lithological contrasts, and/or acquisition artifacts. We set out to investigate misinterpreted seismic anomalies along cross sectional lines. Therefore, we apply seismic attributes to indicate these bright spot features, which we interpret to be submarine gullies looking along time slice intersections, can possibly be mistaken for hydrocarbon anomalies in cross sectional view. However, we cannot fully rule out the presence of hydrocarbons since it is common for gas sands to create similar anomalies. Previously drilled wells within the survey (Korimako-1 and Tarapunga-1) point towards a lack of hydrocarbon potential in the subsurface. While it is possible these bright spots are due to hydrocarbon presence, we present a more likely hypothesis: the lithology of the interfluve sediments is similar to the gully-margin drapes but differs from the gully sediment fill. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","Seismic attributes; Seismic geomorphology; Seismic impedance","geomorphology; hydrocarbon resource; seismic data; seismic source; seismic survey; spatiotemporal analysis; New Zealand; Pacific Ocean; Taranaki Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093680737

The presented approach encompasses: (1) the strategic identification of focal areas in terms of climate adaptation needs, (2) comprehensive diagnosis of local ecological vulnerability and natural adaptive potential to build adaptive capacity, and (3) incorporation of natural adaptive potential through an identified set of planning and design tools. For diagnosis and strategic environmental impact assessment, the multicriteria analysis has been elaborated. The described procedure is applied to the City of Warsaw on the strategic level, by elaboration of the ranking of districts in terms of priority to take adaptation actions based on climatic threats, demographic vulnerability, and assessment of Warsaw Green Infrastructure potential. For further analysis at the planning and design stage, the district with the most urgent adaptation needs has been chosen, and within its borders, two neighborhoods (existing and planned one) with diagnosed ecological sensitivity were selected. Both case studies were analyzed in terms of environmental conditions, urban structure, and planning provisions.

Based on the first five low-order Balmer emission lines detected in the composite spectra of these galaxies (Hα through Hϵ), we derive a nebular attenuation curve that is similar in shape to that of the Galactic extinction curve, suggesting that the dust covering fraction and absorption/scattering properties along the lines of sight to massive stars at high redshift are similar to those of the average Milky Way sight line. The curve derived here implies nebular reddening values that are, on average, systematically larger than those derived for the stellar continuum. In the context of stellar population synthesis models that include the effects of stellar multiplicity, the difference in reddening of the nebular lines and stellar continuum may imply molecular cloud crossing timescales that are a factor of ≥ 3× longer than those inferred for local molecular clouds, star formation rates that are constant or increasing with time such that newly formed and dustier OB associations always dominate the ionizing flux, and/or that the dust responsible for reddening the nebular emission may be associated with nonmolecular (i.e., ionized and neutral) phases of the interstellar medium.

The molecules are abbreviated as monomer, dimer, and trimer as they comprised one, two, and three pairs of core and spacer combinations linked to ring IV, respectively. Hot-stage optical polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies confirmed that all of them exhibit an enantiotropic nematic phase with additional monotropic or enantiotropic smectic mesophases. Large values of 13C-1H dipolar couplings of the order of 11 kHz are observed for all the cases for the terminal carbon C1 of the core unit. These high values indicated that the corresponding CH vector is collinear with the long axis of the molecule, which itself is aligned parallel to the magnetic field. In contrast, the terminal carbon of the ring IV (C19/C17) exhibits a relatively smaller value in the range of 2.0-2.5 kHz, reflecting the divergent local dynamics at different sections of the mesogens. The orientational order parameters of the phenyl rings computed from the 13C-1H dipolar couplings have been used to obtain the conformation of the mesogens in the nematic phase. It is concluded that the dimer and trimer exhibit C2 and C3 symmetry with the ring IV connected by spacers tilted away from the symmetry axis by 35.9 and 90° for the two cases, respectively. This leads to the interesting tripod-like molecular shape for the trimer in the nematic phase rather than the planar representation of the λ shape. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Differential scanning calorimetry; Magnetism; Molecules; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Shims; Dipolar couplings; Enantiotropic nematic phase; Flexible spacer; Molecular ordering; Molecular shapes; Optical polarizing microscopy; Orientational order parameters; Smectic mesophases; Dimers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094932453

Amongst various CO2 conversion strategies, photocatalytic CO2 conversion (PCC) is considered as a promising approach, which utilizes inexpensive sunlight and water with a photocatalyst material. Hence, development of an efficient and a stable photocatalyst is an essential activity for the respective scientific community to upscale the PCC research domain. Until today, metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, etc., are categorized as standard photocatalysts because of their relative stability, abundant availability and low cost. However, their performance is tethered by limited light absorption and somewhat physical properties. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have offered an exciting and efficient way for PCC due to their superb CO2 adsorption and moderate photocatalytic properties. The LDH based photocatalysts show marvelous physiochemical and electrical properties like high surface area, stability, and excellent conductivity. In the present review article, a summarized survey is portrayed regarding latest development for LDH based photocatalysts with a focus on synthesis strategies employing various photocatalyst materials, influencing parameters and possible mechanism involved in PCC to useful fuels and chemicals like CO, CH4, CH3OH, and H2. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 conversion mechanism; Composite nanostructures; Layered double hydroxide; Photocatalytic CO2 conversion; Surface modifications",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094189025

Natural archives of paleo-typhoon variability can be used to assess how changes in the planetary climatic system during the Holocene could influence TC frequency and intensity in this part of Pacific. Extreme typhoon-related rains are the main cause of catastrophic floods on Sakhalin Island and deposits of these floods are evidence of paleo-typhoon. The paleo-typhoons that triggered extreme floods on Southern Sakhalin during the last 6.6 kyr are recorded in the sequence on the interfluvial surface in the northern Susunay Lowland (Naiba River basin). The sequence includes peat bog with numerous loam interlayers deposited during extreme floods inundating the bog. We reconstructed paleo-environmental conditions, including humidity and flood activity, based on analysis of diatoms. We found biological indicators that point to the past floods. The mineral content in the peat being one criteria indicative of the high frequency of floods. The peat bog developed in place of a lagoon that existed at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression. Peat accumulation began in the freshened lagoon coast ~6010 cal yr B.P. When sea level dropped, the lagoon turned into a coastal lake (~5710–5040 cal yr B.P.). A swamp formed in place of the lake under varying moisture conditions. We identified and dated 25 extreme floods and assessed the paleoclimatic background of the events. A recent catastrophic flood from typhoon Phyllis (1981 CE) is considered as an analogue of the paleo-events. The frequency of extreme typhoons increased both during warm (wet and dry) phases and in cold dry phases of the climate fluctuations. We identified three periods of a high typhoon activity (4640–4360; 4030–3580; 1860–1380 cal yr B.P.), when super-typhoons came onto the island once every 30–90 years. A comparison between the extreme typhoons in the south of Sakhalin and in the Sea of Japan region show both synchronism and metachronism of the periods of typhoon activity. Instrumental measurements during 20th–21st centuries revealed considerable changes in super-typhoon tracks; a similar variability may be safely supposed in typhoon tracks in the past. To predict future tropical cyclone activity and the risk of floods under modern climatic instability it is necessary to understand factors influencing variability in the occurrence of strong typhoons and associated extreme floods events on a paleo-scale. This is especially important for areas with rapidly developing coastal economies and intensive use of gas and oil resources, such as Sakhalin Island. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric circulation; Cyclogenesis; Diatom; Holocene; Precipitation","bog; catastrophic event; extreme event; Holocene; peatland; tropical cyclone; typhoon; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sakhalin; Sakhalin Island; Sea of Japan; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088271600

A thorough understanding of how the recent shift in phenology may impact on, for example, land surface temperature (LST) is important. To address this knowledge gap, it is important to quantify these impacts and identify patterns from the global to the regional scale. This study examines the trend and linear regression modeling of the leaf area index (LAI) and LST derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, specifically to assess their spatial distribution and changing trends at the continental and regional scales. The change detection analysis of interannual variability in the global LAI and LST between two periods (2003–2010 and 2011–2018) demonstrates more positive LAI trends than negative, while for LST most changes were not significant. The relationships between LAI and LST were assessed across the continents to ascertain the response of vegetation to changes in LST. The regression between LAI and LST was negative in Australia (R2 = 0.487 ***), positive but minimal in Africa (R2 = 0.001), positive in North America (R2 = 0.641 ***), negative in Central America (R2 = 0.119), positive in South America (R2 = 0.253 *) and positive in Europe (R2 = 0.740 ***). Medium temperatures enhance photosynthesis and lengthen the growing season in Europe. We also found a significant greening trend in China (trendp = 0.16 ***) and India (trendp = 0.13 ***). The relationships between LAI and LST in these most prominent greening countries of the world are R2 = 0.06 and R2 = 0.25 for China and India, respectively. Our deductions here are twofold—(1) In China, an insignificant association appeared between greening trend and temperature. (2) In India, the significant greening trend may be a factor in lowering temperatures. Therefore, temperature may stabilize if the greening trend continues. We attribute the trends in both countries to the different land use management and climate mitigation policies adopted by these countries. © 2020 by the authors.

Recent reports suggest a large fraction of upstream O&G methane emissions result from a small number of super-emitter facilities, emphasizing the value of novel methods that inspect O&G facilities with greater frequency than is practical using existing techniques. Here we describe an optimized method wherein O&G facilities are inspected for emissions at high frequency and high sensitivity using active laser (LiDAR) sensors mounted to aircraft. The method relies on a hierarchical clustering and routing procedure to establish optimal routes to be flown by aircraft departing from local airports and equipped with LiDAR methane sensors. Routes are optimized to inspect all well sites subject to emissions regulation in three O&G intensive regions: the Permian basin, the state of Colorado, and the state of Pennsylvania. While some cost estimates require additional field data, these modeling results suggest the optimized inspections can be performed with comparable effectiveness and up to a factor of six lower cost per inspection compared to current detection methods. The cost per inspection required to achieve equivalent emissions reduction depends on factors such as the weather conditions during inspection (which impacts the limit of detection and therefore the inspection frequency required to achieve equivalency) and the well density (which impacts the flying distance), and the advantage of this program over traditional inspection will be reduced under unfavorable conditions. These modeling results suggest that optimized routing may enable frequent inspection of upstream O&G facilities at large scale and potentially lead to a substantial decrease in both oilfield methane emissions and compliance costs borne by industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Leak detection and repair; Methane; Oil and gas; Vehicle routing problem","Aircraft; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Electric current measurement; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hierarchical clustering; Methane; Optical radar; Anthropogenic global warming; Emissions reduction; Emissions regulations; Hierarchical clustering and routing; High frequency HF; Inspection frequency; Limit of detection; State of Pennsylvania; Inspection; airborne survey; climate change; emission; global warming; lidar; methane; optimization; satellite sensor; Colorado; Pennsylvania; Permian Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086713426

Box 19835-196, Tehran, Iran","In the light of continuing anthropogenic climate change, it is important to gain a deep understanding of rice genotypic behavior under climate change. Most efforts on modeling rice performance under climate change focused on studying some aspects of climate change only such as CO2 concentration ([CO2]) or temperature. A comprehensive study on the role of genotypic variability in rice under diverse [CO2] × temperature × rainfall × representative concentration pathway (RCP) × environment is rare. The objective of the present study was to use AquaCrop-Rice model to study the impact of climate change on different rice cultivars in northern Iran. Three common improved and local rice cultivars were chosen, and their growth and yield behavior were simulated under three environments, three RCPs (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5), four temperature (+ 1 °C, + 2 °C, + 3 °C, + 4 °C), and two rainfall (± 20%) scenarios under two future timeframes (2020–2051 and 2052–2083). Results indicated different responses of rice cultivars under climate change. In general, improved cultivars acted better than the local cultivar although interaction with environment was also observed. Increase in [CO2] and temperature most often favored rice yield. However, RCP8.5 along with temperature scenario + 1 °C resulted in the highest aboveground biomass and yield. Rainfall variation was not of considerable importance. Phenology (flowering and physiological maturity) was accelerated especially by temperature. The length of the vegetative phase was more influenced by temperature than the length of the generative phase. Our simulations also indicated a potential for adaptation of improved cultivars under increasing [CO2] through their reduced stomatal conductance. © 2020, ISB.","AquaCrop; Canopy cover; Climate change; Rice; Simulation; Yield","climate change; genotype; Iran; Oryza; temperature; Climate Change; Genotype; Iran; Oryza; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088150977

The increase in temperature and the reduction of soil moisture have influenced carbon dioxide (CO 2) exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems in various ways, such as a reduction of photosynthesis, changes in ecosystem respiration, or allowing more frequent fires. In this study, we characterize the resulting perturbation of the atmospheric CO 2 seasonal cycles. 2018 has a good coverage of European regions affected by drought, allowing the investigation of how ecosystem flux anomalies impacted spatial CO 2 gradients between stations. This density of stations is unprecedented compared to previous drought events in 2003 and 2015, particularly thanks to the deployment of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) network of atmospheric greenhouse gas monitoring stations in recent years. Seasonal CO 2 cycles from 48 European stations were available for 2017 and 2018. Earlier data were retrieved for comparison from international databases or national networks. Here, we show that the usual summer minimum in CO 2 due to the surface carbon uptake was reduced by 1.4 ppm in 2018 for the 10 stations located in the area most affected by the temperature anomaly, mostly in Northern Europe. Notwithstanding, the CO 2 transition phases before and after July were slower in 2018 compared to 2017, suggesting an extension of the growing season, with either continued CO 2 uptake by photosynthesis and/or a reduction in respiration driven by the depletion of substrate for respiration inherited from the previous months due to the drought. For stations with sufficiently long time series, the CO 2 anomaly observed in 2018 was compared to previous European droughts in 2003 and 2015. Considering the areas most affected by the temperature anomalies, we found a higher CO 2 anomaly in 2003 (+3 ppm averaged over 4 sites), and a smaller anomaly in 2015 (+1 ppm averaged over 11 sites) compared to 2018.

For crops from regions with relict wild populations, this is of even greater interest because the effects of cultivation on symbiont communities can be revealed, which is of particular interest for bacteria such as rhizobia. Here, we determined the structure of root nodule bacterial communities of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), a leguminous shrub endemic to South Africa. We related the community dissimilarities of the root nodule bacteria of 18 paired cultivated and wild rooibos populations to pairwise geographical distances, plant ecophysiological characteristics and soil physicochemical parameters. Using next-generation sequencing data, we identified region-, cultivation- and farm-specific operational taxonomic units for four distinct classes of root nodule bacterial communities, dominated by members of the genus Mesorhizobium.We found that while bacterial richness was locally increased by organic cultivation, strong biogeographical differentiation in the bacterial communities of wild rooibos disappeared with cultivation of one single cultivar across its entire cultivation range. This implies that expanding rooibos farming has the potential to endanger wild rooibos populations through the homogenisation of root nodule bacterial diversity. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Therefore, having an understanding of the key drivers of SOC may inform management changes that will improve ecosystem function and climate change mitigation. The selected study area is ranged from montane forests to tropical grasslands. Extensive soil sampling (0–0.15 m and 0.15–0.30 m) was undertaken across this region to inform our knowledge about key drivers of SOC at different spatial scales. Initially spatial modelling was carried out using spatial linear mixed modelling approach using a variety of environmental covariates. The model had a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient value of 56–60%, and indicated that SOC was predominately influenced by vegetation type and elevation, although the sub-surface (0.15–0.30 m) SOC was influenced by slope and wetness index. Further, four spatial transects with 100 m sampling interval were extracted from the digital maps representing the study area and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis was carried out to examine the scale specific variability of SOC stocks. The EMD, a mathematical analysis, separates dominant frequencies within a spatial/temporal series representing variability created by various underlying processes operating at different scales into a finite number of scale components or intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Decomposition of SOC spatial series for the considered transects resulted up to 7 IMFs. The scale components with lower IMF numbers separated higher frequency oscillations, whereas higher IMF numbers separated lower frequency oscillations, which is the representative of smaller and larger scale processes, respectively. Spectral analysis was performed to identify the scales of IMFs and the correlation analysis was carried out with different environmental covariates to identify the dominant controlling factors at different depths. Majority of the large-scale variations (e.g. 2037–8149 m for IMF's 6 for depth interval 0–0.15 m for transect 1–4) were attributed to the elevation and climatic factors controlling the forest type, while small-scale (e.g. 69–118 m for IMF's 1 for depth interval 0–0.15 m for transect 1–4) variations were more attributed terrain derived attributes. Similar scales were identified for the depth 0.15–0.30 m. The scale-specific controlling factors at different locations and their relative controlling factors may help in selecting environmental covariates that enables us to model SOC more accurately rather than fitting one global model. The study provided firsthand information on baseline SOC stock values from a tropical forest ecosystem with six different vegetation types. The information revealed in this study will be useful in the conservation of tropical forests in the region and towards providing vital firsthand information to establishing a national carbon accounting system for land sector in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital soil mapping; Scale specific variation; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil carbon stocks; Tropical forests","Climate change; Forestry; Functions; Organic carbon; Signal processing; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Tropics; Vegetation; Climate change mitigation; Correlation coefficient; Ecosystem functioning; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Intrinsic Mode functions; Knuckles forest reserves; Lower frequency oscillations; Mathematical analysis; Ecosystems; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem function; forest ecosystem; forest soil; grassland soil; nutrient dynamics; soil carbon; soil depth; soil organic matter; tropical forest; vegetation type; Carbon; Control Systems; Ecosystems; Forestry; Mathematical Analysis; Plants; Tropics; Variations; Central Province [Sri Lanka]; Knuckles Massif; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087330496

However, policy-making and its implementation often fail to generate the desired outcomes that aim to adapt to the adverse impact of climate change in a developing nation, such as Bangladesh—a country highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Against this backdrop, the study aims to analyze the implication of development cooperation and bureaucratic politics on the policy-making and implementation of climate change adaptation policy in Bangladesh. In doing so, the research uses national and international climate adaptation funds and the existing state administrative framework of the climate adaptation regime. Methodologically, it follows a mixed qualitative–quantitative research approach. The study discusses the following key findings: (1) the general cross-sectoral nature and thrusts of domestic and external climate adaptation funding; (2) how Bangladesh technical departments, such as that for water management, have reacted successfully to ensure the utilization of the funds is for implementing adaptation policy; (3) simultaneously, how Bangladesh bureaucracy, made of the elite, together with politics, have maintained their traditional values, practices, and structures in responding to the administrative requirements of climate adaptation funders, especially bilateral and multilateral development agencies, and (4) what changes should be brought to the bureaucratic cadre and added to the administrative setup in Bangladesh to provide a better overall impact of the adaptation policy and funding. © 2020 by the authors.

A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 °C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd9Cu91 alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at -0.65 V vs. RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd9Cu91 foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway. The improved product selectivity towards the highly valuable C3 alcohol is rationalized by an efficient and concerted spillover of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (∗CO) and atomic hydrogen (∗H) species from the Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains of the oxide-derived Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst where the C-C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation processes take place to form the targeted oxygenate product.

In this study, we report a bimetallic Cu96In4 alloy with a dendritic foam morphology for the reduction of aqueous CO2 to CO at an onset potential of -0.3 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and with >70% selectivity. Operando Raman spectroscopy reveals weaker *CO adsorption on the Cu96In4 alloy surface compared to bare Cu and supports the immediate release of CO(g) as the product from the electrocatalyst surface. The Cu96In4 catalyst is subsequently employed in an overall bias-free tandem device for CO2 conversion using water as an electron donor. The buried photovoltaic-biased photoelectrochemical cell relies on state-of-the-art triple-cation mixed halide perovskite and BiVO4 photoabsorbers that can also be assembled in an artificial leaf configuration. The device reaches a solar-to-CO energy conversion efficiency of 0.19% with a selectivity of 75% for CO after 10 h simulated sunlight irradiation using bias-free conditions. The buried perovskite|Cu96In4 cathode shows robust, unaltered PEC activity at different solar intensities, which also allows it to function under low and diffuse sunlight.

Ten male (22.2 ± 3.9 years; 174 ± 0.07 cm; 74.5 ± 8.9 kg) jiu-jitsu athletes participated in this counterbalanced double-blind crossover study. Two protocols, a) supplementation with 0.3 g.kg-1 of body weight of sodium bicarbonate, and b) supplementation with 0.045 g.kg-1 of body weight of placebo substance, were employed. Gastrointestinal tolerability was assessed by the questionnaire. Blood samples were collected at three time points (baseline, pre-ISO, and post-ISO) to determine the responses of potential hydrogenionic (pH), bicarbonate (HCO3-), base excess (EB) and lactate concentrations. The maximum voluntary contraction test and the intermittent isometric contraction test were also performed. As a result, none of the athletes reported significant gastrointestinal discomfort (p > 0.05). HCO3-, pH, and EB at the pre-ISO and post-ISO moments were significantly higher for the sodium bicarbonate protocol. Lactate concentrations were significantly higher for both post-ISO protocols (p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in the performance of the maximum voluntary contraction test and the intermittent isometric contraction test (p > 0.05). Thus, we conclude that sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not generate adverse responses resulting in gastrointestinal discomfort, and does not benefit performance yet promotes a state of metabolic alkalosis. © 2020 Luciano Ragone, João Guilherme Vieira, Mateus Camaroti Laterza, Luis Leitão, Jefferson da Silva Novaes, Jeferson Macedo Vianna, Marcelo Ricardo Dias, published by Sciendo 2020.","handgrip exercise; intermittent exercise; martial arts; metabolic alkalosis; NaHCO3",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096317155

Four years (2014–2017) of high frequency, in situ humic-like fluorescent DOM (FDOMH) data in the Jiulong Estuary were coupled with extrapolation to a freshwater end-member FDOMH concentration and river discharge data to estimate riverine FDOMH export. The wetter El Niño dry season was followed by lower FDOMH export during the subsequent wet season. Furthermore, in the dry season after El Niño reached its strongest phase, a 90–187% increase in FDOMH export occurred. If widespread, this pattern suggests El Niño events may enhance export of FDOMH from south China rivers in dry seasons resulting in seasonal and annual shunting of the terrestrial DOM export, modulating coastal carbon cycling.

The nation’s growing urban work force spends a majority of daily time in the office, thus office indoor air quality (IAQ) can be a key determinant of worker’s wellbeing. Yet, information on office IAQ in rapidly developing southwestern China remains scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an observational study based on continuous monitoring in six office buildings in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to investigate the concentration and variability of indoor particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Hourly indoor concentrations for PM2.5 and CO2 were 0–459 µg/m3 and 375–1102 ppm, respectively, with considerable intra-building and inter-building variability. Indoor PM2.5 exhibited temporal association with ambient PM2.5, while indoor CO2 exhibits both diurnal and weekly patterns. Four out of the six buildings showed a reduction in indoor PM2.5 during work hours, suggesting functional filtration systems. However, we observed daily accumulation of indoor CO2, suggesting ineffective ventilation. Indoor PM2.5 pollution could be of health concern as all buildings experienced days when indoor PM2.5 concentration was above WHO recommendation for at least 50% of the day. Multivariate linear model predicts that every 1 µg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 is associated with a 0.60 µg/m3 increase in indoor PM2.5.

Recently, carbon pricing initiatives have been widely implemented worldwide. With consideration of the interactions between carbon pricing initiatives and freight schedules, this paper presents a carbon pricing initiatives-based bi-level pollution routing problem involving an authority and a freight company. An interactive solution approach integrating a fuzzy logic controlled particle swarm optimization and a modified adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is designed to search for solutions for the carbon pricing initiatives-based bi-level pollution routing problem. Computational experiments and analysis are then conducted to shed light on the influence of carbon pricing initiatives on carbon emissions and the total cost of freight companies. In this part, extended models for the carbon pricing initiatives-based bi-level pollution routing problem with a freight company delivering to multiple regions and with multiple freight companies are proposed and computed using the algorithms based on the interactive solution approach. The results indicate that the proposed method can promote freight company improvements in emission performance, and assist authorities in making decisions for road freight transport carbon emission reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pricing initiatives; Fuzzy logic controlled particle swarm optimization; Modified adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic; Pollution-routing problem; Transportation","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Freight transportation; Fuzzy logic; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Carbon emission reductions; Computational experiment; Emission performance; Freight companies; Number of vehicles; Road freight transport; Solution approach; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084066207

We employ the Myerson value as the solution of the game to capture the structure of the power grid and the power transmission.

Artificial photosynthesis is a two-pronged solution to both problems. However, due to the harsh reaction conditions and low efficiency, traditional semiconductors cannot achieve this. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with larger specific surface areas, lower carrier migration distances, more active surface atoms, and higher elastic strain tolerance play a critical role in the solar to chemical energy conversion scheme, and provide a novel methodology for the synthesis of fine chemicals. This review details the principles of photocatalytic reduction of CO2, and highlights the reduction pathways and product selectivity via experimental methods and theoretical calculations. The state-of-The-Art achievements of 2D materials in the field of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are summarized, mainly including material structure, characteristics, and modification strategies to improve the performance of CO2 reduction. And the research on the combination of 2D materials and single atoms is emphasized. Moreover, bottlenecks and challenges in the design and application of 2D materials, as well as prospects of the future development direction, will be highlighted in order to seek new breakthroughs by exploring new materials design solutions.

We employ data from built-up areas of 285 prefecture-level cities in China spanned 2001–2016 and dynamic spatial panel data analysis to resolve this controversy. Our results show that the direct and indirect effects of vehicles on PM2.5 concentration (annual mean and spatial variation within the city) in urban China are not significant in the short- and long-term. Alternatively, SO2 emission directly increases the mean and spatial variation of PM2.5 within the city in the short- and long-term. Short-term direct and indirect positive association and long-term indirect positive association are found relative to economic growth and PM2.5. Population density increases PM2.5 directly and indirectly in the short-term and yet, directly decreases and indirectly increases PM2.5 in the long-term. In the short- and long-term, the spatial spillover effect of secondary industry increases PM2.5, and industry also directly increases the spatial variation of PM2.5 within the city. Although real estate investment directly increases PM2.5 in the long-term, the spatial spillover effect of investment reduces PM2.5 in the short- and long-term.

Furthermore, the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis does not apply to the relationship between economic growth and PM2.5 proliferation in urban China.

Short Communication: Investigating the environmental impacts of long-term monoculture of sugarcane farming in Indonesia through DPSIR framework. Biodiversitas 21: 4945-4958. An increasing trend of sugar demand in Indonesia due to the rising population has forced the government to boost its national sugarcane production through intensification program. Long-term monoculture system has long been practiced by sugarcane growers in Indonesia, particularly by large sugar companies for more than 30 years. This farming method bolsters the government’s program in scaling-up national sugar production. Through a literature study, the present study analyzed the impacts of long-term sugarcane monoculture in Indonesia on agroecosystem functions by using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Results showed that long-term sugarcane monoculture leads to decreased soil quality, lowered hydrological functions, reduced agrobiodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Those conditions corresponded to reduced sugarcane yield and productivity, increased pests and diseases, decreased income gained by growers, higher dependencies on chemicals, and higher cultivation costs. In the end, we proposed several sustainable crop management to mitigate the detrimental effects of sugarcane monoculture practice in Indonesia. These include performing crop break or rotation with legume or the other cash crop, intercropping, green harvesting and trash blanket, precision agriculture methods, and soil amendment with organic matters. However, some constraints in implementing those sustainable crop management, such as inadequate knowledge and capital, should be considered. The information given in this study can be used by sugarcane growers or companies, policymakers, and sugarcane-related stakeholders as considerations to improve sugarcane productivity while at the same time minimizing its impact on the environment. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Together with the intention to divert municipal waste from landfill, which is still the main way of treatment in approximately half of the EU countries, there is a potential for the construction of waste-to-energy plants (WtEP) that can partially replace fossil fuels. An important factor in planning the construction of new WtE plants is the assessment of the project's economy. However, the ecological aspect of the project, namely the greenhouse-gas (GHG) savings, is becoming a topic of discussion nowadays. In terms of GHG savings, WtE plant integration into an existing district heating system (DHS) has a positive impact, but its level is often only roughly estimated. The paper presents a comprehensive mathematical optimization tool working on a daily time interval that is able to evaluate the impact of changing current technology or WtE plant construction on global warming potential. The technical parameters such as boiler output range, energy efficiency, etc. are considered. The tool also allows to put in the context the GHG savings and economic benefits of the project. These two factors are very difficult to compare. The study answers the question of how to deal with this issue and presents the possibility of comparison, which is generally transferable to any two parameters. Due to two poorly comparable criteria, the result does not include a single optimal solution, but clearly illustrates the view of the overall issue and gives a good basis for the final decision. The method used are illustrated in real-world DHS with various parameters where the relationship between GHG savings and the economic benefits of the integration of a WtE plant is evaluated. The whole problem is the task of linear integer programming and is implemented in the GAMS programming environment. © 2020","Emission cost; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas savings; Multi-criteria optimization; Waste-to-energy","Coal industry; District heating; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Integration; Waste treatment; District heating system; Fossil energy sources; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Linear integer programming; Mathematical optimizations; Programming environment; Waste-to-energy plants; Natural gasoline plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086562798

Thermal diodes can potentially revolutionise passive heat collection/rejection devices such as Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heaters (ICSSWH) and Climate-Control Building Envelopes (CCBE) employed for decarbonisation. We present novel theoretical and experimental validation work on a lumped parameter heat transfer model of Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) to support development of ICSSWH and CCBE components for building facades. This study augments our previous work on a passive horizontal PLVTD model, by introducing falling film evaporation, vapour convection in vertical rectangular enclosures, condensation on vertical plates, and a methodology for evaluating working fluid temperatures. Experimental validations are presented for vertical aluminium (Ap = 0.15 m2, x = 22 mm) and stainless steel (Ap = 0.98 m2, x = 70 mm) prototypes using two different laboratory test methodologies where temperature setpoints were controlled and measured. The model predicts measured steady state thermal conductances in reverse mode (Ur ≈ 12 W·m–2 K−1 and Ur ≈ 1.7 W·m–2 K−1 for x = 22 mm and x = 70 mm PLVTDs respectively) and forward mode (175 &lt; Uf &lt; 730 W m–2 K−1 and 50 &lt; ULvL &lt; 900 W·m–2·K−1 respectively) with reasonable accuracy across investigated ranges (15 &lt; T2 &lt; 65 °C condenser temperatures, 5 &lt; –ΔT12 &lt; 25 °C reverse mode plate-to-plate temperature differences, 50 &lt; q/A &lt; 1000 W·m−2 forward mode heat fluxes). Forward mode behaviour is determined by working fluid vapour mass flow driven by heat flux and influenced by temperature dependent vapour viscosity. Reverse mode behaviour is determined by vapour convection, plate-to-plate radiation, and envelope/structure conduction. Parametric design influences are theoretically examined and ς &gt; 99% diodicity relevant to CCBE and ICSSWH applications is demonstrated experimentally.

This work is novel in that it assesses the challenges and economic incentives available to make feasible the installation of a hydrogen-based energy storage systems within the Province of Ontario from a techno-economic, policy and environmental perspectives. The energy hub analyzed in this work uses electricity from the power grid and solar PVs to meet the manufacturer's demands, while converting the excess to hydrogen gas, which is used across an array of pathways to generate revenue. ThisThis includes a blend ofof hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), hydrogen for forklifts, and the direct injection of hydrogen into the facility's natural gas, adding renewable content to the heating, and manufacturing processes. Our primary objective was to implement a safe design that minimizes capital and operating costs, resulting in a favorable business case for producing hydrogen, and providing ancillary grid services. However, Power-to-Gas creates a net-emission reduction that can be used not only to sell emission allowances in the provincial carboncarbon tax program for up to $30/t-CO2eq but to assist the Company in achieving their strategic emission reduction targets. Installation of the selected Power-to-Gas system would require a total capital investment of $2,620,448 with the electrolyzers and solar panels accounting for 41% and 17% of the capital costs, respectively. The compressors will account for most of the operating costs which total $237,653 annually. Within the energy hub, 76,073 kg-H2 has been produced per year for end-use applications. A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying both hydrogen and carbon credit price which predicted a potentialpotential CO2 offset of 2359.7 tonne/yr with a payback period of as little as 2.8 years. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Ancillary services & demand response; Hydrogen economy; Operational and design optimization; Power-to-gas; Solar energy","Automobile manufacture; Costs; Direct injection; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Fuel cells; Gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Investments; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Operating costs; Sensitivity analysis; Capital and operating costs; Electrical energy demand; Emission reduction targets; Environmental assessment; Industrial manufacturers; Integration of renewable energies; Mixed integer linear programming model; Total capital investments; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088786607

Environment provides us a number of renewable and a non-renewable energy source such as solar power, wind-energy, natural gas, hydropower, biofuels, coal, petroleum etc., Renewables energies are playing a vital role in augmenting Grid powers, provide energy access reducing consumption of fossil fuels and also provides India to pursue low carbon pathway. There are so many steps taken by the international community in order to promote the solar energy. The Sustainable Development Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. The Paris Climate Change Agreement, 2015 has given hope for the carbon emission mechanisms that must be followed by the state parties. In our daily lives, the community as a whole must focus on reducing our daily energy consumption, migrating to renewable resources, using greener transport and adopting environmentally friendly technologies. Being a collective problem, climate change and emission of carbon needs collective solution. It is not new to the developing nations as solar productsis often low quality and negative experiences with substandard generic products damaged the receptivity of the potential consumers. It is important to note here that affordable price and high-quality standard products should be produced in the country itself. The solar power project will reduce and lead to carbon emission.

There is a growing awareness in the research community that energy transitions should be understood as socio-technical transitions and that energy scenario construction should reflect this fact. This paper presents an application of a socio-technical scenario building method for improving long-term scenarios and strategies for the energy transition in Germany. Developing integrated scenarios on a national level starts with employing the cross impact balancing (CIB) approach for identifying consistent societal scenarios. As a first step, relevant context factors are selected and defined (39 descriptors and alternative future developments). Interviews with experts are used to develop a qualitative impact network for the CIB. The resulting context scenarios are then transferred to quantitative energy scenarios by using two different energy models that account for energy demand and supply structures for Germany. A final evaluation focuses on primary energy demand, renewable energy shares, and direct energy-related CO2 emissions. The approach integrates statements of societal and energy model experts and results in an interdisciplinary knowledge integration. This in turn provides insight into the method’s capacity to improve the consistency of energy scenarios and to identify potential societal risks related to the energy transition process. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","CIB; Cross impact balancing; Energy system modeling; Energy transition; Socio-technical scenario","Energy management; Energy system model; Energy transitions; Knowledge integration; Mitigation strategy; Primary energy demand; Research communities; Socio-technical scenarios; Socio-technical transitions; Risk perception; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand analysis; integrated approach; questionnaire survey; scenario analysis; socioeconomic status; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071526608

In the first step, the VOC observations were used to optimize the magnitude and distribution of atmospheric ethane and higher-alkane VOC emissions in the model inventory for the base year 2009. Observation-based increases of the emissions of VOCs and NOx stemming from U.S. oil and natural gas (O&NG) sources during 2009-2014 were then added to the model, and a set of sensitivity runs was conducted for assessing the influence of the increased emissions on summer surface ozone levels. For the year 2014, the added O&NG emissions are predicted to affect surface ozone across a large geographical scale in the United States. These emissions are responsible for an increased number of days when the averaged 8-h ozone values exceed 70 ppb, with the highest sensitivity being in the central and midwestern United States, where most of the O&NG growth has occurred. These findings demonstrate that O&NG emissions significantly affect the air quality across most of the United States, can regionally offset reductions of ozone precursor emissions made in other sectors, and can have a determining influence on a region's ability to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) obligations for ozone. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical analysis; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Geographical scale; Higher alkanes; National ambient air quality standards; Oil and natural gas; Ozone precursors; Surface ozone; Surface sampling; VOC emissions; Gas emissions; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; ethane; industrial emission; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; ozone; volatile organic compound; United States; natural gas; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Midwestern United States; Natural Gas; Ozone; United States; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092070267

Based on a small RNA-binding protein, CsrA and homologs, it controls metabolism, physiology, and bacterial lifestyle decisions by regulating gene expression on a vast scale. Binding of CsrA to sequences containing conserved GGA motifs in mRNAs can regulate translation, RNA stability, riboswitch function, and transcript elongation. CsrA governs the expression of dozens of transcription factors and other regulators, further expanding its influence on cellular physiology, and these factors can participate in feedback to the Csr system. Expression of csrA itself is subject to autoregulation via translational inhibition and indirect transcriptional activation. CsrA activity is controlled by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), CsrB and CsrC in Escherichia coli, which contain multiple high affinity CsrA binding sites that compete with those of mRNA targets. Transcription of CsrB/C is induced by certain nutrient limitations, cellular stresses, and metabolites, while these RNAs are targeted for degradation by the presence of a preferred carbon source. Consistent with these findings, CsrA tends to activate pathways and processes that are associated with robust growth and repress stationary phase metabolism and stress responses. Regulatory loops between Csr components affect the signaling dynamics of the Csr system. Recently, systems-based approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of the roles played by CsrA, while reinforcing the notion that much remains to be learned about the Csr system. © Copyright © 2020 Pourciau, Lai, Gorelik, Babitzke and Romeo.","posttranscriptional regulation; regulatory circuitry; RNA-binding proteins; sRNAs; translation control","exopolysaccharide; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase; RNA binding protein; transcription factor; untranslated RNA; 3' untranslated region; autoregulation; bacterial growth; bacterial virulence; Caenorhabditis elegans; carbon metabolism; carbon storage; cell stress; controlled study; DNA binding; DNA damage; Enterobacter aerogenes; enzyme activity; gene control; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene regulatory network; genetic regulation; glycolysis; immunoprecipitation; iron homeostasis; lifestyle; nonhuman; Northern blotting; nucleotide metabolism; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein degradation; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; quorum sensing; repressor gene; Review; RNA sequence; RNA translation; sequence alignment; Serratia marcescens; signal transduction; transcription elongation; transcription initiation; transcription termination; transcriptomics; Yersinia enterocolitica",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095835042

Here we determine the distribution, drivers and threats to large trees and high carbon forest. Location: Central Africa. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Using Gabon's new National Resource Inventory of 104 field sites, AGC was calculated from 67,466 trees from 578 species and 97 genera. Power and Michaelis–Menten models assessed the contribution of large trees to AGC. Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of AGC, large trees, and stand variables were modelled using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) weights to calculate average regression coefficients for all p. ossible models. Results: Mean AGC for trees ≥ 10 cm DBH in Gabonese forestlands was 141.7 Mg C/ha, with averages of 166.6, 171.3 and 96.6 Mg C/ha in old growth, concession and secondary forest. High carbon forests occurred where large trees are most abundant: 31% of AGC was stored in large trees (2.3% of all stems). Human activities largely drove variation in AGC and large trees, but climate and edaphic conditions also determined stand variables (basal area, tree height, wood density, stem density). AGC and large trees increased with distance from human settlements; AGC was 40% lower in secondary than primary and concession forests and 33% higher in protected than non-managed areas. Main conclusions: AGC and large trees were negatively associated with human activities, highlighting the importance of forest management.

How alpine plant species responded to climate change, however, remains elusive and remnants of the cold-adapted flora that currently strive in restricted ranges as small, isolated populations have been particularly overlooked. To address the evolutionary history of such a ‘glacial relict’, we here sampled and genotyped all known native populations of a narrow endemic species from the northwestern Alps, Papaver occidentale, as well as closely related taxa with double digest restriction-site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. Spatial patterns of genetic variation across populations coupled with insights from climatic niche modelling through time address underpinings of the long-term persistence of the species in face of climate changes. Evidence from population genetics and ecological modelling indicates that P. occidentale likely persisted through the last glacial maximum outside of the Western Prealps and that a major lineage recolonized the area from lower elevation, external regions. Differentiated lineages at the Northern margins of the species distribution range highlight highly divergent and geographically restricted populations that include considerable share of private markers and may indicate local glacial survival in isolated conditions. Our data thus imply that processes having shaped intraspecific spatial genetic structure within the Alps can be complex and lead to mosaic of populations with a mixed-history of local survival and immigration. A better understanding of spatio-temporal aspects of range contraction–expansion is crucial to shed light on processes underlying the evolution of remnant populations of such endemic species and set conservation priorities considering current climate changes. © 2020, The Author(s).","Arctic-alpine flora; Conservation biology; ddRAD sequencing; Narrow endemic species; Papaver alpinum species complex; Refugia during last glacial maximum","adaptation; climate oscillation; ecological modeling; endemic species; evolutionary theory; genetic structure; immigrant population; intraspecific variation; niche; Quaternary; relict species; survival; Alps; Prealps; Papaver; Papaver alpinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088843997

In this review, we mainly focus on experimental and theoretical works of metal dithiolene complexes and their applications in olefin addition/purification, toxic gas adsorption, H2 evolution, and CO2 reduction. The coordination of non-innocent dithiolene ligands on transition metal centers give different oxidative state of metals, thus making the reductive character of sulfurs more obvious. And the p orbitals of sulfurs contribute more to the frontier molecular orbitals of metal dithiolene complexes, making the complexes react with olefins on sulfurs rather than metals. The reversable addition of olefins to these ligands could also be achieved, thus releasing olefins to finish the olefin purification process. In this case, metal dithiolenes are facilitating ligand-centered (S) reactivity towards olefin which makes olefin separation easier. Also, metal dithiolene based MOFs are very sophisticated and promising in the term of reduction ability and particular affinity to small molecules. Moreover, to realize a sustainable energy future, electro and photocatalytic manufacturing of H2 is essential. Here we will also discuss the electro and photocatalyzed proton reductions into H2 by using metal dithiolene as catalysts in aqueous and weak acetic media. Due to the non-innocent character of dithiolene ligands, the reductive potential of metal dithiolene complexes is usually low, which allows the reduction of CO2 to generate formic acid or CO. In these aspects, many homogeneous and heterogeneous metal dithiolene complexes and related reactions are addressed in this review. © 2020","CO2 reduction; H2 evolution; Metal dithiolene; Non-innocent ligand; Olefin separation; Small molecule adsorption",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086477070

The ESP optimum configuration (i.e., flow rate of 75 lpm and applied voltage of +12 kV) was determined based on maximum particle collection efficiencies and minimum ozone emissions associated with the instrument using different laboratory-generated aerosols. This configuration resulted in particle collection efficiencies above 80% for almost all particles in the size range of 0.015–2.5 μm while the ozone concentration was 17 ppb. The ESP was then deployed to our sampling site in central Los Angeles to evaluate its performance using ambient particles under the optimum configuration. Chemical composition and oxidative potential of PM2.5 samples collected on the foils placed inside the ESP tube were compared with those collected concurrently on filters and aerosol slurries using the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) operating in parallel. Our results demonstrated that the ESP was more efficient in preserving labile inorganic ions and total organic carbon (TOC) compared to filters. PM samples collected on ESP substrates also showed higher intrinsic oxidative potential compared to the filters, which might be the result of better preservation of redox active semi-volatile organic compounds on the ESP substrates. However, the TOC concentrations and intrinsic oxidative potential of PM samples collected on ESP substrates were somewhat lower than the aerosol slurries collected by the VACES, probably due to deficiency of water-insoluble compounds in extracted PM samples from ESP substrates. In conclusion, while particle collection for toxicological purposes by the ESP is somewhat inferior to a direct aerosol-into-liquid collection, the ESP performs equally well, if not better, than conventional filter samplers and can be utilized as a simple and adequately efficient PM collector for toxicological studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol-into-liquid collection; Electrostatic precipitator (ESP); Oxidative potential; PM collector; VACES","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Efficiency; Electrostatic precipitators; Electrostatics; Organic carbon; Ozone; Redox reactions; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical compositions; Conventional filters; Electrostatic precipitators (ESP); Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Optimum configurations; Particle collection efficiency; Semivolatile organic compounds; Versatile aerosol concentration enrichment systems; Particles (particulate matter); ammonia; nitrate; ozone; sulfate; volatile organic compound; aerosol; chemical composition; concentration (composition); flow velocity; oxidation; ozone; particulate matter; sampling; total organic carbon; toxicity; volatile organic compound; aerosol; animal cell; Article; California; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric potential; electrostatic precipitator; flow rate; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; rat; sampling; total organic carbon; toxicity; air pollutant; particulate matter; static electricity; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Los Angeles; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Static Electricity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086402381

However, there is a lack of tools based on objective observations for assessing cropland C budgets at the plot scale over large areas. Such tools would allow us to more precisely establish the contribution of an agricultural plot to net CO2 emissions according to the plot management and identify levers for improving the C budget. In this study, we present a diagnostic regional modelling approach, called SAFY-CO2, that assimilates high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) optical remote sensing data in a simple crop model and evaluate the performance of this approach in quantifying crop production and the main components of the annual carbon budget for winter wheat. The SAFY-CO2 model simulates daily crop development (biomass, partition to leaves, etc.), the components of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and the annual yield and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB). Multi-temporal green area index (GAI) maps derived from HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to calibrate the light-use efficiency and phenological parameters of the model. Data from the literature were used to set a priori values for a set of model parameters, and a large dataset of in situ data was used for model validation. This dataset includes 8 years of eddy-covariance net CO2 flux measurements and GAI, biomass and yield data acquired at 2 instrumented sites in southwest France. Biomass and yield data from 16 fields in the study area between 2005 and 2014 were also used for validation. The SAFY-CO2 model is able to reproduce both GAI dynamics (RRMSE = 14%, R2 = 0.97) and biomass production and yield (RRMSE of 27% and 21%, respectively) with high precisions under contrasting climatic, environmental and management conditions. Additionally, the net CO2 flux components estimated by the model generally agreed well with in situ data and presented very good and significant correlations (RMSE of 1.74, 1.13 and 1.29 gC.m−2.d-1 for GPP, Reco and NEE, respectively; R2 of 0.90, 0.75 and 0.85 for GPP, Reco and NEE, respectively) over the 8 studied years. This study also highlights the importance of accounting for post-harvest vegetative events (spontaneous re-growth, weed development and cover crops) for an accurate calculation of the annual net CO2 flux. This approach requires a limited number of input parameters for estimating yield and net CO2 flux components, which is promising for regional/global-scale applications based on Sentinel 2-like data; however, the approach requires plot-scale data concerning organic amendments and straw management (exportation) in animal farming systems to calculate field C budgets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon budget; Crop modelling; Remote sensing monitoring; Winter wheat","Agricultural robots; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Large dataset; Remote sensing; Accurate calculations; Biomass productions; CO2 flux measurement; Light use efficiency; Optical remote sensing data; Remote sensing data; Soil carbon storage; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Information management; agricultural soil; carbon budget; carbon emission; carbon flux; data assimilation; estimation method; greenhouse gas; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; soil carbon; wheat; winter; France; Animalia; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086892814

Furthermore, it explores the reasons for food waste by looking at different cultural practice of various ethnic groups in South Africa. The growing concern of the challenges of waste on human health and the environment has pressured the world to come up with drastic measures on how to manage waste to reduce both environmental and public health impacts. One of the concerns is that food waste has become one of the main contributors to increased greenhouse gas emissions. However, South Africa does not have stringent measures to control or reduce food waste in its communities. Methods: An extensive online search was conducted to assess the influence of culture on food waste in South Africa and explore how other countries' cultural practices contribute to food waste. Information was retrieved from online reports, journals, and books. Results and conclusions: The studies showed a diversity of cultures and practices in South Africa compared to other countries. For example, in affluent countries where food is available in large quantities, cultural practices have a major influence on food waste. Moreover, some studies highlighted the fact that even though most developing countries are overwhelmed by poor people, many of whom live below the poverty line, food waste is also a challenge. In South Africa, food waste generated during social activities that are related to cultural practices remains a serious challenge. This is because during the cultural and social events, food is prepared in large quantities, which ends up not being wholly consumed and resulting in an increase in food waste that gets disposed of at the landfill sites. The government of South Africa must institute awareness raising measures to inform communities to avoid or reduce the generation of food waste. This would reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and environmental impact, and to protect human health. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cultural practices; Food waste; Poverty culture; South African cultures; Wealthy culture; Western culture",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092345333

(2019) will be useful information for the development of climate-resilient design standards, codes, and guides for buildings and infrastructure. Caution in designing for ice loads at latitudes higher than 40 N is warranted due to projected increases in extreme ice thickness. As the results show, it is important to examine changes in the future probability of extreme ice loads occurring simultaneously with extreme wind load in northern NA because the compounding effect may lead to an increase in load larger than the increase in ice load or wind load alone. The methodology proposed by Fluixá-Sanmartín et al. (2019) allows a detailed quantification of the effect of climate change on dam safety, which is one of the main concerns of the managers and technicians of this critical infrastructure for water supply and energy production worldwide. It can serve as a useful guide for dam owners and dam safety practitioners in the analysis of other study cases by encompassing different models and data sources. This would eventually allow a more efficient planning of dam safety investments in the long term and even the adaptation of existing dam exploitation rules. Sayão et al. (2020) also deal with dam safety but from a seismic hazard point of view. They introduce the issue of the visualization of databases, while Petrova (2020) and Frolova et al. (2020) also deal with databases of natural hazard impacts on infrastructure, providing useful tools for further research. Williams et al. (2020) conclude that the fragility functions show a trend of lower tsunami vulnerability (through lower probabilities of reaching or exceeding a given damage level) for road-use categories of potentially higher construction standards; bridges are more vulnerable to the impacts of tsunamis than roads; however, bridges are better designed to withstand the forces of tsunami loading and have a lower level of vulnerability at all hazard intensities (inundation depth) compared to buildings; culverts represent particularly vulnerable sections of roads. The topographic setting is also shown to affect the vulnerability of transportation assets in a tsunami. Braud et al. (2020) proposed the methodology that is robust, relevant, and generic enough to evaluate a nonquantitative method of runoff hazard mapping using localized runoffrelated proxy data. The results from their case study confirm that the susceptibility maps produced by the IRIP model provide relevant information related to runoff and that they can be used to design risk management strategies, as illustrated in the railway context. Among all the identified types of natural hazards in the study by Petrova (2020), hydrometeorological hazards such as heavy snowfalls and rains, floods, and ice phenomena, as well as dangerous exogenous slope processes including snow avalanches, debris flows, landslides, and rock falls, were revealed as having the largest contributions to transport accidents and disruptions. The most dangerous is the combination of heavy precipitations and strong winds. Regional differences in the risk of transport accidents between Russian federal regions were found and analyzed. Toma-Danila et al. (2020) and Mossoux et al. (2019) deal with the vulnerability of the transport infrastructure and, more precisely, the road network. This is important in emergency management in the case of a natural disaster (earthquake and volcanic eruption) in order to access such infrastructure as hospitals. Chen et al. (2019) consider the effects of human engineering in increasing landslide susceptibility and effects on infrastructure, providing case studies of two landslides in the vicinity of bridges. If the analysis of transport infrastructure may lead to better planning by providing new road segments and new infrastructure, then in the case of human engineering, land use change, a nonstructural measure, can also be undertaken to provide better land use through regional plans. Looking at the lessons learned from the database and information visualization papers which promote the conversion of data to information – and thus the digital humanities – as well as at the urban, regional, and mobility plans which are necessary to better manage transportation networks and human engineering activities, how other disciplines can contribute to natural hazard research is also highlighted. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

However, while previous studies of U.S. electric vehicle (EV) adoption consistently predict CO2 mitigation benefits, air quality outcomes are equivocal and depend on policies assessed and experimental parameters. We analyze climate and health co-benefits and trade-offs of six U.S. EV adoption scenarios: 25% or 75% replacement of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, each under three different EV-charging energy generation scenarios. We transfer emissions from tailpipe to power generation plant, simulate interactions of atmospheric chemistry and meteorology using the GFDL-AM4 chemistry climate model, and assess health consequences and uncertainties using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Benefits Mapping Analysis Program Community Edition (BenMAP-CE). We find that 25% U.S. EV adoption, with added energy demand sourced from the present-day electric grid, annually results in a ~242 M ton reduction in CO2 emissions, 437 deaths avoided due to PM2.5 reductions (95% CI: 295, 578), and 98 deaths avoided due to lesser ozone formation (95% CI: 33, 162). Despite some regions experiencing adverse health outcomes, ~$16.8B in damages avoided are predicted. Peak CO2 reductions and health benefits occur with 75% EV adoption and increased emission-free energy sources (~$70B in damages avoided). When charging-electricity from aggressive EV adoption is combustion-only, adverse health outcomes increase substantially, highlighting the importance of low-to-zero emission power generation for greater realization of health co-benefits. Our results provide a more nuanced understanding of the transportation sector's climate change mitigation-health impact relationship. ©2020.

Soot emission reduction has gained its spotlight among the pollutants-related issues mainly due to the renewed interest in Gasoline Direct Injection. The conjunction of experimental measurements and numerical investigations provides an effective tool to cope with the constant evolution of the emission regulations. Thus, numerical models must be validated over a wide range of engine operating points and fuels. To this aim, the Sectional Method was applied to investigate Particulate Matter and Particle Number produced during combustion in a premixed spark ignition engine using 3D-CFD. Soot-related quantities were investigated for different values of equivalence ratio (from 1.0 up to 1.5) as well as for different fuels. Three different fuel types were examined: a commercial nonoxygenated American gasoline (TIER-2), a commercial Chinese gasoline (CHINA-6) with ethanol 10 %vol and pure Ethanol (E100). A detailed chemistry-based tabulated approach was exploited to compute a dedicated soot library, for each of the analyzed fuels, by means of 0D chemical kinetic simulations using a constant pressure reactor approach. Numerical results were compared to a database of experimental measurements collected from literature. The sooting tendency threshold dependency on equivalence ratio was also investigated and the results showed that the ethanol is the less sooting among the examined fuels, while the non-oxygenated gasoline exhibited the highest soot mass and Particle Number. This paper provides a CFD-based benchmark for soot mass and Particle Number for three fuel types with largely different chemical nature. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Chemical analysis; Direct injection; Dust; Emission control; Engines; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Ignition; Soot; Chemical kinetic simulation; Constant pressures; Detailed chemistry; Emission regulation; Equivalence ratios; Gasoline direct injection; Numerical investigations; Oxygenated gasoline; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097161199

Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental protection; Intelligent transportation system; IoT; Sustainability; Vehicle emissions","algorithm; carbon emission; exhaust emission; genetic algorithm; intelligent transportation system; machine learning; navigation; numerical model; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092653423

In this work, a new propeller-like molecule of 5,6-di(4-N,N-(dimethylamino)phenyl)pyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine (APPP) with a rotatable D-π-A structure was facilely prepared, which exhibited a typical TICT character. Interestingly, aggregation/viscosity-induced emission and third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) signal inversion from reverse saturation absorption (RSA) to saturation absorption (SA) in the aggregated state or in solutions with high viscosity were observed in this system. Mechanism studies showed that these properties were originated from the restricted intramolecular rotation (RIR) process, which not only cut off the nonradiative transition channel of electronically excited states but also influenced the electronically excited state transition rate from the charge transfer (CT) state to the TICT state. According to these results, a temperature-triggered third-order NLO optical switch was successfully designed.

An interesting option that is under investigation by several years is the opportunity to use the renewable electricity surplus to power electrolyzers that split water into its component parts, with the hydrogen being directly injected into natural gas pipelines for both storage and transportation. This innovative approach merges together the concepts of (i) renewable power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and of (ii) hydrogen blending into natural gas networks. The combination of renewable P2H and hydrogen blending into natural gas networks has a huge potential in terms of environmental and social benefits, but it is still facing several barriers that are technological, economic, legislative. In the framework of the new hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe, Member States should design a roadmap moving towards a hydrogen ecosystem by 2050. The blending of “green hydrogen”, that is hydrogen produced by renewable sources, in the natural gas network at a limited percentage is a key element to enable hydrogen production in a preliminary and transitional phase. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate at the same time (i) the potential of green hydrogen blending at low percentage (up to 10%) and (ii) the maximum P2H capacity compatible with low percentage blending. The paper aims to preliminary assess the green hydrogen blending potential into the Italian natural gas network as a tool for policy makers, grid and networks managers and energy planners. © 2020 by the authors.

Special attention will be paid to the reduction in NOx in order to comply with the conditions of the MARPOL Convention, Annex VI. The reduction in NOx emissions will be achieved by the application of primary and secondary measures. The primary measures relate to the process in the engine, while the secondary measures are based on the reduction in NOx emissions through the after-treatment of exhaust gases. Some primary measures such as exhaust gas recirculation, adding water to the fuel or injecting water into the cylinder give good results in reducing NOx emissions, but generally lead to an increase in fuel consumption. In contrast to the aforementioned methods, the use of an earlier inlet valve closure, referred to in the literature as the Miller process, not only reduces NOx emissions, but also increases the efficiency of the engine in conjunction with appropriate turbochargers. A previously developed numerical model to simulate diesel engine operation is used to analyse the effects of the Miller process on engine performance. Although the numerical model cannot completely replace experimental research, it is an effective tool for verifying the influence of various input parameters on engine performance. In this paper, the effect of an earlier closing of the intake valve and an increase in inlet manifold pressure on fuel consumption, pressure and temperature in the engine cylinder under steady-state conditions is analysed. The results obtained with the numerical model show the justification for using the Miller processes to reduce NOx emissions and fuel consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This survey examines peer-reviewed empirical studies of CO2 emissions convergence with respect to country coverage and alternative approaches to test for various types of convergence. Findings: For large multicountry studies, the support for convergence is quite limited. However, studies focused exclusively on a subset of countries defined by income classification, geographic region or institutional structure reveal the finding of convergence is more prevalent. Studies at the subnational level have primarily been in the cases of the US and China with the exception of two studies across industry sectors in Portugal and Sweden.

In order to prevent and reduce odour emissions, it is necessary to define specific clear and strict legal solutions and to use appropriate technologies. The Polish law indicates that waste management should not cause a nuisance. Despite this fact, legal solutions at the national level are not clear and precise. They are limited to only a few entries. At the European level, BREF Documents have been developed, which are a set of solutions that can be successfully used to counteract odour emissions. On their basis, BAT Conclusions were created, constituting a set of the best available techniques applicable, among others, to reduce the odour emissions from the waste management facilities. By way of implementation into Polish law, they constitute valid standards for prevention and control of odour emissions. The paper presents several solutions demonstrated in the above-mentioned documents aimed at preventing and reducing odour emissions. Various activities, not only those at the technological level but also related to management and planning, in combination with the best available technology allow for effective prevention and control of odour emissions, which could improve the state of environment around the waste management facilities and the quality of human life. © 2020 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).","BAT; Best available techniques; Legal conditions; Odour nuisance; Odour prevention technologies; Odours; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090052949

With recent technological advancements reducing noise emissions from aircraft engines, airframe noise sources now represent a large component of the total emitted noise during approach and landing. This research investigates a shape-memory alloy slat-cove filler concept, which is a promising noise reduction technology for the leading-edge-slat high-lift system. Aerodynamic and structural experiments are conducted with the purpose of characterizing response under relevant flow conditions. A model-scale wing section prototype was treated with a slat-cove filler and used to compare aerodynamic effects of the shape-memory alloy treatment at multiple settings. It is shown that the addition of the slat-cove filler does not detrimentally impact the aerodynamic response of the wing prototype and actually resulted in a higher lift-to-drag ratio. Aerostructural experiments were conducted incorporating Digital Image Correlation measurements and displacement measurements from a custom-designed system based on a laser displacement sensor. These experiments determined the structural response of the shape-memory alloy slat-cove filler during a typical retraction/deployment cycle under relevant wind tunnel test conditions and compared to results from a finite element analysis model. © The Author(s) 2020.","aerostructural; aircraft; Shape-memory alloys; slat-cove filler; superelastic","Aeroacoustics; Aerodynamic drag; Aerospace industry; Aircraft engines; Fillers; Lift; Lift drag ratio; Noise abatement; Wind tunnels; Wings; Airframe noise sources; Digital image correlations; Experimental validations; Federal Aviation Administration; Finite element analysis model; Laser displacement sensors; Noise reduction technologies; Technological advancement; Shape-memory alloy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088322048

The previous generation of global climate models projected that eastern Amazonia would receive less future precipitation while western Amazonia would receive more precipitation, but many of these models disagreed on future precipitation trends in the region. Here Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are used to examine the shifting risk of eastern Amazonian droughts under high and low future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This new generation of models shows better agreement that most of the Amazonian basin will receive less future rainfall, with particularly strong agreement that eastern and southern Amazonia will dry in the 21st century. These models suggest that global warming may be increasing the likelihood of exceptionally hot drought in the region. With unabated global warming, recent particularly warm and severe droughts will become more common by midcentury, but reducing the rate of greenhouse gas emissions can make extremely hot and dry years less common in the future. Simulated future rainfall changes in Amazonia under high greenhouse gas emissions are associated with changes in the tropical Pacific, but many climate models struggle to reproduce observed trends in the tropical Pacific. These shortcomings highlight the need to improve confidence in global climate models' ability to simulate observed trends in the tropics, even if more CMIP6 models agree on the sign of future rainfall trends. © 2020.

At high Galactic latitude, where the total dust content is low, accurate maps of the 3D structure of the ISM are lacking. We develop a method to quantify the complexity of the distribution of dust along the line of sight with the use of H i line emission. The method relies on a Gaussian decomposition of the H i spectra to disentangle the emission from overlapping components in velocity. We use this information to create maps of the number of clouds along the line of sight. We apply the method to (a) the high Galactic latitude sky and (b) the region targeted by the BICEP/Keck experiment. In the north Galactic cap we find on average three clouds per 0.2 square degree pixel, while in the south the number falls to 2.5. The statistics of the number of clouds are affected by intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs), primarily in the north. IVCs produce detectable features in the dust emission measured by Planck. We investigate the complexity of H i spectra in the BICEP/Keck region and find evidence for the existence of multiple components along the line of sight.

This paper examines the regional differences, spatial–temporal pattern and dynamic evolution of the carbon emission intensity of agriculture production from 1991 to 2018 through the Theil index and spatial data analysis. The results are shown as follows: The overall differences in carbon emission intensity of agriculture production presents a slightly enlarging trend, while the inter-regional differences in carbon emissions intensity is decreasing, but the intra-regional difference of carbon emissions intensity presented an expanding trend. The difference in carbon emission intensity between the eastern and central regions is not obvious, and the difference in carbon emission intensity in the western region shows a fluctuating and increasing trend. The overall differences caused by intra-regional differences; the average annual contribution of intra-regional differences is 67.84%, of which the average annual contribution of western region differences is 64.24%. The carbon emission intensity of agricultural production in China shows a downward trend, with provinces with high carbon emission intensity remaining stable, while provinces with low intensity are expanding. The Global Moran’s I index indicates that China’s carbon emission intensity of agricultural production shows a clear trend of spatial aggregation. The agglomeration trend of high agricultural carbon emission remains stable, and the overall pattern of agricultural carbon emission intensity shows a pattern of increasing differentiation from east to west. © 2020 by the authors.

In physics, entanglement is a critical resource for powering quantum technologies but is difficult to generate, maintain, and measure in organic nanostructures. We provide experimental evidence suggesting how a sequence of ultrashort laser pulses can create pairs of entangled particles that carry spin information across space much like the entangled photon pairs in the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Roden “paradox.” Here, this occurs along the backbones of long polydiacetylene molecules and carotenoid aggregates. Our results provide a surprising experimental scheme for future studies of quantum non-locality in solid-state organics and elucidate the exciting links between molecular quantum information, thermodynamics, and enhanced energy harvesting in processes such as singlet-exciton fission. © 2020 The AuthorsIn quantum mechanics, entanglement is a powerful concept with applications in computing, cryptography, and chemical reactions to boost the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. An example of this in organic semiconductors is the coupling of localized triplet excitons into an overall spin-0, -1, or -2 configuration, termed the triplet-pair state. Here, we develop and apply methods to extract triplet pairs from the lowest excited singlet state in long conjugated molecules (polyenes) and understand the mechanism of this process for the aforementioned applications. © 2020 The AuthorsThe S1 (21 Ag–) state is an optically dark state of natural and synthetic pi-conjugated materials that plays a role in optoelectronic processes, such as energy harvesting, photoprotection, and singlet fission. Experimental characterizations of the S1 wavefunction, however, have remained scarce. Here, studying an archetypal polymer, polydiacetylene, and carotenoids, we experimentally confirm that S1 (21 Ag–) is a superposition state with strong contributions from spin-entangled pairs of triplet excitons (1(TT)). We then show that optical manipulation of the S1 wavefunction using triplet absorption transitions allows selective projection of the 1(TT) component into a manifold of spatially separated triplet pairs with lifetimes enhanced by up to one order of magnitude. Our results provide a unified picture of 21 Ag– states in pi-conjugated materials and provide a hitherto unexplored pathway to create near-free triplets. More generally, our findings open new routes to exploit 21 Ag– dynamics in singlet fission, photobiology, and molecular quantum technologies. © 2020 The Authors","carotenoids; entanglement; molecular quantum control; polyenes; pump-push probe; SDG13: Climate action; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; singlet fission; triplet pair; ultrafast spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091992244

The reduction of NO3− occurs in two steps; in the first step, NO3− is reduced to NO2−; and in the second, unlike denitrification, NO2− is reduced to NH4+ without intermediates. There are two sets of NO3−/NO2− reductase enzymes, i.e., Nap/Nrf and Nar/Nir; the former occurs on the periplasmic-membrane and energy conservation is respiratory via electron-transport-chain, whereas the latter is cytoplasmic and energy conservation is both respiratory and fermentative (Nir, substrate-phosphorylation). Since, Nir catalyzes both assimilatory- and dissimilatory-nitrate reduction, the nrfA gene, which transcribes the NrfA protein, is treated as a molecular-marker of DNRA; and a high nrfA/nosZ (N2O-reductase) ratio favours DNRA. Recently, several crystal structures of NrfA have been presumed to producee N2O as a byproduct of DNRA via the NO (nitric-oxide) pathway. Meta-analyses of about 200 publications have revealed that DNRA is regulated by oxidation state of soils and sediments, carbon (C)/N and NO2−/NO3− ratio, and concentrations of ferrous iron (Fe2+) and sulfide (S2−). Under low-redox conditions, a high C/NO3− ratio selects for DNRA while a low ratio selects for denitrification. When the proportion of both C and NO3− are equal, the NO2−/NO3− ratio modulates partitioning of NO3−, and a high NO2−/NO3− ratio favours DNRA. A high S2−/NO3− ratio also promotes DNRA in coastal-ecosystems and saline sediments. Soil pH, temperature, and fine soil particles are other factors known to influence DNRA. Since, DNRA reduces NO3− to NH4+, it is essential for protecting NO3− from leaching and gaseous (N2O) losses and enriches soils with readily available NH4+-N to primary producers and heterotrophic microorganisms. Therefore, DNRA may be treated as a tool to reduce ground-water NO3− pollution, enhance soil health and improve environmental quality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrification; Nitrate respiration; Nitrate-conservation; Redox potential of soils","Cell proliferation; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Electron transport properties; Energy conservation; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Nitrates; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Sediments; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Timing circuits; Coastal ecosystems; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Electron transport chain; Environmental quality; Primary producers; Reductase enzymes; Soils and sediments; Terrestrial ecosystems; Soil pollution; ammonia; carbon; ferrous ion; Nap protein; Nir protein; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide reductase; Nrf protein; NrfA protein; oxidoreductase; sulfide; unclassified drug; ammonium derivative; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; biogeochemical cycle; concentration (composition); enzyme activity; molecular ecology; nitrogen cycle; terrestrial environment; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; cell membrane; concentration (parameter); crystal structure; cytoplasm; denitrification; dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; ecosystem; energy metabolism; enzyme substrate; fermentation; genetic transcription; leaching; meta analysis (topic); nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; nosZ gene; nrfA gene; oxidation; periplasmic membrane; phosphorylation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); respiratory chain; Review; seashore; sediment; soil; soil acidity; soil temperature; systematic review; terrestrial ecosystem; ecosystem; Ammonium Compounds; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Nitrates; Nitrogen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086307071

In this study, an innovative response surface modeling technique with differential method (RSM-DM) has been developed and applied to investigate the PM2.5 contributions from multiple regions, sectors, and pollutants over the PRD region in 2015. The new differential method, with the ability to reproduce the nonlinear response surface of PM2.5 to precursor emissions by dissecting the emission changes into a series of small intervals, has shown to overcome the issue of the traditional brute force method in overestimating the accumulative contribution of precursor emissions to PM2.5. The results of this case study showed that PM2.5 in the PRD region was generally dominated by local emission sources (39–64%). Among the contributions of PM2.5 from various sectors and pollutants, the primary PM2.5 emissions from fugitive dust source contributed most (25–42%) to PM2.5 levels. The contributions of agriculture NH3 emissions (6–13%) could also play a significant role compared to other sectoral precursor emissions. Among the NOX sectors, the emissions control of stationary combustion source could be most effective in reducing PM2.5 levels over the PRD region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Brute force method; Differential method; PM2.5; Response surface model; Source contribution","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Pollution; Control strategies; Differential methods; Non-linear response; Pearl River Delta region; Pollutant emission; Response surface modeling; Sectoral contribution; Source contributions; Surface properties; accumulation; dust; emission control; particulate matter; pollutant source; response surface methodology; spatial distribution; agriculture; article; China; combustion; pollutant; response surface method; river; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086360252

However, the electrical efficiency of WTE combined heat and power plant is low. One factor that leads to such result is the large heat loss of the boiler exhaust gas. Besides, the amount of high-temperature steam used for power generation decreases because a part of high-temperature steam is used to provide district heating (DH), resulting in a low electricity output. In this study, a novel combined organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and heat pump cycle (ORC-HP) system is analyzed. The waste heat of the exhaust gas is recovered by the ORC and generates mechanical work to drive the HP system, which absorbs the waste heat of low-temperature and low-pressure vapor for the DH. Considering the environmental compatibility, different organic working fluids are compared to select a suitable working fluid for the combined system. Comprehensive thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed to identify the effects of different parameters on combined system. And the economic benefits of the system are considered from the perspective of the investment payback period (PBP). Furthermore, based on sensitivity analysis, multi-objective optimization analysis was applied in the combined system to determine the optimal working conditions. The results indicate that butane and ammonia are the most suitable working fluids. Sensitivity analysis results show that for SIC, the evaporator pressure of ORC and the superheat degree of HP evaporator have a greater impact, and for ORC-HP system efficiency, the evaporator temperature of HP, the superheat of HP evaporator and ambient temperature have a greater impact. Optimization results show that, the optimal PBP and the specific investment cost (SIC) of the new combined system are 0.48 years and 325.94 $/GJ. After optimization, SIC reduces from 333.15 $/GJ to 325.94 $/GJ, with a 2.2% reduction and the product unit cost of DH reduces to 33.97 $/GJ. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Exergoeconomic analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Thermodynamic analysis; Waste-to-energy","Ammonia; Cogeneration plants; Economics; Evaporators; Heat pump systems; Investments; Municipal solid waste; Rankine cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Steam power plants; Temperature; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Working fluids; Electrical efficiency; Environmental compatibility; Evaporator pressure; Evaporator temperature; Exergoeconomic analysis; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic working fluid; Waste to energy technologies; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088106205

However, the strong adsorption of *CO on the Fe-N4 site embedded in intact graphene limits current density due to slow CO desorption process. Herein, we report how the manipulation of pore edges on graphene alters the local electronic structure of isolated Fe-N4 sites and improves their intrinsic reactivity for prompting CO generation. We demonstrate that constructing holes on graphene basal plane to support Fe-N4 can significantly enhance its CO2RR compared to the pore-deficient graphene-supported counterpart, exhibiting a CO Faradaic efficiency of 94% and a turnover frequency of 1630 h-1 at 0.58 V vs RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of pore edges results in the downshifting of the d-band center of Fe sites, which weakens the strength of the Fe-C bond when the *CO intermediate adsorbs on edge-hosted Fe-N4, thus boosting the CO desorption and evolution rates. These findings suggest that engineering local support structure renders a way to design high-performance single-atom catalysts.

Adding a diluent to the combustion process reduces peak combustion temperatures and can reduce the reactivity of the charge, thereby increasing the ignition-delay and, allowing for more time to premix air and fuel. Experiments spanned water/fuel mass ratios up to 140mass% and exhaust gas recirculation ratios up to 20vol% for gasoline and diesel operation with different injection strategies. Diluting the combustion process with either water or EGR resulted in a significant reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions along with a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. The sensitivity of brake thermal efficiency to water and EGR varied among the fuels and injection strategies investigated. An efficiency breakdown revealed that water injection considerably reduced the wall heat transfer; however, a substantial increase in exhaust enthalpy offset the reduction in wall heat transfer and led to a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. Regular diesel operation with main and post injection exhibited a brake thermal efficiency of 45.8% and a 0.3% reduction at a water/fuel ratio of 120%. The engine operation with gasoline, early pilot, and main injection strategy showed a brake thermal efficiency of 45.0% at 0% water/fuel ratio, and a 1.2% decrease in brake thermal efficiency for a water/fuel ratio of 140%. Using EGR as a diluent reduced the brake thermal efficiency by 0.3% for diesel operation, comparing ratios of 0% and 20% EGR. However, a higher impact on brake thermal efficiency was seen for gasoline operation with early pilot and main injection strategy, with a reduction of about 0.8% comparing 0% and 20% EGR. Dilution by means of EGR exhibited a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions up to 15 g/kWh; water injection showed only up to 10 g/kWh reduction for the EGR rates and water/fuel ratio investigated. © IMechE 2019.","early pilot injection; exhaust gas recirculation; gasoline compression ignition; injection strategies; Water injection","Brakes; Diesel engines; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Heat transfer; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Water injection; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion temperatures; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Nitrogen oxide emissions; Pilot injection; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060172929

The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, the aim of the study is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect videos during varying environmental conditions and frames from these videos were extracted to prepare the dataset. The frames in the dataset were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Vehicle detection with deep learning algorithms was implemented to perform multi-object detection. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, Yolo-conv, GoogleNet, ReNet18 and ResNet50 with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. ResNet18 performed better than other detectors which had an average precision of 96.16 and log-average miss rate of 19.40. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces to identify vehicle occupancy information.

Nevertheless, this power system restoration practice strongly relies on conventional power plants, e.g. large thermal power plants. As future global goals aim at reducing the use of fossil fuels and lowering carbon-dioxide emissions, conventional power plants are often taken out of operation. These are characterised by slow start-up times and considerable use of fossil fuels. In this context, large offshore wind farms (OWFs) show potential as renewable-based black start (BS) service providers. These can be equipped with a self-starter, e.g. synchronous generators or innovative power-electronic-based converters, such as battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and/or grid-forming wind turbines in order to BS the system. Additionally, state-of-the-art complementary devices such as STATCOMs or synchronous condensers can help with dynamic regulation and support the OWF both in island operation and BS. In this paper, an overview of different system configurations for OWF BS is presented. Firstly, the requirements for BS from non-conventional power plants are outlined. Afterwards, the challenges faced by OWFs to fulfil these requirements are identified. Finally, different solutions for system configuration to equip OWFs for BS are proposed. © 2020 IEEE.","black start; grid-forming; island operation; offshore wind farms; power system resiliency; power system restoration","Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Industrial electronics; Offshore oil well production; Restoration; Starters; Thermoelectric power plants; Battery energy storage systems; Carbon dioxide emissions; Conventional power plants; Power system restoration; Principles of design; Synchronous condensers; System configurations; Thermal power plants; Offshore wind farms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097798924

Therefore, it is expected that the winter peak demand will rise significantly in the next few years. Demand Response could play an important role in reducing the need for network reinforcements by providing flexibility. The major motivation behind this paper is to evaluate the difference in demand flexibility between temperature-dependent consumers using electricity for heating and consumers using other energy sources. In this paper, temperature-dependent consumers are first identified by analyzing their smart metering data with machine learning. Further, the response of consumers is evaluated using probabilistic baseline models. The results show that heat electrification will increase the demand during low temperatures, whereas these consumers will also be able to offer far more flexibility during low temperatures and high demand. To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study, that would investigate these using state of the art methods in such detail.

In this research, a 2 MW novel self-sustained preheating combustion test rig was constructed. Efforts were made to investigate the effects of secondary air ratio, the air staging degree of preheated fuel burner, and the position of tertiary air on the combustion characteristics and NOx emissions of semi-coke. The results showed that NOx emission was reduced to 67 mg/Nm3 (@6% O2) with a combustion efficiency of 99.2%. The internal fluidized bed combustor (IFBC) could provide high-temperature preheated fuel for the combustion chamber steadily. Also, 69.3% of the fuel-bound nitrogen was released in the IFBC. The temperature distribution in the combustion chamber became uniform under the multi-layer arrangement of tertiary air. As the secondary air ratio decreased from 0.50 to 0.40, NOx emissions decreased due to the enhancement of reducing atmosphere in the reducing zone. Besides, the deeper air staging of the preheated fuel burner contributed to forming a region of low oxygen and strong reducibility at the early staged combustion, which could inhibit the generation of NOx. The strong mixing and long dwell time in the reducing zone were essential for the reduction of NOx emissions. The multi-layer and delayed arrangement of tertiary air could reduce NOx emissions significantly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air distribution; NOx emissions; Pulverized fuel; Self-sustained preheating combustion; Ultra-low volatile fuel","Coke; Combustion chambers; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed combustors; Fuel burners; Nitrogen oxides; Preheating; Combustion characteristics; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion test rigs; Conventional combustions; Fuel bound nitrogens; Reducing atmosphere; Staged combustion; Volatile contents; Pulverized fuel; combustion; detection method; emission; equipment; experimental study; heating; high temperature; nitric oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089137757

However, formation pathways of magnetic minerals and subsequent magnetic response are quite different under different climate. In order to improve the understanding of magnetic assemblages in paddy soil layers in relation to soil formation conditions, a systematic magnetic investigation was performed for surface and its corresponding deep soil collected from 70 sampling sites within a paddy soil area under subtropical climate, south China. Rock magnetic results showed that superparamagnetic, single-domain, and multiple domain maghematite and hematite were produced during ferrallitization pedogenic processes. Some fine superparamagnetic and single-domain ferrimagnetic particles were dissolved during late gleyization of paddy soil formation with increased organic matter and reductive condition. As a result, magnetism of surface soil was weaker than that of deep soil despite basically consistent magnetic mineral composition. ©2020.

We examined the association of fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) and mortality from cancer and all causes among pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer in Utah, a state with considerable variation in PM2.5. Methods: We followed 2,444 pediatric (diagnosed ages 0–14) and 13,459 AYA (diagnosed ages 15–39) patients diagnosed in 1986–2015 from diagnosis to 5 and 10 years postdiagnosis, death, or emigration. We measured average monthly PM2.5 by ZIP code during follow-up. Separate pediatric and AYA multivariable Cox models estimated the association of PM2.5 and mortality. Among AYAs, we examined effect modification of PM2.5 and mortality by stage while controlling for cancer type. Results: Increases in PM2.5 per 5 mg/m3 were associated with cancer mortality in pediatric lymphomas and central nervous system (CNS) tumors at both time points, and all cause mortality in lymphoid leukemias [HR5-year ¼ 1.32 (1.02–1.71)]. Among AYAs, PM2.5 per 5 mg/m3 was associated with cancer mortality in CNS tumors and carcinomas at both time points, and all cause mortality for all AYA cancer types [HR5-year ¼ 1.06 (1.01–1.13)]. PM2.5 ≥12 mg/m3 was associated with cancer mortality among breast [HR5-year ¼ 1.50 (1.29–1.74); HR10-year ¼ 1.30 (1.13–1.50)] and colorectal cancers [HR5-year ¼ 1.74 (1.29–2.35); HR10-year ¼ 1.67 (1.20–2.31)] at both time points. Effect modification by stage was significant, with local tumors at highest risk. Conclusions: PM2.5 was associated with mortality in pediatric and AYA patients with specific cancers.

The relationship between energy consumption, economic growth and CO2 emissions was assessed using regression analysis (the pooled OLS regression and fixed effects methods), Granger causality and panel cointegration tests. Data from 70 countries between 1994-2013 were analysed. The result of the Granger causality tests revealed that the study variables (population, capital stock and economic growth) have a bi-directional causal relationship with CO2 emissions, while energy consumption has a uni-directional relationship. Likewise, the outcome of the cointegration tests established that a long-run relationship exists among the study variables (energy consumption and economic growth) with CO2 emissions. However, the pooled OLS and fixed methods both showed that energy consumption and economic growth have a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions. Hence, this study supports the need for a global transition to a low carbon economy primarily through climate finance, which refers to local, national, or transnational financing, that may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. This will help foster large-scale investments in clean energy, that are required to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate finance; CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Energy consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092175595

This presents an opportunity for fossil fuel exporting desert countries to diversify and transition not only the domestic economy towards solar but also to become an exporter of solar energy through a suitable energy carrier. This paper investigates ammonia (NH3) as a promising carrier option. Essential chemical industries rely on conventionally produced ammonia as the intermediate product from which a wide variety of fertilizers and industrial products are produced. This work presents a methodology for designing, simulating and optimizing an industrial-scale facility that utilizes solely renewable electricity, applied in the context of UAE – a major ammonia exporter. Hydrogen is obtained from desalinated seawater electrolysis and nitrogen from air separation that is then processed in the Haber-Bosch process. A simulation of the integrated plant, that includes desalination, electrolysis, air separation, refrigeration and storage, is carried out in the Aspen Plus® environment. A large-scale plant continuously operated has a specific energy consumption of 10.43 kWh/kg-NH3 and an electric process efficiency of 37.4%. The optimal configuration of generation and storage to operate this plant based on hourly resolution operations and considering options of flexible sub-processes is specified with linear optimization. The fully renewable and cost-optimally configured system entails 3.5 GW of PV, 0.24 GWh of battery storage, and achieves about 37% efficiency for the UAE conditions. The levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) for this base case is estimated at $718/ton-NH3 and further reductions are possible under the expected technical advancements at $450/ton making it directly competitive with conventionally produced ammonia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy transition; Green ammonia; Hydrogen economy; Industrial optimization; Renewable energy integration","Chemical industry; Climate change; Computer software; Desalination; Electrolysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Hydrogen production; Linear programming; Solar energy; Climate change mitigation; Intermediate product; Linear optimization; Renewable electricity; Seawater electrolysis; Specific energy consumption; Technical advancement; Variable renewable energies; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087279184

Using a low-cost instrument (kiln and compressor box) built from local resources, we produced charcoal briquette from palm kernel (Elaeis guineensis) shells. Further, we measured and compared its efficiency using starch as a binder to traditional charcoal and commonly used fuelwood (Acacia) in Cape Coast. Following the American Standards for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the proximate analysis was conducted for all fuels with results indicating that palm kernel shell (PKS) briquette produced had a moisture content of 1.08 %, as compared to 9.25 % in charcoal and 16.00 % in fuelwood. The volatile matter, ash content and fixed carbon recorded were 71.80 %, 0.06 %, and 27.07 % in PKS briquette, 86.00 %, 0.78 %, and 3.97 % in charcoal and 80.50 %, 2.04 %, 1.46 % in fuelwood respectively. The calorific values for charred PKS increased after binding to form the PKS briquette with the highest value among the other fuels. The calorific value for the other fuels were 17.5 MJ/kg for charcoal, 18.72 MJ/kg for charred PKS, and 18.72 MJ/kg for PKS briquette. We also conducted an ignition test, combustion test, fuel burning rate (FBR), and specific fuel consumption (SFC) on PKS briquette and charcoal to determine their suitability as cooking fuels. Charcoal readily ignited as compared to PKS briquette with respective fuel mass of 5.08 g and 25.5 g. The resultant briquette possesses desirable combustion characteristics such as no smoke emissions and ash formation. The FBR and SFC in PKS briquette recorded the highest in comparison with charcoal. The values recorded were 2.84 g/min and 20.05 g/ml respectively while that of charcoal was 0.42 g/min and 3.48 g/ml respectively. PKS briquette produced from this study showed high calorific value, low moisture content, and a fast burning rate amongst other excellent properties.

We examine how theoretical positionings, including from actor-network theory, new materialisms, ontologies, and cosmopolitics, have helped expand anthropological climate research, particularly in three key interrelated areas. First, we investigate ethnographic approaches to climate science knowledge production, particularly around epistemic authority, visioning of futures, and engagements with the material world. Second, we consider climate adaptation studies that critically examine discourses and activities surrounding concepts of vulnerability, subjectivities, and resilience. Third, we analyze climate mitigation, including energy transitions, technological optimism, market-based solutions, and other ways of living in a carbon-constrained world.

Sawdust was used as the biostimulant for the biodegradation of artificial diesel-polluted soil samples. Soil microbial population, soil microbial enzymatic activities (catalase, lipase, dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and β-glucosidase), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN) and phosphorus (MBP), soil microbial respirometric index and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration were monitored to evaluate the efficiency of the bioremediation process. After a period of 56 d, total petroleum hydrocarbon content reduced from 14,221 to 270 mg/kg. The parameter estimation using the nth-order kinetic model revealed that the first-order rate constants (k) for TPH removal were 4.417 d−1 and 0.2670 d−1 for sawdust-amended and unamended soil, respectively. This implied that, the sawdust amendment resulted in reaction rate 16.5 times faster than unamended soil. Thus, the biological indicators were generally more pronounced in biostimulated soil than the attenuated soil. However, to evaluate the efficiency of the sawdust-assisted bioremediation, principal component analysis, which was used in selecting the most sensitive bioindicators. It was observed that microbial biomass carbon, catalase, lipase and dehydrogenase were the most responsive bioparameters. A positive relationship between TPH removal and the four most sensitive bioparameters suggests that the use of four biological activities have proven to be effective monitoring tools for evaluating the efficiency of a bioremediation strategy. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bioparameters; Biorestoration; ecotoxicological monitoring; Principal component analysis; total petroleum hydrocarbon","Biodegradation; Biomarkers; Biomass; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Carbon; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum analysis; Principal component analysis; Rate constants; Soil surveys; Soils; bioparameters; Biorestoration; Ecotoxicological; First-order rate constants; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil microbial biomass carbons; Soil microbial population; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Soil pollution; beta glucosidase; carbon; catalase; diesel fuel; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; petroleum derivative; phosphatase; phosphorus; triacylglycerol lipase; urease; environmental marker; hydrocarbon; petroleum; agricultural soil; biodegradation; bioindicator; biomonitoring; microbial community; parameter estimation; petroleum; phosphatase; phosphorus; principal component analysis; reaction kinetics; soil quality; agricultural land; biological monitoring; bioremediation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; health status indicator; kinetics; microbial biomass; nonhuman; principal component analysis; sawdust; soil microflora; soil pollution; waste component removal; biomass; bioremediation; health status; microbiology; soil; soil pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Carbon; Environmental Biomarkers; Health Status; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064562497

Temperature-dependent decomposition of previously frozen carbon (C) is currently considered one of the strongest feedbacks between the Arctic and the climate system, but the direction and magnitude of the net C balance remains uncertain. This is because winter effects are rarely integrated with C fluxes during the snow-free season and because predicting the net C balance from both surface processes and thawing deep layers remains challenging. In this study, we quantified changes in the long-term net C balance (net ecosystem production) in a subarctic peat plateau subjected to 10 years of experimental winter-warming. By combining 210Pb and 14Cdating of peat cores with peat growth models, we investigated thawing effects on year-round primary production and C losses through respiration and leaching from both shallow and deep peat layers. Winter-warming and permafrost thaw had no effect on the net C balance, but strongly affected gross C fluxes. Carbon losses through decomposition from the upper peat were reduced as thawing of permafrost induced surface subsidence and subsequent waterlogging. However, primary production was also reduced likely due to a strong decline in bryophytes cover while losses from the old C pool almost tripled, caused by the deepened active layer. Our findings highlight the need to estimate long-term responses of whole-year production and decomposition processes to thawing, both in shallow and deep soil layers, as they may contrast and lead to unexpected net effects on permafrost C storage. © 2020 The Authors.

For Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, an emerging hypothesis is that the change could be triggered by shifts in competitive dominance among plant functional groups, specifically from the currently predominant decay-resistant Sphagnum to the more decomposable vascular plants. However, the relationship between Sphagnum and vascular plant occurrence is notably complex and also includes facilitative interactions that are crucial to the productivity of Sphagnum, and therefore, carbon sequestration. Location: Global. Taxa: Northern peatlands—Sphagnum moss and vascular plants. Time period: Present day and the future. Methods: We use a conceptual review to examine underlying mechanisms for the competitive exclusion hypothesis and the nature of facilitative interactions between Sphagnum and vascular plants under potential global change conditions. We complement the review with an empirical study of peatlands with contrasting hydrology to provide some critical insights into the potential effects of change in plant communities on carbon sequestration. We also propose a conceptual model that presents probable combinations of global change factors and their implications for carbon sequestration. Results: Vegetation structure in Sphagnum-dominated peatland appears to be driven largely by hydrology, rather than competition among plant functional groups. The peat deposit also exerts some controls (e.g., nutrient immobilization) on biotic structure, thereby acting as resistance against an abrupt shift in plant communities. Main conclusions: Peatland controls that constrain vegetation shifts have developed over a millennial time-scale in many peatlands, and the pace of climate change may not allow enough time for the establishment of those mechanisms in younger peatlands. Thus, the persistence of a given peatland as a carbon sink also likely depends on the successional stage of the peatland. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","competition; decomposition; hummock-hollow; nitrogen deposition; peatland controls; shading","carbon sequestration; community dynamics; competition (ecology); decomposition; global change; moss; nitrogen; peatland; plant community; shading; Bryophyta; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087801999

Yet the magnitude and seasonal patterns of lake GHG emissions are poorly constrained, because sampling is limited in these remote landscapes, particularly during winter and shoulder seasons. To better define patterns of under ice GHG content (and emissions potential at spring thaw), we surveyed carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations and stable isotopic composition during winter of 2017 in 13 lakes in the arid Yukon Flats Basin of interior Alaska, USA. Partial pressures of CO2 and CH4 ranged over three orders of magnitude, were positively correlated, and CO2 exceeded CH4 at all but one site. Shallow, organic matter-rich lakes located at lower elevations tended to have the highest concentrations of both gases, though CH4 content was more heterogeneous and only abundant in oxygen-depleted lakes, while CO2 was negatively correlated to oxygen content. Isotopic values of CO2 spanned a narrow range (-10‰ to-23‰) compared to CH4, which ranged over 50‰ (-19‰ to-71‰), indicating CH4 source pathways and sink strength varied widely between lakes. Miller-Tans and Keeling plots qualitatively suggested two groups of lakes were present; one with isotopically enriched source CH4 possibly more dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis, and one with depleted signatures suggesting a dominance of the hydrogenotrophic production. Overall, regional lake differences in winter under ice GHG content appear to track landscape position, oxygen, and organic matter content and composition, causing patterns to vary widely even within a relatively small geographic area of interior Alaska. © 2020 The Author(s).

This extended leaf phenology is thought to grant invasive species an advantage over native species because spring and fall are crucial times for light access and carbon acquisition in understory habitats. However, it is unclear whether this advantage persists at northern latitudes where freezing temperatures constrain growing season length and low light levels reduce carbon gain. To investigate the costs and benefits of extended leaf phenology at northern latitudes, we observed leaf phenology, estimated total carbon gain, measured growth, and tested susceptibility to freezing temperatures for four native and four invasive woody shrubs in a disturbed forest in northern Minnesota, USA. We found that the invaders leafed out simultaneously with the natives in the spring but retained their leaves later in the autumn than native species. This extended fall phenology did not enable greater total carbon gain for the invaders because they assimilated less carbon earlier in the year than the natives. There was also no significant difference between native and invasive species in their susceptibility to freezing temperatures. Instead freezing tolerance related more to native range then leaf phenology. Our results suggest that freezing temperatures do not limit invasive species’ northern expansion and instead indicate that at the northern edge of their ranges, these species may lose any competitive advantage granted by extended leaf phenology over their native associates. This study demonstrates the importance of considering latitude and forest structure when investigating phenology and growth. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon assimilation; Distribution; Leaf out; Photosynthesis; Senescence","growing season; growth; invasive species; latitude; leaf area; native species; phenology; seasonal variation; understory; woody plant; Minnesota; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087461452

We employ panel data models on farm household and 31-year rainfall and temperature data to analyze the effects of climatic variability and change on crop diversification among small-scale farmers disaggregated by agroecological zones in Kenya. We find widespread crop diversification among small farms in warmer regions as a risk management strategy. Results further show that smaller farm size, limited use of inorganic fertilizer, low household incomes, and limited access to off-farm livelihood options influence the decision to diversify crop production. However, crop diversification is not a one-size-fits-all strategy and should be adopted in situations where it gives maximum benefits, consistent with existing land use policies and known benefits of a specified crop portfolio. Crop diversification should not crowd-out specialization, particularly among resource-endowed farmers. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Crop diversification; Kenya; Panel data; Small-scale farms","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Developing countries; Food supply; Land use; Productivity; Risk management; Agricultural productivity; Agro-ecological zones; Climatic variability; Crop diversification; Increase productions; Inorganic fertilizers; Risk management strategies; Small scale farmers; Crops; adaptive management; agroecology; climate effect; crop production; environmental risk; land use change; panel data; precipitation intensity; rural area; species diversity; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084494077

We examine the effects of geographic variations in soil type, agricultural inputs, farming practices, and direct land use changes on life cycle GHG emissions. We utilize GREET 2016 but replace default feedstock production inputs with geographically representative data for canola production across eight western Canadian regions (representing 99% of Canada's canola production) and replace the default conversion process with data from a novel process model previously developed in ASPEN in our research group wherein oil extraction is integrated with the HEFA-based fuel production process. Although canola production inputs and yields vary across the regions, resulting life cycle GHG emissions are similar if effects of land use and land management changes (LMC) are not included; 44–48 g CO2e/MJ for the eight regions (45%–50% reduction compared to petroleum jet fuel). Results are considerably more variable, 16–58 g CO2e/MJ, when including effects of land use and LMC directly related to conversion of lands from other uses to canola production (34%–82% reduction compared to petroleum jet fuel). We establish the main sources of emissions in the life cycle of canola jet fuel (N-fertilizer and related emissions, fuel production), identify that substantially higher emissions may occur when using feedstock sourced from regions where conversion of forested land to cropland had occurred, and identify benefits of less intense tillage practices and increased use of summerfallow land. The methods and findings are relevant in jurisdictions internationally that are incorporating GHG emissions reductions from aviation fuels in a low carbon fuel market or legislating carbon intensity reduction requirements. © 2020 The Authors.

The need to deploy a portfolio of GGR technologies in order to decarbonise sectors with the ‘hardest-to-abate’ emissions, particularly to achieve net-zero emissions targets, has become increasingly evident in recent years. In May 2019, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published a report outlining a pathway to net-zero emissions in the UK, which comprised significant contributions from engineered and land-based removals. The target of net-zero emissions has since been enshrined in UK legislation, meaning that GGR will likely be part of the UK's climate strategy. Plans for GGR deployment will therefore need to be set in motion in the short-term, in order to align with the timeframe proposed by the CCC. Despite a growing body of research examining the role governance could and should play in GGR development and deployment, there is a gap in the literature relating to the social implications of removal activities. In particular, the roles of procedural justice (PJ) and social legitimacy (SL) have not been closely examined. This study comprises an analysis of relevant legislation, combined with a series of interviews conducted in the community of Selby (a proposed location for BECCS development) in order to investigate PJ and SL in the context of GGR. It is found that the existing legal framework operates PJ as a ‘tick-the-box’ exercise, failing to engage a wide range of interested stakeholders or to promote meaningful engagements. Moreover, the PJ landscape for GGR is unplanned and adapted from existing legislation and cannot meet the unique needs of this novel activity, such as the need to engage the wider national public given their interest in climate change mitigation. Research in Selby corroborates these findings, revealing a range of issues with engagement procedures, including disinterest or disillusionment with processes, a lack of accessible information, and a disparity between stakeholder expectations and GGR realities. Ultimately, it is only by conducting meaningful engagements, which adequately inform and include participants, that the role of social legitimacy can truly be understood and thus leveraged. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","engagement; governance; greenhouse gas removal; negative emissions; net zero; procedural justice; public acceptance; public participation; social legitimacy; social licence","adult; article; climate change; exercise; expectation; greenhouse gas; human; interview; justice; law; licence; motion; nonhuman; tick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087277767

Climate change impacts that manifest through droughts, heat waves, floods, scarcity of water and depletion of the natural resource base are becoming more precarious in the lives and livelihoods of rural women. This study aims to delineate factors hampering the participation of rural women in the climate change discourse in the Vhembe District, Limpopo, South Africa. The study adopted the qualitative methodology guided by a multi-case study design. A sample of 24 participants was selected through multistage sampling techniques. Rural women and social workers participated in the study. The data were collected using focus group discussions and semi-structured individual interviews and were analysed thematically. The study established that rural women in the Vhembe District are not participating in climate change decision-making processes, especially when it comes to community level politics where climate change-related decisions are made. Furthermore, the pervasive patriarchal dominance in the district discriminates against women and prevents them from acquiring land and property rights as well as adequate information about climate change adaptation and mitigation. The low social status of women is reducing their efforts to participate in the climate change discourse despite their perennial vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. These challenges faced by rural women in the climate change discourse are a cause for concern for the social work profession which is premised on enhancing human well-being. © Unisa Press 2020","Climate change; Participation; Rural women; Social work; Vhembe District",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106221443

The constructed wetlands (CWs) technology has been globally adopted as a green technology owing to its significant reduction in energy demand, economic costs, and environmental pollution. The present review reports the status quo in CWs technology, elucidated numerous CWs contaminants depuration strategies including the heavy metals remedial mechanisms; phytoextraction, phytostabilization, Phyto-volatilization, and rhizo-filtration which are rarely covered in several CWs –related literature. It reports the progress on CWs adoption and highlights the confronting challenges which are capable of systematically debunking the technology sustainability and the putative appraisal if neglected. It recognizes that the current scenarios and the perception of CWs demand urgent operational reassessment. Specifically, it notes that the wetlands sustainability assessment protocol in most rural and peri-urban regions still lacks stringent regulations and effective enactment. It identified the environment as a global ecosystem and stressed that the urban regions would not be essentially separated from the environmental impacts e.g., GHG due to CWs poor maintenance and operations in rural areas. It remarks that a cleaner productive measure through integrated actions is imperative for GHG reduction. Further, it advises that the cyanobacteria be included as potential contaminants in such a complex system as CW-ecosystem with its mitigation step incorporated in the management convention. The study hence provides a current scenario and vital expositions concerning achieving sustainable CW operations at a significantly low residual environmental effect over a long maintenance period. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Constructed wetlands sustainability; Global warming; Greenhouse emission; Optimization; Wastewater","Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Heavy metals; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Environmental pollutions; Maintenance and operation; Maintenance periods; Potential contaminants; Stringent regulations; Sustainability assessment; Ecosystems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086585216

Numerous restrictions have been implemented in airline transport, which is potentially leading toward severe long-term impacts on the global airline industry. In this paper, air transport mobility was analyzed regarding Europe (EU) based on the available data from the relevant sources associated with the airline industry. Data were analyzed in specific periods from January to April of 2020, which corresponded with the initialization of the pandemic in the EU and later in its full development. Specifically, two airports were selected in Croatia as case studies to analyze the impact of COVID-19 more thoroughly on mobility together with the estimation of carbon footprint during the pandemic and the year before the pandemic state. The results revealed that COVID-19 gradually affected air transport mobility in the EU where a peak was reached in April with a reduction in the number of flights in the EU region reaching more than 89%. Cargo traffic was not significantly affected by the pandemic, and was even increased in some cases due to the supply of medical equipment in the fight against the disease. The analyzed case study revealed the reduction in air transport mobility for selected airports to be more than 96%, which directly affected the reduction of CO2 emissions to factor 1.81 for the commercial airport of Zagreb and 3.49 for the seasonal airport of Split. A normalization of air transport mobility is expected to be reached through a 1-year period with a continued reduction in the number of flights ranging from 15% to 25%, based on the projections and expectations from relevant EU associations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aviation; carbon footprint; COVID-19; Europe; mobility; pandemic; sustainability","Airports; Carbon footprint; Disease control; Air transport; Airline industry; Cargo traffic; Case-studies; CO2 emissions; Commercial airports; Coronaviruses; Long-term impacts; Air transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088658118

Prior to a (co-)combustion study, cold-state hydrodynamic tests were performed to investigate the flow regimes and hydrodynamic characteristics of a silica sand bed employed in this reactor. Static bed height of 20 cm was found suitable to ensure bubbling fluidization of the swirling bed during (co-)firing experiments. In the (co-)combustion study, rice husk (a base fuel) was first co-fired with high-moisture sugarcane bagasse (sharing 15% of the total heat input) using an air staging technique, whereas in the second group of experiments, the base fuel was combusted alone with flue gas recirculation. Detailed investigations of (co-)combustion and emission characteristics of the two proposed techniques was performed with a 100 kW heat input to the combustor for variable operating parameters: 30–60% excess air, 0–0.3 secondary-to-total air ratio in the tests for air staging, and 5– 20% fraction of the recycling flue gas when using the second technique. In all test runs, both (co-)combustion techniques ensured NO reducing conditions in the lower combustor’s chamber, leading eventually to the NO emission reduction, compared to burning the base fuel alone. At optimal operating parameters, the combustor showed high (~ 99%) combustion efficiency and reduction of NO emission: by 30% for husk-bagasse co-firing with air staging, and by 38% when burning rice husk with flue gas recirculation, as compared to conventional combustion of the base fuel.

The immense potential of peri-urban and rural hinterlands to counter the climate emergency is therefore also overlooked. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)Climate-KIC’s (Knowledge and Innovation Community) System and sustainable Approach to virTuous interaction of Urban and Rural LaNdscapes (SATURN) aims to address this short-sightedness. The reason why we do not see or value the landscape is complex, but part of the problem relates to its multiple ownership, numerous types and scales of conflicting designations, governance structures, policy requirements, and regulatory frameworks. This leads to an approach that is fragmented and sectoral and, therefore, fails to see the bigger picture or recognise the value that the territory has in order to deal with current environmental challenges. With partners from across Europe, the pan-European Orchestrated Ecosystem research project co-funded by EIT Climate-KIC, SATURN aims to develop new integrated strategies which will increase awareness of the capacity of the landscape, which is seen is seen as a vital way to address the deepening climate emergency. SATURN anticipates that the outputs will build capacity across Europe to help nation-states meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and respond to the environmental challenges. This paper, reporting on interim findings, sets out the next phase of the project and concludes with lessons learned so far, including an initial identification of processes that can be applied in regions across Europe and an evaluation of the significance of exchanging knowledge between different countries. © 2020 by the authors.

Using an inductive, multi-dimensional approach, we analyzed the differences in cocoa and total system yield, economic performance, soil chemical and physical properties, incidence of pests and diseases, potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation. Cocoa agroforestry systems outcompeted monocultures in most indicators. Cocoa yields in agroforestry systems were 25% lower than in monocultures, but total system yields were about ten times higher, contributing to food security and diversified incomes. This finding was supported by a similar profitability of both production systems. Cocoa agroforestry contributed to climate change mitigation by storing 2.5 times more carbon and to adaptation by lowering mean temperatures and buffering temperature extremes. We found no significant differences in relation to the main soil parameters. The effect of the type of production system on disease incidence depended on the fungal species. The few available studies comparing biodiversity showed a higher biodiversity in cocoa agroforestry systems. Increased and specific knowledge on local tree selections and local socio-economic and environmental conditions, as well as building and enabling alternative markets for agroforestry products, could contribute to further adoption and sustainability of cocoa agroforestry systems. © 2020 The Author(s).","Biodiversity; Economic performance; Pests and diseases; Sustainability; System yield; Theobroma cacao","Biodiversity; Chemical analysis; Climate change; Cocoa; Economics; Food storage; Food supply; Soil conservation; Sustainable development; Biodiversity conservation; Chemical and physical properties; Climate change mitigation; Economic performance; Environmental conditions; Multi-dimensional approach; Scientific knowledge; Temperature extremes; Forestry; agroforestry; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; buffering; climate change; cocoa; crop production; extreme event; fungus; high temperature; low temperature; monoculture; socioeconomic conditions; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093099914

The objective has been to quantify the CO2 residual trapping in-situ, based on two distinctly different methods. Both experiments are based on the principle of a combination of hydraulic, thermal and/or tracer tests before and after creating the residually trapped zone of CO2 and using the difference in the responses of these tests to estimate the in-situ residual trapping. In Residual Trapping Experiment I (RTE I), carried out in autumn 2016, the main characterization test before and after the creation of the residually trapped zone were hydraulic withdrawal tests. In this experiment, the residually trapped zone was also created by fluid withdrawal, by first injecting CO2, then withdrawing fluids until CO2 was at residual saturation. The second experiment, Residual Trapping Experiment II (RTE II), was carried out autumn 2017. In this experiment, the residually trapped CO2 zone was created by CO2 injection, followed by the injection of CO2-saturated water, to push away the mobile CO2 and leave the residually trapped CO2 behind. In this test, the main reference test carried out before and after creating the residually trapped zone was injection and recovery of gas partitioning tracer Krypton. This paper presents the experimental procedures and results of these experiments. A hydraulic withdrawal test as a characterization method was robust and gave a clear signal. Given the difficulties in injecting water optimally saturated with CO2, in order not to dissolve the residually trapped CO2 or to create situations with excess mobile gas, withdrawal test may also be a generally preferable hydraulic testing method, in comparison to injection. The limitation of any hydraulic test is that it only gives an averaged value over the test section. At Heletz additional information about CO2 distribution was obtained based on thermal measurements and by monitoring the pressure difference between the two sensors in the bolehole. The latter could be used to estimate the amount of mobile CO2 in the well test section. Tracer experiments with gas partitioning tracers can in principle give more detailed information of CO2 residual distribution in the reservoir than hydraulic tests can, but are also far more complicated to carry out, involving sophisticated and sensitive equipment. In the Heletz case the optimal injection of CO2-saturated water turned out to be difficult to achieve. Creating the zone of residual saturation by means of fluid withdrawal rather than by injecting CO2-saturated water seemed a more robust approach. Monitoring the gas contents in the test interval gave good guidance on the state of the system. Model interpretations of the two experiments to obtain values for CO2 residual saturation are presented in companion papers in this same Special Edition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 injection experiments; Gas partitioning tracers; Hydraulic tests; Residual trapping","Tracers; Well testing; Characterization methods; Characterization tests; Experimental procedure; Model interpretations; Partitioning tracers; Pressure differences; Residual distribution; Thermal measurements; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; comparative study; experimental study; fluid injection; hydraulics; hydrocarbon reservoir; partitioning; tracer; underground storage; Heletz; Israel; Southern District",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089806225

To identify effective transition strategies and accelerate the transition process, decision-makers require comprehensive information that can best be obtained through an evaluation of transition trajectories. However, little work has been done to develop comprehensive analysis systems that can evaluate this process. This study presents an indicator system to evaluate power system transitions that include 13 indicators capturing the technical, economic, environmental and policy dimensions. To test its efficacy, the dynamic target framework is applied to the power system transition in China, and comparisons are drawn against global market leaders such as Germany, the USA and Japan. This paper finds that the framework enables a more rigorous comparative analysis of power system transitions between countries than is currently offered by the application of piecemeal indicators. This framework complements contextually rich qualitative case studies. Empirical analysis shows that China’s transition trajectory has been convoluted because of its more severe environmental restrictions and policy guidance. Cooperation in the intelligent transition of the global power system can promote China’s power system transition. This approach should foster both the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to China’s resource constraints. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Comparative analysis; Evaluation indicator system; Power system transition; Socio-technical system","climate change; decision making; economic policy; energy efficiency; energy resource; policy making; power generation; China; Germany; Japan; United States; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086837602

In this work, the meteorological, chemical transport model and air quality models developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Australia are used in conjunction with the smoke emission model to simulate the formation and dispersion of particle aerosols (PM2.5) in the Greater Metropolitan Region of Sydney as the results of emission of different pollutant species from hazardous reduction burnings or from bushfires. The smoke emission model is based on a fire model describing two distinct fire behaviours: flaming and smothering. There are several schemes that can be used to estimate the emission factors of different emitted species from fire of various vegetation types. A comparison of these schemes is performed by comparing the air quality model output from air quality model with observation from monitoring stations in a case study, the May 2016 prescribed burning winter period, which caused elevated particle concentrations in the Sydney basin. The PM2.5 prediction over the Greater Metropolitan Region of Sydney from the forecasting modelling tool will then be used to calculate the population exposure and health impacts due to the May 2016 fire event as a case study. The three main health endpoints considered for health impacts are mortality, respiratory-related and cardiovascular hospitalisations. The results are comparable with other studies using non-modelling methods of determining the exposure and health impacts on this event. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air quality health impact; CCAM-CTM air quality model; Hazardous reduction burnings (HRB); Smoke aerosols; Smoke emission","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Health; Industrial research; Smoke; Air quality modeling; Chemical transport models; Commonwealth scientific and industrial researches; Metropolitan regions; Modelling and forecasting; Monitoring stations; Particle concentrations; Population exposure; Industrial emissions; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; bushfire; emission inventory; forecasting method; hazardous waste; health impact; incineration; metropolitan area; pollution effect; pollution exposure; smoke; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082867605

Such a change in economic structure also leads to a significant alteration in the provincial greenhouse gas emissions. In order to investigate these differences, this study compares the greenhouse gases emitted from the major human activities in agriculture and tourism-based provinces. For this purpose, Phuket and Phayao provinces in Thailand were chosen as representatives for tourism and agriculture, respectively. Environmental and economic performances of other tourist and agricultural areas in different countries were also presented to examine commonalities and differences. It was found that in the agricultural provinces, the major part of greenhouse gas emissions came from rice cultivation, while in the tourist provinces, from the energy sector. The comparative results among several locations show that the tourist areas (especially urban-tourism-based areas) mostly had a higher eco-efficiency due to the large income from tourism and other services. They also had higher greenhouse gas indices than agricultural areas, due to energy consumption. The performance of agriculture-and-tourism-based provinces was outstanding with the lowest average carbon footprint per capita while not performing badly on the other indices, partly due to a decrease in biomass burning. At a time when global warming is the major world problem, agri-tourism can be considered to be an optimal choice and direction for the sustainable development of both agricultural and tourist provinces. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Carbon footprint; Eco-efficiency; Environmental indices; Tourism","Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Location; Location based services; Sustainable development; Agricultural areas; Biomass-burning; Economic activities; Economic structure; Environmental and economic performance; Human activities; Optimal choice; Rice cultivation; Tourism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087784778

On the other hand, a culture of subsistence tends to maintain moral values in cultivating land that preserves nature, thereby reducing pressure for Mamar land conversion. The conclusion obtained is that a subsistence culture needs to be maintained and become a locomotive for maintaining the sustainability of development as a whole, by reducing the causes of vulnerability in society.

Here, an atmospheric chemistry and transport model was run with a range of landcover scenarios to quantify pollutant removal by the existing total UK vegetation as well as the UK urban vegetation and to quantify the effect of large-scale urban tree planting on urban air pollution. UK vegetation as a whole reduces area (population)-weighted concentrations significantly, by 10% (9%) for PM 2.5, 30% (22%) for SO 2, 24% (19%) for NH 3 and 15% (13%) for O 3, compared with a desert scenario. By contrast, urban vegetation reduces average urban PM 2.5 by only approximately 1%. Even large-scale conversion of half of existing open urban greenspace to forest would lower urban PM 2.5 by only another 1%, suggesting that the effect on air quality needs to be considered in the context of the wider benefits of urban tree planting, e.g. on physical and mental health. The net benefits of UK vegetation for NO 2 are small, and urban tree planting is even forecast to increase urban NO 2 and NOx concentrations, due to the chemical interaction with changes in BVOC emissions and O 3, but the details depend on tree species selection. By extrapolation, green infrastructure projects focusing on non-greenspace (roadside trees, green walls, roof-top gardens) would have to be implemented at very large scales to match this effect. Downscaling of the results to micro-interventions solely aimed at pollutant removal suggests that their impact is too limited for their cost-benefit analysis to compare favourably with emission abatement measures. Urban vegetation planting is less effective for lowering pollution than measures to reduce emissions at source.

In this investigation, a series of Ni and Bi doped TiO2 catalysts with different Ni and Bi contents were synthesized by the conventional sol-gel method and tested for CO2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation. Synthesized nano-photo-catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, TEM, DRS, PL, FTIR and BET analyses. BET results indicated that the doping of Ni or/and Bi in the TiO2 framework resulted in BET specific surface area increment with respect to pure TiO2. DRS analysis showed that Ni doped TiO2, Bi doped TiO2, and co-doped samples had narrower band gap energy and consequently considerably higher light absorption in the visible region compared with pure TiO2. Doping Ni and Bi in TiO2 suppressed the rate of electron-hole recombination as indicated by PL spectra. CO2 adsorption capacity were increased in presence of Bi ions in comparison with pure TiO2 and Ni doped sample as a result of reactant adsorption increase on the surface of catalyst. The yield of methane considerably increased in the presence of Ni and Bi doped samples. The highest methane production (21.13 μmol/gcat) was obtained for 1 wt% Ni–3 wt% Bi co-doped TiO2, which was almost 6.5 times greater than that for pure TiO2 © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In 1961, initial awareness of environmental risks led to the adoption of the Abatement of Nuisances Law, which served as the platform for air pollution policy for several decades, even as population growth and growth of the industrial sector, including fossil fuel power plants, led to a continuous increase in air pollution. In the early 2000s, the environmental movement in Israel criticized local air pollution policy as being out of date and started to promote a new Clean Air Law. The law, which was adopted in 2008 and came into force in 2011, was a watershed in air pollution policy in Israel. It includes ambient air quality values for 28 contaminants, emission permits for the industrial sector based on best available techniques (BAT), an enforcement system, and a unified and transparent monitoring system. This paper reviews the history of air pollution policy in Israel from 1948, through the 1961 and 2008 landmark legislations and their strengths and weaknesses, to the present.

Provided only by select bacteria and archaea in marine systems, this vitamin is known to limit primary production in different oceanic areas. Understanding the consequences of cobalamin limitation on phytoplankton physiology is of great interest, notably for cobalamin-dependent haptophytes that significantly contribute to oceanic carbon fixation and sulfur cycle through dimethyl sulfonio propionate (DMSP) synthesis. Here, the effect of cobalamin limitation was compared to nitrogen limitation on the model haptophyte Tisochrysis lutea grown in chemostats, combining comparative proteomics with the analysis of major macromolecules and specific osmolytes. Our results highlight the interconnection of carbon and DMSP metabolisms through the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthesis by showing that cobalamin scarcity impacts the mechanisms of carbon allocation and reduces DMSP quota. Conversely, proline production seemed to anticorrelate with cobalamin availability. In a boarder context, analysis of transcriptomes or genomes of main DMSP producers from different phytoplankton lineages suggests that most of them are cobalamin-dependent, which means that prokaryotic cobalamin synthesis exerts an important control on phytoplankton DMSP production in some regions of the world ocean. © Copyright © 2020 Nef, Henry, Nicolau, Bérard, Hervé, Caruana, Kaas, Mairet and Garnier.","chemostat; cobalamin; comparative proteomics; DMSP; haptophyte microalgae; metabolism; Tisochrysis lutea; vitamin B12",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093955410

Carbon dioxide adversely affects the environment, therefore, its utilization and storage are critical. In this work, a simplistic approach of single-stage membrane units combine with amine absorption processes with different commercial amines was investigated. An increase in CO2 concentration in the feed gas results in a substantial increase in the thermal energy consumption of the stripper reboiler were using a hybrid amine-membrane setup can effectively reduce energy consumed in the reboiler. Both the amine absorption process and membrane process are simulated using Aspen HYSYS V10. Since the membrane is not available in Aspen HYSYS V10 unit operation package; it is programmed and added as custom user operation. Moreover, a new acid/ amine-based fluid package builds in a combination of the Peng-Robinson equation of state for vapor phase and electrolyte non-random two liquid-based activity model for the liquid phase were used in this study. Furthermore, energy consumption in CO2 capture using different alkanolamine such as N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), monethanolamine (MEA), deithanolamine (DEA), piperazine (PZ), triethanolamine (TEA) are also studied.

Design/methodology - This empirical study uses the financial statements of 83 semiconductor listed companies in 23 provinces from 2004 to 2019 approved by CSRC (2019). A stepwise regression and backward regression are employed in order to examine the role of innovation space to expand technology investment in promoting business growth and uses South Korean Samsung’s investment in China as a test case. Findings - Results indicate that innovation space, technology input, geographical area, owner’s background, operating years and financing liabilities all contribute to a boost in business growth. Factors such as carbon emission, financial liberalization, government efficiency, technology input, and financing liabilities further influence management growth. Innovation space follows a nonlinear pattern, and this plays a positive role in magnifying the influence of technology on management growth. Additionally, operations of the state-owned companies and expansionary financing enterprises are influenced by the external economy. Regarding the spatial distribution, the Samsung investment in 24 companies in China shows that Samsung focuses on the acquisition of scarce resources for semiconductor production as a component of its investment and innovation strategy. Originality/value - Even though prior research has considered the concepts studied here, this study contributes to empirically evaluate the direct impact of innovation space on business growth, and the indirect impact of innovation space on business growth through technology investment.

A forward-looking, traffic-aware, high-level decision control (HLDC) algorithm is proposed in this article, where both traffic and road information (obtained from surrounding vehicles and municipal traffic management centers through connected vehicle technologies) are utilized. The objective is to dynamically optimize the vehicle speed trajectories to reduce, and potentially eliminate, idling time at red traffic lights. The benefits include reduced unnecessary engine restart, emissions, and an improvement in the overall energy efficiency of the CA-HEV. Utilizing the emerging technologies such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), available in connected vehicles, which includes vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and global positioning system (GPS), the HLDC receives the signal phase and timing (SPaT) information via V2I in order to coordinate the vehicle arrival at green phase of an upcoming traffic light when possible. The optimization also aims to eliminate unnecessary engine restarts in CA-HEV when approaching a red light or a stop sign, which has a significant impact on the overall fuel efficiency of CA-HEV. A complete CA-HEV model in MATLAB/Simulink is constructed to simulate, test, and validate the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show 39.5% fuel consumption savings due to optimization algorithm (HLDC) in addition to approximately 39.14% reduction in the total trip time. The results reflect the elimination of wasted idling fuel consumption at a red light, reduced unnecessary ICE restarts, and better utilization of the electric drive (ED) and energy storage system (ESS) power utilized in HE-CAVs. © 2020 SAE International.","Fuel consumption; Fuel savings; High-level decision controller (HLDC); Hybrid electric vehicle; Hybrid supervisory controller (HSC); Low-level powertrain decision controller (LLDC); V2I; Velocity optimization","Electric drives; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Engines; Fuel storage; Fuels; Global positioning system; MATLAB; Street traffic control; Traffic signs; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Automated vehicles; Control strategies; Emerging technologies; Energy storage systems; Optimization algorithms; Overall energy efficiency; Traffic management centers; Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113716347

However, natural regeneration entails synergies and trade-offs across ESs and across stakeholders. To evaluate these trade-offs, we assessed the economic value of four ESs along the course of a natural regeneration process of tropical dry forests of the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and examined how this can inform the design of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes incentivizing forest restoration. We estimated the monetary value of two provisioning ESs –forest products and fodder for calves–, using contingent valuation and direct market valuation methods, and two regulating ESs –carbon stocks and carbon sinks– using the voluntary carbon market prices and the social cost of carbon. We assessed these ESs in four natural regeneration stages: pasture, young secondary forest (0 to 12 years of natural regeneration), intermediate secondary forest (between 12 and 25 years of natural regeneration), and old-growth forest (more than 25 years of natural regeneration or primary forests). Results indicate that throughout the course of the natural regeneration process, there are changes in the magnitude of the trade-offs between regulating and provisioning ESs. We find a clear trade-off between regulating and provisioning ESs in the early stages of natural regeneration. However, as secondary forests grow older provisioning ESs recover, creating synergies rather than trade-offs in later stages of natural regeneration. Our results suggest a PES aiming to increase climate regulation services should focus on the carbon sink potential of young and intermediate secondary forests, as this would provide the greatest additionality and mitigation. We also showed the relevance of using a portfolio of economic valuation methods that can include a wider range of values for understanding landholders’ preferences. While with direct market valuation methods we found that young secondary forests have the lowest economic value as compared to other natural regeneration stages, contingent valuation showed that landholders value young secondary forests the most because of their potential – future – land use (i.e. the possibility of converting it back to pasture). © 2020 The Authors","Contingent valuation; Economic valuation; Natural regeneration; Payment for Ecosystem Services; Secondary forests","Carbon; Climate change; Conservation; Costs; Curricula; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Financial markets; Land use; Secondary recovery; Tropics; Climate change mitigation; Contingent valuations; Natural regeneration; Natural regeneration process; Regulation services; Secondary tropical forests; Social cost of carbon; Tropical dry forest; Reforestation; carbon sink; climate change; contingent valuation; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; igneous province; incentive; mitigation; old-growth forest; policy making; regeneration; secondary forest; service provision; trade-off; tropical forest; Carbon; Conservation; Costs; Economic Analysis; Ecosystems; Land Use; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Coast [Mexico]; Pacific Coast [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086366482

In this context, there has been a considerable body of research emphasis on reducing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon via the resurfacing of public spaces, streets and roofs, with vegetation and cool materials. At the time of writing, minor attention has been given to how buildings' façades could affect outdoor temperature ranges. Whereas facades are studied according to their capabilities of reducing building energy demand and grant indoor comfort, but scarce attention has been given to how their surfaces properties are affecting local microclimates. The proposed work thus assesses the thermal mitigation potential of façades properties such as windows to wall ratios and finishes attribute, such as reflectivity and emissivity. The study, starting from the definition and calibration of a Ladybug Tools' simulation workflow for the assessment of outdoor comfort conditions, simulates urban canyons located in three climate types (temperate warm, temperate cold, and tropical arid), parametrises façade types, along with canyon aspect ratios and ground thermal properties. By creating a hierarchy of importance of interventions between aspect ratios, ground and façade finishes, the work offers information useful to foster site-specific climate mitigation plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Façade; Ladybug Tools; Mean radiant temperature; Mitigation; Outdoor comfort; Urban microclimate","Aspect ratio; Atmospheric temperature; Building energy demands; Building facades; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Indoor comforts; Outdoor comforts; Outdoor temperature; Urban heat island; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087776401

PISCES, as part of the European Community Earth system model (EC-Earth) model suite, runs in offline mode using prescribed dynamical fields as simulated by the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean model. Present-day atmospheric deposition fluxes of inorganic N, Fe, and P into the global ocean account for 40 TgNyr-1, 0.28 Tg Fe yr-1, and 0.10 Tg P yr-1. Pre-industrial atmospheric nutrient deposition fluxes are lower compared to the present day (51 %, 36 %, and 40% for N, Fe, and P, respectively). However, the overall impact on global productivity is low (3 %) since a large part of marine productivity is driven by nutrients recycled in the upper ocean layer or other local factors. Prominent changes are, nevertheless, found for regional productivity. Reductions of up to 20% occur in oligotrophic regions such as the subtropical gyres in the Northern Hemisphere under pre-industrial conditions. In the subpolar Pacific, reduced pre-industrial Fe fluxes lead to a substantial decline of siliceous diatom production and subsequent accumulation of Si, P, and N, in the subpolar gyre. Transport of these nutrient-enriched waters leads to strongly elevated production of calcareous nanophytoplankton further south and southeast, where iron no longer limits productivity. The North Pacific is found to be the most sensitive to variations in depositional fluxes, mainly because the water exchange with nutrient-rich polar waters is hampered by land bridges. By contrast, large amounts of unutilized nutrients are advected equatorward in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, making these regions less sensitive to external nutrient inputs. Despite the lower aerosol N: P ratios with respect to the Redfield ratio during the pre-industrial period, the nitrogen fixation decreased in the subtropical gyres mainly due to diminished iron supply. Future changes in air pollutants under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario result in a modest decrease of the atmospheric nutrients inputs into the global ocean compared to the present day (13 %, 14 %, and 20% for N, Fe, and P, respectively), without significantly affecting the projected primary production in the model. Sensitivity simulations further show that the impact of atmospheric organic nutrients on the global oceanic productivity has turned out roughly as high as the present-day productivity increase since the preindustrial era when only the inorganic nutrients' supply is considered in the model. On the other hand, variations in atmospheric phosphorus supply have almost no effect on the calculated oceanic productivity. © 2021 ASTM International.

However, to achieve such targets, it is essential for the government to identify suitable combination of the RESs (electricity generation fuel mix) that can provide the greatest sustainability benefit to the country. In this paper, a multicriteria decision-making framework based on analytic hierarchy process and system dynamics techniques is proposed to evaluate and identify the best electricity generation fuel mix for Zambia. The renewable energy generation technologies considered include wind, solar photovoltaic, biomass, and hydropower. The criteria used are categorized as technical, economic, environmental, social, and political. The proposed approach was applied to rank the electricity generation fuel mix based on nine sustainability aspects: land use, CO2 emissions, job creation, policy promotion affordability, subsidy cost, air pollution reduction, RES electricity production, RES cumulative capacity, and RES initial capital cost. The results indicate that based on availability of RESs and sustainability aspects, in overall, the best future electricity generation mix option for Zambia is scenario with higher hydropower (40%) penetration, wind (30%), solar (20%), and lower biomass (10%) penetration in the overall electricity generation fuel mix, which is mainly due to environmental issues and availability of primary energy resources. The results further indicate that solar ranks first in most of the scenarios even after the penetration weights of RES are adjusted in the sensitivity analysis. The wind was ranked second in most of the scenarios followed by hydropower and last was biomass. These developed electricity generation fuel mix pathways would enable the country meeting the future electricity generation needs target at minimized environmental and social impacts by 2035. Therefore, this study is essential to assist in policy and decision making including planning at strategic level for sustainable energy diversification. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","clean cities; energy diversification; renewable energy sources; sustainable energy planning; Zambia","Biomass; Climate change; Decision making; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Fuels; Geothermal energy; Hydroelectric power; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Energy diversification; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making frameworks; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy planning; System dynamics technique; Zambia; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079414377

However, empirical research that examines co-occurring environmental effects on northern fish communities remains limited. We used fish community data from 1587 Alaskan stream sites to examine the potential combined and interacting effects of climate change, current weather, habitat, land use, and fire on two community-level metrics (species richness, relative abundance), and on the distributions of three Alaskan fish species. Our models were 71–76% accurate in predicting the distribution of Alaskan stream fishes using a combination of climate and habitat variables. In contrast to other freshwater ecosystems that are most threatened by land use pressures, we did not detect any evidence for the potential stress of anthropogenic land use or fire on stream fishes. Warming temperatures increased overall community richness and abundance but produced differing responses at the species level. Juvenile salmon presence was positively associated with several climate variables including warmer spring and autumn temperatures and wetter summers. In comparison, warmer seasonal temperatures contributed to declines for northern-adapted species such as Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden. This study highlights the overarching role of current and changing climate in regulating northern stream fish biodiversity. Although many fish species may benefit from climate change across their northern ranges, localised declines are likely to occur and may prove detrimental for communities with limited fishing portfolios. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies customised for rapidly changing northern ecosystems will play an essential role in preserving ecologically unique northern species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; interactions; management; northern; Pacific salmon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087143699

The increasing occurrence of temporary intra-seasonal droughts and waterlogging longer than a week demands climate-smart solutions. Research has focused on water deficits since the 1980s. However, besides droughts, waterlogging can restrict productivity of sensitive cash and staple crops as cotton and corn. The year 2019 offered the historically unique opportunity to monitor waterlogging effects with 1088 mm precipitation in the rural commune Cinzanawith an isohyet of 681 mm. Impacts of two extreme downpours on three sorghum cultivars were monitored in a farmers-field experiment with three replications. All sorghum cultivars performed well in 2019 with significantly higher grain and above ground biomass yields than in the reference year 2007, with well distributed rainfall in Cinzana. “Jakumbè” (CSM63E) produced significantly higher grain yields than the hybrid cultivar “PR3009B” bred for high harvest index. The local cultivar “Gnofing” selected by local farmers produced significantly higher above ground biomass. All cultivars tolerated without severe stress symptoms 20 days waterlogging and 72 h inundation. Further waterlogging resilience research of other crops and other sorghum cultivars is needed to strengthen food security in Mali with expected increasing precipitation variation in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

As the effects of climate change amplify the impacts of natural hazards, a critical aspect of the nation’s overall resiliency includes the ability of the maritime and coastal sectors to recover effectively from external shocks and to adapt to changing environmental conditions in order to continue to provide the services the nation relies upon for economic viability and homeland security. This requires adaptation for physical infrastructure as well as organizational, operational, and community elements throughout the maritime transportation system. This paper provides a literature review of port climate adaptation approaches, which highlights the established need and opportunities for collaboration among coastal stakeholders to implement climate adaptation in port communities. The current lack of federal support in the United States for climate adaptation in the maritime sector emphasizes the need for novel methods and approaches to facilitate adaptation at individual port and regional levels. A case study from the port community of Hampton Roads, Virginia provides an example of the time and effort dedicated to stakeholder collaboration to encourage local understanding of climate risks in order to facilitate successful adaptation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate adaptation; climate change; Hampton Roads; Ports; stakeholder collaboration; Virginia","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; environmental conditions; maritime transportation; port; stakeholder; transportation system; United States; Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080899487

The use of woody biomass is effective in reducing CO2 emissions in hot-water supply systems. This report deals with a system that combines a wood pellet boiler (PB) and a heat pump system with CO2 (CO2HP) that is used in a facility for disabled people. The following research was conducted. The operation of a hybrid system combining a PB and CO2HPs was investigated. While operating the system, four specific operations were developed as countermeasures to save on costs and reduce system troubles while reducing CO2 emissions. The processes and results are introduced. Numerical simulations were carried out to optimize the operation. The hot water temperature, water volume, and hot water loads were simulated. The influence of the water volume ratio on the cost and primary energy consumption under the requirements for safe system operation was studied. The regional economic ripple effects (REREs) of this system were studied. The wood pellet boiler is not only a measure for reducing primary energy consumption but can also play an important role in a regional economy for sustainable development in countries that import energy resources such as Japan. © 2020 by the authors.","Combined system; Heat pump; Hot water supply; Regional economic ripple effect; Wood pellet boiler; Woody biomass","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Hybrid systems; Pelletizing; Regional planning; Water supply; Water supply systems; Building sectors; Disabled people; Hot water load; Hot-water supply; Primary energy consumption; Regional economic; Regional economy; System operation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093826214

The objective of the study is focused on Mediterranean region connectivity initiatives in the context of the broader vision of an interconnected European-Mediterranean (Euro-Med) power system for a future low-carbon energy system as the fundamental objective of Med-TSO, the Association of the Mediterranean Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for electricity. The analysis examines how the power grid connectivity evolves from now on to 2030, describing the progress made to date in integrating the power grids of the Mediterranean region as well as the future possibilities for a more integrated power grid covering the whole region. The research, conducted within Mediterranean Project II of Med-TSO, includes an overview on the current situation of the interconnections and the proposal for the 2030 interconnections Master Plan, coherent with the national development plans (NDPs) and shared energy scenarios for the whole region at the same horizon of 2030. It conducts an assessment of the gap between the current and the 2030 expected situation, taking into account the energy transition toward 2030 objectives resulting from the achievements of climate change pledges, local governmental policies and EU strategy for neighboring countries and Africa. The solutions survey includes technical solutions, procedures and rules to improve systems' integration and increase regional electricity exchanges in Med-TSO countries, and is aimed at achieving a higher quality of services and better efficiency of energy supply in Med-TSO member countries in the framework of the expected energy transition. The main scope is to present solutions that will be made available due to maturity and experience in the coming decade, specifically: high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technologies, energy storage, sectors coupling, smart grid technologies and services, inter-TSO and transmission-distribution cooperation platforms, etc. The article presents two case studies: the island paradigm and a new cross-border interconnection project of common interest. Finally, the post-pandemic core role of TSOs, which has become more relevant than ever, is transformed into a key-enabler of energy transition towards a sustainable, resilient and innovative climate-neutral recovery. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Cross border interconnections; Energy transition; Grid integration; Mediterranean region; Technical solutions","Climate change; Electric energy storage; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; HVDC power transmission; Service industry; Storage as a service (STaaS); Surveys; Transmissions; Electricity exchanges; Governmental policies; High voltage direct current transmission; Interconnection projects; Low-carbon energy systems; National Development Plan; Smart Grid technologies; Transmission system operators; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092900982

We assessed the future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean pine forests under a set of management and climate change scenarios, built by combining different regional policies and climate change assumptions. We used the process-based model SORTIE-ND to simulate forest dynamics under each scenario. We coupled the outputs of SORTIE-ND with empirical and process-based models to estimate changes in harvested timber, carbon storage, mushroom yield, water provision, soil erosion mitigation and habitat for biodiversity by 2100, and assessed the trade-offs and synergies between services. Our results suggest that future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean forests will be more strongly determined by management policies than by climate. However, no management policy maximized the provision of all services. The continuation of the business-as-usual management would benefit some services to the detriment of water provision, but leads to higher vulnerability to extreme drought-events or wildfires. Managing for reducing forest vulnerability will balance the provision of services while reducing the risk of damage to forest functioning. We also found multiple spatial synergies between ecosystem services provision, likely driven by differences in site productivity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Climate-smart forestry; Ecosystem services; EU-forest policies; Forest dynamics; Multi-functional forest; SORTIE-ND",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090032254

Contrary to what has been reported in the literature for polished copper surfaces, demonstrating a linear decrease in the faradaic efficiency (FE) as a function of decreasing partial pressure, the (FE) and partial current density of both ethylene and methane are improved when the CO2partial pressure is decreased below 1 atm, and an optimized ethylene efficiency of ∼45% is achieved in the range of ∼0.4-∼0.6 atm at −1.1 Vvs.RHE. Such optimum in ethylene FE, ranging from ∼10-45%, is obtained at a variety of applied voltages (−0.7 to −1.1 Vvs.RHE), but only at relatively low concentrations of KHCO3of less than 0.25 M. Since a low KHCO3concentration induces only a low buffer capacity, we conclude that a rise of local pH induced by a decreased CO2partial pressure explains improved selectivity towards ethylene. If the CO2partial pressure decreases below ∼0.4 atm, not only the availability of CO2limits ethylene selectivity, but also a fall in local pH, associated with the decreasing partial current density in formation of ethylene. Calculations of local concentrations of CO2and the pH corroborate these hypotheses. These findings contribute to, and substantiate the current understanding of the significant role of local pH conditions on the selectivity of CO2electroreduction products, and suggest high ethylene selectivity over oxide derived Cu electrodes can be obtained for diluted CO2feed compositions if the electrolyte has a relatively low buffer capacity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Buffer storage; Copper; Efficiency; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Applied voltages; Electrochemical reductions; Electrodeposited copper; Faradaic efficiencies; Low concentrations; Partial currents; Product selectivities; Two-compartment cells; Aliphatic compounds; carbon dioxide; copper; electrochemical method; electrolyte; ethylene; methane; optimization; partial pressure; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092175083

Understanding its resilience to extreme natural events, using biological principles, and integrating them into more holistic systems-wide modelling techniques is crucial to evaluate and design the wider economic impacts from alternative management interventions. Here we developed a probabilistic and system-wide bio-economic model to measure extreme economic impacts from natural events using the financial concept of Value at Risk. We have applied the new extreme economic impact metric to measure the economy-wide impact from the disruption of mountain-biking recreational services in the Whakarewarewa peri-urban forest in Rotorua, New Zealand from a potential windthrow event. We identified that extreme natural events, such as windthrows, could exert a substantial impact on the urban forest-dependent regional economy. This impact could potentially be intensified by the CO2 forest fertilization effects predicted under future climate scenarios and by adopting low-intensity silvicultural regimes currently rewarded by national climate change mitigation policies.

There has been a 40–50% improvement in the riverine water quality in terms of dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, coliform bacteria levels and suspended particulate matter. These short-term environmental benefits may even pose larger threat to the environment during the post-lockdown ‘as usual scenario’.

Delayed harvesting in aquaculture negatively impacted the production cost, water productivity and footprint, total water use and water use efficiency.

Here, we quantify the ancillary impacts on air pollution and human health using inverse emissions estimates based on multiple satellite observations. We find that Chinese NOx emissions were reduced by 36% from early January to mid-February, with more than 80% of reductions occurring after their respective lockdown in most provinces. The reduced precursor emissions increased surface ozone by up to 16 ppb over northern China but decreased PM2.5 by up to 23 μg m−3 nationwide. Changes in human exposure are associated with about 2,100 more ozone-related and at least 60,000 fewer PM2.5-related morbidity incidences, primarily from asthma cases, thereby augmenting efforts to reduce hospital admissions and alleviate negative impacts from potential delayed treatments. © 2020.

Cobalt macrocyclic complexes, e.g. those of porphyrins, phthalocyanines, tetraazaannulenes (TAA), cyclam, have been tested in order to replace platinum, the best catalyst but a rare and expensive metal. However it has been noted in some studies that these complexes suffer from degradation in an acidic environment. Suspicions have already been expressed that such degradation are caused by hydrogen peroxide or demetallation, but the reason for the loss of activity of these catalysts has never been experimentally established. In the present work, it has been clearly demonstrated that cobalt complexes are stable in the presence of acids when the metal centre is at the Co(III) oxidation state but are demetallated when it is reduced to the Co(II) oxidation state, which occurs during the oxygen reduction reaction. Co2+ is a borderline Lewis acid in Pearson's classification and thus can be substituted by H+ in an acidic environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aqueous acidic solution; Cobalt macrocyclic complexes; Demetallation; Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)","Catalyst activity; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Acidic conditions; Acidic environment; Cobalt complexes; Demetallation; Efficient catalysts; Macrocyclic complex; Oxidation state; Tetraazaannulenes; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089818814

These agricultural practices can potentially both contribute to climate change mitigation and increase the soil’s resilience to physical and biological stresses. The paper draws on research findings from five regions across Europe to identify regionally-specific barriers to and opportunities for the adoption of soil carbon management practices. Data were derived from 50 interviews with policy-makers and advisers and 5 stakeholder workshops in Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Spain. Several barriers to the uptake of soil carbon management practices were common across all regions, however, regional variations were also identified highlighting the importance of understanding the context into which these practices are introduced. Key barriers related to existing biophysical conditions, lack of financial support, farmer knowledge and experience, and the quality of the advisory service. Opportunities included providing economic incentives, harmonizing regulation, supporting long term thinking and planning for resilience and providing good quality advice. We conclude that in addition to persuasive mechanisms for encouraging the adoption of these practices, what is required is a more process-oriented approach that focuses on a series of experiential changes and fosters farmer learning through interactive models of communicative intervention. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","barriers; climate change mitigation; opportunities; Soil carbon management; sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074560061

Little is known, however, about how fluctuations in weather contribute to the experience of place and the connection to mental wellness in Inuit communities. This study aimed to characterize the importance of changes in weather among Inuit, and how these changes influence mental health and wellness in the context of climate change. Data were drawn from a community-driven and Inuit-led study in the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada. In-depth interviews (n = 116 people) were conducted between November 2012 to May 2013 in the five Nunatsiavut communities. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using a constant comparative method. Results indicated that weather impacted mental wellness through three key pathways: 1) shaping daily lived experiences including connection to place and other determinants of wellbeing; 2) altering mood and emotion on a transient basis; and 3) seasonally influencing individual and community health and wellbeing. These results demonstrate the immediate role weather has in shaping mental wellness in Nunatsiavut. In turn, this understanding of the climate-mental wellness relationship points to multiple pathways for action on climate adaptation policy and programming, and underscores the need for more culturally-specific and place-based investigations to appropriately respond to the mental health impacts of climate change. © 2020 The Authors","Circumpolar; Climate change; Inuit; Mental health; Mental wellness; Nunatsiavut; Seasonality; Weather","adaptive management; climate change; comparative study; ethnic group; mental health; qualitative analysis; snow; article; Canada; climate change; constant comparative method; controlled study; human; human experiment; interview; Inuit; major clinical study; mental health; mood; personal experience; public health; seasonal variation; weather; wellbeing; Inuit; Newfoundland and Labrador; weather; snow; Canada; Climate Change; Humans; Inuits; Mental Health; Newfoundland and Labrador; Snow; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090031864

The solution to the too high emissivity of individual economies in the European Union is the energy mix, which will establish a compromise in the so-called the triad of EU policy goals. This is undoubtedly a current climate challenge for the modern world, which also has a direct impact on the economic situation of EU countries. The basis of the presented considerations and recommendations is a literature review on the subject and a statistical analysis of empirical data of the largest statistical organizations in the EU and the world. The starting point for the analysis is the assessment of the state of the energy sector in the EU. Therefore, the goals and tasks until 2030 result from many conditions of the energy sector. The article provides recommendations for the EU on future climate and energy policy, analysing the practices of member countries empirical and data compiled by the world’s largest organizations and institutions, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Nuclear Association (WNA), Eurostat, and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The strategic goals of the EU climate and energy policy presented in the study show the necessary challenges for the implementation of sustainable development in the analyzed sector, which is the driving force of world economies.

Ionospheric scintillation is an important physical characteristic of radio wave signals propagating through the ionosphere. It is believed that a reverse backscattering analysis of the scintillating signals measured by GPS receivers on the ground may unveil some knowledge about the ionospheric irregularity structures causing the scattering in the first place and may in turn help understand the physical mechanisms causing the development of these irregularities. The Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) GPS data are used to build probability functions for the phase variation index, which are best fit by the four-parameter Landau distribution. The fits reveal that the distribution scale-parameter value captures the known patterns observed in the phase activity. In particular, the seasonal and the solar cycle dependence are identified. On a yearly basis, the obtained scale parameter is linearly dependent upon the solar radio flux index F10.7. The same parameter increases with the magnetic latitude and reaches a maximum at the cusp region. These results pinpoints the cusp region as a major place where ionospheric structures affecting the radio signal phase are formed before they propagate poleward and equatorward. Furthermore and using particle scattering by a random medium, the distribution scale parameter obtained for σΦ might be considered as the analog of the Total Electron Content. These preliminary results suggest that a detailed analysis of distribution of fluctuations in the radio signal can potentially provide a simple approach to develop scintillation climatological models. © 2020 IEEE.","GPS signal; Phase variation index σ Φ; probability distribution function","Ionosphere; Ionospheric measurement; Probability distributions; Radio waves; Scintillation; Solar energy; Backscattering analysis; Ionospheric irregularities; Ionospheric scintillation; Ionospheric structures; Physical characteristics; Probability functions; Propagation of radio waves; Total electron content; Global positioning system",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099881050

Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the carbon stock potential of woody species and how it varies by community types and topographic aspects, along altitudinal and slope gradients in Sirso moist evergreen Afromontane vegetation ecosystem of southern Ethiopia. To collect data, a systematic sampling procedure was employed. Five transects were laid out across altitudinal gradients which aligned parallel at 2 km intervals, and 50 sample plots (20 m × 20 m) were laid along transects at 100 m altitudinal interval. Carbon stock was estimated based on the equations and conversion factors formulated for tropical forest carbon stock measurement. The results showed that the total carbon stock of woody species in Sirso moist evergreen Afromontane forest was 384.44 ton/ha. The carbon stock of woody species varied among community types, along altitudinal and slope gradients, while topographic aspect had no significant effect. The carbon stock was higher for the community type of Dracaena fragrans–Rytigynia neglecta, for mid-altitude (1934–2319 m.a.s.l.), and upper slope class (58–75%). Schefflera abyssinica, Syzygium guineense, and Ficus sur contributed 49% of the total carbon stock. Our study suggests that selecting a certain forest as the mitigation option for climate change needs to consider the determinants including vegetation composition and topographic features such as altitude and slope gradients. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biomass; Carbon stock; Climate change mitigation; Determinant","climate change; evergreen forest; topographic effect; tropical forest; woody plant; Ethiopia; Ficus sur; Rytigynia; Schefflera; Syzygium guineense",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073999011

They focused on two sites: the Bucharest urban area and large power plants in the Jiu Valley. The main objectives of the campaigns were to test recently developed airborne observation systems dedicated to air quality studies and to verify their applicability for the validation of space-borne atmospheric missions such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)/Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P). We present the AROMAT campaigns from the perspective of findings related to the validation of tropospheric NO2, SO2, and H2CO. We also quantify the emissions of NOx and SO2 at both measurement sites. We show that tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) measurements using airborne mapping instruments are well suited for satellite validation in principle. The signalto- noise ratio of the airborne NO2 measurements is an order of magnitude higher than its space-borne counterpart when the airborne measurements are averaged at the TROPOMI pixel scale. However, we show that the temporal variation of the NO2 VCDs during a flight might be a significant source of comparison error. Considering the random error of the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD, the dynamic range of the NO2 VCDs field extends from detection limit up to 37 (2:61016 molec. cm-2) and 29 (21016 molec. cm-2) for Bucharest and the Jiu Valley, respectively. For both areas, we simulate validation exercises applied to the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 product. These simulations indicate that a comparison error budget closely matching the TROPOMI optimal target accuracy of 25% can be obtained by adding NO2 and aerosol profile information to the airborne mapping observations, which constrains the investigated accuracy to within 28 %. In addition to NO2, our study also addresses the measurements of SO2 emissions from power plants in the Jiu Valley and an urban hotspot of H2CO in the centre of Bucharest. For these two species, we conclude that the best validation strategy would consist of deploying ground-based measurement systems at well-identified locations. © Author(s) 2020",,"aerosol; air quality; detection method; ground-based measurement; model validation; pixel; satellite data; temporal analysis; temporal variation; urban area; Bucharest [Romania]; Hunedoara; Jiu Valley; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093933364

Mixing of Aw layers, representing Albic soil, with B layers, could improve the physicochemical properties of Albic soil, which is characterized by poor humus on the topsoil and high penetration resistance. The objective of the present study conducted in 2015-2016 in an Albic soil region in Heilongjiang province, China, was to explore the effects of different soil mixing strategies on the physicochemical properties of Albic soil and crop yield. There were four soil mixing treatments: Conventional subsoiler (CS), three-stage subsoil mixing plough (TSMP), four-stage subsoil mixing plough (FSMP), and three-stage subsoil interval mixing plough (TSIMP). Our results demonstrated that the Aw layer bulk density of Albic soil under TSMP, FSMP, and TSIMP decreased significantly compared to that under CS. In addition, the total porosity of the soil under these treatments increased significantly in 2 years. Compared to the water holding capacity under the CS treatment, other treatments increased significantly in the Aw layer. Furthermore, soil penetration resistance of the Aw layer decreased following Aw and B layer mixing. All three soil mixing treatments also increased soil aggregate stability and cation exchange capacity but reduced soil organic carbon content in the Aw layer. Soil mixing increased soybean and maize seed yield. Overall, Aw and B layer mixing improved Albic soil structure and physiochemical properties and increased crop yield; thus, this mixing is a feasible approach for Albic soil improvement, with optimal improvements observed under the FMSP strategy, which also added organic substances to the Aw layer. © 2020 Meng et al.

As an instrumental-technical intervention, planning is mainly used to improve the physical environment (through concepts such as regulating waterproof facades of architecture, setting buffering zones, and designing green-blue corridors). However, the implementation of the proposed physical interventions is often challenging and necessitates assistance from practices such as climate assessment, policy disciplines, civil societies, and economic resources. These extensive perspectives have spawned many new research domains in the realm of spatial planning. This paper provides a review of the recent developments in flood resilience, risk management, and climate adaptation; based on this, it positions planning research and practice within these works of literature. Four clusters of thought are identified, mainly in the European and American scholarship of the last two decades. They are environmental concerns, disaster management concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns. Current planning research concentrates on disaster management in the underlying belief that planning is functionally efficient. The attention to environmental concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns of planning research remains insufficient but has been growing. This, in turn, enlarges the scope of planning research and indicates future directions for study. These new concerns relate to spatial planning's ability to operate effectively in a multi-sectoral setting, despite limited resources and in the face of uncertain risk. © 2020 by the authors.","Flood resilience; Flood risk; Literature review; Spatial planning","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; flood; flood control; policy implementation; spatial planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092148791

Degradation efficiency was evaluated at different applied voltages and initial concentration of dye. The results showed that the microplasma discharge exhibited 99.4 % of degradation efficiency for 50 ppm of RB RGB within 16 min of treatment time and 22.4 % mineralization was achieved. The degradation efficiency increased on increasing the applied input voltage, while it decreased on increasing the initial concentration of dye. Further, the actual textile effluent (received from Tiruppur district, Tamilnadu, India) was treated with this microplasma discharge array and the formation of energetic electrons and free radicals during treatment significantly mineralized the as-received textile effluent with considerable reduction of total organic carbon i.e. 88.6 %.

Using data from a North American survey of e-bike owners, a mode replacement model was adapted and augmented to consider the case of Portland, OR for various levels of e-bike person miles traveled (PMT) mode share penetration. It was estimated that for a 15% e-bike PMT mode share, car trip mode share could be reduced from 84.7% to 74.8%. Total car PMT per day could be reduced from 28.9 million to 25.5 million. Furthermore, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from passenger transportation could be reduced by 12% after accounting for e-bike emissions from electricity generation and induced e-bike trips. An individual e-bike could provide an average reduction of 225 kg CO2 per year. These estimates show that e-bikes have the potential to help cities and regions achieve their climate goals.

It is unclear whether the inner ∼1 AU of disks are volatile-poor or if this region is resupplied with ice-rich dust from colder disk regions. Dust traps at radial pressure maxima bounding disk gaps can cut off the inner disk from these types of volatile reservoirs. However, the trap retention efficiency and atomic composition of trapped dust have not been measured. Aims. We present a new technique to measure the absolute atomic abundances in the gas accreting onto T Tauri stars and infer the bulk atomic composition and distribution of midplane solids that have been retained in the disk around the young star TW Hya. Methods. We identify near-infrared atomic line emission from gas-phase material inside the dust sublimation rim of TW Hya. Gaussian decomposition of the strongest H Paschen lines isolates the inner disk hydrogen emission. We measure several key elemental abundances, relative to hydrogen, using a chemical photoionization model and infer dust retention in the disk. With a 1D transport model, we determine approximate radial locations and retention efficiencies of dust traps for different elements. Results. Volatile and refractory elements are depleted from TW Hya's hot gas by factors of ∼102 and up to 105, respectively. The abundances of the trapped solids are consistent with a combination of primitive Solar System bodies. Dust traps beyond the CO and N2 snowline cumulatively sequester 96% of the total dust flux, while the trap at 2 AU, near the H2O snowline, retains 3%. The high depletions of Si, Mg, and Ca are explained by a third trap at 0.3 AU with >95% dust retention. Conclusion. TW Hya sports a significant volatile reservoir rich in C- and N-ices in its outer submillimeter ring structure. However, unless the inner disk was enhanced in C by earlier radial transport, typical C destruction mechanisms and the lack of a C resupply should leave the terrestrial planet-forming region of TW Hya ""dry""and carbon-poor. Any planets that form within the silicate dust trap at 0.3 AU could resemble Earth in terms of the degree of their volatile depletion. © 2020 ESO.","Astrochemistry; Herbig Ae/Be; Protoplanetary disks; Stars: variables: T Tauri; Techniques: spectroscopic","Atoms; Efficiency; Hydrogen; Infrared devices; Planets; Silicates; Stars; Atomic compositions; Elemental abundance; Gaussian decomposition; Photoionization models; Protoplanetary disks; Refractory elements; Retention efficiencies; Terrestrial planets; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093966611

However, previous work has largely ignored the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during litter decomposition. Unlike most leaf carbon, these litter-derived VOCs are able to diffuse directly into the soil matrix. Here, we used a 99-d microcosm experiment to track VOCs produced during microbial decomposition of 13C-labeled leaf litter into soil carbon fractions where the decomposing litters were only sharing headspace with the soil samples, thus preventing direct contact and aqueous movement of litter carbon. We also determined the effects of these litter-derived VOCs on soil microbial community structure. We demonstrated that the litter VOCs contributed to all measured soil carbon pools. Specifically, VOC-derived carbon accounted for 2.0, 0.61, 0.18, and 0.08% of carbon in the microbial biomass, dissolved organic matter, mineral-associated organic matter, and particulate organic matter pools, respectively. We also show that litter-derived VOCs can affect soil bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition. These findings highlight the importance of an underappreciated pathway where VOCs alter soil microbial communities and carbon dynamics. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","ammonium; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; microbial biomass; microbial diversity; mineral associated organic matter; nitrate; particulate organic matter; stable isotope probing; target gene sequencing; VOC","experiment; leaching; leaf litter; microbial community; microcosm; organic matter; particulate organic matter; soil microorganism; volatile organic compound; Bacteria (microorganisms); carbon; volatile organic compound; microbiology; microflora; plant leaf; soil; Carbon; Microbiota; Plant Leaves; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091310117

Area-based conservation efforts, which include both protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, are likely to extend and diversify. However, persistent shortfalls in ecological representation and management effectiveness diminish the potential role of area-based conservation in stemming biodiversity loss. Here we show how the expansion of protected areas by national governments since 2010 has had limited success in increasing the coverage across different elements of biodiversity (ecoregions, 12,056 threatened species, ‘Key Biodiversity Areas’ and wilderness areas) and ecosystem services (productive fisheries, and carbon services on land and sea). To be more successful after 2020, area-based conservation must contribute more effectively to meeting global biodiversity goals—ranging from preventing extinctions to retaining the most-intact ecosystems—and must better collaborate with the many Indigenous peoples, community groups and private initiatives that are central to the successful conservation of biodiversity. The long-term success of area-based conservation requires parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to secure adequate financing, plan for climate change and make biodiversity conservation a far stronger part of land, water and sea management policies. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; conservation status; ecosystem service; protected area; twenty first century; area based conservation; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation biology; ecosystem; environmental policy; environmental protection; fishery; government; human; indigenous people; marine environment; outcome assessment; priority journal; Review; sea; species conservation; trend study; water management; wilderness; animal; aquatic species; ecology; economics; environmental protection; geographic mapping; history; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Geographic Mapping; History, 21st Century; Wilderness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092307369

Real-world health and recorded PM pollution data for 2018 were used for assessing the health impacts and possible gains. Calculations were performed with WHO AirQ+ software against two scenarios with cut-off levels at country-legal values and WHO air quality recommendations.

Nonetheless, intermittency of renewable energies, especially solar and wind energy, represents one on the main challenge, typically overcome by the installation of electricity storage systems. This issue can be addressed by a new and original approach, consisting in energy-flexibility of the production, in which manufacturing parameters are selected to optimize and to align production planning to the renewable energy availability. The paper deals with a time dependent theoretical and numerical model developed to calculate the time evolution of the electric power required by a manufacturing system, self-consistently coupled with a renewable plant. The aim of the model is to align the power required by the manufacturing system with the renewable energy supply in order to obtain the maximum monthly profit. The model has been applied to a single work center powered by the electric grid and by a photo-voltaic system, performing the machining process over one year of production. The model includes the tool cost, the stocked units, the energy cost and the penalty for the unsatisfied demand. The maximum profit has been calculated with a hourly adaption of manufacturing parameters, i.e. the cutting speed, to the renewable time dependent power profile. The model presents general features and can be applied when production processes are fully characterized. In order to find the maximum profit, the model, inherently nonlinear, has been solved by recurring to the Trust-Region Method. Different scenarios characterized by fluctuations of product demand are considered in order to investigate the sensitivity of the manufacturing system to the uncertainty of the forecast demand. The influence of the photo-voltaic supply has been investigated, comparing results obtained in the case of manufacturing systems powered only by the electric grid. Numerical results show how the proposed method allows to select an optimized production planning, reducing the energy costs and CO2 emissions and finding the maximum profit with the best compromise between the market demand and energy costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Machining process; Optimization parameters; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Sustainable manufacturing systems","Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Machining; Numerical methods; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Solar energy; Wind power; Dynamic decision models; Electricity generation; Electricity storage systems; Energy-Efficient Scheduling; Manufacturing parameters; Manufacturing process; Solar and wind energies; Theoretical and numerical modeling; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088875153

The sustainable management of scrap metal is a challenging task for all the organisations that participate in the supply chain and especially for scrap metal producers and waste management companies. Although metals are considered to be infinitely recycled, scrap metal management is often inefficient due to several factors including collection processes, communication and marketplace limitations, which have significant environmental and economic impacts. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence of the impact of an IoT solution on the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) performance. A case study from a scrap metal producer that operates in the lift industry and a waste management company is presented, in order to illustrate how the deployment of a state-of-the-art industry 4.0 solution has the potential to improve sustainability both in the firm level and in the supply chain level. Direct benefits of the introduced solution are the automation of monitoring and negotiation procedures for the produced scrap metal. Indirectly, the proposed solution is beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions’ reduction, resources availability and response time optimization. The results validate the framework for assessing SSCM for Industry 4.0 developed by Manavalan and Jayakrishna (2019) and demonstrate that Ιndustry 4.0 solutions have the potential to improve, among others, the economic, environmental and social sustainability in supply chain management.

How did these elements, so crucial to life and our surface environment, come to be sequestered within the deepest regions of the Earth, and what can they tell us about the processes occurring there? My approach has been to establish geochemical links between the noble gases, physical tracers par excellence, with major volatile elements of environmental importance, such as water, carbon and nitrogen, in mantle-derived rocks and gases. From these analyses we have learned that the Earth is relatively depleted in volatile elements when compared to its potential cosmochemical ancestors (e.g., ~2 ppm nitrogen compared to several hundreds of ppm in primitive meteorites) and that natural fluxes of carbon are two orders of magnitude lower than those emitted by current anthropogenic activity. Further insights into the origin of terrestrial volatiles have come from space missions that documented the composition of the protosolar nebula and the outer solar system. The consensus behind the origin of the atmosphere and the oceans is evolving constantly, although recently a general picture has started to emerge. At the dawn of the solar system, the volatile-forming elements (H, C, N, noble gases) that form the majority of our atmosphere and oceans were trapped in solid dusty phases (mostly in ice beyond the snowline and organics everywhere). These phases condensed from the proto-solar nebula gas, and/or were inherited from the interstellar medium. These accreted together within the next few million years to form the first planetesimals, some of which underwent differentiation very early on. The isotopic signatures of volatiles were also fixed very early and may even have preceded the first episodes of condensation and accretion. Throughout the accretion of the Earth, volatile elements were delivered by material from both the inner (dry, volatile-poor) and outer (volatile-rich) solar system. This delivery was concomitant with the metals and silicates that form the bulk of the planet. The contribution of bodies that formed in the far outer solar system, a region now populated by comets, is likely to have been very limited. In that sense, volatile elements were contributed continuously throughout Earth’s accretion from inner solar system reservoirs, which also provided the silicates and metal building blocks of the inner planets. Following accretion, it took a few hundred million years for the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans to stabilise. Luckily, we have been able to access a compositional record of the early atmosphere and oceans through the analysis of palaeo-atmospheric fluids trapped in Archean hydrothermal quartz. From these analyses, it appears that the surface reservoirs of the Earth evolved due to interactions between the early Sun and the top of the atmosphere, as well as the development of an early biosphere that progressively altered its chemistry. © 2020 Associacao Portuguesa de Estudos sobre as Mulheres.

HABIT consists of two modules: (i) EnvPack (Environmental Package) that monitors the thermal environment (air and ground), the incident ultraviolet radiation, the near-surface winds and the atmospheric dust cycle; and (ii) BOTTLE (Brine Observation Transition To Liquid Experiment), an In-situ Resource Utilization instrument to produce liquid water for future Mars exploration. BOTTLE will be used also to investigate the electrical conductivity properties of the martian atmosphere, the present-day atmospheric-ground water cycle and to evaluate if liquid water can exist on Mars in the form of brines, and for how long. These variables measured by HABIT are critical to determine the present and future habitability of the martian surface. In this paper, we describe in detail the HABIT instrument and sensors, together with the calibration of its Flight Model (FM) and the Engineering Qualification Model (EQM) versions. The EnvPack module has heritage from previous missions operating on the surface of Mars, and the environmental observations of its sensors will be directly comparable to those delivered by those missions. HABIT can provide information of the local temperature with ±0.2 ​°C accuracy, local winds with ±0.3 ​m/s, surface brightness temperature with ±0.8 ​°C, incident UV irradiance with 10% error of its absolute value in the UV-A, UV-B, UV-C ranges, as well as in the total UV-ABC range, and two additional wavebands, dedicated to ozone absorption. The UV observations can be used to derive the total opacity column and thus monitor the dust and ozone cycles. BOTTLE can demonstrate the hydration state of a set of four deliquescent salts, which have been found on Mars (calcium chloride, ferric sulphate, magnesium perchlorate and sodium perchlorate) by monitoring their electric conductivity (EC). The EC of the air and the dry salts under Earth ambient, clean room conditions is of the order of 0.1 μScm−1. We have simulated HABIT operations, within an environmental chamber, under martian conditions similar to those expected at Oxia Planum. For dry, CO2 atmospheric conditions at martian pressures, the air EC can be as low as 10−8 μScm−1, however it increases with the relative humidity (RH) percentage. The laboratory experiments show that after an increase from 0 to 60% RH within a few hours, the EC of the air increased up to 10−1 μScm−1, magnesium perchlorate hydrated and reached values of 10 μScm-1, whereas calcium chloride deliquesced forming a liquid state with EC of 102 μScm−1. HABIT will operate with a regular cadence, through day and night. The Electronic Unit (EU) is protected with a heater that is activated when its temperature is below −33 ​°C and disabled if the temperature of the surface platform rises above −30 ​°C. Additionally, the heaters of the BOTTLE unit can be activated to dehydrate the salts and reset the experiment. HABIT weighs only 918 ​g. Its power consumption depends on the operation mode and internal temperature, and it varies between 0.7 ​W, for nominal operation, and 13.1 ​W (when heaters are turned on at full intensity). HABIT has a baseline data rate of 1.5 MB/sol. In addition to providing critical environmental observations, this light and robust instrument, will be the first demonstrator of a water capturing system on the surface of Mars, and the first European In-Situ Resource Utilization in the surface of another planet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Astrobiology; Atmosphere; Brines; ExoMars; Habitability; Instrumentation; ISRU; Mars; Regolith; Surface platform; Water","Atmospheric humidity; Calcium chloride; Dust; Electric conductivity; Environmental chambers; Groundwater; Hydration; Incident solar radiation; Irradiation; Liquids; Magnesium compounds; Martian surface analysis; Ozone; Salts; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Water resources; Atmospheric conditions; Electrical conductivity; Engineering qualification modeling; Environmental instruments; Environmental observation; In-situ resource utilizations; Laboratory experiments; Surface brightness temperature; Bottles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086798730

As the cost of renewable energy generation is decreasing, mainly for photovoltaic energy, a significant increase in its production is expected, in particular at the local and domestic levels. Yet, much investment and development is still needed to fulfil the goals for renewable energy generation defined by the Portuguese government and the European Union, in order to decarbonize energy generation and reduce energy dependence. Besides limitations in the installed capacity, the full potential of existing and future RES is not fulfilled, mainly due to imbalances in supply and demand, resulting from the varying climatic conditions and limited energy storage capacity. Although some investment was made in large scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS), especially pumped hydro, distributed energy storage (DES), in particular for stationary domestic storage appliances, have received little attention from decision makers. When properly defined, designed and implemented, they can contribute to increase the efficiency of existing and future RES and the capacity factor. Thus, in this work the questions regarding the implementation of DES are analysed. The main criteria that have to be considered when selecting the proper storage technology for DES are defined, taking into account information and data from current legislation and/or strategic plans and goals, and the technical and scientific literature, in order to support decision making and policy definition at different levels. The proposed application of the various criteria leads to the conclusion that for DES, electrochemical based ESS are the most adequate, among which Li ion batteries and redox flow batteries, particularly suited for local and/or household applications. The current policies sought out for Portugal are also examined in order to identify which aspects should be improved to promote and increase the relevance of DES in the Portuguese energy mix, and it is concluded that specific policies and support are needed to increase the relevance of decentralized electricity storage systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Decentralized renewable energy generation; Distributed energy storage; Portugal; Renewable energy systems; Technology selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089135249

Plant growth is not only controlled by soil physico-chemistry but also by microbial activities through the decomposition of organic matter and the recycling of nutrients essential for plants. A growing body of evidence also suggests that plant functional traits modulate species’ response to environmental gradients. However, no study has yet contrasted the importance of soil physico-chemistry, microbial activities and climate on plant species distributions, while accounting for how plant functional traits can influence species-specific responses. Using hierarchical effects in a multi-species distribution model, we investigate how four functional traits related to resource acquisition (plant height, leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio, leaf dry matter content and specific leaf area) modulate the response of 44 plant species to climatic variables, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial decomposition activity (i.e. exoenzymatic activities) in the French Alps. Our hierarchical trait-based model allowed to predict well 41 species according to the TSS statistic. In addition to climate, the combination of soil C/N, as a measure of organic matter quality, and exoenzymatic activity, as a measure of microbial decomposition activity, strongly improved predictions of plant distributions. Plant traits played an important role. In particular, species with conservative traits performed better under limiting nutrient conditions but were outcompeted by exploitative plants in more favorable environments. We demonstrate tight associations between microbial decomposition activity, plant functional traits associated to different resource acquisition strategies and plant distributions. This highlights the importance of plant–soil linkages for mountain plant distributions. These results are crucial for biodiversity modelling in a world where both climatic and soil systems are undergoing profound and rapid transformations. © 2020 The Authors.

To predict future climate feedbacks, it is important to study the history of permafrost aggradation and thaw. Plant macrofossil analysis with radiocarbon dating has been widely used in detecting past permafrost dynamics in peatlands, however, due to a lack of permafrost-specific plant indicator species, determining the exact timing of permafrost aggradation remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated if oribatid mites can be used to determine Holocene permafrost aggradation and degradation in Canadian mires. Based on analyses of subfossil oribatid mite assemblages of Holocene peat profiles from two mires in the Hudson Bay Lowlands area, our results suggest that two species, Carabodes labyrinthicus and Neoribates aurantiacus, are useful bioindicators, which can be used in palaeoecological studies determining permafrost histories. Moreover, our results show that subfossil oribatid mite remains can reveal periods of permafrost, which cannot be determined with certainty based on plant macrofossils alone. © 2020 The Authors.

Nature-based solutions including salt marshes have been proposed to naturally enhance coastal infrastructure. A gently sloping grass-covered dike (i.e. Wide Green Dike) can be strengthened with clay accumulating locally in the salt marsh. This study explores the feasibility of extracting salt-marsh sediment for dike reinforcement as a climate adaptation strategy in several sea-level rise scenarios, using the Wide Green Dike in the Dutch part of the Ems-Dollard estuary as a case study. A 0-D sedimentation model was combined with a wave propagation model, and probabilistic models for wave impact and wave overtopping. This model system was used to determine the area of borrow pits required to supply clay for adequate dikes under different sea-level rise scenarios. For medium to high sea-level rise scenarios (>102 cm by 2100) thickening of the clay layer on the dike is required to compensate for the larger waves resulting from insufficient marsh accretion. The model results indicate that for our case study roughly 9.4 ha of borrow pit is sufficient to supply clay for 1 km of dike reinforcement until 2100. The simulated borrow pits are refilled within 22 simulation years on average, and infilling is projected to accelerate with sea-level rise and pit depth.

Previous studies in animal models with SCI have demonstrated a promising recovery in respiratory and phrenic nerve activity post-injury induced by the systemic and local administration of serotonin receptor agonists such as Buspirone and Trazodone. Human trials must be performed to determine whether individuals with SCI respond similarly. We hypothesized that Buspirone and Trazodone would decrease the propensity to hypocapnic CSA during sleep. We studied eight males with chronic SCI and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [age: 48.8 ± 14.2 yr; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): 44.9 ± 23.1] in a single-blind crossover design. For 13 days, participants were randomly assigned either Buspirone (7.5-15 mg twice daily), Trazodone (100 mg), or a placebo followed by a 14-day washout period before crossing over to the other interventions. Study nights included polysomnography and induction of CSA using a noninvasive ventilation protocol. We assessed indexes of SDB, CO2 reserve, apneic threshold (AT), controller gain (CG), plant gain (PG), and ventilatory parameters.

The suitability of these techniques depends on the particular application of interest and, especially, on the required spatial resolution. Whereas SD is appropriate for local (e.g., gauge) resolution, BA may be a good alternative when the gap between the predictor and predictand resolution is small. However, the different sources of uncertainty affecting SD such as reanalysis uncertainty, the choice of suitable predictors, climate model, and/or statistical approach may yield implausible projections in particular situations for which BA techniques may offer a compromise alternative, even for local resolution. In this work, we consider a case study with 41 rain gauges over Malawi and show that, despite producing similar results for a historical period, the use of different predictors may lead to large differences in the future projections obtained from SD methods. For instance, using temperature T (specific humidity Q) produces much drier (wetter) conditions than those projected by the raw global models for the target area. We demonstrate that this can be partially alleviated by substituting T+Q by relative humidity R, which simultaneously accounts for both water availability and temperature, and yields regional projections more compatible with the global one. Nevertheless, large local differences still persist, lacking a physical interpretation. In these situations, the use of simpler approaches such as empirical BA may lead to more plausible (i.e., more consistent with the global model) projections. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Bias adjustment; Climate change projections; Extrapolation; Humidity; Malawi; Statistical downscaling","Climate models; Electric power system interconnection; Rain gages; Climate change projections; Future projections; Historical periods; Physical interpretation; Sources of uncertainty; Spatial resolution; Statistical approach; Statistical downscaling; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate prediction; downscaling; regional climate; relative humidity; spatial resolution; tide gauge; water availability; Malawi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092188543

Olivine weathering is a natural process that sequesters carbon out of the atmosphere, but is now being proposed as a strategy that can be artificially implemented to assist in the mitigation of anthropogenic carbon emissions. We use the landscape evolution model Badlands to identify a region (Tweed Caldera catchment in Eastern Australia) that has the potential for naturally enhanced supply of mafic sediments, known to be a carbon sink, into coastal environments. Although reality is more complex than what can be captured within a model, our models have the ability to unravel and estimate how erosion of volcanic edifices and landscape dynamics will react to future climate change projections. Local climate projections were taken from the Australian government and the IPCC in the form of four alternative pathways. Three additional scenarios were designed, with added contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, to better understand how the landscape/dynamics might be impacted by an increase in sea level rise due to ice sheet tipping points being hit. Three scenarios were run with sea level held constant and precipitation rates increased in order to better understand the role that precipitation and sea level plays in the regional supply of sediment. Changes between scenarios are highly dependent upon the rate and magnitude of climatic change. We estimate the volume of mafic sediment supplied to the erosive environment within the floodplain (ranging from ∼27 to 30 million m3 by 2100 and ∼78–315 million m3 by 2500), the average amount of olivine within the supplied sediment under the most likely scenarios (∼7.6 million m3 by 2100 and ∼30 million m3 by 2500), and the amount of CO2 that is subsequently sequestered (∼53–73 million tons by 2100 and ∼206–284 million tons by 2500). Our approach not only identifies a region that can be further studied in order to evaluate the efficacy and impact of enhanced silicate weathering driven by climate change, but can also help identify other regions that have a natural ability to act as a carbon sink via mafic rock weathering. © Copyright © 2020 Manley, Salles and Müller.","carbon sequestration; climate change; enhanced silicate weathering; erosion and deposition; landscape evolution; modeling; olivine; sedimentation","Carbon; Catchments; Climate models; Coastal zones; Glaciers; Olivine; Sea level; Sediments; Silicates; Volcanoes; Weathering; Antarctic ice sheets; Anthropogenic carbon; Anthropogenic forcing; Coastal environments; Landscape dynamics; Landscape evolutions; Precipitation rates; Silicate weathering; Climate change; carbon sequestration; chemical weathering; climate change; future prospect; landscape evolution; olivine; silicate; volcaniclastic deposit; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093978831

In this study, a microbial consortium was enriched from activated sludge obtained from a common textile effluent treatment plant in the absence of organic carbon source to produce an electroactive biofilm. Chronoamperometry method of enrichment was carried out for over 70 days to select for electroactive bacteria that could be used as a cathode catalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFC). The resultant biofilm produced an average peak current of −0.7 mA during the enrichment and produced a maximum power density of 64.6 ± 3.5 mW m−2 compared to platinum (72.7 ± 1.2 mW m−2) in a Shewanella-based MFC. Microbial community analysis of the initial sludge sample and enriched samples, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealed the selection of chemolithotrophs with the most dominant phylum being Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria in the enriched samples. A variety of CO2 fixing and nitrate-reducing bacteria was present in the resultant biofilm on the cathode.

This work studies the effect of increased road capacity on traffic-related emissions in Bogotá using a tool that couples a transportation model with emission factors from COPERT IV. We followed a parametric approach varying transport supply and demand, comparing three scenarios: a baseline scenario that represents the transportation system in Bogota in 2015; scenario 1 incorporates five highway capacity-enhancement projects in Bogotá and assumes insensitive travel demand; scenario 2 incorporates the new highway projects but assumes a demand increase of 13% in vehicle trips with private cars. Results include daily and annual values of traffic-related emissions of five air pollutant criteria: CO, NOx, PM10, SO2, and VOC for the baseline scenario, scenario 1, and scenario 2. We found a reduction in emissions after adding highway capacity and assuming inelastic demand (scenario 1). Scenario 1 results in a 15% reduction in PM10 emissions and a 10% reduction in NOx emissions. In contrast, results for scenario 2 suggest increased emissions for all air pollutant criteria (e.g., VOC and CO emissions increase by 21% and 22% compared with the baseline scenario). Therefore, new traffic demand would eliminate the emission savings observed in scenario 1 and could potentially further degrade air quality in Bogotá. While an exact estimate of induced demand that may result from highway expansion in Bogotá is not available, this analysis highlights that such projects could lead to an increase in emissions unless there is a combined effort to managing demand of private vehicle trips. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bogotá; Highway expansion impacts; Highway plan; Traffic-related emission; Transport infrastructure","air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; public transport; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation policy; Bogota; Colombia; air pollutant; air pollution; Colombia; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Colombia; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082938678

This study explores the opportunities for supporting life cycle approaches in Azerbaijan and the driving forces that would enable their widespread application. Within this context, international treaties and conventions on sustainable development and climate change, transboundary partnership programs, particularly in energy sector, and projects run by multinational companies are examined as potential drivers of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle management (LCM) application in the country. Additionally, higher education institutions of Azerbaijan are reviewed in terms of their capacity for building life cycle thinking into curricula and establishing LCA collaboration network and incorporating life cycle concepts into national energy and infrastructure projects are evaluated as possible routes for promoting life cycle applications in the country. It is concluded that developing and including LCA and LCM subjects in environment-related programs in higher education that are currently focused on more traditional subjects such as ecological chemistry, environmental law and geographic ecology and establishment of a collaboration network will increase the capacity of local stakeholders who, in turn, may serve as partners in multilateral development projects that would not only contribute to the achievement of national sustainable development targets but also enable widespread application of life cycle approaches in Azerbaijan. © 2020","Azerbaijan; Circular economy; LCA; LCM; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle management; Sustainable development",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088010579

This study uses Rock-Eval® pyrolysis to examine how cultural practices impact the quantity of SOC and quality of SOM in cultivated sandy soils in the Senegal groundnut basin. This cost-effective method provides information on SOC thermal stability, which has been shown to be related qualitatively to biogeochemical stability of SOC. We sampled soils within two villages in agricultural plots representative of local agricultural systems, and in two local preserved areas (tree plantation and shrubby savanna). SOC concentrations ranged from 1.8–18.5 g.kg−1 soil in the surface layer (0−10 cm) and from 1.5–11.3 g.kg−1 soil in the 10−30 cm layer. SOC contents of cultivated soils decreased significantly (p-value &lt; 0.0001) according to field amendment, in the following order: addition of organic wastes&gt; addition of manure &gt; millet residues left after harvest &gt; no organic input. We found that the quantity and the quality of SOC are linked, and that both depend on land-use and agricultural practices, especially upon the type of organic inputs. Quantity of SOC and quality of SOM are correlated strongly in the tree plantation (R² = 0.98) and in the protected shrubby savanna (R² = 0.97). They are also correlated significantly in cultivated soils receiving organic wastes (R² = 0.82), manure (R² from 0.74 and 0.91), or millet residues (R2 = 0.91) but not in soils that receive no organic inputs. Indexes based upon Rock-Eval® pyrolysis were represented in an I/R diagram that illustrates the level of SOC stabilization. The indexes of the studied soils were plotted against comparable results from literature. Thermal signatures of the Senegalese Arenosols show an inversion of I and the R indexes compared to data from the literature. This result highlights SOC stabilization as a function of soil depth. Indeed, the refractory pool in the studied soils (where refractory pool ranged from 7.7–21.3 % in the 0−10 cm layer, and from 12.5–24.3 % in the 10−30 cm) was more abundant than in Ferralsols in natural conditions, where refractory pool ranged from 2 to 9%. The soil organic matter in these Arenosols while positively affected by organic inputs, is dominated by more or less labile forms that mineralize quickly: a quality that is excellent for productivity of these agrosystems, but not for mitigation of climate change in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agrosystems; Organic inputs; Rock-Eval® pyrolysis; Thermal analysis; West Africa","aerosol; agricultural application; agricultural soil; biogeochemistry; climate change; crop production; organic carbon; plantation; sandy soil; savanna; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil quality; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Senegal Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086876233

Agricultural practices have profound effects on soil properties, but how these influence crop VOCs remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of agricultural practices on constitutive and herbivore-induced VOC emissions by a major staple crop through soil legacy effects. Methods: In a full factorial experiment, we measured VOC emissions by wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in soil inoculum from wheat-fallow or wheat-cover crop rotations that was subjected to feeding by larval Cephus cinctus. Results (main findings): Under herbivory, plants grown in cover crop inoculum emitted greater total VOCs, including higher concentrations of 2-pentadecanone, an insect repellent, and nonanal, a compound important in the recruitment of natural enemies. Plants grown in fallow inoculum showed no differences in emissions whether under herbivory or not. Soil inoculum did not influence VOC emissions of plants in the absence of larval feeding. Conclusions: These results suggest that agricultural practices influence crop VOC emissions through soil legacy effects.

However, this forest remains under considerable high exploitation from the expansion of settlement and aquaculture pond that likely results in much CO2 release to the atmosphere. The objective of this research is to estimate biomass carbon stocks of mangrove rehabilitated areas in Sinjai District, South Sulawesi. We used a line transects method for mangrove vegetation survey and determined above-belowground biomass and carbon stock using published allometric equations and a conversion factor, respectively. The results showed that the mean values of carbon stocks in above-belowground biomass were 125.48±93.48 Mg C ha-1 and 60.23±44.87 Mg C ha-1. The aboveground biomass stored more carbon than the belowground pool. However, low planting distance in mangrove rehabilitation and conversion of mangrove area into settlements and aquaculture ponds in the last three decades have affected forest structure and biomass carbon magnitudes. Therefore, preservation of intact mangrove and restoration of disturbed forests with pay attention to planting distance should consider. Besides, halting the expansion of settlements and aquaculture ponds are worthwhile options to maintain and possibly increase biomass carbon stocks. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

Ethanol derived from biomass has the potential to be renewable transportation fuel that can replace gasoline. Moreover bioethanol can play an important role in reducing green-house gas emission. Ethanol use will increase because of its biodegradable, renewable and performance qualities. It is a high performance fuel in internal combustion engines and burns relatively cleanly, especially as the amount of gasoline with which it is blended decreases. The largest potential feedstock for ethanol includes materials such as agricultural residues, forest residues, wood, grass, waste paper and municipal wastes. In the present work, potatoes were used as example of starch-based biomass. Different variables were studied for their effect on the percent of bioethanol produced as a result to saccharification and fermentation of the raw material, which included: quantity of enzyme (α-amylase and/or Aspergillus Niger (AN), addition of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC)), temperature during fermentation, separate saccharification and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The maximum percent of alcohol was 56% (b.w.) at 40°C when 3g of α-amylase and 8g of yeast were added using SSF strategy.

However, high doses of such drugs are often associated with a series of pathologies related to unbalanced redox homeostasis, which, in turn, can be linked to inflammation. The oxidative stress onset could deregulate the secretion of cytokines, evidencing a dysfunctional adipocyte. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of supraphysiological doses of Nandrolone Decanoate on redox homeostasis of retroperitoneal fatpad of male rats and its relationship with cytokines-based inflammatory signaling. Hydrogen peroxide production was assessed in the retroperitoneal fat pad of adult male rats which received either 10 mg kg of Nandrolone Decanoate or only a vehicle. Also, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured, together with total reduced thiols and protein carbonylation, as well as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 local levels. High doses of Nandrolone Decanoate caused an increase in the hydrogen peroxide production, together with lower activities of the antioxidant enzymes and lower levels of total reduced thiol. There were also higher protein carbonylation and greater levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the treated group compared to control group. Therefore, it was possible to verify that high doses of Nandrolone Decanoate cause oxidative stress and induce higher inflammatory signaling in retroperitoneal fat pad of male rats. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adipose tissue; Anabolic androgenic steroids; Antioxidant; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species","catalase; cytochrome c; glutathione disulfide; glutathione peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; nandrolone decanoate; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; superoxide dismutase; testosterone; tumor necrosis factor; anabolic agent; cytokine; nandrolone decanoate; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; body weight; controlled study; enzyme activity; glucose tolerance; glucose tolerance test; inflammation; male; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein carbonylation; rat; retroperitoneal fat; testosterone blood level; animal; drug effect; inflammation; intra-abdominal fat; metabolism; oxidative stress; Wistar rat; Anabolic Agents; Animals; Cytokines; Inflammation; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Nandrolone Decanoate; Oxidative Stress; Protein Carbonylation; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088984142

The national highway agencies in partnership with universities and research centers have been working to change this scenario through the development of a mechanistic-empirical method that is more compatible with the Brazilian geographic and technical-scientific realities. The first outcome of this task force is the computer program MeDiNa, which is still under assessment. In this present study, the new flexible pavement software in Brazil (MeDiNa) was used by the Federal University of Juiz de Fora to calculate the overlay asphalt of its the ring road, aiming to recover its functional proprieties. This pavement was evaluated functionally by Computerized Continuous Visual Survey (CCVS) and tests of longitudinal cracks, and structurally by survey deflection measurements (FWD) and shaft sinking. With the data collected from the structural evaluation, the homogeneous segmentation of the stretch and the back-calculation of the data was carried out, aimed at the acquisition of needed parameters for the calculation. After the appropriate design, it was concluded that the best solution for the overlay is resurfacing along its entire length, with the use of the project’s asphalt mixture with single thickness of 5.0 cm, observing the application of the anti-reflective cracking layer in some stretches. © 2020, Escola de Minas.

During the last few years, in the Republic of Croatia there is a strong tailwind towards promoting activities of geothermal energy exploration and exploitation. As geothermal sector was often neglected in a favour of petroleum business in the past, there is still a somewhat knowledge gap in groundwork related to defining geothermal resources potential. Since initial investigation related to defining hot spots in geothermal gradient were conducted more than 40 years ago, there was a need to remodel older imprecise maps with a completely new groundwork research in this area. More than 150 deep oil&gas exploration wells scattered in the Croatian part of the Pannonian Basin were elaborated. From the historical well development records and temperature measurements, obtained with different methods, a novel geothermal gradient map was constructed.

We used an ecosystem services assessment toolkit, TESSA, at two locations in the UK; Hesketh Outmarsh West (northwest England), where realignment has already been carried out, and the Inner Firth of Forth (central Scotland), where realignment is proposed for multiple sites. At the Inner Forth we focus on one site, Inch of Ferryton, in Clackmannanshire but also assess ecosystem services across several sites. Using dedicated data collection where possible, and site-appropriate existing data, we estimate the value of these sites to people in the realigned state compared with the most realistic alternative: continued agricultural production behind hard flood defences (agricultural state). Services assessed were climate change mitigation, agricultural production, nature-based recreation, and flood risk protection. At both sites agricultural production was estimated to be greater in the agricultural state, while other services were estimated to be greater in the realigned state. We are cautious about assigning overall monetary values based on biophysical attributes, particularly considering that climate change mitigation is highly sensitive to carbon prices, and that by necessity we were unable to quantify all services. Nevertheless, using a price for carbon that incorporates the societal cost of emissions, we estimate that the net annual provision of services is £262,935 (£1460.75/ha) at Hesketh Outmarsh West and £93,216 (£574.70/ha) at Inch of Ferryton. At both sites, sequestered carbon in accreting sediments outweighs greenhouse gas emissions from intertidal habitats, and the net value of this in turn outweighs the income foregone from crops and grazing. At Hesketh Outmarsh West the value of ecosystem services is increased by the reduction to flood risk arising from the coastal managed realignment action. Nature-based recreation is estimated to increase at both sites under realignment, with the visitor profile expected to be strongly local. Decisions about coastal management, including realignment, should incorporate information about the ecosystem services provided under different scenarios. This applies beyond coastal ecosystems, and the site-scale is often the most appropriate scale to carry out such assessments, as this is the scale at which decisions are often taken. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural production; Benefits transfer; Climate regulation; Recreation; Restoration; Sediment accretion","agricultural production; climate change; ecosystem service; flood frequency; greenhouse gas; managed realignment; nature conservation; Clackmannanshire; Firth of Forth; Scotland; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029580477

While the overall effect of climate change on agriculture is uncertain, farmers’ perceptions of current and future climate and weather conditions will be a key factor in how they adapt. This paper analyzes data from paired surveys (N = 817) and natural variation from baseline weather across the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW), to determine if long-term, gradual changes in precipitation, and temperature distributions affect farmers’ weather perceptions and intentions to adapt. We note that some areas in the iPNW have experienced significant changes in weather, while others have remained relatively constant. However, we find no relationship between changes in temperature and precipitation distributions and individuals’ perceptions and intentions to adapt. Our findings provide evidence that gradual, long-term changes in weather are temporally incongruous with human perception, which can impede support for climate action policy and adaptation strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agricultural adaptation; Climate change; Experience; Perceptions; Weather; Wheat","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Adaptation strategies; Heterogeneous effects; Human perception; Long term change; Natural variation; Pacific Northwest; Precipitation distribution; Precipitation regimes; Climate change; action plan; adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; environmental policy; farmers knowledge; perception; precipitation (climatology); strategic approach; Pacific Northwest; United States; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083959496

Despite this, long-term carbon (C) accumulation in different components of agroforestry systems, the drivers for C accumulation and the linkages between tree biomass and soil C stocks remain unclear. Location: Global. Time period: From 1989 to 2019. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Here, we report on a global meta-analysis based on 141 studies to identify patterns of C accumulation in tree-based agroforestry systems compared with sole cropland and pasture. Results: We found that agroforestry systems had, on average, 46.1 Mg/ha (95% confidence interval, 36.4–55.8 Mg/ha) more C in tree biomass compared with sole cropland- or pasture-based land uses without trees. Furthermore, agroforestry systems with multiple tree species contained greater biomass C stocks and accumulated biomass C faster than systems with a single tree species. The effect of agroforestry practices on soil C stock increased with tree age, although such increases varied among climatic zones. Agroforestry systems in tropical zones had the ability to increase soil C to peak levels quickly, whereas soil C in temperate zones increased at a slower rate but peaked at a greater overall soil C level. Our structural equation model did not detect a direct linkage between biomass C and changes in total soil C stock in agroforestry systems. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that planting multiple tree species in agroforestry systems is an important strategy to increase biomass C sequestration, with regional climate affecting the temporal change of soil C in response to agroforestry practices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agroforestry; forest age; land-use type; mixture; monoculture; phytomass carbon; soil organic carbon; tree species diversity","accumulation; age; agroforestry; carbon; carbon sequestration; land use; meta-analysis; model test; organic carbon; regional climate; soil carbon; soil organic matter; species diversity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087289665

We estimated that the ERMs decreased the anthropogenic pollutant emissions, with the exception of NH3, by 8–48% during this event. Inputting these reduced emission estimates, our simulations reproduced the observed PM2.5 concentrations and compositions. Stagnant regional meteorological conditions increased the lifetime of the PM2.5 in the NCP boundary layer from 1 day during the clean period to 5 days during the haze episode. Additionally, local emissions accounted for approximately only 20% of the surface PM2.5 in Beijing but more than 62% over the rest of the NCP. We found that the ERMs achieved a modest reduction in the mean surface PM2.5 concentrations during the event, decreasing them by 7% and 4% in Beijing and across the rest of the NCP, respectively. The limited effect was due to the duration of the ERMs being much shorter than the lifetime of the PM2.5, which prevented the concentrations of the latter from fully reflecting the reduction in emissions. We conclude that anthropogenic emissions on the NCP during severe winter haze episodes must be reduced by a much larger percentage to substantially abate the PM2.5 concentrations. © The Author(s).","Emission reduction; Northern China; PM2.5; Severe haze; WRF-Chem","Ammonia; Boundary layers; Emergency services; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic pollutants; Emergency response measures; Haze pollutions; Local emissions; Meteorological condition; North China Plain; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution control; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; climate conditions; concentration (composition); emission control; haze; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087327001

Many studies have shown a correlation among income, the income gap, and carbon emissions, but the influence mechanism remains unclear of income and the income gap on carbon emissions. Using the input-output method, we introduce residents’ consumption tendency to construct a mathematical model to discuss the mechanism of the influence of income and the income gap on indirect carbon emissions from household consumption (ICEH). Data at the national and provincial levels are used to conduct empirical research based on the model. Our model indicates four scenarios in which income and the income gap affect ICEH through residents’ consumption tendency. When richer urban residents have a greater consumption tendency, a decrease in the income gap would reduce carbon emissions. The empirical results show that a decrease in the income gap is correlated with an increase in ICEH in China from 2002 to 2012. Therefore, the win-win situation of “increased income and narrowed income gap-reduced carbon emissions” is hard to achieve in China. Policymakers must urgently explore other ways to reduce carbon emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Income; Indirect carbon emissions from household consumption; Residents’ consumption tendency; Urban-rural income gap","carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental impact; income; input-output analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; human; income; socioeconomics; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Humans; Income; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086665449

However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

While researchers worldwide have spent much effort on quantitatively evaluating organic carbon at the regional scale, few studies have examined organic carbon pools at different levels, or their driving factors. To better facilitate a deeper understanding of carbon pool mechanisms, comprehensive understanding and comparative analysis among carbon pools is necessary. In this study, the Xilingol Typical Steppe Region of Inner Mongolia was used as a case study to quantitatively model vegetation, litter, soil, and ecosystem carbon pools for the 2011–2018 period. The improved Terrestrial Ecosystem Regional (TECO-R) model was used to perform carbon stock simulations, which was modified and calibrated for local application. The organic carbon pools at different levels were compared and analyzed in terms of their spatial distribution, inter-annual variation, and climate-driving factors. The results showed that the modified TECO-R model accurately simulated carbon storage on the whole. From 2011 to 2018 year, the various organic carbon pools increased overall and were characterized by different degrees of clustering in their spatial distribution, inter-annual variation, and climate-driving factors. Clear formation mechanisms were observed in the soil, litter, and root carbon pools. As the soil depth increased, the carbon stock of the root carbon pool and the soil carbon pool decreased. Climate factors exerted different degrees of constraints on each carbon pool. These findings promote understanding of the compositional differences in grassland carbon pools and the driving mechanism for these carbon pools, which, taken together, can help shape the policy for carbon sink management in grasslands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon stock; Climate driving factors; Constraint lines; TECO-R model; Typical steppe region","Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Lakes; Soils; Spatial distribution; Carbon pool mechanism; Comparative analysis; Compositional difference; Grassland ecosystems; Interannual variation; Organic carbon pools; Regional climate changes; Terrestrial ecosystems; Organic carbon; annual variation; carbon sink; carbon storage; climate change; environmental factor; grassland; model; organic carbon; regional climate; soil carbon; soil depth; spatial distribution; steppe; China; Nei Monggol; Xilingol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085173897

Two forms of this metalloenzyme, the vanadium (V)-and iron (Fe)-only nitrogenases, were recently found to reduce small amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Here, we report carbon (13C/12C) and hydrogen (2H/1H) stable isotopic compositions and fractionations of methane generated by Vand Fe-only nitrogenases in the metabolically versatile nitrogen fixer Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The stable carbon isotope fractionation imparted by both forms of alternative nitrogenase are within the range observed for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (13αCO2/CH4 = 1.051±0.002 for V-nitrogenase and 1.055±0.001 for Feonly nitrogenase; values are means ± standard errors). In contrast, the hydrogen isotope fractionations (2αH2O/CH4 = 2.071±0.014 for V-nitrogenase and 2.078±0.018 for Fe-only nitrogenase) are the largest of any known biogenic or geogenic pathway. The large 2αH2O/CH4 shows that the reaction pathway nitrogenases use to form methane strongly discriminates against 2H, and that 2αH2O/CH4 distinguishes nitrogenase-derived methane from all other known biotic and abiotic sources. These findings on nitrogenase-derived methane will help constrain carbon and nitrogen flows in microbial communities and the role of the alternative nitrogenases in global biogeochemical cycles. IMPORTANCE All forms of life require nitrogen for growth. Many different kinds of microbes living in diverse environments make inert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere bioavailable using a special enzyme, nitrogenase. Nitrogenase has a wide substrate range, and, in addition to producing bioavailable nitrogen, some forms of nitrogenase also produce small amounts of the greenhouse gas methane. This is different from other microbes that produce methane to generate energy. Until now, there was no good way to determine when microbes with nitrogenases are making methane in nature. Here, we present an isotopic fingerprint that allows scientists to distinguish methane from microbes making it for energy versus those making it as a by-product of nitrogen acquisition. With this new fingerprint, it will be possible to improve our understanding of the relationship between methane production and nitrogen acquisition in nature. © 2020 Luxem et al.","Methane; Nitrogenase; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; Stable isotopes","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Enzymes; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Methane; Vanadium compounds; Biogeochemical cycle; Biological nitrogen fixations; Carbon and nitrogen; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Microbial communities; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; Stable carbon isotope fractionations; Stable isotopic compositions; Nitrogen fixation; carbon dioxide; enzyme; enzyme activity; greenhouse gas; hydrogen isotope; isotopic fractionation; methane; methanogenesis; microorganism; nitrogen fixation; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; bacterial protein; carbon; Carbon-13; deuterium; methane; nitrogenase; chemistry; fractionation; metabolism; Rhodopseudomonas; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon Isotopes; Chemical Fractionation; Deuterium; Methane; Nitrogenase; Rhodopseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091263976

However, how and what magnitude of plant and soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stocks and stoichiometry are affected by forest conversion is still vague. Here, we addressed this issue by systematically measuring tree biomass and the C, N, and P concentrations in tree organs and soils (0–100 cm) collected from 300 plots in Fujian province. With forest conversion of BF to PF, the tree C, N, and P stocks declined by 43.8, 47.9, and 63.1%, respectively, and the soil C and N stocks across whole soil depth decreased by 19.1% and 13.0%, respectively, and these decreases were more evident after conversion of BF to PF than SF. However, soil P stock showed a tendency of decreasing at 0–20 cm soil depth but increasing at 20–100 cm soil depth following conversion of BF to SF and PF. This unconformity of the vertical pattern of P stock in contrast to C and N stocks, was perhaps due to higher C and N inputs and greater P uptake from the subsoil and its redistribution to the topsoil in BF than in SF and PF. The tree and soil C, N, and P stoichiometry was strongly related to tree biomass, indicating that tree biomass was a vital factor driving soil inputs and retention of nutrients, and thus affecting their stoichiometry. The leaf N:P ratios ranging from 16.7 to 17.2 at our study sites suggested that co-limitations of N and P for forest growth could occur in the studied region. Our results provided insights into the C, N, and P linkages between soils and trees as affected by forest conversion, and advised that predicting these linkages could be an effective approach to identify the impacts of forest conversion, thereby implementing targeted conservation and rehabilitation actions. © 2020","C, N, and P stocks; Dynamics; Forest conversion; Stoichiometry; Tree–soil system","biomass; broad-leaved forest; concentration (composition); forest soil; phosphorus cycle; plantation forestry; secondary forest; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; stoichiometry; subtropical region; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083328570

By critically exploring the frames around climate services, the wider objective is to encourage more reflexive and responsible research in the field, particularly given the huge challenge that climate change represents. By using a framing analysis based on an extensive literature review, five dominant frames were identified. Climate services are mainly framed (1) as a technological innovation, (2) as a market, (3) as an interface between users and producers, (4) as a risk management tool, and (5) from an ethical angle. The predominant frames influence how we think about climate services, shared assumptions, and the way in which policies and projects are designed. To prevent negative effects of climate services on the ground, such as inequalities, the main recommendations include establishing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogues between different communities of practice and players, increasing empirical and social science research to improve our understanding of this new field, and finally, re-thinking climate services in terms of adaptation rather than as the mere production of new information products. © 2020 by the author.

CO2RR on the MoS2 supported single cobalt atom (Co/MoS2) monolayer is performed by using the first-principles simulation, and it is found that cobalt atom prefers to dispersedly anchor on MoS2 support as single atom. According to the transition state calculation for the various possible reaction pathways together with the reaction rate constants calculation, the preferable CO2RR pathway is the reverse water gas conversion (RWGS) and CO hydrogenation pathway with the rate-limiting step of CO hydrogenation into formyl (HCO). The entire reaction pathway can be summarized as *CO2 → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *CH2OH and *CH3O → CH3OH. The electronic structures analysis indicates that Co adatom induced gap states play an important role for CO2 activation and reduction. Therefore, the single cobalt atom supported on MoS2 monolayer is an efficient single atom catalyst for CO2 activation and conversion, and the current work may shed light on the development of single atom catalysts to CO2 reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CH3OH; Co/MoS2; CO2 reduction reaction; First-principles simulation","Activation analysis; Atoms; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical activation; Electronic structure; Hydrogenation; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Rate constants; CO hydrogenation; CO2 activation; First-principles simulations; Induced gap state; Rate-limiting steps; Reaction pathways; Thermoreduction; Transition state; Cobalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087280281

Methods: We obtained data of 111,842 hospital outpatient visits for mental disorders from the largest hospitals of 13 cities, China, between January 01, 2013 and December 31, 2015. We collected air pollutant data including particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter ≤10 µm in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from China National Environmental Monitoring Centre during the same period. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models to determine the associations. Results: A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 was associated with a significant increase in hospital outpatient visits for mental disorders on the current day. When stratified by age, sex and season, the effects of PM2.5 and NO2 were robust among different subgroups at lag05 days. PM10 showed positive associations in males, in cold season, and in depression patients. SO2 showed positive associations in males, in cold season, and in anxiety patients. O3 showed positive associations in females, in warm season, and in depression patients. Nearly one sixth hospital outpatient visits for mental disorders can be attributable to NO2. Conclusions: Short-term increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and O3 concentrations was significantly associated with exacerbation of mental disorders in China as indicated by increases in hospital outpatient visits. NO2 had more serious health threat than other pollutants in terms of mental disorders. Our findings strongly suggest a need for more strict emission control regulations to protect mental health from air pollution. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollution; China; Hospital outpatient visits; Mental health","Emission control; Health risks; Hospitals; Logistic regression; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur dioxide; Attributable risks; Case-crossover designs; Conditional logistic regressions; Emission control regulations; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen dioxides; Outdoor air pollution; Particulate Matter; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; health risk; hospital sector; mental disorder; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; risk assessment; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; anxiety disorder; Article; causal attribution; child; China; concentration (parameter); depression; disease association; disease exacerbation; environmental impact assessment; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; mental health; newborn; outpatient; particulate matter; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk assessment; seasonal variation; winter; adverse event; air pollutant; city; hospital; mental disease; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Nitrogen Dioxide; Outpatients; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087218035

However, the high overpotential, inadequate selectivity, and high cost demand for alternative solutions. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid microbial photoelectrochemical (MPEC) system that contains a microbial anode capable of oxidizing waste organics in wastewater and reducing the oxidation potential by 1.1 V compared with abiotic water oxidation using a PEC anode. Moreover, the MPEC employs a power management circuit (PMC) to enable parallel low-energy-producing reactions operated in the same solution medium to conquer high-overpotential reactions. The nanowire silicon photocathode integrated with a selective single-atom nickel catalyst (Si NW/Ni SA) achieved up to ∼80% faradic efficiency for CO generation with a highly tunable CO:H2 generation ratio (0.1 to 6.8).

This study reported a microbial photoelectrochemical (MPEC) system consisting of electroactive microbial bioanodes and a Si-nanowire photocathode coated with Ni single-atom catalysts. The photocathode and bioanodes converted solar energy and chemical energy of waste organics in wastewater, respectively, into electrical energy, which enabled uphill reactions to overcome the thermodynamic barriers in CO2 reduction to generate syngas with tunable CO:H2 ratios via a power management circuit (PMC).

However, investments can be hindered by barriers, and drivers are necessary to reduce or overcome them and promote investment. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to analyze what factors influence investment decisions—and how they do so—when there are principal-agent problems in the shipowner–charterer relationship. The methodology is based on the following process: model and hypotheses formulation, variable definition, the creation of a study sample and statistical treatment through a descriptive analysis of variables and a binomial logistic regression model, all based on a state-of-the-art application. The results corroborate the hypotheses and indicate that principal-agent problems and split incentives, especially in time charter contracts, and a lack of verified information make the shipowners less likely to invest. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are less likely to be implemented in older vessels, possibly due to the difficulty associated with recovering the investment; they are more likely in larger and newer vessels, and regulation encourage their adoption.

Among different residents’ behaviors, using private car is an essential source of household carbon emission. Therefore, deepening the understanding about its variation and determinants is of great importance for decarbonizing individual behaviors. Taking Japan as example, this study firstly evaluates the emissions generated by household private car from 1990 to 2016. Then, by using econometric model, cluster and spatial autocorrelation analysis, both spatiotemporal trend and emissions determinants are given out. Results indicate that although the private car emissions across the whole extent of Japan is declining, depopulation still contributes to increasing emissions in some prefectures. Last, given the future depopulation trend, target-specific decarbonization policy is suggested to take demographic features as the first consideration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Household emissions; Panel data; Private car; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatiotemporal trend","Carbon; Decarbonization; Greenhouse gases; Car emissions; Carbon emissions; Demographic features; Econometric model; Individual behavior; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal trends; Gas emissions; car use; carbon emission; econometrics; emission inventory; environmental economics; future prospect; greenhouse gas; policy approach; spatial variation; targeting; temporal variation; traffic emission; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089436985

This paper aims to investigate endogenous green innovation efficiency and its convergence across China’s 30 provinces from 2004 to 2014. Due to factor endowment heterogeneity, it is important to explore the convergence of green innovation efficiency among China’s different regions, which can compare green innovation efficiency spatially and propose scientific policy implications for regions with relatively weaker green innovation efficiency. Green innovation efficiency is evaluated through epsilon-based measure (EBM) global Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) in order to overcome the demerits of radial model and slacks-based measure (SBM). Panel unit root test is implemented to explore the convergence of green innovation efficiency across different provinces of China, which addresses the invalid inference of conventional β convergence. The empirical analysis revealed that green innovation efficiency in the east is the highest among four regions of China. Unit root test of panel data revealed that the northeast had the highest convergence among China’s four regions.

The risk of mine explosions can increase if the EGZs migrate out from the gob into the surrounding mine entries. Fluctuating barometric pressure is the common cause for EGZs outflowing or outgassing from the gob. Numerical analysis using a 3D computational fluid dynamics method was developed to fully understand the outgassing phenomenon. A number of simulations using various magnitudes and periods of barometric pressure changes indicated that the EGZ outgassing potentially occurs due to lags in pressure, which are strongly influenced by mine conditions and ventilation systems. An early warning system with a real-time pressure monitoring and the application of gob ventilation boreholes are recommended to detect and mitigate explosion hazards from gob outgassing. © 2020, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.","Barometric pressure variation; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Explosive gas zone (EGZ); Gob outgassing; Methane gas","Atmospheric pressure; Barometers; Coal industry; Computational fluid dynamics; Explosives; Methane; Mine explosions; Numerical methods; Ventilation; Air mixtures; Barometric pressure; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Early Warning System; Explosion hazards; Longwalls; Real time; Ventilation systems; Coal mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089782919

To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50–100 years); these short-term rates are on average (± SD) 155 ± 74 g C m−2 yr−1 in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 ± 38 g C m−2 yr−1 yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future. © 2020, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Carbon sequestration; Dating methods; Holocene; Paleoecology; Wetland; Wetland restoration","carbon sequestration; carbon sink; freshwater environment; long-term change; marsh; peatland; soil carbon; soil property; temperate environment; timescale; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078503727

Much of this research focuses on the role that the IPCC has had in shaping policy outcomes, or how its limitations have potential impacts in uptake and political acceptability of its knowledge claims. Less has been said on its role as an organizer of scientific research. This paper takes the IPCC 1.5 degree Special Report (SR15), requested by the UNFCCC in conjunction with the Paris Agreement in 2015, as a case of how the politics of climate change framed specific work of the IPCC. We argue that this led to 1.5 becoming a boundary object shared by the policy and scientific communities. The paper draws on interviews with SR15 authors, alongside document analysis to trace the origins of the report, and explores what role science had in the transformation of 1.5 degrees from an unrealistic political target to a symbol of climate action. We highlight how 1.5 degrees’ substantive scientific meaning has arisen through political negotiation, demonstrating the complexities of the relationship between science and policy, and the role of the IPCC in these processes.

Yet, its urbanisation will be unprecedented in terms of climate vulnerabilities. Little is known about urbanisation and migrants, in the context of these vulnerabilities, in part because demographic inquiry and training (with a few notable exceptions) has only begun in the last decade to embrace new, spatial data and methods of analysis—especially those involving earth-observing satellites. This descriptive analysis examines urban change along with low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ) data as a proxy for flood exposure, using data from satellites, and integrates those features with socioeconomic characteristics and migration information from demographic and health survey data (DHS 2000–2014). We describe where urban change has occurred in the past 40 years, with a focus on understanding change occurring in LECZ areas. We then describe vulnerabilities of the households and migrants in areas of urban change from about 2004 onward, both in terms of their potential exposure to flooding and socioeconomic characteristics. We find that moderate-risk, 7-10m LECZ areas are not only more built-up than higher elevation areas, but they have also had appreciably more urban development as measured by built-up change than other areas. Although we found that poor urban households are more likely to be located in flood-prone areas, poor households were also less likely to be in areas that are built-up. The 0-6m LECZ has lower proportions of urban in-migrants, but among those migrants to cities, the flood-prone LECZ is more likely to be the destination of poor migrants. This paper suggests that climate adaptation plans should be spatially specific because poor migrants are more likely to be located in LECZ areas that are more prone to flooding. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL); low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ); migrants; urbanisation; vulnerability","coastal zone management; demographic survey; flooding; health survey; human settlement; population dynamics; urbanization; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084158155

However, the selectivity control, energy saving, and emission reduction remain great challenges for C1 chemistry due to the complex and changeable conversion processes. Herein, we briefly summarize recent advances and milestones in conversion of C1 molecules in the last decade, particularly focusing on the new reaction processes, including thermal-driven reactions, such as direct methane to ethylene, CO2 hydrogenation, and oxide-zeolite process for syngas conversion, and mild-condition conversion processes, such as room-temperature methane conversion, electrochemical water-gas shift, electrocatalytic CO reduction to ethylene, and light-driven methanol to ethylene glycol. The challenges and prospects are also fully discussed toward the C1 chemistry for the basic and applied research in the future. Challenges and opportunities: • Controlling the selectivity of products and reducing energy cost and carbon emission are great challenges for C1 chemistry • Synthesizing highly effective catalysts and exploring novel catalytic processes open paths for the conversion of C1 molecules under mild reaction conditions • Developing in situ and operando characterization techniques for the effective identification of the structural evolution of catalysts as well as the deep understanding of the catalytic active centers provides a framework for the synthesis of catalysts C1 chemistry is one of the most widely studied topics in the field of chemistry. However, the relatively inert or active nature of C1 molecules renders it a formidable challenge to develop a unified principle for the conversion of C1 molecules due to the limitation in balancing the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this perspective, the current status and challenges in this research area are discussed with an emphasis on the development of novel reaction processes and the future directions of the C1 chemistry. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","C1 chemistry; efficient catalyst; heterogeneous catalysis; mild condition; reaction process; SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092017427

In this study, road dust samples were collected from different directions centered around a coal-fired power plant in Huainan. Black carbon (BC), soot, char, organic carbon (OC) and total carbon (TC), as well as the δ13C of samples, were determined. Compared to the reference locations which were distant from the power plant, the research areas surrounding the power plant were featured by significantly higher OC/BC ratio and TC concentration. The OC/BC showed significant difference in urban vs. rural areas, and at different distances from the central power plant, which implied that the source and spread of carbonaceous species was dominantly affected by wind direction and urban/rural area differences. Surface morphology analysis showed that the road dust was mixed with spherical particles similar to fly ash. High-resolution XPS C1s spectrum revealed the existence of metal carbide, metal carbonate, and CF3 in the road dust samples. The speciation of carbon in road dusts was found correlated with sampling directions and urban functional areas.

In this study, a novel but simple strategy to endow carbon cloth and polyurethane (PU) foam with amphibious superamphiphilicity (i.e., superamphiphilicity simultaneously in air and in a pre-wetted state) has been demonstrated. Results showed that the surface wettability of the carbon cloth changed from hydrophobic to superamphiphilic by increasing the acidification time using HNO3, which manifested the contact angle of 0° for water and oils irrespective of the state (at dry state or pre-wetted with water or oil) under which the surface was put. Subsequently, the superamphiphilic PU foam was fabricated based on a simple acidification method, and possessed an excellent superamphiphilicity with water and oil fluids taking less than 19 seconds to spread completely on the surface when the PU foam was in a dry state or pre-wetted with water or oil. Moreover, the PU foam exhibited a high storage capacity for water and oil, up to 9-12 times of its own weight.

Due to its rich nutrition, foxtail millet has also been widely used as Traditional Chinese Medicine in dietary therapy. The spatial distribution of foxtail millet production plays an important role in domestic cropping pattern. Cropping pattern needs to be continually adjusted in order to combat ongoing climate change in China. Such adjustments could greatly affect national foxtail millet production. Under future climate scenarios, adopting climate-smart management has become the general trend to achieve a high and stable foxtail millet production. In this case study, we used DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) to assess the potential impacts of future climate change on foxtail millet production in Lishu county of Jilin province in Northeast China. According to these potential impacts, we proposed corresponding measures to adapt local foxtail millet production to future climate change. As compared to the base period (1988–2018), foxtail millet grain yield in Lishu county would change by 15.3% (-8.9%) during the 2020s, -8.8% (-10.5%) during the 2030s, -17.7% (0.4%) during the 2040s, and -25.0% (-18.3%) during the 2050s under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5). Under future climate scenarios, climate-smart management (e.g., adjusting sowing date, supplementing irrigation) could partially offset the adverse impact of climate change on foxtail millet yield. However, adopting climate-smart management alone may only provide temporary relief to the potential stresses local foxtail millet production could be facing. In order to achieve a high and stable foxtail millet yield in the future, we suggest local producers adopt new varieties in addition to using climate-smart management. © 2020","Climate-smart management; DSSAT; Foxtail millet; Future climate change impact assessment","agricultural management; climate change; crop production; cropping practice; cultivar; millet; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Jilin; Setaria italica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089419046

Short-term record-based flood frequency analyses lead to very great aleatory uncertainties about infrequent extreme flood events and their climate-driven causal associations. This study uses paleoflood hydrology to examine a small portion of the underutilized, but very extensive natural record of Holocene extreme floods in the UCRB. We perform a meta-analysis of 82 extreme paleofloods from 18 slack water deposit sites in the UCRB to show linkages between Holocene climate patterns and extreme floods. The analysis demonstrates several clusters of extreme flood activity: 8040–7960, 4400–4300, 3600–3460, 2900–2740, 2390–1980, 1810–720, and 600–0 years BP. The extreme paleofloods were found to occur during both dry and wet periods in the paleoclimate record. When compared with independent paleoclimatic records across the Rocky Mountains and the southwestern USA, the observed temporal clustering pattern of UCRB extreme paleofloods shows associations with periods of abruptly intensified North Pacific-derived storms connected with enhanced variability of El Niño. This approach demonstrates the value of creating paleohydrological databases and comparing them with hydro-climatic proxies in order to identify natural patterns and to discover possible linkages to fundamental processes such as changes in climate. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change; extreme floods; Holocene; meta-analysis; Paleofloods; Upper Colorado River Basin","climate variation; extreme event; Holocene; hydrology; meta-analysis; paleoclimate; paleoflood; proxy climate record; Colorado Basin [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079180798

Although numerous academic journals have published papers on household CO2 emissions (HCEs), great challenges remain in research on assessments, determinants, and further research prospects. This work reviews and projects HCEs using a bibliometric analysis and a systematic review based on the data from the Web of Science (WOS) platform from 1991 to 2020. Over the last 30 years, there has been a rapid and active trend of research on HCEs. We find that (1) the scale of the bibliometric analysis shows that research on HCEs is interdisciplinary and must consider overall cognition of the environment, the economy, society, and technology. It also needs to strengthen cooperation between different countries/territories to emphasize the quality and influence of papers on HCEs. (2) A review of previous literature shows that research on HCEs mainly focuses on the research object, mainstream assessments, and influencing factors. The following six main aspects impact HCEs: demographic, income, social, technological, policy, and natural factors. (3) The research discussion suggests that more micro-level research needs to be conducted, such as research on the city level and the individual level, which is important for sustainable development and low consumption. A comparative analysis of the differences in HCEs is a future research direction. Additionally, localized carbon emission reduction measures need to be implemented. © 2020 by the authors.

However, how transpiration, as major water loss pathway in closed peatland, responds to climate change and then regulates ecosystem water balance that remains poorly understood. Here, we reported an 18,000-year fossil phytolith record from an herbaceous community-dominated mountain peatland in central China to reconstruct climate changes and vegetation evolution and reveal the interactions between regional climate changes and peatland ecosystem. The abundance of bulliform phytoliths—a silicified type of cells that regulate the movements of plant leaves to reduce light exposure and transpiration rate—shows close correlations with the Holocene climate variations with higher bulliform abundance in response to warm-dry climate (11,500–9600 cal yr BP; 7500–3000 cal yr BP) and lower values associated with cold-wet climate (13,000–11,500 cal yr BP; 3000 cal yr BP-present). Spectral analysis reveals that bulliform abundance and reconstructed climate vary with a major ~1000-year periodicity during the Holocene, suggesting a possible causal relationship to solar activity. A high bulliform abundance and warm-dry climate correspond with enhanced solar activity, and vice versa. We interpret that the resultant leaf water deficit resulted from greater light interception, high temperature and drought promoted the production of bulliform cells to fold leaf for water conservation, which is an effective protective mechanism of peatland grasses from the environmental stress. These results expand our understanding of how grass-dominated peatland plant water regulation recorded by bulliform phytoliths responds to solar radiation and local hydroclimate during geological period. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","1000-year periodicity; Holocene peat, central China; Phytolith; Solar activity; Water regulation","Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Solar energy; Solar radiation; Spectrum analysis; Transpiration; Water conservation; Wetlands; Causal relationships; Environmental stress; Light interception; Peatland ecosystems; Regional climate changes; Transpiration rates; Vegetation evolution; Warm dry climates; Climate change; climate change; fossil record; herb; Holocene; hydrological response; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; peatland; phytolith; reconstruction; solar cycle; water budget; China; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086568343

With a difference-in-difference (DID) approach, this study provides empirical evidence to support the policy’s implementation by analysing its impacts on green total factor productivity (GTFP). We find that the implementation of the low-carbon pilot policy has a significant positive impact on GTFP. The low-carbon pilot policy significantly improves the GTFP in the year following implementation, and its efficacy diminishes over time. In terms of mechanism analysis, the policy enables China to achieve win-win development through industry structure adjustment and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. Innovation does not immediately improve GTFP, although the low-carbon pilot policy promotes regional innovation. Our results provide strong support for China’s recent third set of low-carbon pilot policies. As for global mitigation strategy, countries should incorporate the low-carbon development path into their strategic planning. In particular, developing countries should enforce more efforts on low-carbon development as such development path may improve their green productivity.

Increased crop diversity can change soil nitrogen (N), physicochemical properties and alter belowground microbial communities, leading to changes in potential N2O emissions when inorganic N fertilizer is applied. Nitrification and denitrification are two main N cycling pathways under investigation due to their contribution to soil N cycling and production of N2O. The goal of this study was to understand the impacts of 35 years of crop diversification in shaping diversity and the community size and activity of nitrifier and denitrifier bacteria and N2O emissions after N fertilization in corn. In 2017, after fertilizer addition, N2O emissions were continuously measured using automatic chambers from a long-term experiment of simple (corn-corn-soybean-soybean) and diverse (corn-corn-soybean-wheat underseeded with red clover cover crop) four year rotations under second year corn. Soil was collected during peak N2O emissions using high frequency temporal sampling to capture shifts in 16S rRNA, amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZ1 and nosZ2 genes and gene transcripts in soil where urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN) was applied. An N2O emission event occurred in both rotations following UAN application but was higher in the diverse rotation, which also had persistent higher total and denitrifying (nirK and nosZ2) bacterial abundance. Bacterial amoA significantly increased in both rotations shortly after UAN addition, but gene detection decreased significantly in the simple rotation and remained elevated in the diverse. Transcripts for atypical nosZ2 were consistently detected but higher after UAN addition.

Evidence shows that policy makers are more open to using taxes and cap-and-trade systems to combat climate change than levying tolls to manage traffic congestion. Although carbon taxes are too low, and caps on tradable permits too high, to induce significant Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reductions, governments at all levels are starting to implement these instruments, and climate change is now on the international political agenda as the Paris Agreement demonstrates. By contrast, congestion charging is rare. One reason may be that the science of climate change has become virtually impossible to ignore. Another is that GHG concentrations are cumulative, and the consequences of climate change are global, irreversible and potentially catastrophic. Traffic congestion is localized and transient, and more of an inconvenience than a threat to life. Responsibility for transportation policy is also often divided across multiple levels of government. These differences may explain why the use of economic instruments has been more widespread in dealing with climate change than with congestion. © 2020","Carbon taxes; Climate change; Congestion pricing; Economic advice; Greenhouse gas emissions; Policymaking; Pollution; Tradable permits; Traffic congestion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088982996

However, fundamental understanding of the thermal quenching of luminescence, which leads to a pronounced reduction of the emission intensity under high-power light-emitting diode operation, remains to be obtained. Here we show, through a multitechnique approach based on photoluminescence, thermoluminescence and mode-selective vibrational excitation experiments that thermal quenching of luminescence in Y3-zCezAl5O12 is caused by a combined effect of thermal ionization, thermally activated concentration quenching, and thermally activated 5d → 4f crossover relaxation via electron-phonon coupling, and establish the general trends upon variation of the Ce3+ concentration and temperature. Thermal quenching below 600 K is primarily the result of concentration quenching and crossover relaxation, which can be suppressed by keeping the Ce3+ dopant concentration far below 0.7 mol%, whereas for temperatures above 600 K thermal ionization is the predominating quenching process. This new insight into the interplay between different thermal quenching processes provides design principles for optimizing the light emittance and colour stability of new phosphor materials used in white lighting devices characterized by certain operating temperatures.

These atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) emitted from the exhausts of mobile source gasoline-fueled vehicles constitute substantial risks to human health through inhalation, and most importantly, affect urban air quality. Therefore, in order to explicitly determine the inhalation risks of PM2.5 which could potentially contain a significant amount of chemicals and metallic elements (MEs) concentration, we investigated the chemical composition (comprising of carbonaceous species and metallic elements) of PM2.5 emissions from mobile source gasoline-fueled vehicles. To further examine the chemical composition and metallic elements concentration in PM2.5 from the exhausts of mobile source gasoline-fueled vehicles, we systematically investigated PM2.5 emission samples collected from the exhausts of fifteen (15) mobile source gasoline-fueled vehicles. Our study has equally also determined the chemical compositions based on carbonaceous species (organic carbon - OC and elemental carbon - EC). Furthermore, the concentrations of PM2.5 and metallic elements (Ca, Al, Zn, K, Ca, Fe, Mg and Cr) in PM2.5 were analyzed with the help of Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The details of the tested gasoline-fueled vehicles cover the model years, consisting of the vehicles registered from 2000 to 2017 from several vehicle manufacturers (or brands) with various running mileages ranging from 123.4 to 575,844 km (average 123,105 km). Our results established that elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were the most significant concentrations of carbonaceous species. The concentration of metallic elements in PM2.5 and chemical characterization were studied by their relationship with atmospheric PM2.5 and the results showed that the metallic elements concentration in PM2.5 were in descending order as follows: Ca &gt; Al &gt; Zn &gt; K &gt; Fe &gt; Mg &gt; Cr. These results will help us to further understand how PM2.5 emissions from the exhausts of in-use gasoline-fueled vehicles contribute to both chemical and atmospheric metallic elements concentration in the ambient air. © 2020","Carbonaceous species; Gasoline-fueled vehicles; Metallic elements concentration; PM2.5 emissions","Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Automobile manufacture; Climate change; Health risks; Indicators (chemical); Inductively coupled plasma; Magnesium; Metals; Mobile power plants; Optical emission spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Vehicles; Aerodynamic diameters; Atmospheric fine particulate matter; Carbonaceous species; Chemical characterization; Chemical compositions; Fine particulate matter; Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy; Vehicle manufacturers; Gasoline; aluminum; calcium; carbon; chromium; gasoline; iron; magnesium; metal; organic carbon; potassium; zinc; aerodynamics; air quality; chemical composition; concentration (composition); elemental carbon; emission; organic carbon; particulate matter; air pollution; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; controlled study; exhaust gas; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086362221

Extreme weather events, natural hazards, and the failure of climate mitigation and adaptation are substantial risks. These risks are especially significant in fast-urbanizing deltas, such as the Pearl River Delta in China, because the conflict between urbanization and flooding caused by climate change will be more significant in the future. This paper elaborates on an approach that employs a future land-use simulation (FLUS) model for scenario-based 100-year coastal flood risk assessment. Storylines of future scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), called the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5, are utilized in the present study. The Guangzhou Metropolitan Area (GMA) is used as a case study to explore the probable implications of future land-use changes due to the ongoing urbanization process in the region in relation to projected environmental changes (sea-level rise, storm surge, and land subsidence). The results indicate that there will be a significant increase in flooded urban areas in the future. The simulations show that, as compared to 2015, the built-up area in the GMA will increase by 246.57 km2 in 2030 and 513.03 km2 in 2050. As compared to 2015, the flooding of built-up areas in 2030 and 2050 will respectively increase by about 31.32 km2 and 48.49 km2 under the RCP 8.5 scenario. It is also found that, as the main driving factor, urbanization will increase the flooding of built-up areas in Guangzhou in 2030 and 2050 by about 1.9 km2 and 5.9 km2, respectively, under the RCP 2.6 scenario as compared to 2015. Additionally, due to environmental changes, the flooding of built-up areas in Guangzhou will increase by about 24.2 km2 and 26.8 km2, respectively, under the RCP 8.5 scenario by 2030 and 2050 as compared to 2015. This increasing flood risk information determined by the simulation provides insight into the spatial distribution of future flood-prone urban areas to facilitate the development and prioritization of flood mitigation measures at the most critical locations in the region. © 2020","Flood risk management; Future land-use model; Guangzhou; Pearl River Delta; Scenario-based planning; Urbanization","Climate change; Land use; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sea level; Climate mitigations; Coastal flood risks; Critical challenges; Environmental change; Extreme weather events; Flood mitigation measures; Flood risk assessments; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Floods; delta; flood control; future prospect; hazard assessment; land use; metropolitan area; risk assessment; scenario analysis; urbanization; article; climate change; environmental change; flooding; risk assessment; risk management; river; sea level rise; simulation; storm surge; urban area; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086382124

Previous studies have indicated that the catabolism of arginine may contribute to the osmotic stress adaptation of T. halophilus. Unusually, in the chromosome of T. halophilus, preceding the arginine deiminase (ADI) operon, locate two co-transcribed genes, both encoding an ArgR regulator; similar structure was rarely found and the roles of the regulators have not been demonstrated. In the current study, regulatory roles of these two nonidentical ArgR regulators on the arginine metabolism of T. halophilus were investigated. The results show that these two regulators play different roles in arginine metabolism, ArgR1 acts as a negative regulator of the ADI pathway by binding to the promoter sequences and repressing the transcription of genes, and the addition of arginine or hyper-osmotic stress conditions can abolish the ArgR1 repression, whereas ArgR2 negatively regulates the genes involved in arginine biosynthesis. Our study found that despite the commonly known roles of the ArgR regulators as the activator of arginine catabolism and the repressor of arginine biosynthesis, which are found in most studied bacteria possessed one ArgR regulator, the two nonidentical ArgR regulators of T. halophilus both act as repressors, and the repression by which is regulated when sensing changes of environments. By revealing the regulation of arginine metabolism, the current study provides molecular insights and potential tools for future applications of halophiles in biotechnology. Key points: • The expression of the ADI pathway of T. halophilus is regulated by carbon sources and osmotic stress. • The arginine metabolism process of T. halophilus is fine-tuned by the two ArgR regulators. • The ADI pathway may contribute to the osmotic stress adaptation by generating more energy and accumulating citrulline which acts as compatible solute. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ADI pathway; ArgR regulator; Osmotic stress; Tetragenococcus halophilus","Bacteria; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Lactic acid; Metabolism; Osmosis; Transcription; Arginine biosynthesis; Arginine catabolism; Arginine deiminases; Fermentation process; Future applications; Lactic acid bacteria; Negative regulators; Tetragenococcus halophilus; Arginine; arginine; arginine deiminase; arginine; bacterial protein; adaptation; amino acid; bacterium; catabolism; chromosome; enzyme; enzyme activity; fermentation; gene expression; growth regulator; metabolism; amino acid metabolism; amino acid synthesis; argr1 gene; argr2 gene; Article; bacterial chromosome; catabolite repression; controlled study; DNA binding; gene repression; genetic organization; genetic transcription; nonhuman; operon; osmotic stress; promoter region; regulator gene; repressor gene; Tetragenococcus halophilus; Enterococcaceae; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Bacteria (microorganisms); Tetragenococcus halophilus; Arginine; Bacterial Proteins; Enterococcaceae; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Operon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090240971

Empirical results show that while economic growth exerted carbon reduction effects in the eastern region, it stimulated the growth of CO2 emissions in the central and western regions. This is mainly due to regional differences in industrial structure and the high-tech industry. Energy efficiency has made a greater contribution to reducing CO2 emissions in the central region because the R&amp;D investment and patent rights granted in this region has grown faster. The energy consumption structure has a more complex impact. It exerts a “pulling first, then restricting” (Ո-shaped) nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions in the eastern and western regions, but an inverted “N-shaped” effect in the central region. This is mainly due to the differences in the composition of energy consumption across regions. Environmental regulations have a positive “U-shaped” nonlinear impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern and western regions. It means that environmental regulations help cut down CO2 emissions in the early stage, and the facilitation effect gradually disappears at the later stage.

In this context, the use of carpooling in home-work commute is particularly appealing for its potential of lessening the number of cars and kilometers traveled, consequently reducing major causes of traffic in cities. Accordingly, most of the carpooling algorithms are optimized for reducing total travel time, cost, and other transportation-related metrics. In this paper, we analyze carpooling from a new perspective, investigating the question of whether it can be used also as a tool to favor social integration, and to what extent social benefits should be traded off with transportation efficiency. By incorporating traveler’s social characteristics into a recently introduced network-based approach to model ride-sharing opportunities, we define two social-related carpooling problems: how to maximize the number of rides shared between people belonging to different social groups, and how to maximize the amount of time people spend together along the ride. For each of the problems, we provide corresponding optimal and computationally efficient solutions.

Tracing VOC pollution sources is important for controlling VOC emissions and reducing O3 and SOAs. We built a novel mobile proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (M-PTR-MS) instrument to image the distribution of VOCs and trace their emission sources in cities and industrial parks. The M-PTR-MS is composed of a vibration-resistant proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) with a global positioning system receiver, modified box vehicle, and geographic information system (GIS) software. The PTR-MS, mounted on a vehicle, sends VOC data and vehicle position information to the GIS software. These data are used to image the space distribution of VOCs in real time while the vehicle platform is in motion and the VOC sources are precisely traced using the GIS. The spatial data resolution of the M-PTR-MS is typically 0.8 m. The limits of detection, sensitivity, and repeatability of the M-PTR-MS are 43.5 ppt, 347 counts ppb−1, and 2.4% (RSD, n = 5), respectively. The intensity of reagent ions is stable over 8 h (RSD = 0.45%). Compared with commercial PTR-MS equipment, the M-PTR-MS demonstrated high consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 92.665%. Several field experiments were conducted in China using the M-PTR-MS. In one field experiment, the VOC distribution along three different routes was surveyed; the navigation monitoring lasted 1.8 h over a distance of 26.7 km at an average speed of 15 km h−1. The VOC sources in an industrial park were identified by analyzing the components near different factories. The main species from a VOC source in an underground garage was related to paint. The M-PTR-MS instrument can be used by environmental protection agencies to trace VOC pollution sources in real time, and by researchers to survey VOC emissions in regions of concern. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","GIS; Mobile mass spectrometer; PTR-MS; Real time; VOCs","Environmental Protection Agency; Geographic information systems; Industrial emissions; Mass spectrometry; Pollution; Surveys; Vehicles; Vibrations (mechanical); Volatile organic compounds; Correlation coefficient; Global positioning system receivers; Navigation monitoring; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; Secondary organic aerosols; Spatial data resolution; Vibration resistants; VOC emission sources; Proton transfer; volatile organic compound; proton; aerosol; GIS; imaging method; mass spectrometry; ozone; pollutant source; real time; spatial distribution; urban area; volatile organic compound; Article; atmospheric pressure; concentration (parameter); geographic information system; global positioning system; humidity; limit of detection; measurement repeatability; pollution control; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; vibration; China; city; mass spectrometry; China; Cities; Mass Spectrometry; Protons; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087699650

Y. He, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 175701 (2018)10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.175701]. Its crystal structure comprises alternating fivefold, sixfold, and sevenfold carbon rings and exhibits reduced bonding anisotropy compared to diamond, raising the prospects of finding a superstrong material with distinct and favorable mechanical properties. Here we report findings from first-principles calculations that reveal peculiar stress-strain relations in Pbam-32 carbon. The obtained stress responses under various tensile and shear strains display outstanding characteristics contrasting those of traditional superhard materials like diamond and cubic boron nitride (c-BN). The Pbam-32 carbon undergoes structural deformations that produce highly isotropic stress responses under a wide variety of large tensile and shear strains, showcasing unprecedented nearly degenerate stress-strain curves along multiple deformation paths extended over ultralarge, including full-range, strains up to the bond-breaking points. These deformation modes impede or even suppress the graphitization process commonly seen in highly strained diamond and c-BN crystals while still sustaining large peak stresses comparable to those in diamond. Most notably, we find conspicuous bond-weakening and -breaking mechanisms stemming from bonding symmetry reduction in Pbam-32 carbon. At large tensile strains, a sequential bond elongation process occurs, generating a more ductile deformation past the peak stress; at large shear strains, the crystal structure goes through a similar sequential bond elongation process and, interestingly, transforms into a distinct three-dimensional network containing mixed sp2 and sp3 bonding states, suppressing the usual graphitization process. These more gradual bonding-state changes in the severely strained Pbam-32 carbon improve ductility and toughness in this superstrong carbon crystal. These insights elucidate mechanisms for toughening superstrong covalent crystals via microstructural arrangements, which shed light on rational design and development of a distinct class of superstrong materials that exhibit more isotropic mechanical responses with improved toughness under diverse loading conditions. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Calculations; Cubic boron nitride; Curve fitting; Deformation; Diamonds; Graphite; Graphitization; III-V semiconductors; Shear strain; Stress-strain curves; Bond-breaking points; Cubic boron nitride (cBN); Ductile deformations; First-principles calculation; Graphitization process; Stress strain relation; Structural deformation; Three-dimensional networks; Crystal structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093116220

The study concerns the situation with a subtropical city where there is a predominant wind direction (as is the case in, e.g., Hong Kong) and where the direction of that wind is perpendicular to the street canyon, since this is the worst-case from air pollution and overheating point of view. In particular, this North-South oriented street has been studied with the realistic solar irradiance at two different sun directions, corresponding to morning (08:00) and afternoon (16:00) hours, respectively. Two step-up and two step-down North-South oriented street canyons are considered under two different incoming wind speeds (high and low). The corresponding ratios of upwind and downwind building heights are = 1/3, 2/3 and 3/1, 3/2, respectively. The results demonstrated that for the step-up canyon, a higher upwind building was found to produce a hotter air temperature only at a low wind speed and polluted more severely at both high and low wind speeds, compared with its lower upwind building counterpart. In contrast, for the step-down canyon, a higher downwind building was found to produce cooler air temperatures at both high and low wind speeds and accumulated more pollutants only at a low wind speed, compared with its lower downwind building counterpart. On the other hand, at the high wind speed, both air quality and thermal environment were better in the step-up canyon than in the step-down canyon. However, at the low wind speed, the air quality was higher in the step-down canyon than the step-up canyon, while the step-up canyon still provided better thermal environment than the step-down canyon. Moreover, a Richardson number (Ri) for the asymmetric street canyons is defined for the evaluation of the buoyancy force versus the inertial force. When |Ri| > 20, the flow field was mainly dominated by natural convection, and an increase of |Ri| resulted in an increase in the air temperature and a decrease in the pollutant concentration. In contrast, when |Ri| < 20, the flow field was dominated by forced convection, and the variation of |Ri| had an insignificant influence on air quality and air temperature. The simulated pollutant concentration and thermal environment results were further processed to obtain optimization guidelines for a north-south asymmetric canyon in the city centers of Hong Kong via the application of multivariate regression analysis with a group of dimensionless parameters. These guidelines will facilitate the renewal of north-south asymmetric street canyons while enhancing air quality and lowering air temperature by serving as a reference for architects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Asymmetric street canyon; Computational fluid dynamics; Outdoor thermal comfort; Realistic solar radiation","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Flow fields; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Speed; Dimensionless parameters; Multivariate regression analysis; Outdoor-air temperature; Pollutant concentration; Richardson number; Simulated pollutant; Solar irradiances; Thermal environment; Wind; air quality; air temperature; ambient air; asymmetry; height; pedestrian; software; street canyon; subtropical region; wind direction; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089952275

Simulating and forecasting the air quality have become important tools for analyzing the temporal and spatial variations in air pollution and diagnosing the sources and transport pathways of air pollutants.

In this study, we used Newtonian relaxation and the coupled WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)-CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) model to improve the simulation accuracy to correct the inventory data. By utilizing the corrected inventory data, the correlation coefficients of the simulated PM2.5 emissions in April 2016 and April 2017 are greatly improved (with correlation coefficient R = 0.619 vs. 0.409, respectively, and root mean square errors RMSE = 0.0364 vs. 0.0404 mg/m3, respectively).

First, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was developed to estimate the surface ozone concentration (SOC) between 2005 and 2018 based on Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) ozone profiles. The resultant values and their growth rate were then analyzed. The SOC exhibited significant variation in the spatial distribution over the study area, with the maximum and the minimum values occurring in the southeast and the northeast, respectively. The latter region also displayed the highest SOC growth rate, however, whereas the southwest displayed the lowest one. Additionally, prominent seasonality was observed in the SOC: The concentration peaked during the warm season and troughed during the cold season, but the growth rate showed the opposite trend. The values during the cold season greatly affected the annual spatial distribution and the growth rate of the SOC, whereas those during the warm season significantly contributed to the annual concentration. From 2005 till 2018, the SOC showed an upward trend with an average growth rate of 3.4 µg m–3 y–1, with a greater increase in the second half (2012–2018) than the first half (2005–2011) of the study period because of the stronger photochemical reactions caused by the continual increase in HCHO during summer and the weaker NO titration effect caused by the rapid decrease in NO2 during winter. With constantly rising levels of HCHO and a VOCs-limited regime in the study area, we must formulate an effective reduction scheme for VOCs and NO2 co-emissions in order to mitigate the surface ozone pollution, despite the risk that decreasing the NO2 will lead to a certain increase in the SOC. © The Author(s).","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the surrounding areas; Geographically weighted regression model; OMI ozone profile; Spatio-temporal distribution; Surface ozone concentration","Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Spatial distribution; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Average growth rate; Geographically weighted regression models; Minimum value; Ozone monitoring instruments; Ozone profiles; Satellite retrieval; Surface ozone; Surface ozone concentrations; Growth rate; concentration (composition); instrumentation; ozone; photochemistry; satellite altimetry; satellite data; spatial distribution; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089798778

Most literature investigated CO2 solubility in a single-salt solution as a replacement of real saline water, which may significantly overestimate CO2 sequestration potential through solubility trapping. In order to accurately estimate CO2 sequestration potential over geological conditions, the Peng-Robinson Cubic-Plus-Association (PR-CPA) equation of state (EOS) is used in this study to model both aqueous and nonaqueous phases. A promising flash technique at given moles, volume and temperature, known as NVT flash, is employed and the salting-out effect is reproduced by correcting the chemical potential of aqueous nonelectrolyte components. To represent real saline environments, five salts are considered, including sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). With taking into account the electrostatic contribution caused by salts, the combination of the salt-based PR-CPA EOS and NVT flash accurately models the solubility behavior of CO2 in mixed-salt solutions and the numerical results agree with experimental data very well. Moreover, the proposed CPA model exhibits neck-to-neck accuracy to the more sophisticated electrolyte CPA EOS, thus making it promising to accurately estimate carbon sequestration potential in saline aquifers through solubility trapping. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 sequestration; Cubic-Plus-association equation of state; NVT flash; Saline water; Thermodynamic modeling","Aquifers; Binary mixtures; Calcium chloride; Carbon dioxide; Electrolytes; Equations of state; Hydrogeology; Potash; Potassium chloride; Saline water; Sodium chloride; Sodium sulfate; Solubility; Sulfur compounds; Carbon sequestration potential; Cubic plus associations; Deep saline aquifers; Electrostatic contributions; Geological conditions; Salting out effects; Single-salt solutions; Sodium chloride (NaCl); Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085842726

Mianyang, Sichun, 621000, China","When the vortices shedding from an upstream rod impinge upon the surface of a downstream airfoil, the resultant vortex–body interaction noise can be significant. The use of “natural rod-base blowing” to reduce this interaction noise is investigated numerically using a 3D hybrid computational aeroacoustics approach. The natural blowing is generated through an internal slot that interconnects the stagnation and base region of the rod. Numerical simulation is performed for a straight blowing at blowing rates (BRs) between 6.4% and 16.3% and an oblique blowing with slot–incidence angles (θ) between 0° and 15°, respectively. Far-field noise evaluation demonstrates that the natural rod-base blowing under tested BRs can reduce significantly the noise emission, whereas loses its efficiencies gradually with the increase of angle θ. The most effective case is the straight blowing (θ=0°) at BR≥13.6% where the far-field tonal noise associated with the steady-periodic von Karman vortex shedding is annihilated. The changes in transient flow structures indicate that the natural blowing gradually attenuates the von Karman vortex shedding when BR increases, resulting in a mitigation of vortex–body​ interaction on the airfoil leading surface and hence a reduction of the unsteady lift. At BR=13.6%, as the angle θ reaches 15° from below, a new von Karman vortex street reforms in the flow field, leading to another tonal noise. Linear stability analysis based on a local concept of absolute/convective instability suggests that the absolutely unstable region in the near-wake of the rod elongates first and then shrinks with the increase of BR, while the local absolute growth rate decreases monotonously. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Absolute/convective instability; Flow/noise control; Natural rod-base blowing; rod–airfoil configuration; SAS+FWH; vortex–body interaction noise","Airfoils; Computational aeroacoustics; Linear stability analysis; Vortex shedding; Wakes; Absolute/convective instabilities; Airfoil configuration; Incidence angles; Its efficiencies; Numerical experiments; Unstable regions; Von Karman Vortex Street; Von Karman vortices; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084047160

Researches have shown that the difference in economic development levels between the eastern and western regions is an important factor that causes the shift of the center of gravity of carbon emission and its intensity to the west. In decomposition effects, the economic output effect has the largest contribution (56%) to emissions, and the energy intensity effect has the best effect in suppressing emissions. Except for some industries in the East and Central South of China, energy structure in other regions is still dominated by high-carbon energy. In the energy intensity effect, the suppression effects in the East and Central South of China have reached −83,440 Mt and −78,850 Mt respectively, while the Northeast and Northwest of China areas are not significant. Vigorously developing low-carbon technologies and promoting clean energy can effectively reduce carbon intensity.

A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the paddy soil with rice straw incorporation (SI). The paddy soil was sampled from the Yuanyang Terrace, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. There were four treatments: natural light (control check, CK), 5.0 kJ·m−2 UV-B radiation (UVB), SI, and SI + UVB. The effects of UV-B radiation (5.0 kJ·m−2) on straw degradation, soil carbon invertase activity, active organic carbon content, and GHG emissions were studied. The results showed that UV-B radiation promoted the degradation of straw components (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and water-soluble phenol). The SI treatment significantly increased the activity of soil carbon invertase (P &lt; 0.05), the content of soil active organic carbon (P &lt; 0.05), and the emission rates and amounts of GHGs (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to the SI treatment, SI + UVB treatment reduced soil carbon invertase activity and active organic carbon content, resulting in a 17% reduction in CH4 emission and a 40% and 16% increase in CO2 and N2O emission (P &lt; 0.05), but had no significant effect on the global warming potential (GWP). Correlation analysis showed that the degradation rate of straw components was positively correlated with the activity of carbon invertase, the contents of microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC), and the CO2 emission rate; the activities of sucrase and cellulase were positively correlated with the contents of MBC and EOC, which were in turn positively correlated with the emission rates of CH4 and CO2. Under SI, UV-B radiation reduced the soil carbon conversion, which led to a decreased CH4 emission and increased emissions of CO2 and N2O, but did not alter the GWP of GHGs from the paddy soil. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","active organic carbon; greenhouse gases; paddy soil; rice straw incorporation; UV-B radiation","Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Cellulose; Chemical industry; Degradation; Earth (planet); Gas emissions; Global warming; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Radiation effects; Soils; Correlation analysis; Degradation rate; Earth's surface; Global warming potential; Invertase activity; Microbial biomass carbon; Organic carbon contents; Radiation enhancement; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; ozone; paddy field; soil carbon; straw; ultraviolet B radiation; Biodegradation; Carbon Dioxide; Cellulose; Greenhouse Gases; Particulate Emissions; Radiation Effects; China; Yuanyang; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087151835

Moreover, it is also meaningful for exploring the decoupling of economic development from carbon emissions in other areas (both developing and developed countries). The main findings displayed that the decoupling status in developed countries (i.e., USA, Japan, and Germany) were better and more stable than in developing countries (i.e., China, India, and Russia). Germany performed best among the developed countries, and China performed most stable among the developing countries.

Much effort of carbon mitigation as a countermeasure to global changes has focused on the urban areas – the hotspots of fossil fuel and concentrated emission and pollutants. Despite their critical role in CO2 exchange in urban ecosystem, emission from vegetation and soils are largely overlooked in existing urban land surface models. In this study, we parameterized the biogenic CO2 exchange in cities using an advanced single-layer urban canopy model, by incorporating plant physiological functions in the built environment. In addition, the proposed model also includes the anthropogenic CO2 fluxes especially that from traffic emissions based on gridded dataset. We evaluate the proposed model using field measurements from an eddy covariance flux tower located at west Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The model results are in good agreement with the observed carbon flux over the built terrain, with a root mean squared error of 0.21 mg m−2s−1.

Yet, how energy storage might interreact with renewables in existing grids and how these interactions affect overall emissions remain unclear. Here, we estimate emissions induced by battery energy storage in two regions of the United States with very different levels of wind penetration using high-resolution, both spatially and temporally, locational marginal prices and hourly marginal emission factors. We find that the emission intensity of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury is 4264% lower in the high wind penetration grid (28%) than in the low wind penetration grid (<5%). This is due in part to a significant share of wind dispatched as marginal fuel in baseload hours when battery storage charges from the grid, reducing storage-induced emissions. Our study suggests that more wind generation can favorably pair with storage and reduce the air pollution burdens otherwise caused by storage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Grid penetration; Marginal emissions; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Electric batteries; Fuel storage; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Battery energy storage; Emission factors; Emission intensity; High resolution; Locational marginal prices; System emission; Wind generation; Wind penetration; Battery storage; emission; energy storage; induced response; performance assessment; scale effect; wind forcing; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087412780

China is a major country of energy consumption and carbon emissions, and has attempted to build a carbon emission trading market to reduce carbon emissions. This practice helps to promote the carbon trading projects for both regional carbon emission reduction and sustainable development in the pilot areas, as well as having important theoretical and practical significance for the further improvement of carbon emission trading policies. In this study, we first used the difference-in-difference (DID) model to evaluate the impact of carbon emission trading on the carbon emission intensity of construction land (CEICL). The results showed that the carbon emission trading policy can significantly reduce CEICL in the pilot areas. Furthermore, we adopted the quantile regression model to explore the mechanism and acting path of carbon emission trading on CEICL. The results show that the increase in carbon trading volume (CTV) can effectively reduce the CEICL. However, a high carbon trading price (CTP) tends to reduce the suppressing effect of carbon emission trading on CEICL. Additionally, carbon emission trading also affects CEICL through the indirect acting paths of industrial structure and energy intensity. Finally, we propose to promote regional low-carbon development from the perspective of developing a carbon emission trading market nationwide, rationalizing the carbon quota and trading price mechanism, optimizing the regional industrial structure, and improving the energy consumption structure. © 2020 by the authors.","Acting path; Carbon emission intensity; Carbon emission trading; Construction land; Difference-in-difference (DID); Quantile regression","carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; market conditions; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092420546

Sleep problems could increase the risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Objective short sleep duration is associated with increased mortality. Obesity, smoking and sex differences could influence sleep disorders and sleep duration. The health effects of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution are of great concern. However, a large general population-based study with abundant demographic and lifestyle information is needed to confirm the effect of PM pollution on sleep disorders and sleep duration. Methods: Information on PM air pollution, demographics and other related factors was obtained from the UK Biobank. Subjects’ characteristics were described as the means and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for continuous variables and counts (percentages) for categorical variables. In the case–control study of sleep disorders, univariate analysis, single-pollutant models and a four-pollutant model with logistic regression were performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of the risk factors. For sleep duration, univariate analysis, single-pollutant models and a four-pollutant model with linear regressions were carried out to assess the effect of the factors. Sensitivity analysis was performed by data imputation and study population change. Results: There were 5976 cases and 97,160 controls included in the case–control study of sleep disorders. For sleep duration analysis, most of the participants had environmental PM data, and 457,358 participants were selected. The single-pollutant models showed that the OR of PM2.5 for sleep disorders was 2.39 (95% CI: 1.64–3.48) for every 10 μg/m3 increase. PM2.5 and PM10 reduced sleep duration by 0.14 (95% CI: 0.10–0.18) and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.10–0.14) hours for every 10 μg/m3 increase, respectively. Four-pollutant models showed that the OR of PM2.5 for sleep disorders was 4.42 (95% CI: 2.36–8.26) for every 10 μg/m3 increase. PM10 appeared to reduce sleep duration by 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06–0.12) hours for every 10 μg/m3 increase. The main results showed good robustness after sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: PM2.5 was a risk factor for sleep disorders. PM2.5 and PM10 reduced sleep duration. A reduction in particulate matter exposure may decrease the risk of sleep disorders and improve sleep duration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; PM10; PM2.5; Sleep disorder; Sleep duration","adult; air pollution; Article; atmospheric particulate matter; biobank; case control study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; middle aged; phenotype; population; priority journal; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; sleep disorder; sleep time; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089816880

To promote this modal shift, a profit-maximization model that integrates two dimensions is proposed. Internally, the competitiveness of rail freight is enhanced by dynamic freight pricing, backlog controlling, and flexible dispatching. Externally, a subsidy policy is considered to stimulate rail freight. Based on Lyapunov optimization, this multi-slot global optimization problem is converted into a series of low-complexity problems that only require knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The equivalence of this transformation is proved theoretically. Then Harmony search algorithm is used to solve these low-complexity models. A case study based on the transportation network composed of five central cities in China is conducted. Compared with the application of the actual fixed rail freight rates, a CO2 emission reduction of 3261 t can be achieved with the dynamic pricing strategy. Based on jointly optimizing rail freight price and service plan, an additional subsidy of 0.1–0.6 RMB/TEU-km to rail freight operators can achieve an 23.78–25.38% MS from road to rail, as well as a 24.08–26.12% CO2 emission reduction in this service chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Backlog controlling; CO2 emissions; Lyapunov optimization; Operation planning; Pricing; Subsidy policy","Carbon dioxide; Complex networks; Emission control; Global optimization; Roads and streets; CO2 emission reduction; Dynamic pricing; Global optimization problems; Harmony search algorithms; Profit maximization; Rail freight rates; Transportation industry; Transportation network; Costs; algorithm; carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental economics; freight transport; price dynamics; railway transport; subsidy system; transportation planning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089230633

To facilitate the development of low-carbon communities with the growing installation of distributed energy systems, this paper explores bidirectional interactive behaviors among multi-stakeholder energy systems and seek energy management strategies in neighboring communities. The distributed energy systems can share their surplus energy or request insufficient energy in one area, considering the demand-side resources. A collaborative hierarchical framework is developed to coordinate electricity and heat interaction. Multiple independent optimization problems for decentralized stakeholders are obtained and solved based on an analytical target cascading algorithm, in which Lagrangian penalty terms are considered to ensure consistency in energy bidirectional interaction. The influence of carbon tax, and electrical and thermal demand response on the results of the multi-stakeholders interaction problem has been analyzed. The results show that a win-win situation is achieved for all participators while considering the proposed coordination scheme. The total cost and carbon dioxide emissions are reduced obviously. Moreover, implementing carbon tax leads to a decrease in electricity and heat parallel interaction. If policymakers want to keep energy sharing among communities actively, the carbon tax should be set at a reasonable range. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical target cascading; Carbon tax; Demand response; Distributed energy systems; Energy management; Multi-stakeholders","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy management; Global warming; Taxation; Analytical target cascading; Bi-directional interaction; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Demand response resources; Distributed energy systems; Energy management strategies; Low-carbon communities; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086067485

Most reported fluorescence strategies are based on covalent labeling of ligand or RNA, which can impede the binding between them to some extent, or light-off fluorescent indicator displacement methods, which ask for particular indicators. Herein, a label-free fluorescence strategy based on the light-on aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivative to screen RNA-binding small molecules is presented. As a result of electrostatic interaction, the selected peptides can induce self-assembly of the TPE derivative to produce strong fluorescent emission; when the peptides are bound to RNA molecules, the TPE derivative is in the deaggregated form and shows no or minimum fluorescence. Based on the phenomenon, a competitive displacement assay combined with the TPE reporter was employed to characterize selected small molecules for their binding abilities to HIV-I RNAs. This AIE feature enables the fluorescence-off state of the TPE derivative in the presence of RNA-peptide complex to be ""lightened up""quickly as the RNA-binding molecule is introduced and the peptide is competitively released. This strategy was carried out to test several small molecule binders, and the results are consistent with previous reports. This report gives an inspiring example of AIE-based fluorescent assay for HIV-I RNA-binding molecule screening, which may further be explored to build a drug screening platform for RNA-protein interference.

To achieve this goal, the concentration of five air pollutants on two main roads in the Shenyang four-ring area was measured by a vehicle-borne air pollutant monitor. Through analysis of the spatial distribution pattern of these air pollutants, it can be found that the average concentrations of SO2 for the three monitoring events are similar (43.1, 40.6 and 40.3 μg/m3), and the concentrations of NO2, PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 are the highest for the 20190304 event, followed by the 20190107 and 20181213 events. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationships of the gaseous pollutants and particulate matter based on the data from the three monitoring events. The results indicated that SO2 is negatively correlated with the other pollutants, while there are positive correlations among the other four pollutants. In particular, there is a strong positive correlation among the three classes of particulate matter (correlation coefficients &gt; 0.97, p &lt; 0.01). The relative contributions of environmental factors and landscape pattern factors to the air pollutants were analyzed by the BRT model. It is revealed that the environmental factors have a significant influence (relative contributions&gt; 10 %) on air pollution, and temperature was the main influencing factor (relative contributions &gt; 20 %).

Despite being a critical issue for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and food security, the detection of the onset, duration, and magnitude of land degradation remains challenging, as is early identification of short-term vegetation loss preceding land degradation. Here, we present a new approach for monitoring both short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands using satellite data. Our approach integrates Spectral Mixture Analysis and temporal segmentation, and analyzes dense time-series of satellite observations in three steps. First, we unmix all available satellite observations and aggregate them into monthly composites. Second, we calculate the annual Cumulative Endmember Fractions and examine their piecewise trends among years to determine the onset, duration, and magnitude of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation. Third, we attribute a decrease in the green vegetation fraction with a concomitant increase in either open soil, or non-photosynthetic vegetation. We tested our method mapping short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands in the Caucasus Ecoregion using the 2001–2018 time series of MODIS 8-day reflectance data. We found strong patterns of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation, mostly in the eastern part of the Caucasus Ecoregion in areas of desert- and semi-desert natural vegetation. Short-term vegetation loss episodes (3–9 years) were more common and had greater magnitude than decadal degradation (≥10 years), especially in steppe regions. On average, 9.3% of grassland area was subjected annually to either decadal, or short-term vegetation loss. Desiccation, i.e., the shift from green vegetation to dry vegetation, was the most prevalent type of change pathway, with green vegetation loss to open soil coming second. Decadal degradation and short-term vegetation loss rates were the highest in dry areas where the potential natural vegetation is sub-shrub deserts, or halophytic, alluvial, and wet lowland forests. Our findings support known general degradation patterns in the Caucasus Ecoregion, but provide better understanding of ongoing processes, by detecting exact location, timing, and magnitude of changes. More broadly, our method advances the monitoring of grasslands by detecting both decadal degradation and short-term vegetation loss. This flexibility supports adaptive degradation monitoring, aids sustainable land management, and provides new information for carbon stock analyses and biodiversity conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Caucasus mountains; Google earth engine; Land degradation; Landsat; LandTrendr; MODIS; Rangelands; Spectral mixture analysis (SMA)","Arid regions; Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Food supply; Land use; Landforms; Satellites; Time series; Time series analysis; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Flexibility supports; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; Satellite observations; Spectral mixture analysis; Sustainable land managements; Temporal segmentations; Vegetation; biodiversity; climate change; decadal variation; episodic event; grassland; land degradation; land use; mitigation; MODIS; satellite data; segmentation; surface reflectance; time series; vegetation dynamics; Caucasus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087931016

In tundra, mosses are a prominent feature, known to regulate soil temperature and moisture through their physical structure and associated water retention capacity. Moss presence and species identity might therefore modify the impact of increases in temperature and precipitation on tree seedling establishment at the arctic-alpine treeline. We followed Betula pubescens and Pinus sylvestris seedling survival and growth during three growing seasons in the field. Tree seedlings were transplanted along a natural precipitation gradient at the subarctic-alpine treeline in northern Sweden, into plots dominated by each of three common moss species and exposed to combinations of moss removal and experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs). Independent of climate, the presence of feather moss, but not Sphagnum, strongly supressed survival of both tree species. Positive effects of warming and precipitation on survival and growth of B. pubescens seedlings occurred in the absence of mosses and as expected, this was partly dependent on moss species. P. sylvestris survival was greatest at high precipitation, and this effect was more pronounced in Sphagnum than in feather moss plots irrespective of whether the mosses had been removed or not. Moss presence did not reduce the effects of OTCs on soil temperature. Mosses therefore modified seedling response to climate through other mechanisms, such as altered competition or nutrient availability. We conclude that both moss presence and species identity pose a strong control on seedling establishment at the alpine treeline, and that in some cases mosses weaken climate-change effects on seedling establishment. Changes in moss abundance and species composition therefore have the potential to hamper treeline expansion induced by climate warming. © 2020 The Authors.

The Malaysia government has introduced several policies related to the installation of renewable energy to secure its energy demand, which has an annual growth rate of 8.1%. In the Iskandar region in Johor, low-carbon development projects have been continuously implemented under the low-carbon society blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia. The selected village, Layang-Layang, is located within a palm oil plantation and is part of Malaysia rural transformation centre (RTC) project where a community-composting pilot plant was successfully set up in 2016. This study analysed the environmental and economic performance of the community-composting project. A total of four scenarios is analysed regarding their environmental performance (greenhouse gas emission) and the economic returns of investment. Scenario A served as the baseline study where all the municipal waste is sent to a landfill site. Scenario B involved the current pilot-scale composting plant practised by 100 residents in Layang-Layang. Scenario C considered the scaled-up composting scenario (3000 residents) based on the data from scenario A and B in Layang-Layang. Scenario D considered the treatment of the municipal wastes (3000 residents) to generate biogas via anaerobic digestion (AD) where the digestate was used for composting. In this study, co-composting of food waste from a residential area with the green waste from the plantation showed a reduction potential of 96.79% (Scenario C) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission as compared to the landfill (Scenario A) and a reduction of 99.67% on GHG emission for the integrated AD and composting system (Scenario D). The scaled-up composting in scenario C was more attractive for investment as compared to scenario D. Scenario C showed a shorter minimal year for the return of investment (3.09 years) as compared to Scenario D (6.17 years) with electricity generation from biogas.

This model is used to design supply chains minimizing total costs and reducing significantly carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide can be stored or utilized to produce methane through a power to gas system, where hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable power while methane is fed to the gas grid. The Mixed Integer Linear Program model is applied to design carbon systems developed for ten regions with major carbon dioxide emissions, while different saline aquifers are proposed as storage sites. Results show that the Adriatic sea is the most appropriate offshore storage site in the supply chain. This leads to a lower net methane production cost and to the lowest level of economic incentives as compared to other cases. The total costs of this supply chain are 7.34·104 million €/year (953 €/tonCO2 captured), and 16.1 Mton/year of methane are produced. The supply chain does not result economically favorable without substantial financial incentives (80 €/tonCO2 for carbon tax and 260 €/MWh economic incentive for methane production). Comparing supply chains that include simultaneous utilization and storage of carbon dioxide with a carbon capture and utilization supply chain (without storage) shows that the latter is economically less favorable. In addition to mitigation of carbon environmental impact for the whole Country, the large scale supply chain proposed here meets 35% of Italy's methane demand as a whole, a significant contribution to a global economic perspective, widely discussed nowadays, which should include self-sustainment elements at regional level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CCUS and CCU supply Chain; Mathematical model; Optimization; Reduction of CO2 emissions","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Forestry; Global warming; Hydrogeology; Integer programming; Methane; Offshore oil well production; Supply chains; Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic incentive; Electrolysis of waters; Financial incentives; Global economics; Methane production; Mixed integer linear program; Simultaneous utilization; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087329927

To resolve the issue, researchers have strived to reduce the emissions through combustion control. The heat release rate, or in-cylinder pressure information, is necessary to model engine-out emissions, and can also be used to optimize efficiency and emissions by controlling combustion and estimating torque for torque-based engine dynamic control. Piezoelectric pressure sensors are widely used. However, because of cost and durability issues, there have been studies which estimate the in-cylinder pressure using data available only from the engine control unit to reduce engine costs. Therefore, in this study, in-cylinder pressure was predicted, without additional pressure sensors, in light-duty diesel engines. A variable polytropic exponent model was first adopted during the compression stroke, assuming a polytropic process. A Wiebe function was then applied for describing cumulative heat release rate during the combustion phase. Using the in-cylinder pressure model, it was possible to calculate combustion-related parameters which are frequently used such as ignition delay, combustion duration, peaked pressure, and MFB50 (mass fraction burned: timing when 50% of the fuel is burned) without pressure sensors. Notwithstanding the simplification of the model which is targeting real-time applications, the model can predict the in-cylinder pressure at steady-state conditions. The pressure at the end of compression stroke, at start of main combustion timing, and when it has a peaked value by the main combustion were estimated with accuracy of R2 0.996, 0.993, and 0.956, respectively, in test engine. The model was also validated against a second engine. This study can contribute to emission models that need to calculate in-cylinder temperature using pressure data, and other studies to establish engine control strategies, including optimization through combustion control and torque prediction, which can be applied to engine dynamic control. © IMechE 2020.","Compression ignition engine; ignition delay; pressure prediction; Wiebe function; zero-dimensional model","Cost benefit analysis; Diesel engines; Ignition; Pressure sensors; Compression ignition engine; Cylinder temperatures; Engine control strategy; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Light-duty diesel engines; Piezoelectric pressure sensors; Real-time application; Steady-state condition; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085877890

Biogas products have different spatial structure varying on the level of centrality and dispersion of palm oil mill (POM), significantly impacting the transportation and total cost of biogas production. Pinch analysis provides systematic solution to industrial energy planning. However, the current pinch analysis lacks the ability to simultaneously consider CO2 emission target and to minimise cost for bioenergy supply chain. This study presents an integrated spatial and pinch analysis to determine the least cost energy mix to satisfy industrial energy demand and GHG emission target. The selection of cost-competitive energy substitution is evaluated based on supply cost factor constructed with spatial consideration, emission reduction to cost increase (ECI) ratio and emission reduction with cost decrease (ECD) values. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study to meet 120 MW of industrial energy demand in the state of Johor, Malaysia was presented. The results indicated that natural gas from grid extension and bio-compressed natural gas (BioCNG) with upgrading were required to achieve 30% GHG emission reduction.

Therefore, many policies to reduce air pollution have been established worldwide. Moreover, there has been a shift in policy and research attention from greenhouse gases, especially CO2, to other air pollutants. To address the current local environmental challenges, this research analyzes the non-greenhouse gas emissions inventory (CO, NOx, SOx, PM, VOC, and NH3) from ships in the second biggest port in Korea, the Port of Incheon (POI). A bottom-up activity-based methodology with real-time vessel activity data produced by the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is applied to obtain reliable estimations. NOx and SOx dominated the amount of emission emitted from ships. Tankers, general cargo ships, cruise ships, and container ships were identified as the highest sources of pollution. Based on the above results, this study discusses the need for long-term policies, such as the designation of a local emission control area (ECA) and the establishment of an emission management platform to reduce ship-source emissions. Furthermore, this study elucidates that significant emissions come from the docking process, ranging from 33.9% to 42.0% depending on the type of pollutant when only the auxiliary engines were being operated. Therefore, short-term solutions like applying exhausted gas cleaning systems, using on-shore power supplies, reducing docking time, or using greener alternative fuels (e.g., liquefied natural gas or biofuels) should be applied and motivated at the POI. These timely results could be useful for air quality management decision-making processes for local port operators and public agencies. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; In-port ship emission; Non-greenhouse gases; Vessel Traffic Service",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092646808

Cultured human epithelial cells obtained from inferior turbinate tissues were exposed to an urban PM (UPM) standard reference material (SRM 1648a). Intracellular ROS level and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and TJ proteins were examined. Expression level of phosphorylated (p)-Akt, p38, p65 were compared between exposed and unexposed cells. Cells were pretreated with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or Akt inhibitor MK-2206 before exposure to determine whether the changes in cellular ROS and TJ protein expression could be reversed. Exposure to UPM significantly increased ROS levels and inflammatory cytokine expression levels, and decreased expression of TJ proteins zonula occludins (ZO)-1, occludin, claudin-1, and E-cadherin.

This study aims to validate the feasibility of a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for commercial building in response to occupancy variations and time-variant electricity prices in comparison to a conventional rule-based control (RBC) strategy. The building energy system included an air-cooled chiller, stratified chilled water thermal energy storage, two fan coil units, three heat exchangers, and five pumps. The optimal operations of the chiller and storage system were determined with the goal of minimizing the operating cost while maintaining the zone temperature at a cooling set point temperature during cooling operation hours. Artificial neural network was utilized as prediction models and metaheuristics algorithm was employed as optimization solver to construct a reliable and computationally manageable MPC controller. The simulation was performed for four days during the cooling season with a confirmed optimal prediction time horizon of 24 h and a control timestep of 1 h intervals. In conclusion, MPC reduced the total operating cost by 3.4% compared to the RBC, which prioritized the storage system operation to manage the thermal load. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Building energy management; Metaheuristics; Model predictive control; Operation optimization; Thermal energy storage","Cooling; Cooling systems; Costs; Electric energy storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Office buildings; Operating costs; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Predictive control systems; Thermal energy; Air-cooled chillers; Building energy systems; Commercial building; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Operational strategies; Optimal predictions; Optimization solvers; Rule-based control; Model predictive control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089227150

Angiogenesis is a vital physiological process for the growth and development of cells and structures in the human body, whereby excessive or insufficient vessel growth could contribute to pathogenesis of diseases. We therefore evaluated indirect effects of carbon black (CB) and inhalable airborne particles on the angiogenic ability of unexposed Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by co-culturing HUVECs with pre-exposed Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAECs). As endothelial cells are major components of blood vessels and potential targets of fine particles, we investigated if lung epithelial cells exposed to ambient PM2.5 surrogates could induce bystander effects on neighboring unexposed endothelial cells in an alveolar-capillary co-culture lung model. Epithelial exposure to CB at a non-toxic dose of 25 μg/mL reduced endothelial tube formation and cell adhesion in co-cultured HUVECs, and decreased expression of angiogenic genes in SAECs. Similarly, exposure of differentiated SAECs to PM2.5 surrogates reduced cell reproductive ability, adhesion and tube formation of neighboring HUVECs. This indicates epithelial exposure to CB and urban PM2.5 surrogates both compromised the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells through bystander effects, thereby potentially perturbing the ventilation-perfusion ratio and affecting lung function. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Airborne fine particle; Angiogenesis; Carbon black; Endothelial tube formation; Respiratory function","carbon; carbon black; unclassified drug; black carbon; cell; health impact; modeling; particulate matter; physiology; public health; urban atmosphere; Article; blood vessel; bystander effect; cell adhesion; coculture; controlled study; endothelium cell; gene expression; human; human cell; lung function; lung ventilation perfusion ratio; particulate matter; urban area; air pollutant; cytology; drug effect; epithelium cell; lung; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); particulate matter; soot; toxicity; toxicity testing; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Air Pollutants; Coculture Techniques; Epithelial Cells; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Lung; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Particulate Matter; Soot; Toxicity Tests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087728117

However, these fish are threatened due to historical overfishing, disease, and reduced access to spawning rivers. Climate change may pose another challenge for salmon management. Therefore, we conducted a problem-framing study to explore the effects climate change may have on salmon and the socio-ecological system they are embedded within. Addressing this emerging issue will require the cooperation of diverse stakeholders and the integration of their knowledge and values in a contentious management context. Therefore, we conducted this problem framing as a participatory process with stakeholders, whose mental models and questionnaire responses form the basis of this study. By framing the climate change problem in this way, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the problem and incorporate stakeholder perspectives into the management process from an early stage to better address their concerns and establish common ground. We conclude that considering climate change is relevant for Baltic salmon management, although it may not be the most pressing threat facing these fish. Stakeholders disagree about whether climate change will harm or benefit salmon, when it will become a relevant issue in the Baltic context, and whether or not management efforts can mitigate any negative impacts climate change may have on salmon and their fishery. Nevertheless, by synthesizing the stakeholders' influence diagrams, we found 15 themes exemplifying: (1) how climate change may affect salmon, (2) goals for salmon management considering climate change, and (3) strategies for achieving those goals. Further, the stakeholders tended to focus on the riverine environment and the salmon life stages occurring therein, potentially indicating the perceived vulnerability of these life stages to climate change. Interestingly, however, the stakeholders tended to focus on traditional fishery management measures, like catch quotas, to meet their goals for these fish considering climate change. Further, social variables, like “politics,” “international cooperation,” and “employment” comprised a large proportion of the stakeholders' diagrams, demonstrating the importance of these factors for salmon management. © 2020","Atlantic salmon; Baltic Sea; Climate change; Cognitive maps; Expert elicitation; Mental models; Participatory modeling; Stakeholder engagement; Transdisciplinary research","Ecology; Fish; Fisheries; International cooperation; Common ground; Fishery management; Influence diagram; Management efforts; Management process; Participatory process; Problem framings; Socio-ecological systems; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; fishery management; holistic approach; participatory approach; salmonid fishery; stakeholder; Article; Baltic Sea; climate change; conceptual framework; controlled study; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental protection; experimental study; fishery; geographic distribution; methodology; nonhuman; priority journal; problem framing study; salmonine; animal; Baltic States; Salmo salar; Animals; Baltic States; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Salmon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087108918

Commonly overlooked aspects of industrial wastewater such as its fluctuating characteristics, selection of suitable sampling points, and adopting an appropriate treatment methodology are addressed. Different units in a drug-producing industry and chief ingredients at each stage were identified. An appropriate sampling point was finalized following a series of systematic and repeated samplings of prominent industrial locations, at different periods. High organic and solids strength industrial wastewater samples were characterized and subjected to various physico-chemical and oxidative techniques, namely electrocoagulation (EC), chemical coagulation, photocatalytic oxidation, electro-Fenton's (EF), Photo-Fenton's (PF), and Fenton's oxidation. The highest total organic carbon (TOC) reduction efficiencies about 47, 23, and 62 % were obtained from Fenton's oxidation for distinct samplings. The variation in quality of effluent heavily influences the treatment efficacies of individual treatment schemes. Hence, rigid treatment protocols are inadvisable to propose for industrial perspectives to handle diurnal variations in effluent characteristics.

We investigate impacts of air-cleaning on indoor TRAP levels and indoor chemistry in a renovated school adjacent an interstate highway. We monitor air pollutants pre- and post-renovation and quantify efficiency of particle (MERV8 and 16 filters) and gas (functionalized activated carbon) air-cleaning. Time-resolved measurements show air-cleaning systems are effective, with in situ particle removal efficiency >94% across 10 nm to 10 μm. Activated carbon removed BTEX and NO2 with variability in removal efficiency. Over eight months of monitoring, NO2 removal efficiency was 96% initially and decreased to 61%; and BTEX removal efficiency was >80% or increased to >80%. Air-cleaning reduced indoor TRAP to below or near urban background. Air-cleaning systems suppressed indoor chemistry by reducing indoor levels of oxidants (NO2, O3) and reactive organics of indoor origin. When the air cleaning system was inactive, our data show that indoor SOA formation within the school was elevated. Loss rates of NO2 and O3 through the air-cleaning system were ∼1.5-2.4 h-1 and ∼2.3 h-1, respectively. Air-cleaning was 83% and 69% efficient, respectively, in removing monoterpenes and isoprene. By suppressing precursors, scaling calculations show air-cleaning prevented ∼3.4 mg/h of indoor SOA formation due to indoor ozone-monoterpene chemistry. For comparison, we estimate that filtration removed ∼130 mg/h of PM0.01-0.3.

Despite being recognized as one of the main volcanic epicenters on the planet, the Vanuatu arc remains poorly characterized for its subaerial emissions and their chemical imprints. Here, we report on the first plume chemistry data for Mount Garet, on the island of Gaua, one of the few persistent volatile emitters along the Vanuatu arc. Data were collected with a multi-component gas analyzer system (multi-GAS) during a field campaign in December 2018. The average volcanic gas chemistry is characterized by mean molar CO2 /SO2, H2 O/SO2, H2 S/SO2 and H2 /SO2 ratios of 0.87, 47.2, 0.13 and 0.01, respectively. Molar proportions in the gas plume are estimated at 95.9 ± 11.6, 1.8 ± 0.5, 2.0 ± 0.01, 0.26 ± 0.02 and 0.06 ± 0.01, for H2 O, CO2, SO2, H2 S and H2 . Using the satellite-based 10-year (2005–2015) averaged SO2 flux of ~434 t d−1 for Mt. Garet, we estimate a total volatile output of about 6482 t d−1 (CO2 ~259 t d−1; H2 O ~5758 t d−1; H2 S ~30 t d−1; H2 ~0.5 t d−1 ). This may be representative of a quiescent, yet persistent degassing period at Mt. Garet; whilst, as indicated by SO2 flux reports for the 2009–2010 unrest, emissions can be much higher during eruptive episodes. Our estimated emission rates and gas composition for Mount Garet provide insightful information on volcanic gas signatures in the northernmost part of the Vanuatu Arc Segment. The apparent CO2-poor signature of high-temperature plume degassing at Mount Garet raises questions on the nature of sediments being subducted in this region of the arc and the possible role of the slab as the source of subaerial CO2 . In order to better address the dynamics of along-arc volatile recycling, more volcanic gas surveys are needed focusing on northern Vanuatu volcanoes. © 2020 by the authors.

It has been shown that the cultivation of catch crops may play an important role in the mitigation of CO2 emissions. A study on the importance of catch crops (in relation to the main crop) in carbon dioxide sequestration was conducted over the period of 2016-2018 under the soil and climatic conditions of the central Lublin region, Poland. Subsequently, ploughed-in catch crop biomass is a kind of ‘soil CO2 bank'. It was proven that in the case of successful catch crops one can expect carbon dioxide sequestration by these crop cultures to be at a level from 4 to 6 tons CO2 ha-yr-. The quantity of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere by a catch crop is directly proportional to biomass yield produced by it. The following species, which are resilient to adverse weather conditions during seeding and initial plant growth, proved to be particularly useful in carbon dioxide sequestration by catch crops: white mustard, tansy phacelia, winter rye, winter wheat + winter vetch mixture. Catch crops also positively affect the amount of soil organic C compared to soils where they are not grown. Based on the obtained study results, it can be tentatively stated that catch crops are an important factor in carbon dioxide sequestration in broadly understood agricultural activity. It is advisable to promote catch crops on a wide scale due to relatively small costs of such crops compared to the benefits arising from them (phytosanitary effects on soil, CO2 sequestration, and soil carbon storage). It is however necessary to conduct further research in this area in order to determine the suitability of specific catch crop species for CO2 sequestration in various climatic and soil zones. © 2020.

Findings: Income, urbanization, trade and financial development exert upward pressure on CO2 emissions. However, the interaction between urbanization and financial development reduces the emission of CO2. Furthermore, primary energy use, energy intensity, electricity consumption and fossil fuel consumption have positive effects on carbon emission, while combustible renewables and waste, and electricity production from natural gas have negative effects on carbon emission. Practical implications: The policy implication/recommendation indicates that the financial sector’s authorities can combat carbon emission by properly regulating the development and activities of the financial sector in urban areas in Tunisia. The promotion of the development and usage of cleaner energy is recommended to help reduce carbon emission. Policymakers need to promote environmentally friendly economic growth and development agenda. Originality/value: The contribution of this study to the environmental degradation literature is that it offers evidence from Tunisia, which has not received much empirical attention. It also examines the effect of various forms of energy usage on carbon emission. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to examine the interaction effect between urbanization and financial development on carbon emission. Also, if not the first, this study is among the earliest to use the principal component analysis as a part of the prediction of the carbon emission effect of energy variables. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Air pollution; CO2 emission; CO2 mitigation; Cointegration; Econometric; Energy sector; Financial development; Regression; Renewable energies","Economic analysis; Finance; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Global warming; Public policy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Carbon dioxide emissions; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity production; Electricity-consumption; Explanatory variables; Financial development; Ordinary least squares; Variance decomposition; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088572368

It is a pollutant, which influences all three spheres such as haze formation in the atmosphere, soil acidification in the lithosphere, and eutrophication in water bodies. Atmospheric NH3 reacts with sulfur (SOx) and nitrogen (NOx) oxides to form aerosols, which eventually affect human health and climate. Here, we present the seasonal and inter-annual variability of atmospheric NH3 over India in 2008–2016 using the IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite observations. We find that Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is one of the largest and rapidly growing NH3 hotspots of the world, with a growth rate of +1.2% yr−1 in summer (June–August: Kharif season), due to intense agricultural activities and presence of many fertilizer industries there. However, our analyses show insignificant decreasing trends in annual NH3 of about −0.8% yr−1 in all India, about −0.4% yr−1 in IGP, and −1.0% yr−1 in the rest of India. Ammonia is positively correlated with total fertilizer consumption (r = 0.75) and temperature (r = 0.5) since high temperature favors volatilization, and is anti-correlated with total precipitation (r = from −0.2, but −0.8 in the Rabi season: October–February) as wet deposition helps removal of atmospheric NH3. This study, henceforth, suggests the need for better fertilization practices and viable strategies to curb emissions, to alleviate the adverse health effects and negative impacts on the ecosystem in the region. On the other hand, the overall decreasing trend in atmospheric NH3 over India shows the positive actions, and commitment to the national missions and action plans to reduce atmospheric pollution and changes in climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; Agriculture; Ammonia; Climate change; IASI; India; Particulate matter","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Water pollution; Adverse health effects; Agricultural activities; Atmospheric pollution; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; Interannual variability; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal analysis; Growth rate; ammonia; fertilizer; acidification; aerosol composition; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); spatiotemporal analysis; adverse outcome; agricultural procedures; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental temperature; fertilizer application; high temperature; human; India; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; volatilization; wet deposition; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086632036

Such synthesized P- and F-co-doped carbon nitride displayed a well-defined mesoporous nanostructure and enhanced visible light absorption region up to infrared with higher BET surface area of 260.93 m2 g−1; the highest recorded value for phosphorus-doped carbon nitride materials. Moreover, the formation mechanism is delineated and the role of templates was found to be essential not only in increasing the surface area but also in facilitating the co-doping of P and F atoms. Co-doping helped to narrow the optical band gap to 1.8 eV, thus enabling an excellent photocatalytic activity for the aqueous reduction of carbon dioxide into methanol under visible-light irradiation, which is fifteen times higher (119.56 μmol g−1 h−1) than the bare carbon nitride.

The contaminated sites, specifically those located by coastal and equatorial regions, are at great risk in facing the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, since they are not designed considering those in mind. The climate change impacts that specifically affect site remediation may include sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, extreme precipitation, extreme wind, and wildfires. While the efforts toward incorporating sustainability in terms of the assessment of net environmental, economic, and social impacts and benefits in remediation design and implementation is increasing, the remediation approach must incorporate climate change resilience into planning, design, execution, operation, and maintenance of the remediation strategy. There are a few frameworks published in literature that address the incorporation of resiliency and climate change adaptation in contaminated site remediation design. This study presents an overview of some of these frameworks in the context of the United States and its current status quo regarding the environmental remediation to aid in resilient design of remediation strategies for the cleanup of contaminated sites. Further, a new quantitative approach to decision-making involving quantitative life cycle sustainability assessment and quantification of uncertainty in evaluating the feasibility of climate change adaptation measures for site-specific remedial designs is discussed.

National Action Plan for Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH) was prepared in 2018 with objective to strengthen health care services against adverse impact of climate change on health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) approved National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) under National Health Mission (NHM) in February 2019. The common Climate Sensitive Diseases (CSDs) are - air pollution related, heat related, water-borne, vector-borne, cardiopulmonary diseases, mental health, food-borne, nutrition related illnesses etc. Currently the three key areas of focus for NPCCHH include air pollution, heat related illnesses and creation of green and climate resilient healthcare facilities. Air Pollution and Human Health: Acute Respiratory Illnesses (ARI) surveillance in context of air pollution was started in year 2017 in Delhi. Key Strategy in coming years are to expand ARI surveillance in all polluted cities of States, developing State/District/Cities level health sector adaptation plan for air pollution and health. Heat and Human Health: Since 2015, heat related illnesses (HRI) surveillance was started from heat vulnerable States of India. Key Strategies in coming year are strengthening the surveillance, standardizing the investigation of deaths due to suspected heat stroke cases, developing State/ District/ City specific heat and health action plan, increasing public awareness and community outreach, developing measures for early warning system/ alerts and response at State, district and below district level.

Inevitably, this strategy promises a feasible, responsible, and sustainable post-mining management, because 200 years of coal mining have created numerous challenges necessary to tend to once the mining ends. Thus, the Research Institute for Post-Mining (FZN) at the TH Georg Agricola University in Bochum, Germany, has developed a holistic approach to meet these post-mining challenges including further expertise present at our university. Here, the four strategic research pillars are (1) technical geoecology and hydrogeology to avoid and mitigate risks underground, (2) geomonitoring to evaluate and protect the surface, (3) industrial heritage preservation and engineering to secure and reuse brownfields such as mine sites, and (4) economic transformation planning of mining regions to enable a prosper future for generations to come.

Adopting this synergistic approach can improve crop yields and profitability more sustainably, enhance livelihoods and mitigate climate change. Using spatially explicit data generated through a public participatory geographic information system methodology (n = 37), complemented by spatial analysis, interviews (n = 68) and focus group discussions (n = 4), we explored the synergies between participatory farmer-to-farmer agroecology knowledge sharing, farm-level decisions and their links with macro-level prioritization of conservation strategies. We mapped farm conditions and ecosystem services (ES) of two village areas with varying knowledge systems about farming. Results of the farm-level analysis revealed variations in spatial perception among farmers, differences in understanding the dynamics of crop growth and varying priorities for extension services based on agroecological knowledge. The ES use pattern analysis revealed hotspots in the mapped ES indicators with similarities in both village areas. Despite the similarities in ES use, priorities for biodiversity conservation align with farmers’ understanding of farm processes and practices. Farmers with training in agroecology prioritized strategies that are ecologically friendly while farmers with no agroecology training prioritized the use of strict regulations. Importantly, the results show that agroecology can potentially contribute to biodiversity conservation and food security, with climate change mitigation co-benefits.

Results: We developed a new mathematical model that describes the dynamic control of time to flowering by daily values of maximal and minimal temperature, precipitation, day length and solar radiation. We obtained model parameters by adaptation to the available experimental data. The models were validated by cross-validation and used to demonstrate that the phenology of adaptive traits, like flowering time, is strongly predicted not only by local environmental factors but also by plant geographic origin and genotype. Conclusions: Of local environmental factors maximal temperature appeared to be the most critical factor determining how faithfully the model describes the data.

To make an economic assessment of the effectiveness of the environmental tax system in European countries. The hypothetical question is how and when changes in (increasing or decreasing) the rates of different types of environmental taxes affect the pollution of the environment. Methodology. To evaluate economically the effectiveness of the environmental taxation system, the article uses the method of crosscorrelation between indicators in European countries. findings. The effectiveness of environmental taxes depends on the tax base, tax rates, the evolution of taxes, and tax policy. The design of environmental taxes and their implementation differs across countries within the EU. According to the research conducted, two groups of countries can be distinguished in the EU taking into account polar trends of environmental taxation development. The first group of the countries shows the downward trend in environmental taxes - the annual average of the total environmental tax revenue in these countries today is below its base value in 2008 (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Norway, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Sweden, Iceland, Malta, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). The second group of the countries shows a clear upward trend in environmental taxes ranging (Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, France, Poland). originality. Depending on the time lag symbol and the direction of crosscorrelation, there are four groups of countries within the environmental policy. The first cluster includes countries in which environmental policy instruments such as air pollution fees and resource use charges are quite effective (Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia). The second cluster includes countries in which the environmental tax increase was accompanied by an increase in CO2 emissions (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary). In the third group of countries deterioration of the environmental situation is not a motivator for increasing the environmental taxation burden (Lithuania, Greece). The fourth cluster demonstrates that deterioration of the environmental situation in the country motivates to increase the environmental taxation burden (Bulgaria, Spain). Practical value. The data obtained indirectly indicate that the dependencies between the time series we investigated are likely to be nonlinear in nature, which the found crosscorrelation coefficients cannot detect. The research demonstrates the high probability of the existence of diametrically opposite interdependencies between the studied variables for different groups of countries. © 2020 Natsional'nyi Hirnychyi Universytet.

Lichen samples were analyzed for trace elements and Pb and Nd isotopes to evaluate the impact of various anthropogenic sources of pollution on the atmospheric chemistry, and to determine the relative contribution of each source to the atmospheric toxic metal budget. Additionally, atmospheric particulate matter (PM) from the vicinity of the principal pollutant sources was analyzed for trace metal and Pb isotopic composition, as well as scanning electron microscopy, to characterize the most recent emissions. Pb isotopic ratios of the lichen samples fall along a 2-component mixing line between background and traffic related emissions, and do not clearly resolve steel production related emissions, as they are isotopically similar to the background signature, and are inconsistent in 208Pb/206Pb – 207Pb/206Pb space with a significant contribution from coal/fly ash. Nd isotopes, however, provide clear evidence for particulate matter released by the steel industry, including coal/fly ash, because the εNd values of steel-related emissions are distinct from that of the background and traffic emissions. The results highlight the importance of using a multi-tracer approach when investigating the sources of atmospheric pollutants in mixed-use areas. The PM samples differ in composition from those of the lichens collected in the same general location. This indicates that the composition of atmospheric PM varies through time, as the lichen samples preserve particulate matter emitted over the past several decades, whereas the PM samples represent ~1 month in the past year. It is important to consider this difference when evaluating the impact of potential legacy pollution, as current PM emissions may not be representative of past emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric PM; Lichen biomonitoring; Nd isotopes; Pb isotopes; Steel plant emissions","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Budget control; Chemical analysis; Coal; Coal industry; Fossil fuel power plants; Fungi; Isotopes; Lead metallography; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Scanning electron microscopy; Steelmaking; Trace elements; Tracers; Anthropogenic sources; Atmospheric particulate matter; Atmospheric pollutants; Coal-fired power plant; Isotopic composition; Multi-tracer approach; Relative contribution; Traffic-related emissions; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; coal; fly ash; lichen; particulate matter; Middletown; Ohio; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089286362

With data on coal plant locations, atmospheric conditions, and census demographics, we estimate exposure to coal plant emissions using models that predict emission transportation. We find that ethnic and poor populations are more likely to be exposed to coal pollution.

As an approach to identify effective future land-use strategies, this study applied spatially explicit modeling that addresses the spatial connectivity between the provision of ecosystem services and agricultural land-use systems. Considering that the status of ecosystem services varies with the perception of stakeholders, local knowledge, and characteristics of a case study area, two adjoining districts in northern Ghana were integrated into an assessment process of land-use strategies. Based on agricultural land-management options that were identified together with the local stakeholders, 75 future land-use strategies as combinations of multiple agricultural practices were elaborated. Potential impacts of the developed land-use strategies on ecosystem services and land-use patterns were assessed in a modeling platform that combines Geographic Information System (GIS) and Cellular Automaton (CA) modules. Modeled results were used to identify best land-use strategies that could deliver multiple ecosystem services most effectively. Then, local perception was applied to determine the feasibility of the best land-use strategies in practice. The results presented the different extent of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services delivered by future land-use strategies and their different feasibility depending on the district. Apart from the fact that findings were context-specific and scale-dependent, this study revealed that the integration of different local characteristics and local perceptions to spatially explicit ecosystem service assessment is beneficial for determining locally tailored recommendations for future agricultural land-use planning. © 2020 by the authors.

In this context, the development of artificial catalysts that promote these reactions is an important research target. In nature, metalloenzymes that contain multinuclear metal complexes as active sites are known to efficiently catalyze reactions under mild conditions. Therefore, using multinuclear metal complexes as artificial catalysts can be an attractive strategy for small-molecule conversions involving multielectron transfer processes. However, multinuclear-metal-complex-based catalysts for these reactions have not been well established. In this Account, we describe our recent advances in the development of multinuclear metal complexes as catalysts for small-molecule conversion, mainly focusing on water oxidation. As small-molecule conversions involving multielectron transfer processes consists of two essential processes, (1) the transfer of multiple electrons and (2) the formation/cleavage of covalent bond(s), catalysts for these reactions should facilitate both steps. Therefore, we assumed that the assembly of redox-active metal ions and the cooperative effect of neighboring coordinatively unsaturated metal ions can promote these processes. On the basis of this assumption, we employed a pentanuclear metal complex as a molecular scaffold for the catalyst. The scaffold has a pentanuclear structure with quasi-D3 symmetry and consists of a [M3(μ3-X)] core (X = O2- or OH-) wrapped by two [M(μ-bpp)3] units (Hbpp = 3,5-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazole). The metal ions in the triangular core are coordinatively unsaturated, whereas the metal ions at the apical positions are coordinatively saturated. In other words, the pentanuclear scaffold possesses multiple redox-active centers and coordinatively unsaturated sites. It should also be noted that the electron transfer ability of the complex changes dramatically depending on the identity of the constituent metal ions. The iron derivative of the pentanuclear scaffold was found to serve as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation (2H2O → O2 + 4e- + 4H+) with a high reaction rate and excellent robustness. The substitution of metal ions in the pentanuclear scaffold to cobalt ions resulted in the development of a catalyst for CO2 reduction. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of substituents on the ligands of the pentanuclear iron complex and succeeded in precisely manipulating the electron transfer possess. These results clearly demonstrate that the pentanuclear scaffold is an attractive platform for catalysts for small-molecule conversions. Additionally, the intrinsic features of the multinuclear catalytic system, which are totally different from those of conventional mononuclear-metal-complex-based catalysts, are disclosed. In reactions mediated by multinuclear complexes, the multinuclear core can initially accumulate the charge required for catalysis to reach the catalytically active state. Subsequently, the catalyst in the active state reacts with the substrate, initiating electron transfer to the substrate and rearrangement of covalent bonds in the substrate to afford the product. In such a mechanism, the desired number of electrons can be transferred to the substrates in an on-demand fashion, and the formation of undesired chemical species in the targeted catalysis may be prevented. This feature of multinuclear-metal-complex-based catalysts will achieve demanding small-molecule conversions with a high reaction rate, selectivity, and durability. ©",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091904811

Woody flora is ancient and original and is determined by the interpenetration and interaction of various floras and plant communities in different past geologic times. It is composed of plant species both young and old relict species. In terms of their biodiversity, these forests occupy one of the leading positions in the world, and the stock of wood volume accumulated in these forests is an important component in regulating the balance of carbon storage and its release. Haphazard logging of these forests for half a century, the collapse of the fire protection system, the lack of proper and scientifically-based methods and ways of forest care have led to the fact that these unique plantings are currently on the verge of disaster and are losing their environmental and climate-forming functions. The case in point is the natural disasters that occur throughout the Far Eastern Federal district. The purpose of the research was to study the features of the natural renewal process of Fraxinus mandshurica to determine the silvicultural prospects for its use, to identify the planting areas suitable for growing this species in accordance with the order of the RF Ministry of Natural Resources dated March 25, 2019 No. 188 “Concerning Approval of the Rules for reforestation, the procedure for developing a reforestation project and making changes on it”. The Fraxinus tree, thanks to its powerful root system, is a well wind-resistant species and performs soil-protecting and shore-strengthening functions. In addition, it has a valuable wood that has a high cost both on the domestic and on the external market. At the same time, Fraxinus is very plastic to the conditions of the urban environment and can be used to create green areas around cities (Razlomiy et al. 2020).

During the 20th century substantial areas of northern peatlands were drained to repurpose the land for industrial or agricultural use. Drained peatlands have dysfunctional microbial communities, which can lead to net carbon emissions. Rewetting of drained peatlands is therefore an environmental priority, yet our understanding of the effects of peatland drainage and rewetting on microbial communities is still incomplete. Here we summarize the last decade of research into the response of the wider microbial community, methane-cycling microorganisms, and micro-fauna to drainage and rewetting in fens and bogs in Europe and North America. Emphasis is placed on current research methodologies and their limitations. We propose targets for future work including: accounting for timescale of drainage and rewetting events; better vertical and lateral coverage of samples across a peatland; the integration of proteomic and metabolomic datasets into functional community analysis; the use of RNA sequencing to differentiate the active community from legacy DNA; and further study into the response of the viral and micro-faunal communities to peatland drainage and rewetting. This review should benefit researchers embarking on studies in wetland microbiology and non-microbiologists working on peatland drainage and rewetting in general. © Copyright © 2020 Kitson and Bell.","climate change mitigation; fens and bogs; microbial communities and soil quality; peatland drainage; peatland restoration; peatland rewetting; soil metagenomics","RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteroidetes; biogeochemistry; bioinformatics; carbon cycling; climate change; community dynamics; community structure; Cyperaceae; denitrification; ectomycorrhiza; environmental factor; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; fauna; gene sequence; greenhouse effect; humic substance; land drainage; marine environment; metagenomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial degradation; microbial diversity; microbiology; microbiome; nonhuman; oxygen saturation; peatland; photosynthesis; Proteobacteria; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Review; Rhizaria; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; simple sequence repeat; soil chemistry; soil quality; wetland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095998488

An interesting contrast can be drawn with the field of air pollution and health, which has been an active and well-supported research area for almost fifty years. My own career journey started squarely in the latter setting in the 1980s, but transitioned to a major focus on climate and health starting around 2000. The journey has been punctuated with opportunities and obstacles, most of which still exist. In the meantime, a large body of evidence has grown on the health impacts of climate change, adding more urgency to the imperative for action. Institutionalization of climate and health within the federal regulatory and funding apparatus is now needed if we are to make the transition to zero carbon in ways that maximize health and equity benefits. © 2020 by the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091482961

Herein, we report a phytic acid (PA)-assisted in situ-formed amorphous cobalt phosphate/carbon (CoPi/C) composite grown on a flexible woven carbon cloth (CC) via a simple one-step carbonization approach. The tunable synthesis of amorphous and crystalline composites is shown by simply controlling the concentration of the cobalt salts. The strategy for high mass loading to 12 mg cm-2 is also shown in this report. Importantly, the resulting amorphous electrode materials exhibit electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) behavior that works over a wide potential range from -1.4 to +0.5 V in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (2 M KOH) and from -1.5 to +1.5 V in sodium sulfate (1 M Na2SO4). The amorphous electrode as an anode is capable of delivering an areal capacitance up to 2.15 F cm-2 at a current density of 4 mA cm-2 (gravimetric capacitance up to 606.1 F g-1 at 1 Ag-1) and has a retention of 94.2% at 10 000 cycles. The flexible solid-state symmetric device fabricated shows an energy density of approximately 620.0 μW h cm-2 at a power density of 4.7 mW cm-2 (31.1 W h kg-1 at 476.0 W kg-1).

Building energy accounts for 40% of the world's energy consumption and accounts for 33% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. This study applied the LEAP (Long-range energy alternatives planning) model and Bass diffusion method for predicting the total energy consumption and GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions from the residential and commercial building sector of Sejong City in South Korea. Then, using the Bass diffusion model, three scenarios were analyzed (REST: Renewable energy supply target, BES: Building energy saving, BEP: Building energy policy) for GHG reduction. The GHG emissions for Sejong City for 2015-2030 were analyzed, and the past and future GHG emissions of the city were predicted in a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. In the REST scenario, the GHG emissions would attain a 24.5% reduction and, in the BES scenario, the GHG emissions would attain 12.81% reduction by 2030. Finally, the BEP scenario shows the potential for a 19.81% GHG reduction. These results could be used to guide the planning and development of the new city. © 2020 by the authors.","Building energy policy; Building energy saving; CO2 emission; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Long-range energy alternatives planning system (LEAP); Renewable energy supply target","Climate change; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Office buildings; Bass Diffusion Model; Building energy policies; Building energy saving; Commercial building; Government reports; Planning and development; Renewable energies; Total energy consumption; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093867124

Additionally, this paper examines the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The result of the DAG reveals that total biomass energy consumption and GDP have a unidirectional contemporaneous causal relationship with total energy CO2 emissions. Based on the results of the ARDL, we find that a 1% increase in per capita total biomass energy consumption causes a 0.65% reduction in per capita total energy CO2 emissions in the long-run. This finding implies that expanding the usage of biomass is one way to reduce and control greenhouse gases in the US. Moreover, we find that the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis is satisfied for the US case.

Thus, local mini-grids deployment seems to be an attractive solution for scaling up access to electricity in these areas far from the main grid. The currently implemented mini-grids worldwide rely almost entirely on fossil fuel-based Power Generation Systems (PGSs). However, the high operational expenditure and the harmful impact on the environment associated with the use of these sources are increasingly inciting countries to promote the Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) integration into those power generation systems for a more sustainable and more extended electricity supply. In this context, the paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of the Hybrid Power Generation System (HPGS) concept application for mini-grids as well as a novel survey that analyses feedbacks from centralized PV system integration into existing fossil fuel-based PGSs achieved projects worldwide. Then, recent key figures of the Great Algerian South mini-grids and the experience of storage-less PV capacities integration into the fossil fuel-based PGSs feeding three of them are for the first time introduced. The analysis of the 2019-year operation data of the HPGSs thus formed reveals the positive outcomes retrieved from this first experience in terms of fuel saving and CO2 emissions reduction despite the proven low PV penetration level. Given the high solar PV energy potential characterizing the Great Algerian South localities, the performed overview and experiences assessment may provide an incentive for decision makers to pursue undertaking such hybridization projects and to prospect additional options that may increase the achievable PV penetration levels and thus further reduce the dependency of those localities on costly and polluting fossil fuel sources. Hence, the findings of this study will hopefully be beneficial to other mini-grid cases for either new construction or retrofitting projects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbone dioxide emissions; Fuel saving; Hybrid power generation system; Mini-grid; PV penetration; Storage-less","Decision making; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy policy; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Renewable energy resources; Attractive solutions; Fossil fuel-based power generation; Hybrid power generation systems; Impact on the environment; Operational expenditures; Power generation systems; Renewable energy source; Rural and remote areas; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088288304

However, climate incorporates wide varieties of variables and serves as a cumulative process. In the present research, the number of 197 climatic parameters were selected and evaluated drawing upon data from the Iranian Meteorological Organization at 164 selected stations during the period of 1981 to 2018. After accuracy verification (by statistics of reliable synoptic stations in the area), such parameters were applied to develop a database. Then, upon reviewing of the library documents while considering the effective climatic elements in the formation and distribution of vegetation in different regions of Iran, finally 137 climatic variables were identified, in turn used as input data to perform factor analysis in SPSS software. Such variables greatly affect the climate of each region, and in fact, are determinant factors of the climate in each area. Subsequently, cluster analysis was performed on climatic factors obtained from the factor analysis method. According to the results, throughout the Iran, nine factors of temperature, relative humidity, cold season rainfall, warm-season rainfall, wind speed, semi-cloudy days, thunderstorm and snowy day with eigenvalues greater than one were 29.71, 22.32, 9.58, 7.52, 6.22, 6.80, 4.25, 3.69, 2.22%, respectively and totally accounted for 92.35% of the variance the data. Cluster analysis was an important step in determining the number of homogeneous clusters in this study. For this, the wards method was applied. First, by GIS software, the whole of Iran was divided into two climatic zones, and the climatic factors separating Iran into two zones were identified. Then two areas were divided into three sub-areas and this was continued until the final stage and at each stage, the factors separating the climatic zones were identified. By the final stage, it means stage at which the number of suitable and final zones is obtained. Subsequently, we reached from the climatic zone of 25 to zone of 26, so that all suitable climate zones of Iran were obtained by cluster analysis. While we proceeded from the zoning phase of 26 to 27 and up, it had no effect on climate factors, and no factor was identified as a separating factor of climatic zones. Eventually, based on the multivariate statistical methods, 26 bio-climatic zones for Iran was obtained. Then, the overall vegetation map of Iran was networked by the kriging method and matched to the Iranian map of climatic zones. And exactly the dominant vegetation types were studied and introduced within each climatic zones. Finally, the results of the multivariate statistical method were compared with those of the traditional Pabout method and the weaknesses and strengths of the Pabout method and also multivariate statistical methods used in the bio-climatic zonation of Iran were investigated. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bioclimatic classification; Climatic factors; Cluster analysis; Geographical information system; Pabout classification; Wards method","Cluster analysis; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Factor analysis; Rain; Separation; Statistics; Vegetation; Wind; Zoning; Classification approach; Climatic parameters; Climatic variables; Determinant factors; Factor analysis method; Homogeneous cluster; Multivariate statistical method; Warm season rainfall; Multivariant analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100777683

Urban farming can significantly protect urban lands while balancing the natural environment for self-reliant food production. The essential need for a tool able to quantify and evaluate the performance of the urban farm's sustainable food production has persuaded us to develop the Sustainable Urban Farming Index Assessment (SUFIA) Model. The research has applied the critical literature review and identified three criteria and fifteen sub-criteria handling sustainable farming, and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) measured the weights. AHP revealed reducing air pollution (WC1.1.=29.3224), soil health and water cleaning (WC1.2.=29.2454), and food sovereignty (WC3.1.=25.6442) are critical in food productivity.

These assessments often contain reference values for cancer and/or noncancer effects. Increasingly, the use of systematic review methods are preferred when developing these assessments. Systematic evidence maps are a type of analysis that has the potential to be very helpful in the update process, especially when combined with machine-learning software advances designed to expedite the process of conducting a review. Objectives: To evaluate the applicability of evidence mapping to determine whether new evidence is likely to result in a change to an existing health reference value, using inhalation exposure to the air pollutant acrolein as a case example. Methods: New literature published since the 2008 California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) Reference Exposure Level (REL) for acrolein was assessed. Systematic review methods were used to search the literature and screening included the use of machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify studies that characterized acute and chronic exposure and could be informative for hazard characterization. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were briefly summarized before their suitability for chronic point of departure (POD) derivation and calculation of a reference value was considered. Studies considered potentially suitable underwent a targeted evaluation to determine their suitability for use in dose–response analysis. Results: Over 15,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Both machine-learning and manual screening processes were used to identify 60 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Most of these PECO-relevant studies were short-term exposure animal studies (acute or less than 1 month of exposure) and considered less suitable for deriving a chronic reference value when compared to the subchronic study in rats used in the 2008 OEHHA assessment. Thirteen epidemiological studies were identified but had limitations in the exposure assessment that made them less suitable for dose–response compared to the subchronic rat study. Among the 13 studies, there were four controlled trial studies that have the potential to be informative for future acute reference value derivation. Thus, the 2008 subchronic rat study used by OEHHA appears to still be the most appropriate study for chronic reference value derivation. In addition, advances in dosimetric modeling for gases, including new evidence pertinent to acrolein, could be considered when updating existing acrolein toxicity values. Conclusions: Evidence mapping is a very useful tool to assess the need for updating an assessment based on understanding the potential impact of new studies on revising an existing health reference value. In this case example, the focus was to identify studies suitable for chronic exposure dose–response analysis, while also identifying studies that may be important to consider for acute exposure scenarios, hazard identification, or for future research. This allows the evidence map to be a useful resource for a range of decision-making contexts. Specialized systematic review software increased the efficiency of the process in terms of human resources and time to conduct the analysis. © 2020","Evidence map; Hazard characterization; Hazardous air pollutant; Risk assessment; Systematic review","Aldehydes; Decision making; Environmental Protection Agency; Health; Health hazards; Herbicides; Machine learning; Mapping; Rats; Risk assessment; California Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental health; Epidemiological studies; Hazard identification; Human health risk assessment; Machine learning software; Office of environmental health hazard assessments; Short-term exposure; Health risks; acrolein; acrolein; aldehyde; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; dose-response relationship; epidemiology; hazard assessment; health geography; literature review; machine learning; pollution effect; pollution exposure; reference sample; research work; software; air pollutant; California; chemical analysis; chronic toxicity; data analysis software; dosimetry; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental protection; health hazard; inhalation; machine learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nonhuman; practice guideline; priority journal; reference value; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; animal; environmental health; rat; reference value; Animalia; Rattus; Acrolein; Air Pollutants; Animals; Environmental Health; Rats; Reference Values; Risk Assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088106760

Biomass sorghum has been suggested as a genetically and agronomically tractable feedstock species to augment near-term cellulosic feedstock production. This study used DayCent modeling to investigate biomass sorghum production emissions relative to corn with and without stover utilization at 3,265 across the rainfed United States. Sorghum produced greater average feedstock dry matter (15.6 ± 1.4 vs 14.8 ± 2.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and slightly lower estimated ethanol energy yields (10.6 ± 1.0 vs 11.8 ± 2.9 MJ m-2 yr-1) as corn grain with 75% stover collection. The high biomass removals in both the sorghum and corn stover scenarios led to soil organic carbon losses on 90 and 100% of sites, respectively. Average feedstock production emissions intensities were similar between sorghum and corn with 75% stover removal (17.6 ± 2.8 vs 18.8 ± 3.0 g CO2e MJ-1), but were notably lower under sorghum for sites in the southwestern study region (13.6 ± 3.0 vs 22.5 ± 3.1 g CO2e MJ-1). These results suggest that biomass sorghum produces cellulosic feedstock with similar emissions to corn grain and at current yield levels is unlikely to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard emissions reduction threshold for cellulosic biofuels. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Biofuels; Biomass; Emission control; Energy policy; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Organic carbon; Biomass removal; Cellulosic biofuels; Cellulosic feedstocks; Emissions intensity; Emissions reduction; Feedstock production; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Soil organic carbon; Cellulosic ethanol; alcohol; organic carbon; biofuel; carbon; biomass; greenhouse gas; maize; simulation; sorghum; Article; bioenergy; biomass; controlled study; drought tolerance; energy yield; fertilizer application; grain yield; greenhouse gas; high temperature; leaching; maize; nonhuman; plant residue; precipitation; sorghum; soybean; volatilization; biomass; greenhouse effect; soil; United States; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon; Greenhouse Effect; Soil; Sorghum; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092681742

We propose that the role of land management practices—from intensive forestry to allowing passive afforestation of abandoned lands—have played a major role in the growth of the terrestrial carbon sink in the decades since the mid twentieth century. The Forest Transition, a historic transition from shrinking to expanding forests, and from sparser to denser forests, has seen an increase of biomass and carbon across large regions of the globe. We propose that the contribution of Forest Transitions to the terrestrial carbon sink has been underestimated. Because forest growth is slow and incremental, changes in the carbon density in forest biomass and soils often elude detection. Measurement technologies that rely on changes in two-dimensional ground cover can miss changes in forest density. In contrast, changes from abrupt and total losses of biomass in land clearing, forest fires and clear cuts are easy to measure. Land management improves over time providing important present contributions and future potential to climate change mitigation. Appreciating the contributions of Forest Transitions to the sequestering of atmospheric carbon will enable its potential to aid in climate change mitigation. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 ± 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 ± 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 ± 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 ± 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0–100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%–53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","blue carbon; carbon stocks; climate change mitigation; coastal wetlands; salt marsh; seagrass; tidal forest","buffer zone; carbon storage; climate change; coastal wetland; global change; saltmarsh; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States; carbon; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; North America; soil; United States; wetland; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; North America; Northwestern United States; Soil; United States; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089185406

However, not only has it proved challenging to identify such systems, it also remains uncertain whether the low-redshift LyC leakers are truly 'analogues' of the sources that reionized the Universe. Here, we use high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations to examine whether simulated galaxies in the epoch of reionization share similar emission line properties to observed LyC leakers at z ∼3 and z ∼0. We find that the simulated galaxies with high LyC escape fractions (fesc) often exhibit high O32 and populate the same regions of the R23-O32 plane as z ∼3 LyC leakers. However, we show that viewing angle, metallicity, and ionization parameter can all impact where a galaxy resides on the O32-fesc plane. Based on emission line diagnostics and how they correlate with fesc, lower metallicity LyC leakers at z ∼3 appear to be good analogues of reionization-era galaxies. In contrast, local [S ii]-deficient galaxies do not overlap with the simulated high-redshift LyC leakers on the S ii Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram; however, this diagnostic may still be useful for identifying leakers. We use our simulated galaxies to develop multiple new diagnostics to identify LyC leakers using infrared and nebular emission lines. We show that our model using only [C ii]158 μm and [O iii]88 μm can identify potential leakers from non-leakers from the local Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Finally, we apply this diagnostic to known high-redshift galaxies and find that MACS 1149_JD1 at z = 9.1 is the most likely galaxy to be actively contributing to the reionization of the Universe. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","dark ages, reionization, first stars; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: star formation; H ii regions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094563648

In order to create this map, DESI will obtain spectroscopic redshifts of over 30 million objects; among them, a majority are [O ii] emitting star-forming galaxies known as emission-line galaxies (ELGs). These ELG targets will be pre-selected by drawing a selection region on the g-r versus r-z colour-colour plot, where high-redshift ELGs form a separate locus from the lower redshift ELGs and interlopers. In this paper, we study the efficiency of three ELG target selection algorithms-the Final Design Report (FDR) cut based on the DEEP2 photometry, Number Density Modelling (NDM) and Random Forest-to determine how the combination of these three algorithms can be best used to yield a simple selection boundary that will be best suited to meet DESI's science goals. To do this, we selected 17 small patches in the DESI footprint where we run the three target selection algorithms to pre-select ELGs based on their photometry. We observed the pre-selected ELGs using the MMT Binospec, which is similar in functionality to the DESI instrument, to obtain their spectroscopic redshifts and fluxes of 1054 ELGs. By analysing the redshift and fluxing distribution of these galaxies, we find that although NDM performed the best, simple changes in the FDR definition would also yield sufficient performance. © 2020 The Author(s).","catalogues; cosmology: observations; methods: observational",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097368972

In addition to the growing demand for feedstocks that are converted into products (such as plastics and fertilizers), climate policies that penalize GHG emissions may incentivize a switch from burning natural gas and oil to their feedstock use. Using an enhanced version of the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, we examine several scenarios to assess natural gas and oil use as feedstock and find that global feedstock use grows 2–3 times by 2050 relative to 2015 levels. In a scenario consistent with reaching 2 °C goal set by the Paris Agreement, the share of natural gas used as a feedstock grows from about 5% in 2015 to about 15% in 2050 and the share of oil used as a feedstock grows from about 10% in 2015 to about 17% in 2050. In this scenario, the share of natural gas used as a feedstock in 2050 is 86% larger than in the no-policy Reference. The corresponding increase in a share of oil used as a feedstock is 40%.

Almost 85% of the primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it is necessary to reduce carbon footprints to protect environment from the way of production and consumption of energy. To overcome this, adoption of a poly-generation system is the most effective way. It can be said as one of the most effective method to enhance energy efficiency, reduce energy consumption and control environmental pollution. It is the combination of several renewable energy using systems in a way that the output of one system becomes the input for another. Also, a number of utility outputs are obtained. This way, the amount of useful energy in the given amount of input is harnessed to a maximum extent, thus maintaining a very high energy efficiency. In this present work, our objective is to propose a techno-economical and techno-feasible polygeneration system for the selected three villages by using Homer Pro software. For this number of renewable energy systems like solar PV, biomass, hydrokinetic systems, wind turbine, hydrogen etc. are combined in an optimal way suitable for 3 different villages in south India. This is done by taking into account the availability of resources in the corresponding geographic area and also the utility products/outputs and deliverables on demand with the aid of an energy software called Homer Pro. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Economic feasibility; Poly-generation system, Deliverables; Renewable energy","Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Pollution control; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Environmental pollutions; Polygeneration system; Primary energies; Production and consumption; Reduce energy consumption; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy using; Very high energies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096357395

In this paper, the authors take a critical look at these behavioural approaches and call for a more dynamic, practice-oriented understanding of long-term changes in sustainable food consumption and supply. Design/methodology/approach: This approach is based on the experiences from a long-term experiment promoting sustainable eating in a workplace lunch restaurant using a series of informational and nudging techniques. In the experiment, the authors found that focussing solely on eating behaviours did not help to capture the multi-level change processes mobilised. The authors therefore propose a more dynamic, practice-oriented methodology for examining long-term changes in sustainable eating. The emprical data of the experiment are based on qualitative and quantitative data, consisting of customer survey, customer and kitchen personnel focus group discussions and monitoring data on the use of food items in the restaurant and their climate impacts. Findings: The results draw attention to a series of practical challenges restaurants face when promoting sustainable eating. Directing analytical attention to tinkering helped to reveal the tensions brought about by labelling and nudging in menu planning and recipe development. The results show how tinkering required attentiveness to customers' wishes in both cases. Nudging offered more freedom for the restaurant to develop menus and recipes. In the case scrutinised, however, nudging customers towards tastier and more satiating vegetarian dishes included the use of dairy. This partly watered down the climate benefits gained from reduced meat consumption. Originality/value: Rather than looking separately at changes in consumer behaviour and in the supply of food, the authors show how we need analytical concepts that enable the evaluation of their mutual evolution. Tinkering can assist us in this endeavour. Its adaptive, adjustive character, however, calls for caution. The development of praxis in food services and catering requires critical companions from the transdisciplinary research community. Research can provide systematic knowledge on the impacts of labels and nudges on kitchen praxis. However, research itself also needs to tinker and learn from experiments. This necessitates long-term speculative research strategies. © 2020, Minna Kaljonen, Marja Salo, Jari Lyytimäki and Eeva Furman.","Experimentation; Labelling; Lunch restaurant; Nudging; Sustainable eating; Tinkering","article; attention; case report; climate; clinical article; consumer attitude; feeding behavior; human; interdisciplinary research; meat consumption; restaurant; tension; vegetarian; workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088876317

However, the level of preparation of the country and its society for climate change in the second decade of the 21st century can be evaluated as low. The Municipal Adaptation Plans (MAPs) created in 2017–2019 became a subject of research studies whose main goal was to determine the typology of adaptation actions to be undertaken as part of MAPs in the 14 selected Polish cities in various geographical regions. Moreover, the type and scope of intended actions were analysed according to the planned amount of expenditure and from the perspective of sectors. The tasks accepted for implementation up to 2030 mainly relate to modernisation and development of transport systems and to actions connected with physical infrastructure. A large number of tasks and even a bigger scale of financial sources planned in the analysed MAPs for mitigation actions show that Polish cities are at an initial stage of actions for climate protection. The typology of adaptation actions which the work proposes may be helpful in research carried out in countries of a similar level of preparation for adaptation to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

In recent years the dengue has spread rapidly to several regions and it becomes a major public health menace globally. Dengue transmission is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall. In the present study, a climate driven dengue model was developed and predicted areas vulnerable for dengue transmission under the present and future climate change scenarios in India. The study also projected the dengue distribution risk map using representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in India in 2018–2030 (forthcoming period), 2031–2050 (intermediate period) and 2051–2080 (long period). The dengue cases assessed in India from 1998 to 2018 and found that the dengue transmission is gradually increasing year over year. The temperature data from 1980 to 2017 shows that, the mean temperatures are raising in the Southern region of India. During 2000–2017 periods the dengue transmission is steadily increasing across the India in compare with 1980–1999 periods. The dengue distribution risk is predicted and it is revealed that the coastal states have yearlong transmission possibility, but the high transmission potential is observed throughout the monsoon period. Due to the climate change, the expansion two more months of dengue transmission risk occurs in many regions of India. Both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios revealed that dengue outbreaks might occur at larger volume in Southern, Eastern, and Central regions of India. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of climate change on dengue transmission. These results helps to suggest appropriate control measures should be implemented to limit the spread in future warmer climates. Besides these, a proper plan is required to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the epidemic potential of dengue in India. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dengue; India; Rainfall; RCP4.5 & RCP8.5; Reproductive rate; Temperature","Climate models; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Maps; Sensitivity analysis; Transmissions; Viruses; Climate change scenarios; Control measures; Environmental factors; High transmission; Intermediate periods; Mean temperature; Temperature data; Transmission potential; Climate change; climate change; dengue fever; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemiology; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; Article; climate change; controlled study; demography; dengue; disease burden; disease transmission; epidemic; female; geographic distribution; human; India; infection control; infection risk; mosquito; nonhuman; priority journal; public health problem; retrospective study; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Aedes; animal; climate change; dengue; India; Dengue virus; Aedes; Animals; Climate Change; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086896304

The research was conducted from April to July 2019 in Batu Alang Village, Sabbang district, North Luwu Regency, South Sulawesi. The research consisted of two stages ie. Survey (literature study, observations, and interviews) to obtain dataset for climate, soil and cocoa plant growth and desktop study (simulation using Cropwat 8.0) to run the model using dataset previously obtained from the survey. The results show that evapotranspiration of cocoa (ETc) on stage 1 is 106.53, Stage 2 is 114.2, Stage 3 is 106.2, and Stage 4 is 85.1. Based on the ETc and the effective rainfall values in the study sites, water needs of cocoa plants in North Luwu Regency for all growth stages are adequate. The highest attack area of cocoa pod borer of 8332 ha occurred in February attributed to climatic conditions with an average temperature of 27.2 C, 81% humidity, and 308 mm rainfall. On the other hand, the lowest attack area was 3224 ha in May that can be attributed to an average air temperature of 27.4 C, 83% humidity, and 384 mm rainfall.

Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive experimental study on plain and reinforced FRP-confined concrete, limited to circular cross sections. The program included 63 carbon FRP (CFRP)-confined plain and 60 CFRP-confined RC specimens with a variation in the geometries and in the applied materials. The analysis showed a significant influence of the compressive strength of the confined concrete on the confinement efficiency in the design methodology, as well as the importance of the proper determination of individual reduction values for different FRP composites. Finally, applicable experimental test results from the literature were included, enabling the development of a modified stress–strain and ultimate condition design model. © 2020 by the authors.

Its incidence varies considerably between countries, suggesting its interaction with the external environment. To analyze the influence of climate and air pollution on the occurrence of idiopathic PE in the region of Sousse (Tunisia). A total of 142 patients with idiopathic PE at two academic hospitals in Sousse (Tunisia) were enrolled in the study over a 7-year period. An analysis of two time series (environmental data and PE cases) was performed. Climatic data were collected from the National Institute of Meteorology. Air pollution data were obtained from the modeling platform of the National Agency for Protection of the Environment. The year 2015 was marked by the occurrence of the highest number of cases (24.6%). A statistically significant decrease in PE risk of 41.9% was observed during the summer with an OR of 0.59 (95% CI [0.36–0.94] and p = 0.026), compared with other seasons. Poisson GLM regression showed a significant increased risk of PE of 3.3% for each 1 °C temperature drop. After multiple binary logistic regression, the elevation of PM10 concentration was independently associated with an increased risk of PE (p &lt; 10−3, OR 79.55, 95% CI [42.28–149.6]). Some environmental parameters may predispose to the onset of idiopathic PE. Understanding their accurate influence may have preventive and curative implications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Climate; Environment; Pulmonary embolism","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); disease incidence; environmental factor; health risk; nervous system disorder; particulate matter; regression analysis; time series analysis; Sousse; Tunisia; air pollutant; air pollution; human; lung embolism; season; Tunisia; weather; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Humans; Pulmonary Embolism; Seasons; Tunisia; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087299868

Flexible statistical methods for prediction have demonstrated the integration of satellite observations with other predictors, yet these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting the spatiotemporal structure of the training datasets. We present a new approach for predicting PM2.5 using machine-learning methods and evaluating prediction models for the goal of making predictions where they were not previously available. We apply extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) modeling to predict daily PM2.5 on a 1 × 1 km2 resolution for a 13 state region in the Northeastern USA for the years 2000–2015 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth and implement a recursive feature selection to develop a parsimonious model. We demonstrate excellent predictions of withheld observations but also contrast an RMSE of 3.11 μg/m3 in our spatial cross-validation withholding nearby sites versus an overfit RMSE of 2.10 μg/m3 using a more conventional random ten-fold splitting of the dataset. As the field of exposure science moves forward with the use of advanced machine-learning approaches for spatiotemporal modeling of air pollutants, our results show the importance of addressing data leakage in training, overfitting to spatiotemporal structure, and the impact of the predominance of ground monitoring sites in dense urban sub-networks on model evaluation. The strengths of our resultant modeling approach for exposure in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 include improved efficiency, parsimony, and interpretability with robust validation while still accommodating complex spatiotemporal relationships. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; Air pollution; MAIAC; PM2.5; Spatial cross-validation","Forecasting; Machine learning; Particles (particulate matter); Satellites; Security of data; Urban growth; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Satellite observations; Spatial cross validations; Spatio-temporal models; Spatio-temporal relationships; Spatio-temporal structures; Predictive analytics; atmospheric pollution; data set; health impact; machine learning; methodology; numerical model; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; article; cross validation; exposure science; feature selection; optical depth; particulate matter; prediction; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088271716

However, energy flexibility is required to cope with the increased share of renewable energy. Utilising it necessitates mathematical models of the operational response of energy flexible consumers. In this paper we present an accurate and general dynamic model of energy flexibility based on stochastic differential equations. The intuitive interpretation of the parameters is explained, to show the generality of the proposed model. To validate the approach, the parameters are estimated for three water towers and three buildings controlled by economic model predictive controllers. The model is then used to offer the energy flexibility on the current electricity market of Scandinavia, Nord Pool, using the so called “flexi orders”. Finally, the energy flexibility is used by controlling the demand of the water towers indirectly, through price signals designed based on the proposed model. Compared to having perfect foresight of electricity prices and future demand, between 63% and 98% of the potential savings were obtained in for these case studies. This shows that even without direct control of energy flexible systems, most of the potential can be reached under the current market conditions. © 2020 The Authors","Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility function; State space model; Stochastic differential equations","Commerce; Differential equations; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Water towers; Electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Non-linear modelling; Perfect foresights; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Response of energy; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic models; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity industry; nonlinearity; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086584242

This study investigated the effect of conductive magnetite (Fe3O4) addition on the AD of a sulfur-rich organic waste mixture, with an emphasis on the fate of sulfur and on H2S production. In contrast to previous findings, methanogenic performance under magnetite-added conditions was not significantly enhanced within the tested dose range of up to 20 mM Fe. When magnetite was added, H2S production decreased remarkably along with the extracellular accumulation of S0. Moreover, the H2S content in biogas was below 100 ppmv at magnetite doses of 8 mM Fe or higher (&gt;6000 ppmv under control conditions, i.e., without magnetite). The reduced H2S production appears to be due to the anaerobic oxidation of sulfide to S0 because sulfate reduction remained active, whereas FeS was not produced under magnetite-added conditions. Based on microbial community analysis results and thermodynamic calculations, the electric syntrophy via DIET between exoelectrogenic anaerobic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and electrotrophic methanogens is suggested to have been promoted by magnetite. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose an electro-syntrophic association that couples the oxidation of sulfide to S0 with the reduction of CO2 to CH4 in methanogenic environments. The present findings open a new possibility for in situ H2S control and sulfur recovery in AD processes for sulfur-rich waste treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Anaerobic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria; Direct interspecies electron transfer; Elemental sulfur; Hydrogen sulfide; Magnetite","Bacteria; Conductive materials; Fatty acids; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Methanogens; Ore reduction; Oxidation; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic oxidation; Electrically conductive; Extracellular accumulations; Microbial community analysis; Microbial oxidation; Oxidation of sulfides; Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria; Thermodynamic calculations; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084852109

With the desire to achieve future sustainable development, China’s government is taking actions to adapt to climate change and to ensure food self-sufficiency. This paper assesses the scientific literature from both domestic and international journals, and the review policies released by the Chinese government, in order to investigate the adaptive actions being taken in China at the scale of the central government, and at the local administration and individual farmer level. The results demonstrate that China’s government has undertaken a multitude of adaptation programs in order to cope with vulnerability in the agricultural sector, and these include the release of stimulus policies, the support of new technological research, and investments in field facilities to strengthen the building of adaptive capacity. At the farmer household level, we found that people are spontaneously adapting to climate change on their own accord by changing the timing of cultivations, and through the selection of other crop species and cultivars. People are also securing non-land-related jobs when confronted with climate disasters. A summary is presented of the various agricultural adaptation policies and technologies. Although China has made great progress in terms of adapting to climate change, there is still more work that needs to be done. This work entails not just agricultural policy stimulation but also non-structural components, such as raising public awareness and providing adaptive skill training, etc. It can be concluded that agriculture sector could seek advantages and avoid disadvantages from adaptation activities by multiple stakeholders from different perspectives, and reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Climate adaptation strategies and actions are important and indispensable components for agricultural development in China, and more advanced technologies and ideologies are needed for a secure future. © 2020 by the authors.

Modelling the hydrological impacts of climate change is generally done in various stages and has uncertainty associated with each of them. These include scenario uncertainty in climate scenario selection, model uncertainty in climate simulation by global climatic models (GCMs), uncertainties while downscaling GCMs, biases in downscaled data, erroneous input to the hydrological model, and uncertainty in the structure and parameterisation of the hydrological model. The present paper aims at reviewing the uncertainties involved at each stage of climate change impact assessment of hydrology. In the near future, climate scenario uncertainties would be smaller than those associated with the choice of GCMs. Multi-model ensemble approach takes better account of uncertainties involved with GCMs. Moreover, considering a range of possible climate scenarios is recommended than using a single best or average case climate scenario. GCMs shall be downscaled by statistical or dynamical methods (regional climatic models (RCMs)) before using them for regional studies. Bias correction methods can considerably improve the RCM simulations. Evaluation of model performance is recommended for regional-scale studies for the preparation of adaptation strategies. Taking into account the uncertainties associated with climate impact studies can help formulate effective adaptation strategies. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Climate change; Downscaling; Global climatic models; Hydrology; Uncertainty","climate change; climate modeling; global climate; hydrological modeling; hydrology; literature review; uncertainty analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091713884

We report the reductive chemistry of the Ln(iii) complexes of the tripodal heptadentate Schiff base H3trensal (2,2′,2′′-tris(salicylideneimino)triethylamine), [LnIII(trensal)], 1-Ln (Ln = Sm, Nd, Eu). We show that the reduction of the [EuIII(trensal)] complex leads to the first example of a Eu(ii) Schiff base complex [{K(μ-THF)(THF)2}2{EuII(trensal)}2], 3-Eu. In contrast the one- and two-electron reduction of the [NdIII(trensal)] and [SmIII(trensal)] leads to the intermolecular reductive coupling of the imino groups of the trensal ligand and to the formation of one and two C-C bonds leaving the metal center in the +3 oxidation state. The resulting one- and two electron reduced complexes [{K(THF)3}2Ln2(bis-trensal)], 2-Ln, and [{K(THF)3}2{K(THF)}2Ln2(cyclo-trensal)], 4-Ln (Ln = Sm, Nd) are able to effect the reductive disproportionation of carbon dioxide by transferring the electrons stored in the C-C bonds to CO2 to selectively afford carbonate and CO.

For M51, the polarization vectors generally follow the spiral pattern defined by the molecular gas distribution, the far-infrared (FIR) intensity contours, and other tracers of star formation. The fractional polarization is much lower in the FIR-bright central regions than in the outer regions, and we rule out loss of grain alignment and variations in magnetic field strength as causes. When compared with existing synchrotron observations, which sample different regions with different weighting, we find the net position angles are strongly correlated, the fractional polarizations are moderately correlated, but the polarized intensities are uncorrelated. We argue that the low fractional polarization in the central regions must be due to significant numbers of highly turbulent segments across the beam and along lines of sight in the beam in the central 3 kpc of M51. For NGC 891, the FIR polarization vectors within an intensity contour of 1500 are oriented very close to the plane of the galaxy. The FIR polarimetry is probably sampling the magnetic field geometry in NGC 891 much deeper into the disk than is possible with NIR polarimetry and radio synchrotron measurements. In some locations in NGC 891, the FIR polarization is very low, suggesting we are preferentially viewing the magnetic field mostly along the line of sight, down the length of embedded spiral arms. There is tentative evidence for a vertical field in the polarized emission off the plane of the disk. © 2020. The Author(s).

In order to reduce airborne emissions, a global 0.5 % sulphur limit for marine fuels was implemented in January 2020. Recently, a new generation of so-called hybrid fuels that meet these new requirements have appeared on the market. Studies have shown that these fuels have physical properties that make conventional clean-up methods difficult, but few have studied their effects on marine life. We conducted short and long-term microcosm experiments with natural mesozooplankton communities exposed to the water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of the hybrid fuel RMD80 (0.1 % sulphur) and a Marine Gas Oil (MGO). We compared the toxicity of both fuel types in 48h short-term exposures, and studied the effects of the hybrid fuel on community structure over two generations in a 28-day experiment. The F0 generation was exposed for eight days and the F1 generation was raised for 22 days without exposure. GC–MS and GC–FID analysis of the WAFs revealed that the hybrid fuel was dominated by a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), whereas the MGO was mainly composed of VOCs. We observed significant short-term effects on copepod egg production from exposure to 25 % hybrid fuel WAF, but no effects from the MGO WAF at equivalent WAF dilution. In the long-term experiment with RMD80, the feeding rate was initially increased after exposure to 0.5–1.1 % hybrid fuel WAF, but this did not increase the copepod egg production. Significant change in community structure was observed after eight days in the F0 community at 0.5–3.3 % WAF. Indications of further alterations in species abundances was observed in the F1 community. Our results demonstrate that the MGO is a less toxic low-sulphur alternative to the hybrid fuel for marine zooplankton, and that a hybrid fuel spill could result in altered diversity of future generations of copepod communities. © 2020 The Author(s)","Community; Generations; Hybrid fuel; Marine gas oil; Mixture; Zooplankton","fuel oil; marine gas oil; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; aromatic hydrocarbon; fuel oil; sulfur; cleanup; community structure; egg production; fuel; generation time; marine ecosystem; oil spill; PAH; sulfur; toxicity; volatile organic compound; zooplankton; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; community structure; controlled study; copepod; dilution; egg production; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; long term exposure; mass fragmentography; microcosm; nonhuman; priority journal; species diversity; toxicity; zooplankton; animal; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; physiology; reproduction; ship; theoretical model; time factor; toxicity; water pollutant; zooplankton; Copepoda; Animals; Copepoda; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fuel Oils; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Models, Theoretical; Reproduction; Ships; Sulfur; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090033310

Previous research has characterized activated sludge using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, which can help to address questions on the relative abundance of microorganisms. In this study, we used 16S rRNA transcript sequencing in order to characterize ""active"" populations (via protein synthesis potential) and gain a deeper understanding of microbial activity patterns within activated sludge. Seasonal abundances of individual populations in activated sludge change over time, yet a persistent group of core microorganisms remains throughout the year which are traditionally classified on presence or absence without monitoring of their activity or growth. The goal of this study was to further our understanding of how the activated sludge microbiome changes between seasons with respect to population abundance, activity, and growth. Triplicate sequencing batch reactors were sampled at 10-min intervals throughout reaction cycles during all four seasons. We quantified the gene and transcript copy numbers of 16S rRNA amplicons using realtime PCR and sequenced the products to reveal community abundance and activity changes. We identified 108 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with stable abundance, activity, and growth throughout the year. Nonproliferating OTUs were commonly human health related, while OTUs that showed seasonal abundance changes have previously been identified as being associated with floc formation and bulking. We observed significant differences in 16S rRNA transcript copy numbers, particularly at lower temperatures in winter and spring. The study provides an analysis of the seasonal dynamics of microbial activity variations in activated sludge based on quantifying and sequencing 16S rRNA transcripts. IMPORTANCE Sequencing batch reactors are a common design for wastewater treatment plants, particularly in smaller municipalities, due to their low footprint and ease of operations. However, like for most treatment plants in temperate/continental climates, the microbial community involved in water treatment is highly seasonal and its biological processes can be sensitive to cold temperatures. The seasonality of these microbial communities has been explored primarily in conventional treatment plants and not in sequencing batch reactors. Furthermore, most studies often only address which organisms are present. However, the activated sludge microbial community is very diverse, and it is often hard to discern which organisms are active and which organisms are simply present. In this study, we applied additional sequencing techniques to also address the issues of which organisms are active and which organisms are growing. By addressing these issues, we gained new insights into seasonal microbial populations dynamics and activity patterns affecting wastewater treatment. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

The combination of AnMBR and fertigation reduces CO2 emissions due to the organic matter valorization and the partial avoidance of mineral fertilizer requirements. However, both AnMBR and fertigation still face technological and regulatory barriers that need to be overcome. These bottlenecks were tackled within the first Innovation Deal approved by the European Commission in 2016, and gave rise to several case studies on water reuse systems. The results of the Oliva Wastewater Treatment Plant (Spain) and Peschiera-Borromeo Wastewater Treatment Plant (Italy) showed that reclaimed water can be considered as a reliable water and nutrient source, return a positive economic balance (up to 376 k€·year−1) and provide significant reductions and savings in CO2 emissions (up to −898.9 tCO2·year−1). According to the new EU regulation, a new key player known as the Reclaimed Water Manager, was also proposed to be in charge of supplying reclaimed water with appropriate quantity and quality to end-users. This new agent would also be responsible for drawing up and implementing a Water Reuse Risk Management Plan in cooperation with the parties involved. Applying AnMBR technology to water reuse thus shows potential for contributing to catchment-scale Circular Economy while preserving natural water bodies, reducing the carbon footprint and creating new business opportunities. However, to take full advantage of its benefits demonstration projects would need to be carried out and favorable and harmonized regulations among the EU States would need to be adopted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural water reuse; Anaerobic digestion; Membrane technology; Nutrient recovery and reuse; Reclaimed water; Sustainability assessment","Agricultural robots; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Catchments; Fertilizers; Nutrients; Risk management; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Business opportunities; Demonstration project; Mineral fertilizers; Natural water bodies; Risk management plans; Technological feasibility; Wastewater treatment plants; Effluents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086372126

However, attempts to use MOFs or MOF-based composites for CO2 photoreduction6–13 usually result in far lower CO2 conversion efficiency than that obtained from state-of-the-art solid-state or molecular catalysts14–18, even when facilitated by sacrificial reagents. Here we create ‘molecular compartments’ inside MOF crystals by growing TiO2 inside different pores of a chromium terephthalate-based MOF (MIL-101) and its derivatives. This allows for synergy between the light-absorbing/electron-generating TiO2 units and the catalytic metal clusters in the backbones of MOFs, and therefore facilitates photocatalytic CO2 reduction, concurrent with production of O2. An apparent quantum efficiency for CO2 photoreduction of 11.3 per cent at a wavelength of 350 nanometres is observed in a composite that consists of 42 per cent TiO2 in a MIL-101 derivative, namely, 42%-TiO2-in-MIL-101-Cr-NO2. TiO2 units in one type of compartment in this composite are estimated to be 44 times more active than those in the other type, underlining the role of precise positioning of TiO2 in this system. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aluminum; carbon dioxide; chromium; chromium terephthalate; iron; metal organic framework; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; carbon dioxide; catalysis; catalyst; crystal structure; molecular analysis; organic compound; oxide group; phthalate; porosity; quantum mechanics; reduction; Article; controlled study; density functional theory; electron; electron spin resonance; oxidation; photocatalysis; photochemistry; photoreduction; priority journal; quantum chemistry; reduction (chemistry); thermodynamics; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090443871

The global climate model (GCM)—Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth Systems (HadGEM2-ES) is used to drive the two RCMs. The results of baseline simulations show that the two RCMs can correct the obvious underestimation of light rain below 5 mm day−1 and the overestimation of precipitation above 5 mm day−1 in Northwest China and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, as being produced by the driving GCM. While PRECIS outperforms RegCM4 in simulating annual precipitation and wet days in several sub-regions of Northwest China, its underperformance shows up in eastern China. For extreme precipitation, the two RCMs provide a more accurate simulation of continuous wet days (CWD) with reduced biases and more realistic spatial patterns compared to their driving GCM. For other extreme precipitation indices, the RCM simulations show limited benefit except for an improved performance in some localized regions. The future projections of the two RCMs show an increase in the annual precipitation amount and the intensity of extreme precipitation events in most regions. Most areas of Southeast China will experience fewer number of wet days, especially in summer, but more precipitation per wet day (≥ 30 mm day−1). By contrast, number of wet days will increase in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and some areas of northern China. The increase in both the maximum precipitation for five consecutive days and the regional extreme precipitation will lead to a higher risk of increased flooding. The findings of this study can facilitate the efforts of climate service institutions and government agencies to improve climate services and to make climate-smart decisions. © 2020, Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Erasmo BUONOMO, with British Crown (administered by Met Office).","climate change; Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX); dynamical downscaling; extreme precipitation; regional climate models (RCMs)","climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095768079

The increased scattering in the body effectively improves the light utilization efficiency and improves catalytic properties. In this work, fusiform-shaped g-C3N4 capsules are created by controlling the nucleation kinetics of supramolecular assemblies. The fusiform-shaped capsule micron-nanostructure is synthesized with ultrathin wall thickness and adjusted carbon/nitride ratios which decrease the recombination rate of photo-generated carriers. The hollow nanostructure and relatively higher specific surface area of the fusiform-shaped capsule effectively enhance light scattering inside body and lead to an enhanced carrier utilization efficiency. Moreover, the decrease of bandgap and relatively negative conduction band position affect the response of hollow fusiform-shaped g-C3N4 capsules (Hf-g-C3N4) in visible light region and improve the photo-reducing performance. In term of H2 evolution property, Hf-g-C3N4 has been improved to 7052 µmol g−1 h−1, which is 10.9 times higher compared with bulk structure. More importantly, Hf-g-C3N4 can produce CH4 at the rate of 1.63 µmol g−1 h−1 without help of co-catalyst and hole sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic reduction reaction of CO2 to CH4. At same time, the selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is another advantage of Hf-g-C3N4. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","capsules; carbon nitride; nucleation dynamics; photocatalysis; supramolecular assembly","Carbon dioxide; Carbon nitride; Efficiency; Hafnium compounds; Image enhancement; Light; Light scattering; Nanostructures; Catalytic properties; Hollow nanostructures; Photocatalytic property; Photocatalytic reduction; Photocatalytic reduction reaction; Photogenerated carriers; Supramolecular assemblies; Utilization efficiency; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091270963

However, as the backbone of China’s economic development, industrial parks also consume huge energy resources and cause serious pollution to the environment, making China face greater pressure on environmental issues. This article takes the Yongcheng Economic and Technological Development Area, a typical energy-intensive industrial park in Henan Province, as the research object to analyze its energy saving and emission reduction potential. Three scenarios (baseline scenario, energy cascade utilization scenario, and energy efficiency technology enhancement scenario) are set to quantify the energy-saving potential and air pollutant emission reduction of the park under different scenarios. The results show that in the energy cascade utilization scenario, by realizing the recycling of waste heat resources from heat source enterprises, it can bring energy saving of 6385 TJ, and reduce 0.35 kt SO2, 0.79 kt NOx, 0.067 kt PM10, and 0.035 kt PM2.5. And CO2 emission reductions have reached 604 kt. In the energy efficiency technology enhancement scenario, by eliminating relatively backward technologies and adding advanced energy-saving technologies, 7306 TJ energy saving could be achieved. SO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, and CO2 emission reductions are 0.37, 0.82, 0.038, 0.071, and 719 kt, respectively. The results of the CALPUFF model indicate that the pollutant concentrations of SO2, NOx, PM10, and PM2.5 in the spring and autumn are relatively high, while those in the summer and winter seasons are relatively low. In four seasons, the highest 1-h average concentration and dispersion range of four pollutants have been reduced both in the energy cascade utilization scenario and in the efficiency technology enhancement scenario. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air quality; CALPUFF model; Emission reduction of air pollutants; Energy cascade utilization; Energy conservation supply curve; Energy saving","economic development; emission control; energy efficiency; energy resource; environmental issue; industrial emission; pollutant removal; seasonal variation; China; Henan; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; pollutant; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087043465

The relative effects of meteorological conditions in eastern China were quantified using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) for the period 2007–2016, and the year 2012 was chosen as the reference. In combination with observations of the air quality, the relative contributions of the two factors were identified. Six regions were selected according to their geolocations and regional climatic features. The results showed that meteorological conditions alone may have caused up to 10% of the variation in the mean annual air quality index. These conditions were generally favorable in coastal regions but unfavorable in inland ones, and they usually exerted a greater influence during winter. On average, anthropogenic emissions contributed approximately 70% of the change in PM10 concentration (relative to 2012) during the studied decade, but the contribution ratio varied significantly by region and year. Most regions exhibited lower anthropogenic ratios before 2012, indicating the major effects of anthropogenic emissions on air quality after this year. Furthermore, the considerable improvement in the air quality of these regions was mainly ascribed to reduced anthropogenic emissions. This study provides clear evidence that the air pollution control efforts that have been initiated in China since 2013, such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP), have succeeded in improving the air quality. However, attention must also be directed to the effects of meteorological conditions, which may cause severe pollution episodes even during low levels of emissions; thus, air pollution forecasting and appropriate emergency measures should be implemented in the future. © 2020, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

The scale of change in the district’s climate was analyzed using meteorological station data (1901–2000) and grid data (1985–2015). Perceptions of climate change among forest-dependent communities in three altitude zones (< 1200 m asl (zone A); 1200–1800 m asl (zone B), and > 1800 m asl (zone C)) in the study region were surveyed with respect to 14 climate-specific indicators. Annual mean, maximum, and minimum temperature of seasonal data indicated increasing trends except monsoon. Percentage cloud cover showed an increase, of approximately 3%, while diurnal temperature displayed decreasing trends. Rainfall in the district showed a decreasing trend, with more than 50% of years 1985–2015 receiving less rainfall than the annual average. More than 90% of respondents in zones A and B, and around 65–70% respondents in zone C, reported changes in climate parameters. These findings confirm the long-term observable changes in climate in the region and demonstrate the utility of station data, grid data, and surveys of local communities’ perceptions when analyzing climate change. The analysis provided important clues about the nature of climate changes in the district. The results can be used to reduce the gap between bottom-up understanding and top-down policies and to formulate precautionary and ongoing site-specific adaptation practices for communities in different altitude zones in the study region, leading to effective and efficient mitigation of climate change impacts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Rainfall; Respondents’ perception; Temperature; Western Himalaya","Forestry; Rain; Surveys; Annual average; Climate change impact; Climate parameters; Diurnal temperatures; Forest-dependent communities; Local community; Meteorological station; Minimum temperatures; Climate change; rain; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; environmental assessment; perception; rainfall; altitude; Article; climate change; community; environmental impact; environmental indicator; environmental temperature; forest; India; meteorology; trend study; environmental monitoring; forest; meteorology; Himalayas; India; Uttarakhand; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; India; Meteorology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090395111

Although assessments to develop plans for linked and connected landscapes in response to climate and land-use change have been increasingly employed in the last decade, efforts to operationalize and implement these plans have been limited. Here, we present a framework using existing, available biological data to design an implementable, comprehensive multispecies connectivity plan. This framework uses a scenario-based approach to consider how ecosystems, habitats, and species may need to adapt to future conditions with an ensemble of connectivity models. We use the south coast ecoregion of California as an example to evaluate and prioritize linkages by combining linked metapopulation models and key landscape features (e.g., conservation planning status and implementation feasibility) to identify and prioritize a multispecies linkage network. Our analyses identified approximately 30,000 km2 of land, roughly one-fifth of our study area, where actions to preserve or enhance connectivity may support climate adaptation, nearly half of which is already conserved. By developing and implementing a dynamic connectivity assessment with an eye towards projected changes, our analysis demonstrates how dynamic connectivity can be integrated into feasible regional conservation and management plans that account for demographic as well as landscape change. We observed overlap across multiple models, reinforcing the importance of areas that appeared across methods. We also identified unique areas important for connectivity captured by our complementary models. By integrating multiple approaches, the resultant linkage network is robust, building on the strengths of a variety of methods to identify model consensus and reduce uncertainty. By linking quantitative connectivity metrics with prioritized areas for conservation, our approach supports transparent and robust decision-making for landscape planning, despite uncertainties of climate and land-use change. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate-wise connectivity; Conservation; Ecological network; Feasibility; Functional connectivity; Linkage; Multispecies; Protected area network; Scenario",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092524093

Various initiatives are being implemented to reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage. A straightforward method that can be applied for a detailed understanding of the effects of climate change and prospective electricity grid mix on building energy use is presented. The novelty of this study was to integrate long-term energy projections in a high temporal resolution LCA for buildings and taking into account different future climates and prospective electricity mixes across Canada. The research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific robustness of LCA metrics.

However, cases where NCIs between solvents and substrates are responsible for a major extent for determining selectivity are rare. The current computational study with density functional theory identifies two important transformations where this is the case: the intramolecular carbonyl-ene reaction and the Staudinger [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. In both cases, the role of explicit solvent molecules interacting noncovalently with the substrate has been taken into account. Calculations indicate that the diastereomeric ratio would be 95.0:5.0 for the formation of tricyclic tetrahydrofuran diastereomers via the intramolecular carbonyl-ene reaction and 94.0:6.0 for the formation of the triflone diastereomers via the Staudinger [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, which corroborates with the experiment. Interestingly, in both the cases, the calculations indicate that noninclusion of explicit solvent molecules would lead to only a small difference between the competing transition states, which leads to the conclusion that solvent-substrate NCIs are the major cause for diastereoselectivity in both the cases considered.

When states share a water resource, adaptation to climate change proves to be more burdensome, especially if the resource in question is governed by a transboundary water agreement that fails to incorporate flexibility. The focus of this paper is on transboundary water basins with more than two riparian states, where only part of the co-riparian states are party to a transboundary water agreement. The paper discusses whether the recognition of the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water as a principle of customary international law creates an obligation for the party states to such agreements to adapt the terms of their arrangement to climate change. It argues that the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water establishes an obligation of conduct for the states to respect non-parties’ riparian rights to a fair share of beneficial uses of water and protect the environment. Therefore, the nature of disruptions caused by climate change may make it imperative for the party states to take all possible measures that allow them to modify their water practices under an agreement to the implications of climate change in order to comply with the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Adaptation; Climate change; Flexibility; Transboundary water agreements",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094942067

Moist convection provides ascent within the rain belt, but must be parameterized in climate models, limiting predictions. Here, we use a pan-African convection-permitting model (CPM), alongside a parameterized convection model (PCM), to analyze how explicit convection affects the rain belt under climate change. Regarding changes in mean climate, both models project an increase in total column water (TCW), a widespread increase in rainfall, and slowdown of subtropical descent. Regional climate changes are similar for annual mean rainfall but regional changes of ascent typically strengthen less or weaken more in the CPM. Over a land-only meridional transect of the rain belt, the CPM mean rainfall increases less than in the PCM (5% vs 14%) but mean vertical velocity at 500 hPa weakens more (17% vs 10%). These changes mask more fundamental changes in underlying distributions. The decrease in 3-hourly rain frequency and shift from lighter to heavier rainfall are more pronounced in the CPM and accompanied by a shift from weak to strong updrafts with the enhancement of heavy rainfall largely due to these dynamic changes. The CPM has stronger coupling between intense rainfall and higher TCW. This yields a greater increase in rainfall contribution from events with greater TCW, with more rainfall for a given large-scale ascent, and so favors slowing of that ascent. These findings highlight connections between the convective-scale and larger-scale flows and emphasize that limitations of parameterized convection have major implications for planning adaptation to climate change. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Belts; Climate models; Parameterization; Rain; Tropics; Adaptation to climate changes; Fundamental changes; Hadley circulation; Intense rainfalls; Mean vertical velocity; Rainfall contributions; Regional climate changes; Underlying distribution; Climate change; atmospheric convection; climate change; humidity; rainfall; regional climate; updraft; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091641663

An interaction may exist between the climatic changes and invasive plant species. In this 2-year study, we investigated the effects of warming, CO2 and nitrogen application on the biomass, growth and leaf tissue nitrogen concentration of three invasive weed species. Treatments were: (i) simulated (elevated) CO2 (approximately 800–900 ppm); (ii) warming or high temperature (day/night 25/15 °C); (iii) simulated (elevated) CO2 combined with high temperature (CO2 = approximately 800–900 ppm; temperature day/night 25/15 °C); and (iv) control conditions (CO2 = approximately 400–450 ppm; temperature day/night 20/10 °C). The doses of nitrogen were: (i) 0 kg ha−1 (control; low); (ii) 60 kg ha−1 (medium); and (iii) 120 kg ha−1 (high). RESULTS: Elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 combined with high temperature improved biomass and the growth of the tested invasive weed species: Lactuca serriola L., Hordeum murinum L. and Bromus tectorum L. Nitrogen application had little effect on grasses, whereas the broadleaved weed mostly had a positive response to nitrogen application. Invasive weed species were generally negatively or neutrally affected by warming. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that nitrogen fertilization under different climatic conditions improved few of the parameters, whereas elevated CO2 promoted most of the growth parameters of invasive weeds. Overall, is it concluded that these weeds will be more invasive under climate change conditions. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","climate change; elevated CO2; global warming; invasive plants; nitrogen pollution","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; Asteraceae; biomass; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; Hordeum; metabolism; Southern Europe; temperature; weed; Asteraceae; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Hordeum; Mediterranean Region; Nitrogen; Plant Weeds; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087652104

Understanding the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the regional level is thus essential for policymakers in achieving emission targets given the decomposition of industry at the regional level.

Because of climate warming, plant traits might change, altering ecosystem functions and vegetation-climate interactions. Despite important feedbacks of plant trait changes in tundra ecosystems with regional climate, with a key role for shrubs, information on responses of shrub functional traits is limited. Here, we investigate the effects of experimentally increased permafrost thaw depth and (possibly thawassociated) soil nutrient availability on plant functional traits and strategies of Arctic shrubs in northeastern Siberia. We hypothesize that shrubs will generally shift their strategy from efficient conservation to faster acquisition of resources through adaptation of leaf and stem traits in a coordinated whole-plant fashion. To test this hypothesis, we ran a 4 year permafrost thaw and nutrient fertilization experiment with a fully factorial block design and six treatment combinations - permafrost thaw (control, unheated cable, heated cable) fertilization (no nutrient addition, nutrient addition). We measured 10 leaf and stem traits related to growth, defence and the resource economics spectrum in four shrub species (Betula nana, Salix pulchra, Ledum palustre and Vaccinium vitis-idaea), which were sampled in the experimental plots. The plant trait data were statistically analysed using linear mixed-effect models and principal component analysis (PCA). The response to increased permafrost thaw was not significant for most shrub traits. However, all shrubs responded to the fertilization treatment, despite decreased thaw depth and soil temperature in fertilized plots. Shrubs tended to grow taller but did not increase their stem density or bark thickness. We found a similar coordinated trait response for all four species at leaf and plant level; i.e. they shifted from a conservative towards a more acquisitive resource economy strategy upon fertilization. In accordance, results point towards a lower investment into defence mechanisms, and hence increased shrub vulnerability to herbivory and climate extremes. Compared to biomass and height only, detailed data involving individual plant organ traits such as leaf area and nutrient contents or stem water content can contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of feedbacks between shrub growth strategies, permafrost thaw and carbon and energy fluxes. In combination with observational data, these experimental tundra trait data allow for a more realistic representation of tundra shrubs in dynamic vegetation models and robust prediction of ecosystem functions and related climate- vegetation-permafrost feedbacks. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

This review based work identified that the concept of climate change has conveyed into the contexts through disaster management discourse in Bangladesh. Climate change understanding and action programs could be divided into three groups (early-stage (1980-2000), mid-stage (2001-2010), and third stage (2011-2020). While early-stage works related to the basic understanding of ozone layer depletion, greenhouse effect, global warming, and their impacts on natural resources and physical functions, mid-stage reports contain impact narratives on different sectors and outlined action plans. The third stage reports have firm commitments to reduce climate change vulnerabilities of people, processes, and systems. In this stage, climate-resilient development is proposed through mainstreaming climate change investments/expenditures into regular development programs of the government. The roles of actors (both individual and institutional) from the government to non-government entities, varied and conflicting interests (e.g., personal, thematic, and need-based), struggle among the institutions over control over actions/processes. Moreover, local works have little influence on institutional and policy-making processes related to climate change compared to the impact made by global level reports mainly produced by international agencies. © 2020 Published by RERIC in International Energy Journal (IEJ).","Bangladesh; Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Climate change policies; Climate change research","Disaster prevention; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Ozone layer; Action plan; Change perceptions; Development programs; Disaster management; Government entities; Ozone layer depletion; Physical function; Policy making; Disasters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099011788

Thirty-five year (1980–2014) climatic data (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) were used for seasonal (Kharif-I, Kharif-II, and Robi) trend analysis. It has been identified that the cropping pattern needed to be modified by local farmers due to climate change impacts and crop production has declined severely in the study areas. For instance, in the Kharif-II season, during the period 2008–2009 with an agricultural land area of 13,670 hectares, the average production was only 2.58 mt per hectare. The study shows a significant strong positive correlation between seasonal average rainfall and seasonal average humidity (r = 0.75, p < 0.05) during the Robi season. A significant strong negative correlation between seasonal average temperature and seasonal average humidity (r = − 0.60, p < 0.05) during the Kharif-I season was also found.

To collect empirical data, individual interviews, focus group discussions, oral history, and key informant interviews were conducted. To supplement the empirical findings, time-series data of cyclones and sea-borne depressions in the Bay of Bengal were also analyzed. Analysis of secondary data regarding climate change-induced events and regional studies suggested that the biophysical conditions of the Bay of Bengal are likely to be aggravated in the future, potentially causing more frequent extreme events and affecting the livelihoods of coastal fishing communities in Bangladesh. The fisher respondents revealed that the main target hilsa shad fishery is particularly vulnerable to climate change in terms of alterations to migration patterns and breeding and growth performance. The fishers reported constant climate-related risks because they live in seafront locations, exposed to extreme events, and their occupation entails risky sea fishing. Fishers claimed that they often need return to the coast due to unsuitable weather conditions related to cyclones and frequent tropical depressions, which can cause financial losses or even causalities. Such events negatively affect fishers’ livelihoods, and wellbeing. To cope with the impacts of climate change the fishers have adopted various strategies at both sea fishing and household levels. However, these strategies only support the fishers in terms of immediate survival; they are not enough for long-term resilience.

This study applies Raunkiær's plant life-form concept that was developed for temperate climate to a subtropical island flora, in parts, dominated by summer aridity. We quantify how plant life-form patterns as well as patterns of important plant functional traits (PFTs) relate to important climate and topographic characteristics. Location: La Palma, Canary Islands. Taxon: Flora of La Palma. Methods: We assigned each native plant species a plant life-form, that is, phanerophyte, chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte, geophyte and therophyte, as well as PFTs (succulence and N-fixer). We used stacked species distribution models to assess occurrence probability for each species using the Atlantis database (500 m × 500 m grid). We related richness and percentage values for each plant life-form and PFT to climate and topography. Results: Plant life-forms and PFTs showed a clear pattern within geographic but also climate space, while topography had a minor effect. Phanerophytes mainly contributed to the flora in humid areas. Chamaephytes and hemicryptophytes most strongly contributed to the summit scrub flora and, to some degree, also to the arid coastal regions. Geophytes and therophytes were mainly found in dry coastal regions. N-fixers contributed mainly to warm-arid and cool-arid regions, while succulent species were mainly found in arid coastal regions. Main conclusions: Raunkiær's plant life-form concept can be comprehensively transferred to a subtropical island flora by adapting to local unfavourable growing conditions, that is, aridity. Using the strong environmental gradients offered by our study island, we identify substantial climate-driven variation in patterns of plant life-forms and PFTs that might be used for large-scale comparisons in macroecological studies. The growth strategies reflected in Raunkiær's plant life-forms suggest differences in species establishment and coexistence dynamics within different parts of the island's climate space. © 2020 The Authors.

Natural sand is widely considered abundant, whereas recent research has pointed out the increasing risk of supply shortage in a number of world regions. In the current research, we examine the implication of future sand demand in the context of low-carbon infrastructure development. We mapped the projected investments on buildings and low-carbon infrastructure up to 2030 and estimated the sand intensity of the two types of construction. We translated these investments and sand intensity to country-specific sand-demand projections under three economic development scenarios. Our results indicate that China is expected to face the highest sand demand, followed by India, and that should the current sand extraction rates and construction practices be maintained, developing countries will be exposed to a significant supply risk of construction sand. Under the scenario of sustainable growth, developed economies are expected to have a relatively stable sand demand whereas South-East Asia and Africa will see a rapid increase in their sand demand over the next 15 years.

Biomass is further processed and many types of products are produced from it, such as oils, nutraceuticals, livestock feed, fertilizers and other substances. Some of them can be used as a renewable energy source, for example, for the production of biofuels. The production of biofuels using biomass as a renewable energy source, which is an inexhaustible source for solving the energy problem, is becoming increasingly important. The use of algae in architecture has brought many benefits, such as energy saving, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, oxygen generation, biofuel production, wastewater treatment at the micro level using building facades and at the macro level by integration into urban space.

Drivers of vegetation-derived services in parks are complex, as climate and park management interact with the functioning of multiple species of vegetation types. Yet, informal observations suggest that recreational parks are constructed consistently to specific principles of landscape design. Here we ask: what are the patterns of functional traits and vegetation diversity in cities of varying climate in the United States, and how do these patterns result in a consistent typology of recreational park? We hypothesized that increased aridity would exclude species not adapted to warm, dry climates, thereby reducing local, or alpha, taxonomic diversity and shifting community composition. However, a similar preference of park managers in the United States for suites of service-based functional traits leads to similarity of mean values of services traits in recreational parks among cities, regardless of climate differences. We tested this hypothesis by surveying lawn species, comprised of herbaceous turf and spontaneous plants, and woody species in fifteen recreational parks across Baltimore MD, Riverside CA, and Palm Springs CA, three cities that contain multiple parks but differ in regional climate. With increasing aridity, taxonomic alpha diversity decreased and plant physiology shifted, yet no differences were observed among most service-based functional traits. Among the cities surveyed, no significant differences were observed in functional dispersion of woody and spontaneous species or most service-based traits. Taxonomic composition differed in each city for all vegetation types, while suites of service-based traits differed between Baltimore and the two more arid cities of Riverside and Palm Springs. Our results suggest that across the United States, service-based functional traits are consistent, even when arising from unique compositions and abundances of species in recreational parks. We interpret these results as an interaction between climate and the preferences of recreation park managers for services, creating a pattern of vegetation diversity where taxonomic alpha and beta diversity vary among regions while specific suites of services remain available. © Copyright © 2020 Ibsen, Borowy, Rochford, Swan and Jenerette.","biodiversity; ecosystem services; functional diversity; park; park management; urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095710439

Reflecting the building momentum of PT use worldwide, construction has recently commenced for The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research in Adelaide – the first PT centre in Australia. This systematic review aims to update the clinical evidence base for PT, both proton beam and carbon ion therapy. The purpose is to inform clinical decision-making for referral of patients to PT centres in Australia as they become operational and overseas in the interim. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and thirty-six studies were included, two-thirds related to proton beam therapy alone. PT at the very least provides equivalent tumour outcomes compared to photon controls with the possibility of improved control in the case of carbon ion therapy. There is suggestion of reduced morbidities in a range of tumour sites, supporting the predictions from dosimetric modelling and the wide international acceptance of PT for specific indications based on this. Though promising, this needs to be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence found, with 90% of studies of level IV (case series) evidence. Prospective comparative clinical trials, supplemented by database-derived outcome information, preferably conducted within international and national networks, are strongly recommended as PT is introduced into Australasia. © 2020 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists","carbon ion therapy; hadron therapy; particle therapy; proton therapy; systematic review","adult; Australia and New Zealand; cancer model; cancer radiotherapy; case study; clinical decision making; female; hadron; human; ion therapy; male; medical research; morbidity; patient referral; photon; prediction; prospective study; proton therapy; public health; review; suggestion; systematic review; ion therapy; neoplasm; procedures; proton therapy; Heavy Ion Radiotherapy; Humans; Neoplasms; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Proton Therapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083155342

Most of the studies dealing with the urban canopy meteorological forcing on air pollution focused on change in average conditions or only on a selected winter and/or summer air pollution episode. Here we extend these studies by focusing on long-term extreme air pollution levels by looking at not only the change in average values, but also their high (and low) percentile values, and we combine the analysis with investigating selected high-pollution episodes too. As extreme air pollution is often linked to extreme values of meteorological variables (e.g., low planetary boundary layer height, low winds, high temperatures), the urbanization-induced extreme meteorological modifications will be analyzed too. The validation of model results show reasonable model performance for regional-scale temperature and precipitation. Ozone is overestimated by about 10.20 gm..3 (50 %.100 %); on the other hand, extreme summertime ozone values are underestimated by all models. Modeled nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations are well correlated with observations, but results are marked by a systematic underestimation up to 20 gm..3 (..50 %). PM2:5 (particles with diameter 2:5 m) are systematically underestimated in most of the models by around 5 gm..3 (50 %.70 %). Our results show that the impact on extreme values of meteorological variables can be substantially different from that of the impact on average ones: low (5th percentile) temperature in winter responds to UCMF much more than average values, while in summer, 95th percentiles increase more than averages. The impact on boundary layer height (PBLH), i.e., its increase is stronger for thicker PBLs and wind speed, is reduced much more for strong winds compared to average ones. The modeled changes in ozone (O3), NO2 and PM2:5 show the expected pattern, i.e., increase in average 8 h O3 up to 2.3 ppbv, decrease in daily average NO2 by around 2.4 ppbv and decrease in daily average PM2:5 by around ..2 gm..3. Regarding the impact on extreme (95th percentile) values of these pollutants, the impact on ozone at the high end of the distribution is rather similar to the impact on average 8 h values. A different picture is obtained however for extreme values of NO2 and PM2:5. The impact on the 95th percentile values is almost 2 times larger than the impact on the daily averages for both pollutants. The simulated impact on extreme values further well corresponds to the UCMF impact simulated for the selected high-pollution episodes. Our results bring light to the principal question: whether extreme air quality is modified by urban land surface with a different magnitude compared to the impact on average air pollution. We showed that this is indeed true for NO2 and PM2:5, while in the case of ozone, our results did not show substantial differences between the impact on mean and extreme values. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

Hence reasonable dispatch schemes can be made. In this paper, a two-step multi-objective optimization framework for microgrid scheduling problem is proposed based on cloud-edge computing. A typical microgrid structure with smart metering terminals (SMTs) is introduced and the cloud-edge computing framework is designed, in which the central energy management system (CEMS) is utilized to compute the day-ahead microgrid economical/environmental scheduling problem on the cloud side by forecast data, and the edge-computing servers are applied to re-compute the local optimum schemes on the edge-side during the operation process. Thereafter, the two-step multi-objective optimization strategy is proposed taking advantages of the global computing in cloud-side and the distributed computing in edge-side. The day-ahead global optimization model and the online local optimization model are employed to meet different goals by the two steps. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy is efficient in dealing with the microgrid scheduling problem to reduce cost and emission and can take account of the forecast data errors as well as the global optimum information. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud-edge computing; Dispatch scheme; Microgrid; Multi-objective optimization strategy; Smart metering terminal","Edge computing; Electric measuring instruments; Electric power measurement; Energy management systems; Global optimization; Information management; Microgrids; Scheduling; Computing frameworks; Electricity customers; Global computing; Local optimizations; Micro-grid systems; Microgrid structures; Operation process; Scheduling problem; Multiobjective optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101639091

Overviews of adaptation policy, plans and actions have largely been lacking for Africa, particularly at the local, city level. We applied a systematic map to assess what the human responses to climate impacts are in African cities, noting the climate drivers of these actions, the range of responses, where they have taken place, and who the actors are. Standardized, pre-selected search terms were used to systematically search peer-reviewed and grey literature, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Google. Publications were screened based on pre-approved inclusion criteria, and actions described in included articles were coded using categories from key conceptual framing papers on climate change adaptation. Of 2 042 peer-reviewed and 60 grey-literature publications, 252 underwent full-text screening, with 121 included for coding. We recorded 1 504 actions, taking place in 41 cities from 21 African countries, in response to various climate drivers. Anticipatory and reactive actions were taken by actors, from individuals to international agencies, and we highlighted successful adaptations, those taking advantage of climate impacts, and maladaptive actions. Combinations of climatic and non-climatic stimuli induced adaptive responses, which were frequently based on local knowledge, and provided a base upon which government action could build. Residents of informal settlements had less adaptive capacity than those in formal settlements, and government action could build their resilience. Since development is affected by climate impacts, climate change information should be integrated into development programmes. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Cities; Climate change; Coping; Informality; Poverty","International cooperation; Adaptation policies; Adaptive capacity; Adaptive response; Climate change adaptation; Development programmes; Government actions; Informal settlements; Systematic maps; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; informal settlement; integrated approach; literature review; state role; traditional knowledge; World Wide Web; Africa; Scopus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093112531

However, other extreme climatic events in the non-growing season, such as rainfall that causes temporary thawing at the bare soil surface without snow cover, could be responsible for appreciable fluxes of N2O. The objective of this study was to quantify the proportion of ice-trapped N2O and biologically-produced N2O released following a rain-induced thawing event on soils collected in late fall. The lab experiment was done in soil-filled microcosms after the soil surface was frozen at −20 °C for 2 h, which generated a 1–2 cm ice layer at the soil surface, before they were injected with N2, N2O and 15N2O gas at 5 cm depth and then received different amounts of water with customized rainfall simulators (0, 3, 7.5 or 15 mm simulated rainfall h−1) at 4 °C. Gas samples were collected at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h after gas injection. Soil temperature and water content increased faster after rain-induced thawing than after the air-induced thawing event. The release of ice-trapped N2O was not affected by rain-induced thawing because soil pores filled with melted ice-water, which slowed N2O diffusion and reduced N2O to nitrogen gas (N2), based on the production of 15N–N2. However, high simulated rainfall intensity (7.5 and 15 mm h−1) contributed to greater biological N2O emission after 48 h. We conclude that rainfall on a frozen bare soil surface in cold temperate humid regions may cause N loss through harmless N2, rather than the greenhouse gas N2O. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Freeze-thaw cycles; Gas diffusivity; Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen loss","Frozen soils; Greenhouse gases; Ice; Nitrogen oxides; Snow; Thawing; Bare soil surface; Climatic events; Growing season; Nitrous oxide emissions; Rainfall simulators; Simulated rainfall; Soil microcosms; Soil temperature; Rain; bare soil; biophysics; freeze-thaw cycle; frozen ground; greenhouse gas; induced response; microcosm; nitrogen oxides; precipitation intensity; snow cover; snowmelt; soil surface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089753071

Within a vegetation type, however, finer-scale environmental features, such as the physical and chemical properties of soil (edaphic variation), control patterns of plant diversity and distributions. Aims: Here, we review the literature to provide a mechanistic framework for the edaphic control of plant diversity. First, we review three examples where soils have known, prevalent effects on plant diversity: during soil formation, on unusual soils and in regions with high edaphic heterogeneity. Second, we synthesize how edaphic factors mediate the relative importance of the four key processes of community assembly (speciation, ecological drift, dispersal and niche selection). Third, we review the potential effects of climate change in edaphically heterogeneous regions. Finally, we outline key knowledge gaps for understanding the edaphic control of plant diversity. In our review, we emphasize floras of unusual edaphic areas (i.e., serpentine, limestone, granite), because these areas contribute disproportionately to the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Taxa: Terrestrial plants. Location: Global. Conclusion: Edaphic variation is a key driver of biodiversity patterns and influences the relative importance of speciation, dispersal, ecological drift, niche selection and interactions among these processes. Research is still needed to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which edaphic variation influences these community assembly processes, and unusual soils provide excellent natural systems for such tests. Furthermore, the incorporation of edaphic variation into climate change research will help to increase the predictive power of species distribution models, identify potential climate refugia and identify species with adaptations that buffer them from climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community assembly; edaphic; geodiversity; geology; gradient; heterogeneity; macroecology; soil","biodiversity; climate change; community dynamics; environmental gradient; geodiversity; geology; heterogeneity; macroecology; plant; soil; spatial distribution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088114570

The average measured value by phenolphthalein test was less than 2 mm after more than 100 years of service life in exposure class XC3 of EN 206. Low carbonation depth is explained by the presence of a thin (2-4 mm) layer of the protective render coat (PRC) situated on the bridge concrete. The place, where the PRC was of good quality was almost impermeable and the carbonation of the concrete underneath was even 0 mm. If the PRC locally spalled, the carbonation depth of the same concrete, at the same structure and environment reached at this place even more than 80 mm. It was observed that low carbonation of concrete significantly depends on the non-permeability of the PRC. A narrow free space filled with the carbonates causes increased non-permeability of the PRC creating thus the built-in limestone-based (anti-carbonation) barrier with the ability to dramatically reduce CO2 penetration into the beneath concrete over time.

Local governments' behavior affects the supply of energy-intensive industrial land. Industry structure dependence reinforce the effects of the carbon emissions trading program. The impacts of the carbon emissions trading program on the supply of energy-intensive industrial land would be less in cities with stronger regional competition, higher fiscal pressure or during political cycles.

Two large AQ and RS datasets collected during 2012–2018 were analyzed. The effects of various emission control programmes on the trends of tailpipe emissions and air quality were evaluated. Correlations between tailpipe emissions and roadside and ambient air quality were also explored. The results showed a decreasing trend of NO2 at both roadside and ambient AQ stations from 2013 to 2016, which was attributed to the intensive implementation of a series of vehicle emissions control programmes. Although NO2 was decreasing, O3 was generally increasing for all AQ stations. AQ data showed that O3 had little correlation with either NO2 or NOx, but was mainly determined by NO2/NOx ratio. Roadside NO2/NOx ratio increased first and then decreased or stabilized after 2014, while ambient NO2/NOx ratio increased steadily. RS data showed that the overall NO decreased quickly during 2012–2015 and then decreased moderately after 2015. The decrease was mainly attributed to the effective NO reduction from LPG vehicles. However, diesel NO remained high and reduced relatively slowly during the study period. Gasoline vehicles were relatively clean compared with LPG and diesel vehicles. Finally, good correlations were demonstrated between NO measured by RS sites and NOx measured by roadside AQ stations, indicating that vehicle emissions were the major contributor to roadside NOx pollution. Ambient NOx emissions could be affected by various sources, leading to different correlation levels between RS and ambient AQ results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Real driving emissions; Remote sensing; Tailpipe, roadside and ambient; Vehicle emission control programmes","Air quality; Diesel engines; Emission control; Large dataset; Liquefied petroleum gas; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Road vehicles; Roadsides; Air quality monitoring stations; Ambient air quality; Gasoline vehicle; Good correlations; Monitoring stations; Remote sensing system; Tailpipe emission; Vehicle emission; Remote sensing; diesel fuel; gasoline; liquefied petroleum gas; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; ambient air; correlation; emission control; pollution monitoring; remote sensing; roadside environment; traffic emission; air pollution; air quality control; ambient air; Article; community program; correlation analysis; data base; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; priority journal; remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086447056

However, less is known about its coastal mountain ecosystems, especially under extreme weather conditions, raising concerns about the vulnerability of these populated areas to catastrophic fires. Here we examine the fine-scale association between burn severity and a suite of environmental drivers including explicit fuel information, weather, climate, and topography, for diverse ecosystems in California's northern coastal mountains. Burn severity was quantified using Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat multispectral imagery during 1984-2017. We found a significant increasing trend in burned areas and severity. During low-precipitation years, areas that burned had much lower fuel moisture and higher climatic water deficit than in wetter years, and the percentage of high-severity areas doubled, especially during the most recent 2012-2016 drought. The random forest (RF) machine learning model achieved overall accuracy of 79% in classifying categories of burn severity. Aspect, slope, fuel type and availability, and temperature were the most important drivers, based on both classification and regression RF models. We further examined the importance of drivers under four climatic conditions: dry vs. wet years, and during two extended drought periods (the 2012-2016 warmer drought vs. the 1987-1992 drought). During warm and dry years, the spatial variability of burn severity was a mixed effect of slope, long-term minimum temperature, fuel amount, and fuel moisture. In contrast, climatic water deficit and short-term weather became dominant factors for fires during wetter years. These results suggest that relative importance of drivers for burn severity in the broader domain of California's northern coastal mountains varied with weather scenarios, especially when exacerbated by warm and extended drought. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting areas with high burn severity risk for fire adaptation and mitigation strategies in a changing climate and intensifying extremes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Six Ri cases and two stack emissions (S1 and S2) were considered. The distributions of temperature and pollutants, and visualization of pollutant diffusion were measured experimentally. Results show that as the Ri increases, the dimensionless temperature in the vertical center plane decreases, with its mean value reducing by 57%. According to the CRP value, the influence of Ri on pollutant distributions can be divided into two stages, namely the strongly influenced stage (0 ≤ Ri ​≤ ​0.78) and the weakly influenced stage (0.78 ≤ Ri ​≤ ​1.15). The mean pollutant concentration in the leeward wall and inner street canyon decreases rapidly with the Ri increasing (0 ≤ Ri ​≤ ​0.78), but changes little when Ri ​≥ ​0.78. Under the stack S2 emission, with Ri increasing, the obvious downwash effect gradually weakened, until Ri ​≥ ​0.97 the downwash effect disappeared eventually.

Currently, little efforts have been directed toward understanding the EV-copper-resource-environment nexus. Autoregressive integrated moving average model combined with dynamic material flow analysis was developed for the nexus analysis in Fujian in China due to its vigorous EV promotion. Results showed that standardized passenger vehicle ownership would increase 3.34 times from 2018 to the peak year 2042, with about 12 times’ and 139 times’ increase of EV sales in baseline and aggressive scenarios respectively. Accordingly, EV-induced additional copper demand in Fujian would increase the same times as EV sales since 2018, leading to the expansion of copper processing that would incur increasing ripple effects, including 1) aggressive scenario's accumulative additional copper ore demand during 2013-2050 exceed 40 times Chinese reserve in 2016; 2) about 62% of on-road EV's CO2eq reduction compared with Fuel vehicle would be offset by CO2 emissions from baseline scenario's additional copper processing under Chinese power structure in 2018. Additionally, many other pollutants will also increasingly be emitted in response to the growing EV-induced additional materials’ processing, which can further extend ripple effects from local to global environment, and finally threaten global sustainability.

The objective of this study was to investigate the rates of N2O production and reduction processes at various soil depths along a hydrological gradient in grazed subtropical grasslands. A batch incubation study was conducted on soils collected along a hydrological gradient representing isolated wetland (Center), transient edge (Edge) and pasture upland (Upland) in south-central Florida. Significantly different N2O production and reduction rates between hydrological zones were observed for surface soils (0–10 cm) under ambient conditions, with average N2O production rates of 0.368, 0.178 and 0.003 N2O-N kg−1 dry soil h−1 for Center, Edge and Upland, respectively, and average N2O reduction rates of 0.063, 0.132 and 0.002 N2O-N kg−1 dry soil h−1. Nitrous oxide production and reduction in subsurface soils maintained low rates and showed small variations between depths and hydrological zones. Our results suggest that N2O dynamics were affected by depth, mainly through labile organic carbon (C) and microbial biomass C, being influenced by hydrological zone primarily through soil NO3- content. The spatial distribution of N2O fluxes from denitrification along the hydrological gradient is likely attributed to the differences in N2O production and reduction in surface soils. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","denitrification; greenhouse gas; hydrology; labile organic carbon; nitrate; soil depth; wetland","denitrification; grassland soil; hydrological regime; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; pasture; spatial distribution; subtropical region; wetland; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090971875

Achieving the climate targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals requires better accounting for climate and health costs in energy planning. This paper quantifies trade-offs between selected energy infrastructure, climate, and health costs when meeting future electricity demand by increasing the share of renewable energy, with a focus on variable renewable energy (VRE; here: wind and solar photovoltaic power). Using a spatially and temporally resolved approach, we analyzed three scenarios for year 2030 for Northeast Brazil, characterized by 30%, 45%, and 70% of VRE (the latter corresponds to 100% renewable energy). We find that accounting for the health impacts from electricity generation is sufficient to economically justify deep decarbonization of Northeast Brazil's power sector. Full decarbonization is economically justified when the carbon price exceeds $20/tonne CO2, which is less than Brazil's country-level social cost of carbon and only 4.8% of the global social cost of carbon. Our study shows that regional climate and health costs from electricity generation alone can be greater than the additional infrastructure costs of decarbonization. Our results highlight how systematically accounting for health and climate costs in energy planning would economically justify the decarbonization of energy systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep decarbonization; Energy planning; Health impact assessment; Paris agreement; Renewable energy system; Social cost of carbon; Sustainable development goals","Carbon; Cost accounting; Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Ambient particulate Matter; Electricity generation; Energy infrastructures; Fossil fuel combustion; International energy agency; Renewable energy systems; Solar photovoltaic power; Variable renewable energies; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088030002

However, clarifying these effects is fundamental to better understand the relationship between vegetation and climate change. This study investigated spatio-temporal divergence in the responses of Finland's boreal forests to climate variables using the plant phenology index (PPI) calculated based on the latest Collection V006 MODIS BRDF-corrected surface reflectance products (MCD43C4) from 2002 to 2018, and identified the dominant climate variables controlling vegetation change during the growing season (May–September) on a monthly basis. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to quantify the response of PPI to climate variables and distinguish the separate impacts of different variables. The study results show the dominant effects of temperature on the PPI in May and June, with TMX, TMN and TMP being the most important explanatory variables for the variation of PPI depending on the location, respectively. Meanwhile, drought had an unexpectedly positive impact on vegetation in few areas. More than 50 % of the variation of PPI could be explained by climate variables for 68.5 % of the entire forest area in May and 87.7 % in June, respectively. During July to September, the PPI variance explained by climate and corresponding spatial extent rapidly decreased. Nevertheless, the RAD was found be the most important explanatory variable to July PPI in some areas. In contrast, the PPI in August and September was insensitive to climate in almost all of the regions studied. Our study gives useful insights on quantifying and identifying the relative importance of climate variables to boreal forest, which can be used to predict the possible response of forest under future warming. © 2020 The Authors","Boreal forests; Climate variables; Monthly difference; Partial least squares (PLS) regression; Plant phenology index (PPI)","boreal forest; climate change; forest ecosystem; least squares method; phenology; plant; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; vegetation dynamics; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098289574

Mountaintop species and ecosystems are expected to experience the strongest impacts of climate change. Lower tolerances to changes in habitat and decreased available surface area with increasing elevation should lead to smaller ranges and even extinctions of endemic species living on mountaintops. Thus, the potential impacts of climate change must be understood in order to achieve sound and long-lasting conservation and management of mountaintops. We evaluated the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution and conservation status of ten endemic bird species of eastern Brazil mountaintops based on ecological niche models. The models predicted a gradual reduction of suitable area for all species with a projected contraction of up to 94%, upwards shifts from 1039 to 1470 m in elevation, and range shifts from 7 to 373 km for 2070. Five groups of mountainous regions are highlighted as crucial for the current conservation of endemic birds. If these projections materialize, nine species of birds should be recognized as being under some level of threat. To diminish these effects, public policies and land conversion at local and regional scales and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are urgently needed. © 2020","Climate change; Ecological niche models; Espinhaço Range; High altitude grasslands; Rupestrian grasslands; Tropical mountains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096827594

This framework consists of five critical categories – adopted actions, institutional capacity, research quality, planning processes, and regional collaboration – and twenty-one evaluation criteria. The framework is designed to uncover asymmetries between places, identify opportunities for intervention, and track progress in adaptive capacity. We further applied this framework to regions in California to test its viability and glean insights into the framework's capacity to generate new and useful policy relevant information.

Ocean warming is one of many concerns, since more than 90% of the Earth's warming occurs in the oceans. Macrophyte-dominated communities recently have become the focus of climate mitigation due to their high carbon sequestration rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the effects of environmental variables on the phenological response of photosynthesis in entire macrophyte communities (i.e., community production). We conducted 30 monitoring surveys from May 2015 to February 2017 and collected time-series data of environmental variables in Zostera marina (3 m depth) and Sargassum siliquastrum (1 m depth) communities. The community production and respiration from two different macrophyte communities were calculated from dissolved oxygen time-series. Analysis of the time-series indicated strong diurnal frequencies for dissolved oxygen, light, and net ecosystem production, whereas weekly frequencies dominated for water temperature, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and current speed. Water temperature appeared to drive mean gross ecosystem production over the course of a year and light induced variations in the short-term and were similar in both macrophyte communities. © 2020 Japanese Society of Phycology","climate change; global warming; power spectral density; principal component analysis; Sargassum siliquastrum; Zostera marina","canopy architecture; carbon sequestration; climate conditions; community response; global change; macroalga; macrophyte; marine ecosystem; net ecosystem production; phenology; seagrass; seasonality; temperature effect; time series analysis; water temperature; Sargassum siliquastrum; Zostera marina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088571414

Whereas the mitigation pillar is more developed and peer-reviewed literature can be found, adaptation is still lagging behind, not to mention the absence of information on the effectiveness of the CoM concerning the development of climate adaptation plans. This paper aims at presenting a thorough analysis of climate hazard data declared by CoM signatories as well as the degree of regional agreement of those signatories when reporting climate data. Thus, we assume that the signatories belonging to the same climate region should report similar climate hazard data for both current and future timeframes. Using a new statistical method for measuring the variability of categorical data, we determine that, overall, the signatories show low agreement within climate regions. Hence, we conclude that the CoM, in the corresponding part of climate risk assessment, is not as effective as it could be desired.

This research aims to understand how existing zoning regulations that prescribe urban form affect the microclimate of densely built redeveloped commercial and mixed-use urban areas. ENVI-met was used to simulate diurnal microclimatic conditions of two former indoor shopping malls in the Denver metropolitan area that were converted to walkable urban outdoor centers in the early 2000s – the 29th street Mall in Boulder, CO and Belmar in Lakewood, CO. Simulations were conducted for a typical summer day (June 29, 2015) and validated through on-site air temperature observations. To compare the impact of urban form on microclimate at both sites, four policy scenarios were developed to apply the hypothetical policy-driven morphology of one site to the other by changing building height, tree density, street direction, and a combination of the three factors. The combined scenario showed the largest differences in air temperature to the base case (up to 2.0 °C), which is in the order of magnitude of the RMSE (1.2 °C–2.4 °C). Site configuration influenced air temperature and wind speed creating hyperlocal cool and warm pockets. Mean radiant temperature (MRT) varied the most between the scenarios with differences of up to 15.0 °C due to tall buildings and increased shading. Urban form policies of Belmar contributed to more effective heat mitigation, particularly with respect to MRT. Findings from this empirical work demonstrate the importance of design guidelines and zoning to achieve desired microclimate outcomes and highlight the potential of planning policies to create climate-sensitive urban forms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Design and planning policy analysis; Design guidelines; Form-based zoning; Urban heat mitigation; Urban microclimate","air temperature; assessment method; design; guideline; metropolitan area; microclimate; redevelopment; regulatory framework; summer; urban area; urban policy; wind velocity; Boulder Creek [Colorado]; Colorado; Denver; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086508944

There has been significant recent research into High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete to enable the utilization of fly ash and to reduce CO2 emission by reducing cement demand. This comprehensive review summarizes up to date literature on HVFA concrete with more than 50% of cement replacement using ASTM Class F low calcium fly ash. Firstly, the available HVFA literature in which only fly has been used to replace cement, is categorized based on the replacement level and the mechanical and durability property results are summarized. Secondly, the remaining literature is categorized based on the different material additions to modify the HVFA concrete and the results are compared. The summarized results are discussed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reported results. The effect of each material addition on the HVFA concrete properties are also discussed to identify potentially more suitable additives for future development. Overall, this paper will provide an understanding of the current state of HVFA concrete research and the gaps in research for the development HVFA concrete containing higher replacement levels and achieving the required performance. Hence, summarised knowledge would significantly be beneficial to design prospective research towards a sustainable cement-free concrete using industrial waste. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Durability; HVFA concrete; Mechanical performance; Micro/nano additives; Sustainability","Cements; Concrete additives; Fly ash; Industrial research; Cement replacement; Cement replacement materials; High volume fly ash; High volume fly ash concrete; Low calcium fly ash; Mechanical and durability properties; Sustainable cements; Systematic literature review; Concretes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090032499

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests - the dominant boreal forest type - and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a ∼20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 °C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (∼45°N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (∼70°N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining. © 2020 The Author(s).

Estimation is challenging, however, because economic activity can worsen pollution but also independently improve health outcomes, confounding pollution–health estimates. We leverage variation in exposure to local particulate matter of diameter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) across Sub-Saharan Africa driven by distant dust export from the Sahara, a source uncorrelated with local economic activity. Combining data on a million births with local-level estimates of aerosol particulate matter, we find that an increase of 10 μg m–3 in local annual mean PM2.5 concentrations causes a 24% increase in infant mortality across our sample (95% confidence interval: 10–35%), similar to estimates from wealthier countries. We show that future climate change driven changes in Saharan rainfall—a control on dust export—could generate large child health impacts, and that seemingly exotic proposals to pump and apply groundwater to Saharan locations to reduce dust emission could be cost competitive with leading child health interventions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Climate change; Dust; Economics; Groundwater; Health; Particles (particulate matter); Aerosol particulate matters; Confidence interval; Economic activities; Health interventions; Infant mortality; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Sub-saharan africa; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087012813

The calcites separated from the sulfides of the No I and No II orebodies shared identical δ13CPDB values (− 5.3 to − 0.8 ‰) and δ18OSMOW values (+ 14.5 to + 21.8 ‰) with those of the calcites in the SYG region, suggesting that CO2 in regional ore-forming fluids possibly had a homologous C–O source that originated from a ternary mixture of the dissolution of marine carbonate rocks, degassing process of the Emeishan mantle plume, and dehydroxylation of sedimentary organic matter. The No. I-1 and No. I-2 orebody was hosted in the same strata, but the sulfur source of No. I-1 orebody (+ 13.1 to + 19.0 ‰) with equilibrated sulfur fractionation (δ34Ssphalerite &lt; δ34Sgalena) and No. I-2 orebody (+ 18.0 to + 21.8 ‰) with sulfur equilibrium fractionation (δ34Ssphalerite &gt; δ34Sgalena) were different. They were derived from the allopatry thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) of overlying Carboniferous sulfates in the ore-hosting strata and local TSR of sulfates in the ore-bearing Upper Devonian Zaige Formation, respectively. The narrow and uniform Pb isotopic ratios of single galena grains collected from sulfides with 206Pb/204Pb of 18.713–18.759, 207Pb/204Pb of 15.772–15.776 and 208Pb/204Pb of 39.383–39.467 indicate a well-mixed metal source(s) that consist of Proterozoic Kunyang and Huili Group basement rocks and Devonian to Middle Permian ore-hosting sedimentary rocks. Besides, the late Permian Emeishan basalts are difficult to contribute metals for regional Pb–Zn mineralization despite a closely spatial relationship with the distribution of the Pb–Zn deposit. This is supported by Pb isotopic ratios plotting above the average upper crustal Pb evolution curves and staying far away from that of the age-corrected Emeishan basalts. Hence, taking into account of the similarities in tectonic setting, ore-hosting rock, ore assemblage, wall rock alteration, ore-controlling structure, and ore-forming materials and the differences in relationship with regional magmatism, fluid inclusion characteristic and ore grade between the Maoping deposit and typical MVT Pb–Zn deposit, the ore genesis of the Maoping deposit should be an MVT like Pb–Zn deposit. © 2020, Science Press and Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Maoping Pb–Zn deposit; MVT-like deposit; Ore genesis; Ore-forming materials","Basalt; Biomarkers; Calcite; Deposits; Economic geology; Isotopes; Lead metallography; Mineralogy; Ore reduction; Ores; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Wall rock; Zinc deposits; Equilibrium fractionations; Marine carbonate rock; North-eastern yunnan provinces; Ore forming material; Ore-controlling structures; Sedimentary organic matter; Spatial relationships; Thermochemical sulfate reduction; Lead compounds; carbon isotope; carbonate rock; fluid inclusion; host rock; lead; lead isotope; metallogenesis; ore-forming fluid; orogeny; oxygen isotope; sulfur isotope; zinc; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089038017

The results of the scenario analyses show that taking into account the pollution emissions and public health, the gap of electricity tariff among different blocks should be limited, and that the coverage percentage is important in residential electricity consumption. Furthermore, based on the income levels and electricity consumption of different users, the electricity price policy reform should be taken to guide consumers to conserve electricity and reduce extravagant electricity consumption.

The first major carbon offset programme, the United Nations’ Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), has been criticized for generating a large number of credits from projects that do not actually reduce emissions. Following the controversial CDM experience, California pioneered a second-generation compliance offset programme that shifts the focus of quality control from assessments of individual projects to the development of offset protocols, which define project type-specific eligibility criteria and methods for estimating emissions reductions. We assess the ability of California’s ‘standardized approach’ to mitigate the risk of over-crediting greenhouse gas reductions by reviewing the development of two California offset protocols–Mine Methane Capture and Rice Cultivation. We examine the regulator’s treatment of three sources of over-crediting under the CDM: non-additional projects, inflated counterfactual baseline scenarios, and perverse incentives that inadvertently increase emissions. We find that the standardized approach offers the ability to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of over-crediting. This requires careful protocol-scale analysis, conservative methods for estimating reductions, ongoing monitoring of programme outcomes, and restricting participation to project types with manageable levels of uncertainty in emission reductions. However, several of these elements are missing from California’s regime, and even best practices result in significant uncertainty in true emission reductions. Relying on carbon offsets to lower compliance costs risks lessening total emission reductions and increases uncertainty in whether an emissions target has been met. Key policy insights Substantial and ongoing oversight by offset programme administrators is needed to contain uncertainty and avoid over-crediting. California’s Mine Methane Capture Protocol may have influenced federal decisions not to regulate methane emissions from coal mines on federally-owned lands. Government priorities and methodological choices drive outcomes in carbon pricing policies with large offset programmes, contrary to the common perception that these policies delegate decision-making to private actors. Offsets are better understood as a way for regulated emitters to invest in an incentive programme that achieves difficult-to-estimate emission reductions, than as accurately quantified tons of reductions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additionality; cap-and-trade; emissions trading; mine methane; Offsets; uncertainty","carbon emission; clean development mechanism; emission control; emissions trading; methane; uncertainty analysis; United Nations; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087501918

As requirements for water increase due to water scarcity and industrialization, it has become increasingly important to effectively detect and diagnose faults in water distribution systems in large buildings. In many cases, if water supply is not impacted, faults in water distribution systems can go unnoticed. This can lead to unnecessary increases in water usage and associated energy due to pumping, treating, and heating water. The majority of fault detection and diagnosis studies in the water sector are limited to municipal water supply and leakage detection. The application of detection and diagnosis for faults in building water networks remains largely unexplored and the ability to identify and distinguish between routine and non-routine water usage at this scale remains a challenge. This study using case-study data, presents the application of principal component analysis and a multi-class support vector machine to detect and classify faults for non-residential building water networks. In the absence of a process model (which is typical for such water distribution systems), principal component analysis is proposed as a data-driven fault detection technique for building water distribution systems for the first time herein. Hotelling T2-statistics and Q-statistics were employed to detect abnormality within incoming data, and a multi-class support vector machine was trained for fault classification. Despite the relatively limited training data available from the case-study (which would reflect the situation in many buildings), meaningful faults were detected, and the technique proved successful in discriminating between various types of faults in the water distribution system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared to a univariate threshold technique by comparison of their respective performance in the detection of faults that occurred in the case-study site. The results demonstrate the promising capabilities of the proposed fault detection and diagnosis approach. Such a strategy could provide a robust methodology that can be applied to buildings to reduce inefficient water use, reducing their life-cycle carbon footprint. © 2020","Fault detection and diagnosis; Non-routine events; Performance monitoring; Principal component analysis (PCA); Support vector machine (SVM); Water distribution system","Carbon footprint; Housing; Lead removal (water treatment); Life cycle; Metropolitan area networks; Municipal engineering; Support vector machines; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Water treatment; Detection and diagnosis; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault detection techniques; Limited training data; Multi-class support vector machines; Municipal water supplies; Residential building; Threshold techniques; Fault detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094861783

City of Paramount, CA, is one of these communities that encompasses several industrial facilities, including metal-processing and finishing companies, in close proximity to each other as well as to residential neighborhoods and sensitive receptors (e.g., schools and hospitals). Between 2016 and 2019, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted an extensive air monitoring campaign in this community to identify and address sources of airborne particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) and other toxic metals. Using portable air samplers, 24-hr time-integrated total suspended particulate (TSP) samples were collected every third or sixth day at a total of 49 different locations (including 12 local schools) throughout the city for Cr (VI) analysis. In certain areas, elevated levels of Cr (VI) were initially found; consequently, additional efforts were made to better characterize sources of Cr (VI) and other metals. As part of these efforts, hourly concentrations of 20 metals were also measured continuously over 1.5 years with Xact 625 (Cooper Environmental Services, OR, USA) at two locations within the community. Air monitoring results indicated a substantial reduction in ambient levels of Cr (VI) over time as a result of enforcement actions, rule developments, and voluntary emissions mitigations. Long-term continuous multi-metals measurements provided previously unknown information on the temporal trends of metals and elements, including their diurnal, day-of-the-week, and seasonal variations. The high time-resolution measurements also enabled investigating the impact of exceptional events (e.g., 4th of July fireworks) on the levels of ambient TSP-bound metals. A Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) source apportionment analysis on the continuous multi-metals data identified five major sources, two of which were associated with the nearby industrial emissions (together accounting for 9.8%–13.8% of total metals concentrations), while the other three were linked with resuspended soil (48.8%–69.8%), brake wear (7.3%–19.1%), and road dust (13.1%–18.3%), all with distinct profiles and temporal variations. Results from this study show how a strategic air monitoring can lead to the discovery of emission sources, and how concurrent inspection and enforcement actions along with voluntary control measures by facilities can result in substantial emission reductions. Highly time-resolved source apportionment results coupled with wind data also provide valuable information on the dynamic variation in source activity and allowed for the identification of the most probable source locations that led to elevated concentrations at the receptor sites. © 2020","Community air monitoring; Environmental justice; Metals; Source apportionment","Air quality; Concurrency control; Emission control; Factorization; Finishing; Location; Metals; Particles (particulate matter); Quality management; Soil pollution; Elevated concentrations; Environmental services; Integrated measurements; Positive Matrix Factorization; Residential neighborhoods; South Coast Air Quality Management District; Substantial reduction; Total suspended particulates; Chromium compounds; chromium; element; metal; air sampling; atmospheric pollution; chromium; concentration (composition); emission inventory; environmental justice; particulate matter; pollution exposure; source apportionment; spatial analysis; trend analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; California; city; concentration (parameter); dust; fire; hospital; neighborhood; nonpoint source pollution; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; residential area; school; suspended particulate matter; time; California; Los Angeles Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089796878

In the event of a volcanic eruption, fast and robust decisions need to be made by aviation authorities about which routes are safe to operate. Such decisions take into account forecasts of ash location issued by Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) which are informed by simulations from Volcanic Ash Transport and Dispersion (VATD) models. The estimation of the time-evolving vertical distribution of ash emissions for use in VATD simulations in real time is difficult which can lead to large uncertainty in these forecasts. This study presents a method for constraining the ash emission estimates by combining an inversion modeling technique with an ensemble of meteorological forecasts, resulting in an ensemble of ash emission estimates. These estimates of ash emissions can be used to produce a robust ash forecast consistent with observations. This new ensemble approach is applied to the 2011 eruption of the Icelandic volcano Grímsvötn. The resulting emission profiles each have a similar temporal evolution but there are differences in the magnitude of ash emitted at different heights. For this eruption, the impact of precipitation uncertainty (and the associated wet deposition of ash) on the estimate of the total amount of ash emitted is larger than the impact of the uncertainty in the wind fields. Despite the differences that are dominated by wet deposition uncertainty, the ensemble inversion provides confidence that the reduction of the unconstrained emissions (a priori), particularly above 4 km, is robust across all members. In this case, the use of posterior emission profiles greatly reduces the magnitude and extent of the forecast ash cloud. The ensemble of posterior emission profiles gives a range of ash column loadings much closer in agreement with a set of independent satellite retrievals in comparison to the a priori emissions. Furthermore, airspace containing volcanic ash concentrations deemed to be associated with the highest risk (likelihood of exceeding a high concentration threshold) to aviation are reduced by over 85%. Such improvements could have large implications in emergency response situations. Future research will focus on quantifying the impact of uncertainty in precipitation forecasts on wet deposition in other eruptions and developing an inversion system that makes use of the state-of-the-art meteorological ensembles which has the potential to be used in an operational setting. © 2020 by the authors.

It can be regarded as a suite of pollutants since PM covers a very wide range of particle sizes and also has a diverse chemical composition. Historically, much of the PM arose from coal burning and was measured as black smoke. However, in the second half of the twentieth century in developed countries, there was a reduction in black smoke emissions from coal burning and PM steadily became dominated by carbonaceous particles from road traffic exhaust and the secondary pollutants, ammonium salts and secondary organic carbon. This is exemplified by the composition of fine particles (referred to as PM 2.5) as measured in London, Delhi and Beijing. Steadily, as control strategies have addressed the more tractable sources of emissions, so sources previously regarded as unconventional have emerged and have been seen to make a significant contribution to airborne PM concentrations. Among these are non-exhaust particles from road traffic, cooking aerosol and wood smoke. The particle size distribution of airborne PM is hugely diverse, ranging from newly formed particles of a few nanometres in diameter through to particles of tens of micrometres in diameter. There has been a great deal of interest in ultrafine (nano) particles because of suspicions of enhanced toxicity, and as traffic emissions decrease as a source, so regional nucleation processes have become much bigger relative contributors to particle number, but not mass.

This paper’s aim is to study the effects on (1) primary energy use, (2) GHG emissions and (3) energy and CO2 costs when energy end-use efficiency measures are implemented in the electrolysis. Significant savings in final and primary energy use, GHG emissions and energy and CO2 costs can be achieved by implementing the studied measures. Vertical electrode cells and the combination of inert anodes and wettable cathodes are among the measures with the highest savings in all three areas (primary energy use, GHG emissions and energy and CO2 costs). Direct carbothermic reduction is one of the measures with the highest savings in primary energy use and energy and CO2 costs. For GHG emissions, direct carbothermic reduction is the more beneficial choice in regions with a high proportion of coal power, while inert anodes are the more beneficial choice in regions with a high proportion of low-carbon electricity. Although a company potentially can save more money by implementing the direct carbothermic reduction, the company should consider implementing the vertical electrode cells together with other energy-saving technologies since this would yield the largest GHG emission savings while providing similar cost savings as the direct carbothermic reduction. It may be necessary to impose a price on GHG emissions in order to make inert anodes cost-effective on their own, although further evaluations are needed in this regard. There is a potential to achieve carbon-neutrality in the reduction of aluminium oxide to pure aluminium. © 2020, The Author(s).","Aluminium industry; Direct carbothermic reduction; Energy and CO2 cost saving; Energy saving; GHG emission saving; Primary energy consumption saving","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anodes; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbothermal reduction; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electrolysis; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Aluminium oxide; Aluminium production; Carbon neutralities; Energy-saving technologies; Low-carbon electricities; Primary energy use; Vertical electrodes; Wettable cathodes; Greenhouse gases; aluminum; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electrokinesis; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089859825

Soil organic carbon fractions, such as particulate organic carbon is the most sensitive indicator in improving soil organic matter and soil quality. We determined particulate organic matter-carbon (POM-C) and mineral associated carbon (MAC) in Bengkulu and West Java Provinces Indonesia. The study areas were grain crop fields, secondary forest, 5 yr-oil palm plantation, 10 yr-oil palm plantation, 15 yr-oil palm plantation and 25 yr-oil palm plantation. Soil organic carbon fraction magnitudes varied in the surface of 0 to 30 cm of grain crop fields, secondary forest and oil palm plantations. Twenty five year-oil palm plantation provided the largest total organic carbon, while 5 yr-oil palm plantation and grain crop fields contained similar amount of total organic C. Both POM-C and MAC fractions were increased in the plantation sites with oil palm trees and secondary forest compared to the grain crop fields. The plantation sites had a larger POM-C content than grain crop fields, but the increase of POM-C was limited to the surface of 0 to 10 cm of soil. Carbon stock in 0-30 cm under oil palm plantations were reduced up to 20% compared to secondary forests and 28% compared to rubber plantations in Bengkulu and West Java Provinces. On average, converting forest to plantations led to a loss of 10 Mg C/ha after about 10 years of conversion. However, the C stock in the subsoil was similar under the forest and the plantations in Bengkulu. Further, limited C input from litter would eventually cause more losses of SOC in oil palm plantations compared to rubber plantations. In conclusion, investigating the deeper profiles and soil erosion may be an important tool to unfold the trends of soil organic carbon fraction dynamics and magnitudes after the conversion of natural ecosystems to intensive plantations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon sequestration; crop field; deforestation; particulate organic matter; plantation","Biogeochemistry; Crops; Forestry; Grain (agricultural product); Organic carbon; Planning; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Soil quality; Sustainable development; System-on-chip; Carbon sequestration; Oil palm plantations; Particulate organic carbon; Particulate organic matters; Sensitive indicator; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matters; Total Organic Carbon; Palm oil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096353192

Therefore, this paper presents novel radial basis function (RBF) based on affinity propagation (AP) clustering to evaluate the energy performance and save the energy of buildings. The number of hidden layer nodes of the RBF are obtained by the AP. Then main factors affecting the energy consumption of buildings are used as inputs and outputs of the RBF to build the energy performance and saving model of buildings. Compared with other neural networks, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated though University of California Irvine datasets. Finally, the proposed method is applied in energy saving and emission reduction of construction industries. In the first case, doubling the roof area and halving the overall height of buildings are obtained. And the heating and cooling loads of buildings are reduced by 56.35% and 50.06%, respectively. In the second case, the humidity outside is increased by 12.45%.

Herein, we report a facile method by modifying a Cu foil surface with a layer of porous carbon. The structure of carbon has a major influence on C1 and C2,3 product selectivity. A carbon aerogel modifier leads to higher C2,3 product formation than that of a carbon black modifier, demonstrating the non-innocent role of carbon materials. In both cases, major surface reconstruction on the Cu foil-such as pitting and particle formation-is observed during electrocatalysis. In addition, the restructured Cu surface shows distinctly lower activity toward CO2 reduction when the carbon modifier is removed. This is likely due to the fact that the carbon modifiers influence the product distribution by (i) modulating the local pH and CO2 concentration by serving as a highly porous and hydrophobic barrier, and (ii) restructuring the metal surface that generates more active sites. Our findings illustrate that the carbon in carbon-based catalysts can have an disproportionate role in directing product formation in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction.","carbon aerogels; electrocatalysis; electrochemical corrosion; electrode−electrolyte interface; morphology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092945356

We examined the effects of spatial mono- and polycentricity on PM2.5 concentrations using spatial econometric models based on a three-year panel of data for cities at, or above, the prefecture in China. We found that population density had a robust moderating effect. That is, all else being equal, PM2.5 concentrations are lower when low-density cities have a strong-monocentric spatial structure and when high-density cities are polycentric. We estimated the population density threshold at which point the relationship between structure and density changes at about 160 persons/km.2 Our findings can serve as a possible criterion for differentiating low- and high-density cities in China and guide policymakers in planning optimal urban structures to mitigate air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Moderating effect; Mono-centricity; PM2.5 concentrations; Polycentricity; Population density; Urban spatial structure","concentration (composition); econometrics; particulate matter; population density; spatial data; urban planning; urban population; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090715808

An accurate estimate of China s FFCO2 emissions is a prerequisite for global and regional carbon budget analyses and the monitoring of carbon emission reduction efforts. However, significant uncertainties and discrepancies exist in estimations of China s FFCO2 emissions due to a lack of detailed traceable emission factors (EFs) and multiple statistical data sources. Here, we evaluated China s FFCO2 emissions from nine published global and regional emission datasets. These datasets show that the total emissions increased from 3.4 (3.0 3.7) in 2000 to 9.8 (9.2 10.4) Gt CO2 yr-1 in 2016. The variations in these estimates were largely due to the different EF (0.491 0.746 t C per t of coal) and activity data. The large-scale patterns of gridded emissions showed a reasonable agreement, with high emissions being concentrated in major city clusters, and the standard deviation mostly ranged from 10% to 40% at the provincial level. However, patterns beyond the provincial scale varied significantly, with the top 5% of the grid level accounting for 50 % 90% of total emissions in these datasets. Our findings highlight the significance of using locally measured EF for Chinese coal. To reduce uncertainty, we recommend using physical CO2 measurements and use these values for dataset validation, key input data sharing (e.g., point sources), and finer-resolution validations at various levels. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Land use regression models are effective in predicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants, and have been widely used in many cities in Europe, North America and China. To reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 and PM10 in Xi'an during the heating seasons, the authors established two regression prediction models using PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from 181 monitoring stations and 87 independent variables. The model results are as follows: for PM2.5, R2 = 0.713 and RMSE = 8.355 μg/m3; for PM10, R2 = 0.681 and RMSE = 14.842 μg/m3. In addition to the traditional independent variables such as area of green space and road length, the models also include the numbers of pollutant discharging enterprises, restaurants, and bus stations. The prediction results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 and PM10 in the heating seasons of Xi'an. These results also indicate that the spatial distribution of pollutants is closely related to the layout of industrial land and the location of enterprises that generate air pollution emissions. Green space can mitigate pollution, and the contribution of traffic emission is less than that of industrial emission. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply land use regression models to the Fenwei Plain, a heavily polluted area in China. It provides a scientific foundation for urban planning, land use regulation, air pollution control, and public health policy making. It also establishes a basic model for population exposure assessment, and promotes the sustainability of urban environments. © 2020","Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Land use regression; Respirable particulate matter (PM10); Spatial distribution; Xi'an City","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Forecasting; Green manufacturing; Industrial emissions; Land use; Logistic regression; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Atmospheric pollutants; Distribution characteristics; Land-use regression models; PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations; Population exposure assessments; Public health policies; Regression predictions; Scientific foundations; Spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086889308

Weighing both sustainable development and environmental protection, the Environmental Protection Tax Law was implemented in 2018 in China. This research employed a Bayesian space-time model to identify the impacts of the environmental protection tax on PM2.5 pollution (IEPTPM2.5P) at the provincial level in 2018 in China, combining remotely sensed and in-situ monitoring data. Then the influence factors of the IEPTPM2.5P was investigated using a Bayesian LASSO regression model. Results indicate that the IEPTPM2.5P resulted in a decreasing trend of annual PM2.5 concentrations in 31 provinces. The spatial pattern of the IEPTPM2.5P presented a distinct geographical feature. The highest five IEPTPM2.5P occurred in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, and Hebei, and the corresponding values were −1.81, −1.79, −1.52, −1.51, and −1.47 μg/m3 per year, respectively. Tourism output value associated negatively with the IEPTPM2.5P, and the other five variables associated positively with the IEPTPM2.5P. The urbanisation rate and relief amplitude were the top two influencing factors, with contributions of 36.3% and 19.3%, respectively. The IEPTPM2.5P increased 0.0141 μg/m3 per year (95% credibility interval (CI): 0.0013, 0.0259) if the urbanisation rate increased one percentage point. The influencing contributions and magnitudes of the tax rate for air pollutants and the environmental tax revenue are 9.6% and 12.1%, 0.0016 (95% CI:−0.0038, 0.0076) and 0.0108 (95% CI:−0.0188, 0.0412) μg/m3 per year, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian LASSO model; Bayesian spatiotemporal model; Environmental protection tax; Influence factors; PM25pollution","air quality; Bayesian analysis; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; environmental tax; particulate matter; provincialism; sustainable development; air pollutant; air quality; article; China; controlled study; environmental protection; tourism; urbanization; air pollution; Bayes theorem; China; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; particulate matter; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bayes Theorem; Beijing; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088035706

The present study utilizes methane diffusion flame with water vapor additive to analyze the effectiveness of the novel water-assisted synthesis of CNT in reducing amorphous carbon formation. Flame shape, temperature, and CNT growth region within the water-assisted flame were analyzed at varying fuel and oxygen concentration. The amorphous carbon layer thickness (ACLT) is analyzed through cross-sectional analysis of the CNT growth region using a developed bend wire method. A 50% increase in fuel concentration results in the increase in axial extent of the growth region by 37.5% followed by an increase in the ACLT by 20%. Meanwhile, an 8% increase in oxygen concentration results in the decrease of growth region axial extent by 82% with a 35% reduction in ACLT. On average, water vapor additive produces an additional 17.3% reduction in ACLT in any flame composition. Both the reduction in ACLT as oxygen and water concentration is independently increased happen due to the carbon supply regulation. However, since the change in the growth temperature that happens at varying oxygen concentration is not observed at varying water concentration, the carbon supply regulation in both situations is remarkably different as explained by the water-gas shift reaction. © 2020","Amorphous carbon layer; Carbon nanotubes synthesis; Diffusion flame; Flame synthesis; Nanomaterial","Additives; Amorphous carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst deactivation; Chemical shift; Fuels; Nanocatalysts; Oxygen supply; Synthesis (chemical); Water gas shift; Water vapor; Amorphous carbon layer; Catalyst nano particles; Cross sectional analysis; Flame composition; Fuel concentration; Oxygen concentrations; Water concentrations; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Flame synthesis; carbon; carbon nanotube; fuel; methane; oxygen; water; Article; catalyst; chemical reaction; concentration (parameter); cross-sectional study; feasibility study; flame; gas diffusion; growth; nanoencapsulation; oxygen concentration; particle size; priority journal; synthesis; temperature; thickness; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087856124

Given limited carbon inputs from plant material, heterotrophic fungi likely use unconventional sources of carbon in these systems. A baiting method was used to culture keratinophilic fungi from biocrust and rhizosphere soils in an arid grassland in Utah, USA. Fungi were baited using llama and sheep wool, horsehair, and snakeskin on two media, and pure cultures were identified using ITS and LSU rRNA sequences. One hundred-eighteen fungal colonies were grown, representing a total of 32 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 97 % similarity. Cultures were dominated by the phylum Ascomycota (88 %) followed by Mucoromycota (8.6 %) and Basidiomycota (3.4 %). The orders Pleosporales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, and Sordariales were commonly isolated, with the dominant taxa Alternaria (27 %), Aspergillus (22 %), Fusarium (11 %), and Chaetomium (8%). Thirty percent of the fungi isolated have the capacity to degrade keratin in vitro using a keratin azure assay, with Penicillium showing the highest degradation followed by Geomyces, Alternaria, and Fusarium. Although keratin degraders can be infectious, dermatophytes associated with skin infections were not isolated in culture or detected in Illumina sequencing. Illumina sequencing was used to determine general patterns in seasonal variation and habitat preference of keratinophiles. Alternaria was the most abundant genus with >70 % of the sequences. The combination of Illumina data with culture-dependent approaches facilitated the characterization of a specialized community and confirmed the low abundance of dermatophytes in this arid site. © 2020","Alternaria; Fungal baiting; Fungal cultures; Keratin; Seasonal variation","Biodegradation; Carbon; Ecosystems; Keratin; RNA; Soils; Environmental conditions; Fungal community; General patterns; Habitat preferences; Operational taxonomic units; Rhizosphere soils; Seasonal variation; Soil surface temperatures; Fungi; abundance estimation; desert soil; fungus; genetic analysis; heterotrophy; identification method; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil temperature; United States; Utah; Alternaria; Arthrodermataceae; Ascomycota; Aspergillus; Basidiomycota; Chaetomium; Eurotiales; Fungi; Fusarium; Geomyces; Hypocreales; Lama (mammal); Otus; Ovis aries; Penicillium; Pleosporales; Sordariales; keratin; bacterial count; biodiversity; classification; desert climate; ecosystem; fungus; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; microbiology; mycobiome; phylogeny; rhizosphere; season; Biodiversity; Colony Count, Microbial; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Fungi; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Keratins; Mycobiome; Phylogeny; Rhizosphere; Seasons; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087161468

While field campaigns targeting either basin meteorology or wintertime pollution chemistry have been conducted, coupling between interconnected chemical and meteorological processes remains an insufficiently studied research area. Gaps in understanding the coupled chemical-meteorological interactions that drive high-pollution events make identification of the most effective air-basin specific emission control strategies challenging. To address this, a September 2019 workshop occurred with the goal of planning a future research campaign to investigate air quality in western U.S. basins. Approximately 120 people participated, representing 50 institutions and five countries. Workshop participants outlined the rationale and design for a comprehensive wintertime study that would couple atmospheric chemistry and boundary layer and complex-terrain meteorology within western U.S. basins. Participants concluded the study should focus on two regions with contrasting aerosol chemistry: three populated valleys within Utah (Salt Lake, Utah, and Cache Valleys) and the San Joaquin Valley in California. This paper describes the scientific rationale for a campaign that will acquire chemical and meteorological datasets using airborne platforms with extensive range, coupled to surface-based measurements focusing on sampling within the near-surface boundary layer, and transport and mixing processes within this layer, with high vertical resolution at a number of representative sites. No prior wintertime basin-focused campaign has provided the breadth of observations necessary to characterize the meteorological-chemical linkages outlined here, nor to validate complex processes within coupled atmosphere-chemistry models. ©2021 American Meteorological Society.","Aircraft observations; Atmospheric; Chemistry; Field experiments; Greenhouse gases; Mountain meteorology","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layers; Emission control; Landforms; Meteorology; Mixing; Aerosol concentration; Air basins; Aircraft observations; Atmospheric; Cold air pools; Field campaign; Field experiment; Greenhouses gas; Mountain meteorologies; Research areas; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119719649

Consequently, semi-arid and dry areas have been identified as vulnerable land, requiring attention from both science and policy perspectives. In some regions, such as the Mediterranean region, land degradation is particularly intense, although there are no extreme ecological conditions. In these contexts, a wide range of formal and informal responses is necessary to face particularly complex and spatially differentiated territorial processes. However, the fit of responses has been demonstrated to be different over time and space according to the underlying socioeconomic context and the specific ecological conditions. The present commentary discusses this sort of “entropy” in the policy response to land degradation in Southern Europe, outlining the intrinsic complexity of human–nature dynamics at the base of such processes. Reflecting the need of differentiated regional strategies and more specific national measures to combat desertification, three policy frameworks (agro-environmental, economic, social) with an indirect impact on fighting land degradation have been considered, delineating the importance of policy assemblages. Finally, the importance of policy impact assessment methodologies was highlighted, focusing on the possible responses reinforcing a continental strategy against land degradation. By evidencing the role of participatory planning, developmental policies indirectly addressing land degradation reveal to be an important vector of more specific measures abating desertification risk, creating, in turn, a favorable context for direct interventions of mitigation or adaptation to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

The hourly concentrations of PM2.5 were obtained from the Isfahan Department of Environment and Isfahan Air Quality Monitoring Center. Then, the 24-h mean concentration of PM2.5 for each station was calculated using the Excel software. According to the results, the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 in 2014–2019 was 29.9–50.9 μg/m3, approximately 3–5 times higher than the WHO guideline (10 μg/m3). The data showed that people of Isfahan in almost 58% to 96% of the days of a year were exposed to PM2.5 higher than the WHO daily guideline. The concentrations of PM2.5 in cold months such as October, November, December and January were higher than those in the other months. The zoning of the annual concentrations of PM2.5 in urban areas showed that the highest PM2.5 concentrations were related to the northern, northwestern, southern and central areas of the city. On average, from 2014 to 2019, the number of deaths due to natural mortality, lung cancer (LC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke associated with ambient PM2.5 were 948, 16, 18, 281 and 60, respectively. The present study estimated that on average, 14.29% of the total mortality, 17.2% of lung cancer (LC), 15.54% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 17.12% of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and 14.94% of stroke mortalities were related to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5.

Kabul city the capital of Afghanistan has felt this propagating problem from the establishment of its new administration in 2001. The rapid population growth urbanization, low capacity of roads, and lack of a comprehensive strategy to manage traffic systems and tackle traffic congestions are the leading contributors to the traffic congestion problem. Therefore, it is vital to utilize advanced software tools to explore possible solutions to the traffic congestion problem. This study was aimed to evaluate and analyze Baraki Intersection in Kabul city Afghanistan using SIDRA INTERSECTION 5 software. It assessed traffic performance in one of the most important junctions in Kabul based on parameters such as Level of service, delays, Queue, Fuel consumption and production of CO2, CO, (CH2O)n, NO x. The results showed that there was a notable time delay, dangerous amount of emissions and low level of service (LOS F). After a comprehensive investigation of the results it was concluded that building an underpass from north to south direction will significantly reduce delays and emissions and increase the level of service until 2030. © 2020 IEEE.","Greenhouse Gasses Emissions; Level of Service; Pollution; Sidra Intersection; Traffic Congestion",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097680994

If cloud providers fail to meet changing demands during peak hours, they may experience service requests’ delays and rejections, damaging both their reputation and their profit margin. The idea of cloud federations is contemplated as a solution to this challenge by allowing a group of cloud providers to combine their resources, as and when required, to satisfy client requests dynamically. Despite the merits of the existing cloud federation approaches, they suffer from several limitations, such as performance issues, the inability to converge to a solution in complex scenarios, the lack of consideration of SLA requirements during the federation formation phase, and the lack of flexibility offered to clients to prioritize specific objectives during the formation of the cloud federation. This work addresses these deficiencies by presenting a green, practical, and customizable SLA-based approach to cloud federation formation. Inspired by social gaming, the proposed approach can rapidly form a stable coalition of cloud providers able to fulfill client requests, while ensuring the satisfaction of SLA requirements in terms of performance, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and providers’ trustfulness. At the heart of this approach lies a new coalition formation algorithm, dubbed the “multi-criterion coalition formation algorithm (MCCF).” Unlike existing collation formation algorithms, the MCCF algorithm offers clients the flexibility to prioritize the objectives used for cloud federation formation. Based on those preferences, the MCCF algorithm generates stable SLA-aware groups of cloud providers that dynamically adapt to network changes using a self-healing process. The MCCF algorithm has been implemented and extensively tested using a wide range of scenarios, and its performance was compared with that of two state of the art approaches: The optimal approach and the split-and-merge approach. The results show that the MCCF algorithm outperforms the optimal and the split-and-merge approaches in terms of coalition size, individual providers’ payoff, and mistrust cost. Moreover, the proposed approach yields a zero % request rejection rate and an execution time that is 8 to 16 times faster than the split-and-merge and optimal approaches, while enabling a reduction of the Carbon footprint of the cloud coalition operations. Owing to these advantages and its ability to offer a flexible and customizable solution to clients, the MCCF algorithm represents a promising and environmentally conscious cloud collation formation approach that is ideal for real-time applications and practical cloud deployments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud federation; Coalition formation; Energy and trust awareness; Social games","Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Mergers and acquisitions; Trusted computing; Coalition formations; Coalition operations; Optimal approaches; Performance issues; Real-time application; Request rejections; Self-healing process; Split-and-merge approach; Green computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083880617

The “Vulcan Project” is an effort to estimate bottom-up carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production (FFCO2) for the U.S. landscape at space and time scales that satisfy both scientific and policy needs. Here, we report on the Vulcan version 3.0 which quantifies emissions at a resolution of 1 km2/hr for the 2010–2015 time period. We estimate 2011 FFCO2 emissions of 1,589.9 TgC with a 95% confidence interval of 1,367/1,853 TgC (−14.0%/+16.6%), implying a one-sigma uncertainty of ~ ±8%. Per capita emissions are larger in states dominated by electricity production and industrial activity and smaller where onroad and building emissions dominate. The U.S. FFCO2 emissions center of mass (CoM) is located in the state of Missouri with mean seasonality that moves on a near-elliptical NE/SW path. Comparison to ODIAC, a global gridded FFCO2 emissions estimate, shows large total emissions differences (100.4 TgC for year 2011), a spatial correlation of 0.68 (R2), and a mean absolute relative difference at the 1 km2 scale of 104.3%. The Vulcan data product offers a high-resolution estimate of FFCO2 emissions in every U.S. city, obviating costly development of self-reported urban inventories.

However, after nearly a decade of implementation, it is still unclear whether this policy legitimately has the effects of energy-saving and emission-reduction. The present study aims to estimate the nationwide effects of CCCP at city level, which has not been fully studied in the past. For this purpose, a combined propensity score matching and difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) model is adopted to investigate policy effect and its heterogeneity in terms of energy structure, SO2 emissions and energy intensity. In addition, the superposition effect and the marginal effect of energy-saving and emission-reduction policies for electricity industry (ESERE) are investigated for the first time. The simulation results of PSM-DID model reveal that the implementation of CCCP heightens the share of electricity consumption in pilot cities by 4.898%.

The primary challenge in studying the mechanism is to determine the adsorption states of CO2, since complicated metal surfaces often result in many different adsorption sites. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed a computational study on the adsorption of CO2 on the Ag electrode surface. The results show that the adsorption populations of CO2 are extremely sensitive to the adsorption sites. Importantly, we found a new preferable adsorption position which is the step site of the (211) surface, having both oxygen atoms interacting with Ag atoms. Moreover, the adsorption populations were found with the order of (211)&gt;(110)&gt;(111)&gt;(100). Subsequently, the adsorption characteristics were correlated with p orbital energies, the d-band positions and charge transfers between Ag surfaces and CO2. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO2 adsorption; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Silver",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092206391

It remains challenging, however, to develop a membrane with high levels of both permeance and selectivity with the ability to capture CO2 in a highly efficient manner. Herein, we report amino-decorated organosilica membranes that are based on a facile and effective co-polymerization strategy that uses bis(triethoxysilyl)acetylene (BTESA) and (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) precursors. This co-polymerization strategy simultaneously endows the resultant membranes with a controlled pore size and enhanced CO2-philic properties that have significantly improved CO2 separation performance. These composite membranes display CO2 permeance that ranges from 2550–3230 GPU and a range for CO2/N2 selectivity of 31–42 in the separation of CO2/N2 mixtures, which outperforms most state-of-the-art membranes and exceeds the target for post-combustion CO2 capture operations. A satisfying performance was achieved with a CO2 permeance of 8 ✕ 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 (2390 GPU) and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 70. The present study highlights an elegant decoration strategy for the production of membranes with ultrahigh CO2 capture capacities, which can also be extended to other organosilica precursors for target-oriented separations by varying the bridged or side-chain groups. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Affinity; APTES; BTESA; CO2 capture; Pore size control","Composite membranes; Copolymerization; Energy efficiency; Investments; Membrane technology; Pore size; Silica; CO2 separation; Membrane based separation technologies; Organosilicas; Post-combustion; State of the art; Target oriented; Triethoxysilane; Triethoxysilyl; Carbon dioxide; 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane; acetylene derivative; bis(triethoxysilyl)acetylene; carbon dioxide; methane; organosilicon derivative; unclassified drug; adsorption; Article; carbon dioxide evolution; chemical structure; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gas permeability; membrane permeability; molecular size; polymerization; pore size; pore volume; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; Carbon Dioxide; Copolymerization; Membranes; Permeability; Pore Size; Selectivity; Separation; Silica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087040534

While various compounds have been demonstrated to affect soil microbes, most data are case-specific and do not provide generalizable predictions on their effects. Here we show that the chemical structural affiliation of low-molecular weight compounds typically secreted by plant roots—sugars, amino acids, organic acids and phenolic acids—can predictably affect microbiome diversity, composition and functioning in terms of plant disease suppression. We amended soil with single or mixtures of representative compounds, mimicking carbon deposition by plants. We then assessed how different classes of compounds, or their combinations, affected microbiome composition and the protection of tomato plants from the soil-borne Ralstonia solanacearum bacterial pathogen. We found that chemical class predicted well the changes in microbiome composition and diversity. Organic and amino acids generally decreased the microbiome diversity compared to sugars and phenolic acids. These changes were also linked to disease incidence, with amino acids and nitrogen-containing compound mixtures inducing more severe disease symptoms connected with a reduction in bacterial community diversity. Together, our results demonstrate that low-molecular weight compounds can predictably steer rhizosphere microbiome functioning providing guidelines to engineer microbiomes based on root exudation patterns by specific plant cultivars or crop regimes.

This work shows that defensible, provider- and time-specific emissions projections can be derived from two major factors: committed emissions from existing power plants and policy restrictions on future system characteristics. This letter introduces a bottom-up, power plant-based model that projects utility-specific annual average greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of electricity in the U.S. state of California for 2018-2050, believed to be the first openly available GHG emissions model with utility-specific projections. California is a useful case study for testing in part because of its strict regulatory GHG targets and the complexity of its electricity system, including limited asset ownership by utilities and substantial reliance on imported electricity. This plant-based approach to emissions projections bounds uncertainty in a way that less infrastructurally grounded approaches cannot. For example, emissions from unspecified sources of power can be estimated based on available plants. Based on historical power plant lifetimes, existing policy, and default model assumptions, the CO2 intensity of Californian electricity is projected to drop from 175 kg CO2/MWh (sales + losses, 2020) to 95 kg CO2/MWh by 2030, operationally decarbonizing by 2047. Upstream methane leakage increases GHG intensity of natural gas-fired power plants by about 30%, assuming a 100 year time horizon and national average estimates for leakage (which likely underestimate leakage for California). Although drivers like market conditions also affect future outcomes, California's current policy targets do not appear to require early retirement for utility generation assets, though up to about two gigawatts of extant in-state merchant capacity might be affected. Under current policy, new generating assets must either comply with the 100% clean electricity standard by 2045 or stop selling in California before the end of their expected useful life. © 2020 The Author(s).

To meet changes in capacity and post-COVID-19 passenger processing, airport infrastructure such as terminal buildings, airfields, and ground service equipment require substantial upgrades. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but that estimate excludes airport construction and operation. Metrics that assess an airport's sustainability, in addition to environmental impacts that are sometimes unaccounted for (e.g. water consumption), are necessary for a more complete environmental accounting of the entire aviation sector. This review synthesizes the current state of environmental sustainability metrics and methods (e.g. life-cycle assessment, Scope GHG emissions) for airports as identified in 108 peer-reviewed journal articles and technical reports. Articles are grouped according to six categories (Energy and Atmosphere, Comfort and Health, Water and Wastewater, Site and Habitat, Material and Resources, Multidimensional) of an existing airport sustainability assessment framework. A case study application of the framework is evaluated for its efficacy in yielding performance objectives. Research interest in airport environmental sustainability is steadily increasing, but there is ample need for more systematic assessment that accounts for a variety of emissions and regional variation. Prominent research themes include analyzing the GHG emissions from airfield pavements and energy management strategies for airport buildings. Research on water conservation, climate change resilience, and waste management is more limited, indicating that airport environmental accounting requires more analysis. A disconnect exists between research efforts and practices implemented by airports. Effective practices such as sourcing low-emission electricity and electrifying ground transportation and gate equipment can in the short term aid airports in moving towards sustainability goals. Future research must emphasize stakeholder involvement, life-cycle assessment, linking environmental impacts with operational outcomes, and global challenges (e.g. resilience, climate change adaptation, mitigation of infectious diseases). © 2020 The Author(s).

In coastal areas, this CO2-enriched seawater mixes with waters affected by seasonal degradation of organic material loaded externally from watersheds or produced as a response to nutrient enrichment. As a result, coastal bivalves often experience strong seasonal changes in carbonate chemistry. In some cases, these changes may resemble those experienced by aquacultured bivalves during translocation activities. We mimicked these changes by exposing juvenile hard clams (500 μm, Mercenaria mercenaria) to pCO2 in laboratory upwellers at levels resembling those already reported for northeastern U.S. estuaries (mean upweller pCO2 = 773, 1274, and 1838 μatm) and then transplanting to three grow-out sites along an expected nutrient gradient in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island (154 bags of 100 clams). Prior to the field grow-out, clams exposed to elevated pCO2 exhibited larger shells but lower dry weight per unit volume (dw/V). However, percent increase in dw/V was highest for this group during the 27-day field grow-out, suggesting that individuals with low dw/V after the laboratory treatment accelerated accumulation of dw/V when they were transferred to the bay. Treatments also appeared to affect shell mineral structure and condition of digestive diverticula. Although treatment effects diminished during the field grow-out, clams that were preexposed for several weeks to high pCO2 would likely have been temporarily vulnerable to predation or other factors that interact with shell integrity. This would be expected to reduce population recovery from short-term exposures to high pCO2. Published 2020.

Those emissions are part of the so-called non-exhaust emissions, which play an increasing role for particle emissions from transportation. The authors propose a laboratory test setup by using a brake dynamometer and a constant volume sampling approach to determine the emissions in regard to the particle number concentration. Several impacts were investigated while the same test cycle (novel worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (novel-WLTP)) was applied. In a first item, the importance of the bedding process was investigated and it is shown that friction couples without bedding emit much more particles. Furthermore, the efforts for reaching a bedded friction state are discussed. Additionally, the impact of brake lining compositions is investigated and shows that NAO concepts own crucial advantages in terms of brake particle emissions. Another impact, the vehicle weight and inertia, respectively, shows how important lightweight measures and brake cooling improvements are. Finally, the role of the load profile is discussed, which shows the importance of driving parameters like vehicle speed and reservoir dynamics. The authors show that, under urban driving conditions, extreme low particle emissions are detected. Furthermore, it is explained that off-brake emissions can play a relevant role in regard to brake particle emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

The European Union’s direction for the use of renewable energy is distributed generation and an increased use of by-products and organic waste, especially in the production of next-generation biofuels. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the production potential of straw in Poland and the possibility of its use for energy purposes, including a forecast for 2030, on the assumption that the management of this resource is in accordance with the provisions of the Polish Code for Good Agriculture Practice. In Poland, in the years 1999–2018, the average annual surplus of straw harvested over agricultural consumption equalled 12.5 million tons (4.2 Mtoe). Its largest surpluses were in the Dolno´ slaskie, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Lubelskie, Wielkopolskie, and Zachodniopomorskie voivodeships (NUTS2). Based on the developed panel models, forecasts for straw surpluses in Poland are presented in three perspectives: realistic, pessimistic, and optimistic.

Factors affecting the vegetative trait diversity of their plant communities are well studied, but those affecting their floral diversity are not. Local factors, such as land-use intensification and soil characteristics, can greatly influence floral trait diversity in semi-natural grasslands, which in turn can influence pollination function. We selected 16 semi-natural grasslands in France along a local land-use intensification gradient. Floral functional diversity indices were calculated from measurements of five floral traits known to influence interactions with pollinators: flower area, flowering height, floral reflectance, nectar tube depth and nectar sugar production per floral unit. Using linear mixed models, we found a negative influence of phosphorus soil content, and a positive influence of a composite soil variable including soil texture, organic carbon and total nitrogen soil content, on floral functional diversity. However, local land-use intensification did not influence floral functional diversity. Moreover, our results showed a positive relation between floral functional diversity and plant-pollinator interaction frequency as a proxy of pollination function. More specifically, we found a positive influence of the nectar resource diversity (i.e. the variability in production of nectar sugar by flowers) on plant-pollinator interaction frequency. These results, based on a correlative approach and functional diversity indices as measure of functional complementarity, suggest that the diversity of floral traits may promote niche partitioning of pollinators and pollination function approximated by plant-pollinator interaction frequency, and highlight the main role of nectar in this process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Land-use intensification; Nectar; Plant-pollinator interactions; Soil nitrogen; Soil phosphorus","composite; floral trait; flower; flowering; nectar; niche partitioning; nitrogen; pollination; pollinator; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087220136

Understanding why ranchers adopt managed grazing is key to developing the right incentives. In this paper, we explore principles and practices associated with the larger enterprise of 'regenerative ranching' (RR), which includes managed grazing but infuses the practice with holistic decision-making. We argue that this broader approach is appealing due to a suite of ecological, economic and social benefits, making climate change mitigation an afterthought, or 'co-benefit'. RR is challenging, however, because it requires a deep understanding of ecological processes along with a set of skills related to monitoring and moving livestock and feeding the soil microbiome. We review the literature regarding links between RR and SCS, then present results of qualitative research focused on motivators, enablers and constraints associated with RR, drawing on interviews with 52 practitioners in New South Wales, Australia and the western United States. Our analysis is guided by a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with RR that identifies determinants of regenerative potential. We discuss implications for rancher engagement and conclude with a consideration of leverage points for global scalability. © 2020 The Authors.","holistic planned grazing; natural climate solutions; regenerative agriculture; resilience; social-ecological systems; soil carbon sequestration","Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Ecology; Soils; Australia; Bare grounds; Climate change mitigation; Cobenefits; Holistic planned grazing; Natural climate solution; Regenerative agriculture; Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Soil carbon sequestration; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094943229

The characteristics of cathodes can be improved by modifying their surface, e.g., by hydrogen plasma treatment, as was performed in this work. The surface of multi-walled CNT arrays grown on silicon substrates from toluene and ferrocene using catalytic chemical vapor deposition was treated in a high-pressure (~104 Pa) microwave reactor. The structure, composition, and current-voltage characteristics of the arrays were studied before and after hydrogen plasma treatment at various power values and durations. CNT tips were destroyed and catalytic iron was released from the CNT channels. The etching rate was influenced by iron particles that formed on the array surface. The lower emission threshold in the plasma-treated arrays than in the initial sample is explained by the amplification factor of the local electric field increasing due to graphene structures of unfolded nanotube layers that formed at the CNT tips. © 2020 by the authors.

The ultimate goal is to test the viability of the combined MHD/test-particle approach for data-driven modeling of active events in the solar corona and their impact on the heliosphere. Based on an MHD model of X-class solar flare observed on 2017 September 8, we calculate trajectories of a large number of electrons and protons using the relativistic guiding-center approach. Using the obtained particle trajectories, we deduce the spatial and energy distributions of energetic electrons and protons, and calculate bremsstrahlung hard X-ray emission using the ""thin-target""approximation. Our approach predicts some key characteristics of energetic particles in the considered flare, including the size and location of the acceleration region, energetic particle trajectories and energy spectra. Most importantly, the hard X-ray bremsstrahlung intensity maps predicted by the model are in good agreement with those observed by RHESSI. Furthermore, the locations of proton and electron precipitation appear to be close to the sources of helioseismic response detected in this flare. Therefore, the adopted approach can be used for observationally driven modeling of individual solar flares, including manifestations of energetic particles in the corona, as well as the inner heliosphere. © 2020.

The nannofossil record was integrated with the planktonic oxygen and carbon stable isotopes, as well as the Uk'37 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the studied site during the investigated interval. The coccolithophore primary productivity, reconstructed from the PPP (primary productivity proxy = absolute values of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica + small Gephyrocapsa group) revealed pronounced fluctuations, that were strongly associated with variations in the intensity of the regional Alboran Upwelling System. The comparison of the nannoplankton record with opal phytolith content for the studied site and the already available pollen record at the nearby Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1385, suggests an association of the upwelling dynamics with the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation-like (NAO-like) phase. High PPP during positive (+) NAO-like phases is the result of intensified upwelling, owing to the complete development of the surface hydrological structures at the Alboran Sea. This scenario was identified during the MIS 12/MIS 11 transition (428-422 kyr), the late MIS 11c (405-397 kyr), and MIS11 b to MIS 11a (397-376 kyr). Two short-term minima in the PPP and SST were observed during MIS 11 b and were coeval with the North Atlantic Heinrich-type (Ht) events Ht3 (∼390 kyr) and Ht2 (∼384 kyr). Increased abundance of the subpolar Coccolithus pelagicus subsp. pelagicus and Gephyrocapsa muellerae was consistent with the inflow of cold surface waters into the Mediterranean Sea during the Ht events. Lowered PPP during negative (−) NAO-like phases is the result of moderate upwelling by the incomplete development of surface hydrological structures at the Alboran Sea. This scenario is expressed during the early MIS 11c (422-405 kyr). Overall, the results of our study provide evidence of the important role of atmospheric circulation patterns in the North Atlantic region for controlling phytoplankton primary production and oceanographic circulation dynamics in the Western Mediterranean during MIS 11. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alboran sea; Coccolithophore primary productivity; Interglacial; Marine isotope stage 11; Micropaleontology; North atlantic oscillation; Palaeoceanography; Western europe","Atmospheric pressure; Infill drilling; Isotopes; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Submarine geology; Surface waters; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Carbon stable isotopes; Hydrological structure; Integrated ocean drilling programs; North Atlantic oscillations; Ocean drilling programs; Oceanographic circulation; Sea surface temperature (SST); Oceanography; atmospheric circulation; marine isotope stage; nanofossil; nanoplankton; Ocean Drilling Program; primary production; sea surface temperature; upwelling; Alboran Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea; Coccolithus pelagicus; Gephyrocapsa; Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica; Gephyrocapsa muellerae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090118185

This study developed ensemble niche models to explore the distribution patterns of Cecropia peltata and Ulex europaeus under baseline and future conditions, as well as the factors that regulate them. The models were based on occurrence records as well as climate, land-use and topography datasets. Climatic factors played a stronger role than land-use and topographical factors in their distribution patterns. Additionally, temperature seasonality and temperature annual range were the optimal predictor for the global distributions of C. peltata and U. europaeus, respectively. Under the baseline-RCP 8.5 scenario in 2070, significant increases in habitat suitability for C. peltata were generally detected in tropical regions, while for U. europaeus under the same condition, significant increases in habitat suitability were generally observed in west coast of South America and Europe, suggesting the impacts of climate changes on species distribution may be species specific. The contrast changes of suitable habitat areas for U. europaeus under the baseline-2.6 and 8.5 scenarios may suggest that the scenarios of climate changes may modify its distribution patterns and variations in suitable habitats. The double-edged effects of global warming on plant invasions may be a result of the scenario specific climate change and the species-specific responses to changes in climate.

To facilitate rational design and quick screening of desired catalysts, an intrinsic descriptor was identified for the catalysts, which correlates the catalytic activity with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures. Among the catalysts, Fe/Cu-, Ni/Zn-COFs could be excellent electrocatalysts, with the low overpotential (~0.25 V) while suppressing side reactions. The excellent activity and selectivity of the catalysts stems from their unique bimetallic sites that break the constraint of scaling relations, leading to much more adsorption modes and facilitating intermediates to achieve the ideal states. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bimetallic-atoms electrocatalysts; Carbon dioxide reduction; Density functional theory calculation; Design principles; Energy conversion","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Renewable energy resources; Adsorption modes; Covalent organic frameworks; Electrochemical reductions; Environmental remediation; Rational design; Renewable energy source; Scaling relations; Side reactions; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089364120

This approach has mainly been demonstrated by using datasets originating from the same area A, with similar geopedological conditions, to build, validate and test prediction models. The objective of this study was to analyse how MIRS performs when applied to predict SOC and SIC contents, from a calibration database collected over a region A, to predict over a region B, where A and B have no common area and different soil and climate conditions. This study used a French MIRS soil dataset including 2178 topsoil samples to calibrate SIC and SOC prediction models with partial least squares regression (PLSR), and a Tunisian MIRS topsoil dataset including 96 soil samples to test them. Our results showed that when using the French MIRS soil database, i) the SOC and SIC of French validation samples were successfully predicted using global models (R2 val = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively), ii) the SIC of Tunisian samples was also predicted successfully both using a global model and using a selection of spectral neighbours from the French calibration database (R2 test of 0.96 for both), iii) the SOC of Tunisian samples was predicted moderately well by global model (R2 test of 0.64) and a transformation by natural logarithm of the calibration SOC values significantly improved the SOC prediction of Tunisian samples (R2 test of 0.97), and iv) a transformation by natural logarithm of SOC values provided more benefit than a selection of spectral neighbours from the French calibration database for predicting Tunisian SOC values. Therefore, in the future, MIRS might replace conventional physico-chemical analysis techniques, or at least be considered as an alternative technique, especially when optimally exhaustive calibration databases will become available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Local and global calibration; Mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy; National dataset; Natural logarithm transformation; Partial least squares regression (PLSR); Soil organic and inorganic carbon","Calibration; Chemical analysis; Database systems; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Least squares approximations; Organic carbon; Reflection; Soils; Spectroscopy; Statistical tests; Accurate estimation; Mid-infrared reflectances; National libraries; Natural logarithms; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Physico-chemical analysis; Soil inorganic carbons; Soil organic carbon; Soil testing; calibration; concentration (composition); data set; inorganic carbon; least squares method; near infrared; soil organic matter; spectral reflectance; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085738831

In the neutron source scheme proposed, neutron emission occurs in a relatively small region (less than 1 mm) as a result of the D-D fusion reaction initiated when the focused deuterium ion beam hits the deuterium-loaded target. The main goal of the project is to develop a simple and compact device that can be used in the high-quality fast neutron radiography. In the scheme proposed, the ion beam is extracted from the dense ECR discharge plasma that is confined in the simple magnetic mirror trap. After upgrading the extraction system and the magnetic lens, the deuterium ion beam with a total current in the focal plane of up to 150 mA was obtained, which considerably exceeds the current obtained previously. The numerical simulations of the beam magnetic focusing were performed using the IBSimu code and the results were compared to the experimental data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deuterium; Direct energy conversion; Electric discharges; Fusion reactions; Ions; Magnetic mirrors; Magnetism; Magnetoplasma; Neutron radiography; Neutron sources; Compact devices; Deuterium ion beams; Discharge plasma; Extraction systems; Fast neutron radiographies; High quality; Magnetic focusing; Total current; Ion beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096353575

As a result, energy security (stable supplies at affordable (rational) prices, stable functioning of international electric power markets, reduction of CO2 emissions) is an essential condition for economic growth and development, and concerns all post-Soviet countries. In recent decades, the volatility of electric power markets has increased with the emergence of new energy sources and the development of technologies, which leads to a change in the global structure of energy security. In such circumstances, the role of sub-regional electric power markets is increasing. It should be considered that the same sort of experience has already been applied: the Europe's Single Electricity Market, which has been developing over a rather long period and which has such characteristics as competitiveness and flexibility. However, despite the creation of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in 2011, the single internal energy infrastructure of the EU has not been fully formed. In the EU countries, the creation of the market is aimed at improving energy security and energy efficiency by dividing the electricity business into two components - natural monopoly activities (transmission of electricity) and competitive activities (generation and selling of electricity). This has both political and economic significance, contributing to the strengthening of integration processes. However, due to some objective and subjective reasons, the Common Market of the Eurasian Economic Union was not created by the specified date (July 2019), so it is important to identify constraining factors and measures for its formation. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Energy efficiency; Power markets; Competitive activity; Economic growths; Electric power markets; Electricity business; Integration process; Internal energies; Natural monopolies; New energy sources; Energy security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098915020

For an efficient operation of coupling devices such as heat pumps with intermittent sources of renewable energy, accurate heat load forecasts need to be developed and embedded into an operation strategy to enable further decarbonisation of heat generation. Data analysis driven forecasts based on weather data hold the potential of identifying consumption patterns to forecast day-ahead heat demand and have been studied extensively for electricity demand forecasts. However, it remains to be shown how such forecasts can be applied in district heating systems. In this study, we propose a control strategy that utilizes hourly heat load forecasts with a 24-hours rolling horizon. First, we investigate supervised forecasting techniques on three different heat load data sets. The application of convolutional neural networks on data of the district heating network in Flensburg, Germany delivers the most promising outcome. Elaborating further on this example, we then develop a control strategy and demonstrate how a heat load forecast can be used to improve the utilization of offshore wind generation or reduce energy costs through a heat pump and a heat storage system. Thus, we contribute to the electrification of the heat sector and thereby enable a reduction of carbon emissions. © 2020, The Author(s).","District heating; Heat forecast; Operation strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104934128

To achieve Nationally Determined Contribution targets discussed under the Paris Agreement, countries must project emission baselines considering different levels of ambition and sectoral performances and monitor government policies and mitigation actions. This study develops a Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework based on energy use and carbon emission scenarios for Brazil up to 2030, focusing on transport. Three scenarios are developed based on different political commitments. All scenarios and mitigation actions are discussed under the Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, which is recognized as one of the most important institutional instruments of the National Policy on Climate Change. Results reveal a 41% abatement in CO2e emissions when comparing the most ambitious scenario to the conservative one. MRV framework indicates that Brazil is on track to a low carbon economic transition, although joint action is needed. This is mainly due to the increasing penetration of bioenergy into the transport energy matrix, while electromobility does not expand in Brazil at the pace of major international players such as Europe and China. Special contribution of this paper is on the role of bioenergy in prospective carbon emission scenarios, which is a lack in the literature. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy efficiency; MRV; NDC; Prospective scenarios; Transitioning narratives","Carbon; Economics; Carbon emissions; Development path; Electromobility; Emission sources; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon economic; National policies; Transport energy; Climate change; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; conceptual framework; international agreement; political discourse; scenario analysis; state role; traffic emission; Brazil; China; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087367770

Renewable hydrogen-based iron production can become the least-cost supply option at a carbon dioxide (CO2) price of around United States dollars (USD) 67 per tonne. Availability of low-cost renewable electricity is a precondition. Australia is the world's largest producer of iron ore and at the same time a country with significant low-cost renewable electricity potential. A shift to direct reduced iron (DRI) exports could reduce global CO2 emissions substantially and at the same time increase value added in Australia, while maintaining steel production in countries that are currently processing ore into iron and steel, such as China, South Korea, and Japan. The approach could be expanded to other parts of the world and other energy-intensive industry sectors. Such relocation analysis in a climate context can become a new industrial ecology research area. Iron and steel industry CO2 emissions can be reduced by nearly a third, around 0.7 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2 per year. To achieve these emission reductions, investment of USD 0.9 trillion, or 0.7% of the total energy sector investment needs, would be required, global DRI production would have to increase seven-fold from today's level, and the hydrogen energy used would equal 1% of global primary energy supply. Such a shift could develop from 2025 onward at scale, if the right policies are put in place. © 2020 by Yale University","commodity trade; decarbonization; hydrogen; industrial ecology; iron and steel; renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decarbonization; Emission control; Energy policy; Hydrogen; Industrial research; Investments; Iron ores; Steelmaking; Energy intensive industries; Industrial ecology; Iron and steel; Iron-and-steel making; Material flow analysis; Microeconomic analysis; Renewable energies; Technology assessments; Iron and steel industry; alternative energy; carbon emission; cost analysis; detection method; electricity; electricity supply; energy policy; industrial ecology; iron and steel industry; Australia; China; Japan; South Korea; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081293235

Although Tehran, the capital of Iran, has been subject to a variety of climate change impacts in recent years, appropriate adaptation measures to address them are yet to be taken. This study primarily aims to categorize the barriers to climate change adaptation in Tehran and analyze the way they interact with each other. The study was done in three steps: first, the focus group discussion (FGD) method was used to identify the barriers; next, the survey and the structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to validate the barriers, identify their importance, and examine their possible inter-relationships; and finally, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was applied to categorize and visualize the relationships between the barriers. Results show that barriers related to the ‘structure and culture of research’, ‘laws and regulations’, and ‘planning’ belong to the cluster of independent barriers and are of greater significance. The ‘social’ barrier and barriers related to ‘resources and resource management’ are identified as dependent barriers and are of lesser importance. Barriers related to ‘governance’, ‘awareness’, ‘education and knowledge’, ‘communication and interaction’, and ‘economy’ are identified at the intermediate cluster. The findings of this study can provide planners and decision makers with invaluable insights as to how to develop strategies for climate change adaptation in Tehran. Despite the scope of the study being confined to Tehran, its implications go far beyond this metropolis. © 2020 by the authors.

We evaluate global scenarios of EV deployment and their impacts on total global CO2 emissions. For this assessment, we enhance the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to represent the fleet dynamics of light-duty vehicles (LDV), including internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs. For EV fleet, both plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) are considered. We consider several illustrative scenarios and find that global LDV stock is projected to grow from 1.1 billion vehicles in 2015 to 1.65–1.75 billion in 2050, while global EV stock is growing from about a million in 2015 to about 585–825 million in 2050. At this level of market penetration, EVs would constitute one-third to one-half of the overall LDV fleet by 2050 in different scenarios, with the stricter carbon constraints implied in the Paris to 2 °C scenario leading to the largest EV share. Our modeling suggests that EV uptake will vary across regions. China, the U.S., and Europe remain the largest markets in our study timeframe, but the EV presence is projected to grow in all regions. While the global LDV fleet grows by about 50% by 2050, the corresponding CO2 emissions from LDV are reduced by about 50% in 2050 relative to 2015. Global carbon intensity of LDVs are reduced by about 70% from 2015 to 2050. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economy-wide modeling; Electric vehicles; Paris Agreement","Battery electric vehicles; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Fleet operations; Internal combustion engines; Light electric vehicles; Light weight vehicles; Carbon constraints; Carbon intensity; CO2 emissions; Global scenarios; Light duty vehicles; Light-duty; Market penetration; Policy analysis; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electric vehicle; international agreement; transportation development; transportation planning; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091638431

In the present study, we propose an almost new practical methodology and perform on-road experiments on 60 bi-fuel vehicles to discuss the impacts of vehicle speed, fuel type, usage, and accumulated mileage on the CO, HC, and NOx EFs. 80% and 20% of the tested vehicles were private cars (PCs) and taxis (TXs), respectively. TXs and PCs are compared together based on their emission performances, emission characteristics, vehicular specific power (VSP) distributions, and type of fuel. The results show that in the entire cases except for GAS-PCs, CO EFs increased with vehicle speed. Although CNG vehicles show less HC EFs, they produce higher NOx mileage-based EFs compared to gasoline ones. NOx mileage-based EFs decrease with vehicle accumulated mileage, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the CO and HC EFs. Burning CNG rather than gasoline decreases 70% and 42% of CO, and 70% and 85% of HC mileage-based EFs in PCs and TXs, respectively. The influence of burning CNG on NOx emission of TXs seems to be insignificant, but NOx was more emitted by a factor of 1.7 in CNG PCs. Accumulated mileage has a destructive effect on combustion quality, especially in CNG vehicles. The factors of usage and accumulated mileage could considerably develop the VSP distribution and fuel consumption rate of GAS vehicles, while they have no detectable impact on that of CNG vehicles. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Bi-fuel vehicles; CNG; PEMS; Real-road measurements; Taxis; Vehicles emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088134769

Indeed, in many industrial and technological components, materials operate under dry or lubricated conditions for thousands of hours. However, contrary to the determination of a coefficient of friction, which can typically reach ‘steady state conditions’ in a few hours, the determination of wear under realistic conditions is by definition a long term test. It is not easy to accelerate a wear mechanism without fundamentally changing it. In addition, friction tests are more repeatable than wear tests and for this reason it is always necessary to run multiple repeat tests and obtain a reliable statistical result. Commonly, to characterise a single material couple under one set of test conditions, requires at least three repeats at one duration and ideally this is to be repeated for more than one test duration to plot also the evolution of wear. It is clear that with a single-station test machine and tests that take weeks to perform, it is economically and practically impossible to generate enough measurements for data with high confidence levels. Therefore, in this work an approach is presented to measure the wear of materials is an efficient way and under realistic contact conditions. Such a method can be potentially used to more easily map wear evolution and performance of different materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Parallel tests; Sliding wear; Wear mapping; Wear testing","Carbon footprint; Friction; Life cycle; Testing; Tribology; Contact conditions; High confidence; Long term tests; Realistic conditions; Steady-state condition; Technological components; Tribological issues; Wear mechanisms; Wear of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089396454

The trend in the historic climatic variables is estimated using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen slope analysis. A discrete wavelet analysis is also performed to separate only the long period component of the signal, and its trend is also studied. A significant decreasing trend is observed in the rainfall. However, a monotonous long-term increasing trend is detected for monthly average temperatures and monthly minimum temperatures. The sequential Mann-Kendall test result shows a significant change in the climatic pattern after 1980. The rainfall effectiveness of the basin is analyzed using indices. A drought analysis is also conducted using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in different time scales since climatic zones 2 and 3 in the catchment are drought-prone areas in recent years.

However, an excessive flaring releases large quantity of emissions of VOCs and NOx, which may suddenly enhance local ozone as a secondary pollution. Normally, the flare destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 98% or 99% is regulated as the national standard and presumed for industrial practices in the U.S. Unfortunately, real DRE values could be much lower than the standard due to impact factors including various meteorological and operating conditions such as the cross-wind speed, flare jet velocity and heating value of combustion. Thus, it is critically important to explore the sensitivity of the regional ozone impact due to low DREs of OGCPI flare combustions. In this paper, a systematic methodology has been developed to examine ozone impacts due to the low flare DREs, which have never been systematically studied before. The DRE formulas were derived from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling and Water Environment Research Foundation (WERF) results and then employed to recompile the point source emission inventory. After that, comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx) was employede to simulate and quantify local ozone changes impacted by flare emissions of OGCPI. Case studies indicate that the maximum hourly ozone increments due to the low DRE through CFD and WERF modeling is 0.18 ppb and 1.3 ppb, respectively. This study could enrich fundamental understandings of industrial point source emissions and provide the quantitative and valuable support for the ozone pollution caused by OGCPI flare emissions under low DRE instead of standard values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CAMx; DRE; Flare; Industrial emissions; Ozone pollution","Accident prevention; Air quality; Chemical industry; Chemical operations; Computational fluid dynamics; Ozone; Wind; Chemical process industry; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Destruction and removal efficiencies (DRE); Industrial practices; Point source emissions; Secondary pollution; Systematic methodology; Water environment research foundations; Industrial emissions; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; computational fluid dynamics; heating; ozone; point source; point source pollution; simulation; volatile organic compound; air quality; Article; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; heating; meteorology; methodology; petrochemical industry; pollution; priority journal; quantitative analysis; simulation; velocity; wind speed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087380960

The Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the most important international meeting surrounding climate change. The 2015 Paris climate talks reflected the global preoccupation around climate change, in that it was the first time 150 Heads of State ever gathered to discuss an issue. For geographers, the COPs are important sites to study because decisions around our environmental commons can perpetuate or contest socio-environmental narratives responsible for social and environmental inequalities. Increasingly, gender is being introduced into the climate debate in sites such as the COPs. Using qualitative methods, this paper delineates the mechanisms by which some meanings of gender like gender balance dominate over others like gender equality. My research illustrates how discourses of gender and climate change arise, are perpetuated, and materialized through climate policy. I use an intersectional lens to underscore the practices that perpetuate injustices, and explore the discourses that are the most popular at the COPs around gender and climate change, who perpetuates them, which narratives are mobilized, and which become invisible. I highlight how material practices at the COPs that construct polarized divisions of gender are accompanied by polarized divisions of space.

While much work has been done to understand the impacts of biological invasions on ecosystem services such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, less is known about their impact on sites that have significant cultural value. Assessing these values is complicated by the fact that biological invasions are novel in nature. People are unlikely to have experience with the scales and types of change that concern researchers, meaning that it can be difficult to assess how these changes may impact both the way that people value places and also the specific sites that people value. We assess cultural values in the context of wilding conifers in three landscapes in New Zealand. We mix interview and survey data with scientific projections and visualisation tools based on spatial analysis to explore the interactions between the information that people have about invasives and the impacts that they have on cultural values. We find that concern about wilding conifers increases significantly when people are presented with visual, scientifically credible, projections of incursion. This change demonstrates the importance of communicating credible scenarios for biological invasions when considering how they might affect people’s cultural values. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cultural ecosystem services; Cultural values; Involvement; Public perceptions; Survey methods; Wilding conifers","biological invasion; coniferous tree; ecosystem service; invasive species; spatial analysis; New Zealand; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087992452

Economy of scale is shown, including specific reduction in GHG emissions per capita in settlements of the Northern (Arctic) energy district. When settlement size exceeds 2,000 people GHG emissions increase due to economic activity of small and medium-sized businesses and a more developed social infrastructure, which ensures a higher quality of life.

Model projections of baseline SOC showed RMSE of 1.9 kg/m2 in comparison to a recently available continental SOC stock dataset. The model-predicted N2O emissions are close to 1.25% of N input. Our results suggest 10.2 million ha of cultivated lands in the Southern and Lower Midwestern United States will produce &gt;10 Mg ha−1 year−1 with net carbon sequestration under rainfed conditions. Cultivated lands in Upper Midwestern states including Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Michigan, and North Dakota showed lower sorghum biomass productivity (average: 6.9 Mg ha−1 year−1) with net sequestration (average: 0.13 Mg CO2e ha−1 year−1). Our national-scale spatially explicit results are critical inputs for robust life cycle assessment of bioenergy production systems and land use-based climate change mitigation strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

It is especially important to diagnose the state of support-rod insulators (OSI) of voltage class 110 kV and above. At the same time, due to the large number of objects, difficulties arise in the interpretation of signals associated with defects. In most cases, by analyzing signals in the HF, UHF, or infrared ranges of secondary electromagnetic radiation (EMR) caused by PDs, it is possible to identify the presence of a defective insulator. To recognize a defect (flange detachment from porcelain) and its localization, it is proposed to use the method of pulsed mechanical action (IMV). The article describes a method for detecting a defective insulator and a method for assessing the degree of development of a defect by the characteristics of PDs and using the method of acoustic emission (AE). In this case, the PDs method allows at an early stage to ascertain the presence of a defective insulator, and the AE method allows one to assess the degree of its destruction. © 2020 IEEE.","diagnostics of high-voltage electrical insulators; high-voltage electrical insulators; method of partial discharges; partial discharges; vibrodiagnostics of high-voltage electrical insulators","Defects; Electric insulation; Electric insulation testing; Electromagnetic waves; Partial discharges; Porcelain; High-voltage insulators; Infrared range; Mechanical action; Online monitoring; Porcelain insulators; Support rod; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098913629

Governments around the world are looking for recovery options that deliver new jobs and businesses. Few sectors link job creation so closely to sustainable green production as the food sector. It is the largest source of employment in many countries in the global South. At the same time cities depend upon imported food that is produced in far-Away countries and shipped around the world. The trillions of dollars to be invested in recovery from COVID-19 offers an unprecedented opportunity for a clean, green and just transition to a more biodiversity-friendly agricultural and food system. Key among the political opportunities to shift the post-pandemic world towards sustainability and resilience are the ongoing deliberations of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Post-2020 Framework will be the precedent for national governments to bridge economic action with the key need for a green, resilient recovery. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has traditionally seen agriculture as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity and has been actively promoting the protection of natural ecosystems by concentrating its efforts on preventing further expansion of agriculture. But it has not explicitly recognized the importance of mixed, diverse agricultural landscapes for their contribution to the conservation of wild biodiversity. The CBD has an opportunity to bring its influence to bear on international policy favouring investments in local production and marketing capacity to replace imported food and beverages. This will contribute to both COVID-19 recovery through creation of rural jobs and income and empowering governments and consumers to support diverse, mixed agricultural systems that conserve and enhance biodiversity as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Yet, previous research reveals that cranberry growers have mixed attitudes about the anthropogenic roots of climate change, with many being skeptical. Building on the researchers’ analysis of the personal and ecological conditions that affect climate change attitudes among cranberry growers, this paper examines the effect that key actors in the growers’ social networks have on those attitudes. Through statistical analysis of survey data and content analysis of two important cranberry newsletters, the paper finds that cranberry growers’ perceived importance of two key cranberry growing institutions, the “sociopolitically focused” Cape Cod Cranberry Growers’ Association and the “technically focused” University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, as well as connections to other cranberry growers, is associated in nuanced ways with growers’ climate change attitudes. Drawing on the sociological theory of “social capital,” the paper examines how these social ties to key actors/institutions may result in greater threat perception or worry about climate change. It then considers how “green ties,” if harnessed and supported by these important actors in the cranberry grower network, might significantly mitigate climate change in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Cape Cod; Climate action; Climate change; New England; Social capital; Social networks","Climate models; Climatic changes; Content analysis; Ecological conditions; Economic importance; Massachusetts; Social capitals; Sociological theories; University of Massachusetts; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089288545

During the day, solar energy is used to produce electricity, and the absence of sunlight can be overwhelmed with fuel combustion. This study presents a thermo-economic survey for a hybridized power plant in different regions of Spain, considering the local climatic conditions. The developed model considers the instant solar irradiance and ambient temperature dynamically, providing an estimation of the power output, the associated fuel consumption, and the most relevant pollutant emissions linked to combustion. Hybrid and combustion-only operating modes at selected geographical locations in Spain (with different latitudes, mean solar irradiances, and meteorological conditions) are analyzed. The levelized cost of electricity indicator is estimated as a function of investment, interest rate, maintenance, and fuel consumption actual costs in Spain. Values of about 124 e/MWhe are feasible. Fuel consumption and emissions in hybrid operation can be reduced above 30% with respect to those of the same turbine working in a pure combustion mode. This model shows the potential of hybrid solar dishes to become cost-competitive against non-renewable technologies from the point of view of costs and reduction in gas emission levels in regions with high solar radiation and low water resources. © 2020 by the authors.","Brayton cycles; Concentrated solar power; Distributed energy production; Parabolic dish; Thermo-economic analysis","Combustion; Cost benefit analysis; Fuels; Gas turbine power plants; Gas turbines; Investments; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Surveys; Water resources; Climatic conditions; Concentrated solar power; Geographical locations; Hybrid operations; Levelized cost of electricities; Meteorological condition; Micro gas turbines; Pollutant emission; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099775216

The pipeline components in the gas network are simplified, and the standard state space model of the pipeline under finite length is obtained. The standard modules of pipeline components and non-pipe components in the gas network are established in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The gas turbine is an important device that reflects the electricity-gas interaction characteristics of offshore platforms. The piecewise linear fitting method is used to obtain the gas turbine gas consumption model. Finally, a dual-time scale simulation solution method is proposed in this paper. Combined with an example of the electricity-gas interconnection system under the typical operation mode of a 25-IS offshore oil platforms, the simulation shows that the dynamic model of the natural gas system is helpful to study the interaction between the electricity-gas interconnection network, which can provide a reference for the use of different energy cascades on offshore platforms and achieve energy conservation and emission reduction goals. © 2020 IEEE.","Electricity-gas interconnection system; Natural gas subsystem; Natural gas subsystem; power subsystem gas turbine; Power subsystem gas turbine, electricity-gas interconnection system","Drilling platforms; Dynamic models; Emission control; Gas turbines; Gases; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); MATLAB; Natural gas; Offshore oil well production; Piecewise linear techniques; Pipelines; Simulation platform; State space methods; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Interconnection systems; Natural gas systems; Off shore platforms; Offshore oil platform; Piecewise linear fittings; State - space models; Steady-state modeling; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101596072

Here we develop a nitrogen doped hierarchically porous carbon aerogel (NPCA) derived from chitosan biomass via a combined chelation reaction and freeze-drying procedures for SCs and MSCs. The NPCA exhibits three-dimensional (3D) reticular texture with ultrahigh SSA of 2529 m2 g−1, which is highly responsible for accommodating large charge storage. The interconnected micro-/mesopores distributed on the continuous carbon network can create more adsorption sites and commodious channels for fast ion diffusion, yet offer high electrical conductivity for rapid electron transport. As a result, the assembled symmetric SC using NPCA exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with energy density of 6.8 Wh kg−1 at power density of 251 W kg−1. More importantly, the solid-state flexible NPCA-MSC presents high areal capacitance of 25.6 mF cm−2, outstanding energy density of 0.78 μWh cm−2, exceptional cyclability with only 1% capacitance fading after 10000 cycles, and superior flexibility with capacitance retention of 99%.

Mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most important processes of C cycling, and links C sequestration and emission. However, few studies have been focused on SOC mineralization in urban parks, especially in scenarios involving rising temperature. Here, soils from different ages of deciduous forest (DT), evergreen forest (ET) and lawn (LN) were collected from the urban parks of Chengdu megacity. A soil incubation study (35 days) was conducted to examine SOC mineralization in three temperature regimes (15, 25, and 35 ℃), three vegetation types (DT, ET, and LN) and three vegetation ages (5, 10, and 15yr), making 27 treatments in total. Results demonstrate that increases in temperature stimulated the daily SOC mineralization rate, cumulative SOC mineralization, and mineralization intensity in the soils from urban green spaces, especially in soils under the 5-year-old plantings. Furthermore, results from principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the soil labile organic carbon (LOC) fraction, especially readily oxidizable carbon (ROC), soil enzyme activity and soil pH are the major factors influencing SOC mineralization. During the incubation, the average temperature sensitivity (Q10) of the SOC mineralization rate at 25−35 °C was higher than at 15−25 °C (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that more C would release from urban green spaces under a warmer climate. However, over all planting ages, the average Q10 of SOC mineralization rate in lawn soils reduced by 1.87 %–4.04 % and 4.16 %–5.84 % relative to deciduous and evergreen forest soils, respectively. Overall, the SOC mineralization rate was ranked LN &gt; ET &gt; DT, while the Q10 of the SOC mineralization rate was ranked DT &gt; ET &gt; LN with increasing temperatures. Moreover, the older vegetation showed lower SOC mineralization rates and higher Q10 values. These findings imply that SOC stored in the soils under grass and young plantations are less susceptible to climate warming, although the mineralization rates are higher. By contrast, SOC in soils under trees is more susceptible to climate warming, but the mineralization rates are lower. Overall, the temperature change is more important for the SOC mineralization in forest soils and older plantation soils in urban green spaces. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Incubation temperature; LOC fraction; SOC mineralization; Temperature sensitivity; Urban park green space","deciduous forest; enzyme activity; evergreen forest; forest soil; greenspace; megacity; mineralization; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; temperature effect; urban planning; urban region; vegetation type; Chengdu; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086646261

Under the influence of climate change, permafrost degradation reduces the bearing capacity of bored piles in permafrost regions. Based on the monitoring results of bored piles at a site in Beiluhe and related simulations, the effect of a ventilated open structure (VOS) on the temperature at the pile-soil interface and the bearing capacity of bored piles was discussed. The results showed that climate warming can significantly reduce the bearing capacity of bored piles. The higher thermal conductivity of concrete than frozen soil had a negligible influence on thermal stability of pile. However, the temperature at the pile-soil interface decrease drastically within a year due to the lower surface boundary temperature beneath a VOS.

To adapt to climate change and ensure food security with a fixed area of arable land, utilizing a multiple cropping frequency each year is regarded as an efficient method of offsetting the projected negative yield impacts on staple crops. Given that climate warming prolongs the potential growing season and benefits the expansion of multi-cropping systems, this research investigated whether changes in precipitation will keep pace with temperature in the marginal double-cropping area of northern China under two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Our results indicated that northern China will experience consistent warming, which will cause the limits of the double-cropping system to move remarkably towards the northeast and northwest in this century. However, the increased precipitation may not be sufficient to alleviate the water deficiency in the double-crop rotation and support the realisation of double-cropping benefits due to increasing heat resources. Although the potential yield will be considerable in the marginal double-cropping area after future expansion, the instability of rain-fed yields will gradually increase with the decrease in precipitation in the marginal region unless supplemental irrigation is applied. The insufficient precipitation was projected to negatively affect the potential yield in this area by 56–67 %. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of yield was great due to the large spatial distribution difference in the cumulated precipitation. After adopting limited irrigation in key wheat growth periods, this negative effect was predicted to be alleviated by approximately 10–12 %. In the entire marginal region, the northeast faces the lowest risk of precipitation deficiency during double-cropping system expansion. It was concluded that the double-cropping system is an efficient adaptation strategy worth encouraging in the context of climate change; however, this approach should be considered only after considering the local cumulative precipitation and the condition of the water supply. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Crop water requirement; Double-cropping systems; Northern China","arable land; climate change; crop production; crop rotation; crop yield; double cropping; food security; growing season; irrigation system; precipitation (climatology); spatial distribution; temperature effect; China; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087779528

These approaches tend to underestimate emissions because they often only incorporate data on household travel, not including commercial vehicle movements, taxis, ride hailing services, and other trips typically underreported within travel surveys. In contrast, traffic counts embed all types of on-road vehicles; however, they are only conducted at selected locations in an urban area. Traffic counts are typically spatially correlated, which enables the development of methods that can interpolate traffic data at selected monitoring stations across an urban road network and in turn develop emission estimates. This paper presents a new and universal methodology designed to use traffic count data for the prediction of periodic and annual volumes as well as greenhouse gas emissions at the level of each individual roadway and for multiple years across a large road network. The methodology relies on the data collected and the spatio-temporal relationships between traffic counts at various stations; it recognizes patterns in the data and identifies locations with similar trends. Traffic volumes and emissions prediction can be made even on roads where no count data exist. Data from the City of Toronto traffic count program were used to validate the output of various algorithms, indicating robust model performance, even in areas with limited data. © 2019 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",,"Commercial vehicles; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Emissions prediction; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Monitoring stations; On-road emissions; Spatio-temporal prediction; Spatio-temporal relationships; Travel demand models; Urban road networks; Gas emissions; algorithm; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; prediction; road traffic; spatiotemporal analysis; travel demand; urban area; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074776317

Insufficient preparedness of the healhcare provider could lead to a nosocomial infection during disaster, which also could lead to an outbreak disease. Both local and global healthcare provider preparedness will impact the handling of the epidemic. Government policy and regulation are very important primary and basic sources of information because they are mandatory to be applied as a part of national policy. IAQ is one of the exogenous factors that could lead to nosocomial infection. Hospital has to be responsive to handle disaster victim and prepared its strategy to handle its IAQ in an over usage condition during disaster. The complexity and sensitivity about this IAQ studies made the number of research in this area are very limited. Another regulation review had been done by National institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in United States in order to find their preparedness of IAQ regulations during disaster. This study aimed to compile and analyze the regulation about IAQ in Indonesian hospital for the last 20 years, and find the Indonesian hospital preparedness facing disaster. Indonesian Regulation were searched and analyzed the policy output about indoor air pollutant, variables, and hospital standard milestones. Chronological issuance of this regulation was organized and compared the significance output from year to year. The chronological data shown a lot of improvement in term of comprehensiveness, and needs of improvement for the enforcement of the monitoring action.

Approximately 46% of the population resides in Ulaanbaatar, and over half of the population living in ger (traditional yurt dwelling) areas consumes raw coal, which leads to an increase in ambient air pollutants. The Government of Mongolia took a series of actions to reduce air pollution; one was the ban on the consumption of raw coal beginning on 15 May 2019. In this study, improvement in particulate matter (PM) air quality was shortly studied by assessing the hourly data for the last six years, from January 2014 to February 2020. The analysis exhibited a major improvement in PM concentrations during the 2019–2020 winter in Ulaanbaatar. The average PM concentrations clearly exhibited a decreasing trend in November 2019–February 2020 compared to the previous five years. The maximum PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were reduced to 46% and 55%, respectively, compared to the mean maximum values of the previous five years. The most prominent occurrence frequency of PM concentrations shifted to a lower concentration range. Although a PM pollution reduction was seen during the 2019–2020 winter, further air quality improvement can be obtained by taking a set of multiple actions with accurate planning management. © The Author(s).","Improvement in air quality; Mongolia; Particulate matter; Reductions in PM concentrations; Ulaanbaatar",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091274586

But the Fe cycle matters too. Using a compilation of C, Fe, S and H fluxes between the Earth's exosphere, continents, and mantle reservoirs, I demonstrate that hydrothermal weathering of the oceanic lithosphere and volcanic degassing of SO2 have acted as net sinks of O2, amounting to ca. 2.7±1.1 Tmol O2/y, over the Cenozoic. Near constancy of atmospheric oxygen concentrations over the same interval of time suggests that this igneous sink is compensated by the sedimentary cycles of C, S and Fe. The net subduction and accretion of OC likely made the dominant contribution and, therefore, operated as a net source of atmospheric O2 over the last 50-60 Myr. This result implies that redox steady-state in the Cenozoic is dynamically maintained by a net input of solar (photosynthetic) energy, ∼0.8 to 2 EJ/y, into the lithospheric cycles of C, S and Fe. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Atmosphere; Biogeochemical cycle; Imbalance; Kinetics; Oxygenation; Redox","carbon balance; carbon cycle; Cenozoic; chemical weathering; organic carbon; oxygenation; paleoatmosphere; reaction kinetics; redox conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097683361

To address this, we used reciprocal gardens to detect genetic and environmental plasticity effects on phenotypic variation and combined with genetic analyses. Four reciprocal garden sites were planted with three regional ecotypes of Andropogon gerardii, a dominant Great Plains prairie grass, using dry, mesic, and wet ecotypes originating from western KS to Illinois that span 500–1,200 mm rainfall/year. We aimed to answer: (a) What is the relative role of genetic constraints and phenotypic plasticity in controlling phenotypes? (b) When planted in the homesite, is there a trait syndrome for each ecotype? (c) How are genotypes and phenotypes structured by climate? and (d) What are implications of these results for response to climate change and use of ecotypes for restoration? Surprisingly, we did not detect consistent local adaptation. Rather, we detected co-gradient variation primarily for most vegetative responses. All ecotypes were stunted in western KS. Eastward, the wet ecotype was increasingly robust relative to other ecotypes. In contrast, fitness showed evidence for local adaptation in wet and dry ecotypes with wet and mesic ecotypes producing little seed in western KS. Earlier flowering time in the dry ecotype suggests adaptation to end of season drought. Considering ecotype traits in homesite, the dry ecotype was characterized by reduced canopy area and diameter, short plants, and low vegetative biomass and putatively adapted to water limitation. The wet ecotype was robust, tall with high biomass, and wide leaves putatively adapted for the highly competitive, light-limited Eastern Great Plains. Ecotype differentiation was supported by random forest classification and PCA. We detected genetic differentiation and outlier genes associated with primarily precipitation. We identified candidate gene GA1 for which allele frequency associated with plant height. Sourcing of climate adapted ecotypes should be considered for restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: We analyzed outcomes of 14 consecutive thoracoscopic operations under local anesthesia for high-risk SSP from 2015 to 2019. Suspicious lesions were determined based on intraoperative direct or indirect detections. Direct detection involved identifying pleural fistulas or air bubbles. Indirect detection involved finding thin and transparent bullae without any other suspicious lesions. Identifications of culprit lesions were confirmed by arrest or significant decrease in air leakage after surgical repair. All surgical repairs were followed by immediate single pleurodesis for a definitive cure and prevention of recurrence. Success was defined as the removal of the thoracic tube by surgical repair combined with immediate postoperative single pleurodesis. Results: The main underlying pulmonary diseases were emphysema (n = 7), carcinoma (n = 3), interstitial pneumonia (IP) (n = 3), and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (n = 1). A leakage point was identified in 13 cases (six on direct and seven on indirect detections). Success was achieved in nine cases (four on direct and five on indirect detections). Adverse events included one case of acute exacerbation of IP and one case of carbon dioxide narcosis. Conclusion: Thoracoscopic surgery under local anesthesia can be the worthwhile definitive modality, among few remaining treatments, for highly fragile patients with SSP. Detecting air leakage directly and the presence of thin and transparent bullae without any other suspicious lesions can be clues for identifying culprit lesions. © 2020, The Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery.","Awake thoracoscopic surgery; Local anesthesia; Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; Thoracoscopic surgery; Video-assisted thoracic surgery","acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; carbon dioxide; clopidogrel; fentanyl; lidocaine; midazolam; warfarin; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; disease exacerbation; female; high risk patient; human; interstitial pneumonia; local anesthesia; lung carcinoma; lung emphysema; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; peroperative care; pleurodesis; pneumonia; radiation injury; recurrent disease; secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; spontaneous pneumothorax; thorax drainage; thorax radiography; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; chest tube; complication; lung disease; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; pleura cavity; pleurodesis; pneumothorax; secondary prevention; treatment outcome; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anesthesia, Local; Chest Tubes; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Pleural Cavity; Pleurodesis; Pneumothorax; Secondary Prevention; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082474251

Thereby, focusing on cities is especially important because of today’s large share of the global population living in cities and because local authorities are close to the needs of their residents. However, devising targeted and effective policy measures implies a thorough understanding of prevailing consumption patterns and associated environmental consequences. The goal of this article is to investigate and compare household behaviours and lifestyle-induced carbon footprints in Sydney and Melbourne in order to enhance today’s understanding of household consumption in cities of a high-income, high-emission country. For this purpose, we employed a two-stage clustering approach with a Self-Organising Map and a subsequent Ward-clustering. This allowed for including expenditure data along with socio-economic attributes and thus for recognising lifestyle-archetypes. These emerging archetypes represent households with similar characteristics and comparable consumption patterns. Analysing the archetypes in detail and performing a city-comparison based on multi-dimensional scaling revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the two metropoles. ‘Older’ archetypes seem to behave more alike across cities but show different carbon footprints emphasising the importance of regionalised environmental assessments and of city-specific supply chains. Distinct patterns especially emerged in the high- and low-income segments highlighting the different importance of different lifestyles in each city. Socio-economically similar family-archetypes were found in both cities, but some of them showed diverging consumption behaviours. This article showed that studying household-induced environmental impacts in cities should not rely on macro-trends but should rather be based on city-specific analyses that capture local peculiarities and consider socio-economic characteristics and consumption data simultaneously. © 2020 The Author(s).

Thus far, only the detectability of SRM has been examined using both a stationary and nonstationary detection and attribution method. Here, the spatiotemporal detectability of the forced response to artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) as exemplary methods for CDR and SRM, respectively, is compared in Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) experiments using regularized optimal fingerprinting and single-model estimates of internal variability, while working under a stationary or nonstationary null hypothesis. Although both experiments are forced by emissions according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and target the climate of the RCP4.5 scenario using AOA or SAI, detection timescales reflect the fundamentally different forcing agents. Moreover, detectability timescales are sensitive to the choice of null hypothesis. Globally, changes in the CO2 system in seawater are detected earlier than the response in temperature to AOA but later in the case of SAI. Locally, the detection time scales depend on the physical, chemical, and radiative impacts of CDR and SRM forcing on the climate system, as well as patterns of internal variability, which is highlighted for oceanic heat and carbon storage. © 2020.

We examined the impacts of the tunneling beetle, Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), and the dwelling beetle, Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar), on the carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted from pasture-laid bovine dung as well as their sum-total (CO2 + CH4 + N2O) effect on global warming, or their carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Despite dung beetles potential effects on CH4 and N2O, the existing literature shows no ultimate CO2e reductions. We hypothesized that more dung beetles would degrade pats faster and reduce CO2e, and so we increased the average dung beetle biomass per dung volume 6.22× above previously published records, and visually documented any dung damage. However, the time effects were 2-5× greater for any GHG and CO2e (E = 0.27-0.77) than dung beetle effects alone (E = 0.09-0.24). This suggests that dung beetle communities cannot adequately reduce GHGs unless they can accelerate dung decomposition faster than time alone. © 2020 The Author(s).

Genotype and planting stock type selection may influence buffer establishment success and soil properties, which may affect buffer functions such as soil nutrient removal, hydrological regulation (i.e. soil dewatering) or local climate regulation (i.e. temperature reduction). This farm-scale study tested the effects of two unrelated hybrid poplar genotypes (P. deltoides × P. nigra, genotype D × N-3570 and P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera, genotype M × B-915311) and two planting stock types (unrooted whips and bare-root stocks) on biomass growth, soil nutrient availability and soil microclimate in 15 m wide bioenergy buffers located downslope of hayfields in the cold temperate region of southern Québec, Canada. Poplar genotype had an important effect on biomass growth, soil microclimate and the supply rates of several macronutrients and micronutrients, while planting stock type had little effect on these variables. The P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera genotype produced the highest biomass and had generally lower nutrient availability in the soil, but not for soil NO3, which was less available under the P. deltoides × P. nigra genotype. Compared to the hayfield soils, only the P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera genotype maintained a lower supply rate of available P in the buffer soil. Compared to the hayfield soils, NH4 supply rates were lower in the buffers for both genotypes, while NO3 supply rates were similar or higher. Both genotypes had the capacity to maintain cooler soil temperatures and lower moisture content in the soil of the buffer compared to the adjacent hayfields, but this capacity was greater for the P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera genotype. Because plant-soil interactions are strongly affected by hybrid poplar genetics, genotype selection is an important consideration in the design of multifunctional agricultural buffers. In temperate agroecosystems, future studies should try to identify productive poplar genotypes that would decrease topsoil NO3 and P availability and reduce soil water content in order to minimize potential N and P losses from buffer soils during runoff events. © 2020 The Authors","Agroforestry; Balsam poplars; Climate regulation; Hydrological regulation; Ion-exchange membranes; Macronutrients; Metals; Micronutrients; Nitrate; Novel ecosystem; Phosphorus; Phytoremediation; Populus canadensis; PRS-Probes; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","Agricultural robots; Biomass; Ecosystems; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Agricultural land; Ecosystem services; Nutrient availability; P availabilities; Plant-soil interactions; Soil water content; Temperate regions; Temperature reduction; Forestry; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; bioenergy; biomass; genotype-environment interaction; hybrid; microclimate; nutrient availability; soil nutrient; soil property; soil-vegetation interaction; woody plant; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Populus; Populus balsamifera; Populus deltoides; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Populus x canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089083138

Travel demand patterns for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, however, have a more diverse and stricter set of requirements compared to light duty vehicles. Therefore, it is critical to understand the technical feasibility of using BEVs and FCEVs to meet the medium and heavy duty vehicle travel demands as a function of vehicle capabilities and infrastructure availability. This work develops and applies a representative dataset of California-based medium and heavy duty vehicles trips to evaluate (1) potential electric load demand of future BEVs and (2) the feasibility of EVs to meet state-wide medium and heavy duty travel demand. From a technical perspective, EVs can support between 62 and 76% of commercial Class 2B-7 vehicle miles traveled with technologies in development today. Further increases will require increasing vehicle range, improving fuel efficiency, and/or expanding available charging locations. Class 8 trucks have a much lower BEV feasibility compared to FCEVs due to their weight and longer trip distances, with 100-mile vehicles meeting up to 8% of vehicle miles travelled with home base charging. Class 8 FCEVs with the same range can meet up to 27% and are likely to have expanded ranges that facilitate up to 68% due to inherent benefits of storing on-board hydrogen relative to batteries. Feasibility results indicate that EVs can significantly contribute to reducing emissions from the medium and heavy duty sectors but cannot fully meet demand under the configurations considered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicles; Electrification; Feasibility; Fuel cell electric vehicles; Medium and heavy duty","Automotive batteries; Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Air pollutant emission; Electric load demands; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fuel cell electric vehicle; Heavy duty vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Vehicle miles travelled; Vehicle-miles traveled; Battery electric vehicles; electric vehicle; emission control; estimation method; feasibility study; fuel cell; pollutant removal; travel demand; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087479120

Daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Bangkok, Thailand, continuously exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Thai National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs). Bangkok has only recently begun to measure concentrations of PM2.5. To overcome this paucity of data, daily PM2.5/PM10 ratios were generated over the period 2012–2018 to interpolate missing values. Concentration-response coefficients (β values) for PM2.5 versus non-accidental, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortalities were derived from the literature. Values were also estimated and were found to be comparable to those reported in the literature for a Chinese population, but considerably lower than those reported in the literature from the United States. These findings strongly suggest that specific regional β values should be used to accurately quantify the number of premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 in Asian populations. Health burden analysis using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) showed that PM2.5 concentration in Bangkok contributes to 4240 non-accidental, 1317 cardiopulmonary, and 370 lung cancer mortalities annually.

Its vulnerability to climate change has already led to an accumulation of severe changes along its ecosystems. This work reviews the current findings on impacts observed in phytoplankton communities occurring in the NAP, with a focus on its causes, consequences, and the potential research priorities toward an integrated comprehension of the physical–biological coupling and climate perspective. Evident changes in phytoplankton biomass, community composition and size structure, as well as potential bottom-up impacts to the ecosystem are discussed. Surface wind, sea ice and meltwater dynamics, as key drivers of the upper layer structure, are identified as the leading factors shaping phytoplankton. Short- and long-term scenarios are suggested for phytoplankton communities in the NAP, both indicating a future increase of the importance of small flagellates at the expense of diatoms, with potential devastating impacts for the ecosystem. Five main research gaps in the current understanding of the phytoplankton response to climate change in the region are identified: (i) anthropogenic signal has yet to be disentangled from natural climate variability; (ii) the influence of small-scale ocean circulation processes on phytoplankton is poorly understood; (iii) the potential consequences to regional food webs must be clarified; (iv) the magnitude and risk of potential changes in phytoplankton composition is relatively unknown; and (v) a better understanding of phytoplankton physiological responses to changes in the environmental conditions is required. Future research directions, along with specific suggestions on how to follow them, are equally suggested. Overall, while the current knowledge has shed light on the response of phytoplankton to climate change, in order to truly comprehend and predict changes in phytoplankton communities, there must be a robust collaboration effort integrating both Antarctic research programs and the whole scientific community under a common research framework. © Copyright © 2020 Ferreira, Costa, Dotto, Kerr, Tavano, Brito, Brotas, Secchi and Mendes.","bottom–up impacts to the ecosystem; climate change; phytoplankton response; research gaps and directions; West Antarctica",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095951980

Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions between a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities. © 2020 The Author","Circus sp.; Collision risk; Displacement; Grey literature; Harrier; Impact assessment","Birds; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Sustainable development; Conservation priorities; Environmental benefits; High sensitivity; Knowledge accessibilities; Knowledge-sharing; Online repositories; Systematic Review; Wind energy development; Wind power; accessibility; anthropogenic effect; collision; displacement; environmental impact assessment; geographical distribution; knowledge; language; literature review; raptor; wildlife management; wind power; Circus (genus); grey literature; habitat; human; human experiment; language; nonhuman; physician; review; systematic review; wildlife; wind farm; animal; bird; ecosystem; energy resource; wild animal; wind; Aves; Circus; Animals; Animals, Wild; Birds; Ecosystem; Energy-Generating Resources; Wind",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086765174

In particular, this article analyzes the state-of-the-art with regard to both the current role of coal generation and the performance of the main legal and regulatory tools as implemented in Italy thus far to ensure the closure of all coal power plants by 2025 as announced in the Italian National Climate and Energy Plan. Based on existing data and scenarios on both electricity production and demand trends, this article unfolds the marginal role played by coal-fired generation in the Italian energy mix. In addition, this paper aims to highlight the outstanding technical uncertainties and regulatory hurdles in the way towards de-carbonization of energy generation in Italy. This paper argues that several remarkable improvements are needed in order to avoid over-generation (especially through natural gas), to upscale the penetration of renewable energy sources, and develop the necessary infrastructures to adequately deliver on the full phasing-out of coal within the expected timeframes. © 2020 b the authors Licensee MDPI Basel Switzerland","Coal phase-out; Coal-fired generation; De-carbonization; Energy regulation","Carbonization; Coal; Electric power plants; Energy policy; Natural gasoline plants; Plant shutdowns; Renewable energy resources; Coal fired generation; Coal generation; Coal power plants; Electricity production; Energy generations; Energy plan; Renewable energy source; State of the art; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094825959

It remains unknown whether the effect of environmental regulations on the surrounding regions is free riding or pollution shelter. Based on the data from 2006 to 2018, the spatial correlation of PM2.5 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomerations in China was examined in this study. In addition, the spatial spillover effects of environmental regulation on PM2.5 concentrations were explored while the socio-economic driving factors of the heterogeneity of pollution spillover were identified via SDM based STIRPAT framework. Results showed that the characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations spatial correlations varies from one urban agglomeration to another. This study revealed that the air pollution is affected by not only local environmental regulations, but also regulations implemented in surrounding cities. The PM2.5 concentration of BTH, YRD and PRD increased by 0.76, 0.147 and 0.109 for each unit increase in environmental regulation of surrounding cities, respectively. In fact, cities with loose regulation become the pollution shelters. The spatial spillover effects offset the improvement effects of local environmental regulations on the air quality. Furthermore, the comparison amongst three urban agglomerations showed that the spatial spillover effects of PM2.5 concentration in BTH and YRD are higher than that of PRD. This is attributed to differences in industrial structure, population density, economic development, FDI and geographical location. Therefore, the spatial spillover effects should be taken into consideration and joint regulation should be strengthened to address air pollution issues in urban aggregations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Environmental regulation; Spatial spillover effects; Urban agglomeration","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental quality; particulate matter; spatial analysis; spillover effect; urban area; air pollution; air quality; article; China; city; economic development; population density; river; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088138933

The results show that because of the coronavirus outbreak, NOx emissions across the whole mainland China dropped sharply after 31 January, began to rise slightly in certain areas after 10 February, and gradually recover across the country after 20 February. Compared with the emissions before the outbreak, NOx emissions fell by more than 60% and ~30% in many large cities and most small to medium cities, respectively. Overall, NOx emissions were reduced by 36% over China, which were mainly contributed by transportation.

Southwest Ethiopia is a region where important cash crops such as Coffea arabica and Aframomum corrorima (korerima) originate. These crops are known to require shade for their growth and productivity. This study was conducted to assess the impacts of climate change on an important but neglected cash crop of A. corrorima using GIS-based species distribution approaches. Local meteorological data and bioclimatic data from WorldClim were used to map past, present, and future distribution of the crop in the Coffee Forest System of Southwest Ethiopia. Moreover, 96 key informants were interviewed and completed questionnaires to complement the distribution modeling. The key informants mapped the history and present occurrences of A. corrorima and based on this, ground-truthing survey was conducted. The interpolation method of the Inverse Distance Weighted was used in ArcGIS 10.5 to develop bioclimatic variables for modeling past and present distribution while data from IPCC (AR4) Emissions Scenarios was used for the future occurrence prediction using Principal Component Analysis. Eleven best bioclimatic variables were selected and MaxEnt was used to model past, present and future distribution of A. corrorima. The output of our model was validated using Area Under the Curve (AUC) approach. Temperature and precipitation are the most important environmental variable, then temperature increased by 1.3°C in the past (from 1988 to 2018) while it is predicted to increase further by at least 1.4°C before 2050. On the contrary, precipitation decreased by an average of 10.1 mm from the past while it is predicted to decrease further by 12.5 mm before 2050. Our model shows that the area suitable for korerima in 1988 was 20,638.2 ha and it was reduced by half and became 10,545.3 ha in 2018, similarly predicted to shrink into 3225.5 ha by 2050. The findings from the key informants confirm the model results whereby 89.1% of the respondent replied korerima producing area has been shifted into the mountains over the last 30 years (by 150 m a.s.l. from 1988 to 2018) and thus expected to be pushing up in the next 32 years (by 133 m before 2050). The community claims that the length of the rainy season of the area has been shortening from 9 months in the past to an average of 5.5 months recently which also coincides with increasing temperature. We conclude that with the changing climatic condition, the suitable habitat of korerima has already shrank by 48.9% (from 1988 to 2018) and the trend may lead to a shrink by 84.38% before 2050 (from 1988 to 2050). Therefore, it is important to develop site-specific climate adaptation strategies for the region such as promoting alternative livelihoods and avoiding further coffee forest degradation and deforestation. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aframomum corrorima; Bioclimatic variables; Coffee forest; GIS; MaxEnt; Suitability","angiosperm; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; coffee; crop yield; GIS; maximum entropy analysis; Ethiopia; Aframomum; Coffea arabica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092214790

While previous studies have explored the implications of such budgets for the global economy, few studies have conducted regional- and national-level analyses. This paper explores budgets through 2050 consistent with the 1.5 and 2 °C long-term temperature goals in the context of the USA. We employ a state-level model of the USA embedded within a global human-Earth system model (GCAM-USA) to study the implications of such budgets for the US energy system. Our results show that achieving the stringent budgets entails accelerated deployment of energy conserving technology, almost complete decarbonization of the power sector, increased electrification of buildings and industrial end-use sectors, and decarbonization of transport employing a combination of electrification and the substitution of fossil fuels for bioenergy.

In order to perform this goal, this paper combines the concept of the meta-frontier efficiency and the directional distance function to process empirical work. This methodology allows for the incorporation of technological heterogeneities into the efficiency analysis and implementation results of increment in desirable outputs and reduction in undesirable outputs. Empirical results indicate that the average total-factor CO2 emission efficiency is 0.481 and has a slight downward trend over the studied period, which is lower than that of the whole industry in China. CO2 emission efficiency and the technology gap ratios among different regions in China’s agricultural sector show different space–time characteristics. A comparative analysis is applied in this study to verify the relationship between the actual and potential CO2 intensities, whose average values are, respectively, 0.1972 and 0.0816 Mtc/billion yuan RMB. Research shows that there exists huge space for CO2 intensity reduction. Meanwhile, the major contributor to the potential CO2 intensity reduction varies across different regions, as managerial failure for most provinces in the eastern and central regions and technology gap in the western regions. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","CO2 emission efficiency; Directional distance function; Meta-frontier technological heterogeneities; The potential CO2 intensity reduction","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Efficiency; Emission control; Agriculture sectors; CO2 emission reduction; Comparative analysis; Directional distance function; Efficiency analysis; Intensity reduction; Technological efficiency; Time characteristics; Carbon dioxide; agroindustry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; methodology; technical efficiency; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084445903

Specifically, rising temperatures should cause increasing relative abundances of heat-loving or heat-tolerant species (that is, ‘thermophilization’) and changes in precipitation should cause altered abundances of water-demanding species. We analysed millions of records of thousands of species and found that the plant communities in most ecoregions in North, Central and South America have experienced thermophilization over the past four decades (1970–2011). Thermophilization was fastest in ecoregions with intermediate temperatures and was positively correlated with warming rates within many biomes. Changes in the relative abundances of water-demanding species were less consistent and were not correlated with changes in precipitation, meaning that the drought sensitivity of some ecoregions may be increasing despite decreasing rainfall and increasing probabilities of drought. Climate-driven changes in plant community composition will affect the function and stability of New World ecoregions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089540269

Academics and practitioners, however, confront limits and barriers to the adaptation both in theory and practice. Despite the extensive efforts in understanding limits and barriers, little is still known about political and institutional barriers, more specifically political challenges in Indigenous communities that typically nullify the effect of adaptation strategies. This study investigates the experience of the Mohawk community of Kanesatake, a First Nations community in Canada, during and after the 2017 and the 2019 floods in Quebec. Results reveal the links between the proximate set of barriers and historical, political pressures in Indigenous communities. Findings explain that unhealed wounds in relationships among nations generate political and institutional hurdles, which eventually orchestrate the co-occurrence of multiple barriers: the lack of land ownership rights, insurance, and social institutions such as police force and firefighters, to name a few. Findings have implications both for theory and practice. In theory, the findings reveal the fact that barriers are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are often interdependent. In practice, findings support the fact that policies fail if they disregard underlying interdependencies. © 2020","Canada; Climate change adaptation; Indigenous community of Kanesatake; Institutional fragmentation; Political barriers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087476143

This environmental change forces the entire Barents Sea ecosystem to adapt and restructure and therefore changes in pelagic-benthic coupling, organic matter sedimentation and long-term carbon sequestration are expected. Here we combine new and existing organic and inorganic geochemical surface sediment data from the western Barents Sea and show a clear link between the modern ecosystem structure, sea ice cover and the organic carbon and CaCO 3 contents in Barents Sea surface sediments. Furthermore, we discuss the sources of total and reactive iron phases and evaluate the spatial distribution of organic carbon bound to reactive iron. Consistent with a recent global estimate we find that on average 21.0 ± 8.3 per cent of the total organic carbon is associated to reactive iron (fOC-Fe R) in Barents Sea surface sediments. The spatial distribution of fOC-Fe R, however, seems to be unrelated to sea ice cover, Atlantic water inflow or proximity to land. Future Arctic warming might, therefore, neither increase nor decrease the burial rates of iron-associated organic carbon. However, our results also imply that ongoing sea ice reduction and the associated alteration of vertical carbon fluxes might cause accompanied shifts in the Barents Sea surface sedimentary organic carbon content, which might result in overall reduced carbon sequestration in the future.

An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

This study probes into the coupling mechanism between carbon emissions and added values among different sectors of 30 regions in China with average propagation length analysis. Average propagation length index is employed to evaluate the connection length of trade linkages between regions and sectors within input–output framework in the production chain. The results reflect the unbalance of industrial chain's value distributions and the carbon emission distributions as well. From regional perspective, the developed regions like Beijing and Shanghai outsource the carbon emissions embodied in primary products via the production chain, while such carbon-intensive products generating in surround regions achieve lower portion of added value gains. Along the whole production chains, most of the added value benefits are obtained from the trade, finance, and real estate sectors in developed regions, which hardly generate carbon emissions. From sectoral view, the sectors like construction and real estate industry have specific roles in context of the whole production chains, whose upper production streams are complex and correlated with carbon-intensive sectors like metal, nonmetal, and equipment production. It can be concluded that the combination of the size of the linkages and the distance between sectors may visualize the added value and emission structure between each sector and region along the production chains. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Average propagation length; Decarbonization policy; Linkage analysis; Production chain","Commerce; Construction equipment; Industrial emissions; Carbon emissions; Coupling mechanism; Developed regions; Primary products; Production streams; Propagation lengths; Real estate industries; Value distribution; Carbon; carbon emission; emission control; equipment; input-output analysis; policy making; primary production; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086563616

Data were collected through structured interviews, institutional data, and literature reviews. These data were analyzed in a quantitative descriptive. Most of the paddy fields are converted for home and housing, partially used for economic activities that have higher land rent such as shops, boarding houses, and restaurants. The perceived impact is increasing air temperature, air pollution, also reduced employment opportunities and income from agricultural sector.

Satellite‐derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used for PM2.5 estimation. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the gaps caused by data deficiency impede its better application at the urban scale. Additionally, obtaining accurate results in unsampled spatial areas when PM2.5 ground sites are insufficient and distribute sparsely is also a challenging issue for PM2.5 spatial distribution estimation. This paper aimed to develop a model, i.e., spatially local extreme gradient boosting (SL‐XGB), combining the powerful fitting ability of machine learning and optimal bandwidths of local models, to better estimate PM2.5 concentration at the urban scale by using Beijing as the study area. This paper adopted simplified high‐resolution MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm (SARA) AOD at 500 m resolution as the major independent variable, hence, ensuring the estimation can be operated at a fine scale. Moreover, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was adopted to fill the gaps in SARA AOD, thus improving its availability. Then, based on full‐covered SARA AOD and other multisource data, the SL‐XGB model, integrating multiple local XGBoost models and particular optimal bandwidths, was trained to estimate PM2.5 concentration. For comparison, SL‐XGB and two other models, XGBoost and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were evaluated by 10‐fold cross validation (CV). The sample‐based CV results reveal that the SL‐XGB performed the best as assessed through R2 (0.88), root mean square error (RMSE = 24.08 μg/m3) and mean prediction error (MPE = 16.90 μg/m3). Additionally, SL‐XGB also performed the best in the site‐based CV with a R2 of 0.86, a RMSE of 26.15 μg/m3 and a MPE of 17.97 μg/m3, which shows its good spatial generalization ability. These results demonstrate that SL‐XGB can better simultaneously handle non‐linear and spatial heterogeneity issues despite spatially limited data at the urban scale. As far as the PM2.5 concentration distribution was concerned, it presented a gradient increase in PM2.5 concentrations from the northwest to the southeast in Beijing, with abundant spatial details.

Here, novel CNDs (blue-emitting CNDs (b-CNDs) and green-emitting CNDs (g-CNDs)) with tunable redox abilities and emission are synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal method. The redox ability of CNDs is regulated by surface state tailoring. The abundant reductive groups on the surfaces endow the b-CNDs appealing reducibility, whereas g-CNDs with fewer surface functional groups are deficient in reducibility. Using HAuCl4 indicator, the distinct reducibility of CNDs is visually identified. Gold salts are reduced to Au nanobelts under reduction and stabilization of b-CNDs, causing plasmons-induced color changes, whereas g-CNDs have no reduction effect on Au3+. The size-evolution process of Au nano-species can guide not only plasmonic absorbance alteration but also fluorescence (FL) and second-order scattering (SOS) changes. Therefore, based on the plasmonic morphology-induced SOS increasement and the Förster resonance energy transfer-induced FL switch off, the b-CNDs contribute to a ratiometric sensor coupled with FL and SOS for Au3+ detection. The ratiometric strategy displays a better sensitivity and selectivity and a broader linear range than single-signal SOS or FL method. The regulation of redox CNDs and ratiometric assay of Au3+ provide a new prospect for the preparation and application of versatile CNDs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorescence and scattering ratiometric sensing; Plasmonic nanocrystals; Redox carbon nanodots; Reducibility visualization; Tunable fluorescence","Chlorine compounds; Energy transfer; Gold; Gold compounds; Morphology; Nanodots; Plasmonics; Surface states; Systems engineering; Controlled synthesis; Hydrothermal methods; Ratiometric sensing; Ratiometric sensors; Resonance energy transfer; Second order scattering; Surface functional groups; Tunable properties; Diamonds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085490285

However, the traditional lever method is insufficient in designing multi-row parallel-series multi-speed planetary gear automatic transmissions. In this study, an extended lever method is proposed, which can design and analyze the transmission state of planetary gears with multiple input elements, multiple output elements and no fixed elements. Then, based on the extended lever method, a series of multi-speed planetary gear automatic transmissions are designed, among which a twelve-speed planetary gear automatic transmission is selected, and the kinematics and dynamics are analyzed by using the lever method. The results show that the designed twelve-speed transmission has a wide range of speed ratios, with up to seven overdrive gears and a smaller speed ratio interval of each overdrive gear.

Mini-channel solar panels incorporating a novel multiple-throughout-flowing loop are used for heat collection, whilst a vapour injection air source heat pump (VI-ASHP) is innovatively combined with an underfloor heating and cooling system. To demonstrate the system, a multiple-throughout-flowing mini-channel solar thermal panel array of 36 m2 and a VI-ASHP of 40 kW heating capacity have been built and tested. Subsequently, mathematical models of the solar-assisted VI-ASHP system are established and compared with the experimental data. Based on the validated models, the energetic, economic and environmental performance is investigated under the typical weather conditions for a northern Chinese city (Taiyuan). The results indicate that, for a common rural house employing the proposed novel system, the proportion of the annual heat requirement, cooling load and hot water heating energy provided by solar thermal energy, photovoltaic energy and electricity from the power grid is 74.6%, 6.9%, and 18.5% respectively, thus giving a total energy supply proportion of 81.5% from solar energy. In addition, compared with a coal-powered system, our system has a cost payback period of 6.52 years and a life-cycle net cost saving of 56328.4RMB, thus the proposed system provides a greater economic performance. Furthermore, it can save 5tons of anthracite coal and reduce carbon emissions by 12.1tons annually.

Understanding carbon emissions characteristics in this region is crucial to promote ecological security with rapid development. Qinghai, located in Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau in western China, plays a special part in the global ecosystem. This study examines carbon emissions from residential consumption and the underlying influencing factors of the overall emission change in 2002 and 2012 in Qinghai. Findings show that total residential consumption-based carbon emissions rose rapidly between 2002 and 2012, from 1139.51 to 9066.34 Kt with an average growth of 23 % annually. The largest emitters shifted from living-type sectors (e.g. agriculture, and food and tobacco) to development-type ones (e.g. chemical products, and non-metallic mineral products); a 6-fold increase has occurred in household-related carbon emissions per capita in Qinghai from 2002 to 2012, which was mainly prompted by the household consumption level (43 %) followed by carbon intensity (27 %) and economic structure (14 %), while household consumption structure and urbanization level have relatively small effects, 10 % and 5% respectively. Given Qinghai's important role in promoting ecological security, the significant slash in carbon emissions will require a transition to a low-carbon socio-economic system. The study is helpful for making policies towards low-carbon development and the sustainable development of western China. Moreover, this study provides new insight into carbon emission differences between urban and rural residents and identifies the driving forces of carbon emissions, which could provide guidance for related research in other areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Drivers; Household consumption; Qinghai; Structure decomposition analysis; Sustainable regional development; Urbanization","Agricultural robots; Ecology; Economics; Housing; Mineral industry; Sustainable development; Ecological security; Household Consumption; Low-carbon development; Nonmetallic minerals; Residential consumption; Socio-economic systems; Urban and Rural Residents; Urbanization levels; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086473391

Design/methodology/approach: The research method used in this paper is the multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model, which is an effective policy effect assessment method. To further address the issue of endogeneity, the DID integrated with the propensity score matching (PSM-DID) approach is employed to eliminate the potential self-selection bias. Findings: The results show that the HSR has significantly reduced industrial pollution emissions, which is validated by several robustness tests. Compared with peripheral cities, HSR exerts a greater impact on industrial pollution emissions in central cities. In addition, the mechanism test reveals that the optimised allocation of inter-city industries is an important channel for HSR to mitigate industrial pollution emissions, and this is closely related to the location of HSR stations. Originality/value: Previous studies have paid more attention to evaluating the economic effects of HSR, however, most of these studies overlook its environmental effects. Consequently, the impact of HSR on industrial pollution emissions is led by using multi-period DID models in this paper, in which the environmental effects are measured. The results of this paper can provide a reference for the pollution reduction policies and also the coordinated development of economic growth and environmental quality. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China’s prefecture-level cities; High-speed railway; Industrial pollution emissions; Multi-period difference-in-differences model","Economic and social effects; Economics; Industrial railroads; Pollution control; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Design/methodology/approach; Difference-in-differences; Difference-in-differences models; Environmental quality; High - speed railways; High speed railways (HSR); Industrial pollution; Propensity score matching; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078938232

It is found that regulated geothermal heating system can postpone the formation of thermal breakthroughs and shrink radius of the cold front. It's also indicated that well spacing and production rate are the two main factors affecting the production performance and emission reduction of geothermal heating systems.

The use of condensed tannins (CT) as a natural feed additive to modulate ruminal archaea can mitigate the methane emissions from cattle in tropical systems. We investigated the effects of CT on in vivo methane emissions and rumen microbiota ecology in beef cattle. Batch experiments were also conducted to evaluate the impact of dietary CT on the biogas production from beef cattle manure. Six adult rumen-cannulated Nellore cattle were used in a double 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of three diets containing either a 0%, 1.25% or 2.5% CT additive from Acacia mimosa extract. The experimental period consisted of 63 days, and methane production was measured using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) technique from Day 16 to 21 of each feeding period. Adding Acacia extract to the diets reduced daily methane emissions per animal. Methane suppression occurred more by reduction of intake than by the direct effect on methanogenic archaea. We verified that CT directly suppresses archaea rumen communities and increases total rumen bacteria. Our study indicates that CT benefit rumen Fibrobactersuccinogenes and Ruminoccous flavefaciens populations and have no negative effect on biogas production from cattle manure. Acacia extract as a feed additive has promising potential as part of an overall nutritional strategy to reduce the methanogenesis from Zebu beef cattle in tropical systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bovine; Methane; Phenolic compounds; SF6 tracer technique; Sustainability","Acacia extract; biogas; condensed tannin; methane; plant extract; sulfur hexafluoride; tannin; unclassified drug; biofuel; proanthocyanidin; adult; animal experiment; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; controlled study; dietary intake; energy yield; feeding behavior; fermentation; Fibrobacter succinogenes; in vivo study; male; manure; methanogenesis; Nellore cattle; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; Ruminococcus flavefaciens; animal; animal food; archaeon; biosynthesis; bovine; Brazil; diet; dietary supplement; drug effect; metabolism; microbiology; rumen; tropic climate; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Archaea; Biofuels; Brazil; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Male; Methane; Proanthocyanidins; Rumen; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086366768

Development planning for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment was utilised in the study. Using multi-stage sampling procedure, 193 vegetable farmers in selected sites prominent for vegetable production from Uganda, Ghana and Nigeria were used. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and linear regression at α0.05. Awareness of climate variability and change was high among most respondents from the three countries, but highest among respondents from Uganda (78.3%). Awareness was highest for long dry spell (x¯ = 1.90) and drought (x¯ = 1.81) and lowest for harmful gas emissions (x¯ = 0.76). Changes in climate variability and trends were perceived to be highest in terms of flood volume/damage caused by flood to farmlands in Nigeria (x¯ = 3.85) and Uganda (x¯ = 5.0), but in terms of increased temperature for Ghana (x¯ = 4.93). Impact of climate-related changes on vegetable farming was high in Ghana (98.3%) and Nigeria (46.6%) but low in Uganda (5.0%). Awareness (β = 0.14), perception (β = 0.15) use of adaptation strategies (β = 0.10) and household size (β = − 0.19) predicted change in perceived impact of climate variability among vegetable farmers. Vegetable farmers in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda are affected differently by climate variability. Farmers in these countries also have different priorities for adaptation strategies. Locality-specific climate adaptation strategies would help ease farmers burden due to climate change. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate variability; Ghana; Livelihood impacts; Nigeria; Uganda; Vegetable farming","adaptive management; climate change; climate variation; drought; flood; livelihood; perception; strategic approach; sustainability; Ghana; Nigeria; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075206803

Low energy requirements and small size can potentially contribute to sustainable mobility in terms of climate protection and reduced local emissions. Our study evaluates how three-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles, categorised as L-Class according to Regulation (EU)No168/2013, can contribute to more efficient use of space in urban areas. Evaluations of expert interviews, an extensive literature research, and analyses of the German national household travel survey (MiD) serve as the basis of the study. First, the substitution potential of trips through LEVs is explored using MiD data. Our findings show that between 17% and 49% of trips made and 6% to 30% of the distance covered by private trips can theoretically be substituted by LEVs. Thus, reorganisation of current land use offers potential and additionally, LEVs are an attractive and sustainable addition to other means of transport and contribute to achieving the climate protection goals of the transport sector. Due to the fact that technology application is restricted by travel behaviour and political support, our study discusses possible support by public bodies towards sustainable mobility. Here, the promotion of LEVs in combination with restrictive measures for cars is necessary. © 2020 by the authors.","LEV; Light electric vehicles; Small electric vehicles; Urban land use; Urban mobility","electric vehicle; emission control; environmental protection; feasibility study; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; travel behavior; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092629550

In this study, it is aimed to compare the results using Ohm’s law, Thermionic Emission theory (TE), Norde and Cheung-Cheung functions. The I–V measurement of the Au/7%Gr-doped PVA/n-GaAs type SD was taken in the range of 80–360 K in 20 K steps. Considering that each method is effective in the different voltage region of the I–V curve and the parameters are strongly voltage-dependent, the results are compatible with each other. Also, the interface states (Nss) were calculated with and without Rs for each temperature value, and it was attained that the effect of Rs reduced Nss values by almost 1 degree. This result reveals the importance of the Rs parameter for SDs. As a result, it is plainly represented that the basic diode parameters n, Rs and ΦBo values are strongly dependent on temperature and voltage, and affected by barrier inhomogeneity and surface states. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Diodes; Electric resistance; Interface states; Thermionic emission; Barrier inhomogeneities; Device parameters; Different voltages; Ideality factors; Series resistances; Temperature values; Thermionic emission theory; Voltage dependence; Schottky barrier diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091730237

Besides economic aspects, uncertainties concerning the long-term operation reliability and limited exhaust emissions of R100-operated agricultural machinery are hindering market entry. Thus, the aim of this research is to evaluate field experiences, such as downtimes and repairs, engine oil quality, and cold start behaviour, over a total period of more than 50,000 operation hours with 18 tractors. The tested tractors range from European Union exhaust gas stages I to IV and were configured for the use of R100. Additionally, performance, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter were measured on a tractor test stand. The tractors demonstrated their full functionality under usual Bavarian farm conditions in daily use. Within the tractor fleet, no serious engine damage was observed, while minor malfunctions and necessary repairs occurred just occasionally. The operational reliability of the tested rapeseed-oil-fuelled tractors seemed to be comparable to that of diesel-fuelled tractors. The results of recurrent power and fuel consumption measurements gave no indication of engine deterioration. Furthermore, measurements proved that differences in exhaust gas emissions between R100 and diesel operation were marginal. Tractor models with exhaust gas after treatment systems were characterized by low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in particular. With the 18 tractors running on R100, about 220 tonnes of CO2eq per year were saved on average from 2015 to 2017. It can be concluded that the usage of pure rapeseed oil fuel (R100) in compatible agricultural machinery is an implementable alternative to diesel fuel and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. Nevertheless, there are some challenges to solve, particularly for modern agricultural machines with engines with exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","Agricultural machinery; Biofuel; Emission; Operation reliability; Pure plant oil fuel","Agricultural robots; Biodiesel; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Oilseeds; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Repair; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Vegetable oils; Aftertreatment systems; Agricultural machine; Consumption measurement; Emission characteristics; Engine deterioration; Operation reliability; Operational reliability; Particulate Matter; Automobile testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100774867

Extreme weather events like heavy rains cause sewers to overflow and may result in urban flooding a common scenario to the cities in developing countries like Bangladesh. With a current population of 1.4 million estimated to rise to 2.9 million by 2030, Khulna is more prone to urban flooding due to lower topography and sea-level rise due to climate change. This research aims to find the different aspects of climatic vulnerability and how the city is sustaining by gaining resilience and adaptation in the hostile climatic condition due to climate change and sea level rise. Different spatial analysis viz. land use-land cover mapping, flood mapping based on Digital Elevation Model, catchment delineation, hazard and risk mapping, physical vulnerability, etc. carried out to understand the climatic hazard condition and its impacts on different aspects. It is found that 0.25m and 0.50m sea level rise (SLR) leads to inundate 5% and 9% of the city where 4% and 6% are agriculture respectively within the city. Within this range, residential uses inundate 0.50% and 1% respectively. The city has 52% open field and greeneries and 14% waterbodies which can absorb 0.50m SLR accepting 1% inundation of the residential land uses.

Knowledge of these traits can inform the likely persistence of urban forests under future, more severe climates. We assessed the plasticity of morphological and physiological traits of tree species planted along an urban climatic gradient in the Greater Sydney region during a severe, multi-year drought in eastern Australia. We selected four sites along a ∼55 km east-west transect, ranging from the cool/wet coast to the warm/dry inland. We assessed five tree species (four natives, one exotic) with different predicted climatic vulnerability based on climate-origins, estimating functional traits indicative of drought tolerance: carbon isotope composition (δ13C), Huber value (HV), specific leaf area (SLA), wood density (WD), and leaf turgor loss point (πtlp). Broadly, trees planted in warm/dry sites had more negative πtlp, higher WD, δ13C and HV, and lower SLA than cool/wet sites, indicating phenotypic plasticity to drought. The leaf-level traits πtlp, δ13C and SLA were more strongly correlated with temperature and precipitation, compared to HV and WD. Species differed in the extent of their trait shifts along the transect, with greater plasticity evident in the exotic Celtis australis and the more temperate cool-climate Tristaniopsis laurina, compared to the more tropical, warm-climate Cupaniopsis anacardioides, which showed limited plasticity and lower drought tolerance. Our findings reveal adaptive capacity of urban trees to climate via plasticity in drought tolerance traits, which can direct species selection to improve urban forests resistance to climate change. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Drought tolerance; Osmotic potential; Phenotypic plasticity; Turgor loss point; Urban planning; Water-use efficiency","adaptation; carbon isotope; climate change; drought; phenotypic plasticity; precipitation (climatology); tolerance; tree; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Celtis australis; Cupaniopsis anacardioides; Tristaniopsis laurina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087218324

This paper explores the use of experimental data to develop exposure-response relationships for use in risk assessment studies. These studies have typically identified the USA mid-West, much of Europe, the Indo Gangetic Plain in South Asia and the Eastern coastal region of China as global regions where O 3 is likely to threaten food supply and other ecosystems. Global risk assessment modelling estimates yield losses of staple crops between 3 to 16% causing economic losses of between US$14 to 26 billion in the year 2000. Changes in anthropogenic emissions of O 3 precursors in recent decades have modified O 3 concentration profiles (peaks versus background O 3) and global distributions with the Northern Hemisphere seeing increases in O 3 levels of between 1 and 5 ppb/decade since the 1950s and the emergence of Asia as the region with the highest O 3 concentrations. In the future, O 3 mitigation could focus on methane (CH 4) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions; these will differentially influence global and local/regional O 3 concentrations and influence daily and seasonal profiles. The consequent effects on vegetation will in part depend on how these changes in O 3 profile alter the exceedance of detoxification thresholds for plant damage. Adaptation options may play an important role in enhancing food supply while mitigation strategies are being implemented. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which O 3 affects plants, and how this might influence detoxification thresholds and interactions with other environmental variables such as water stress and nutrients, would help develop O 3 deposition and impact models to support the development of crop, land-surface exchange and ultimately earth system models for holistic assessments of global change.

Second, utilizing real-word delivery demand data, full-day parcel-delivery operations of a three-digit postal code area in both urban and rural contexts are simulated for UAVs and ground delivery modes. The results show that in general, UAVs produce significantly lower emissions compared to ground delivery per parcel-km and up to 35% compared to electric vehicles.

We apply a forest-water and land-atmosphere interaction lens to current strategies for improving landscape resilience in the West African Sahel and the concept of the Great Green Wall (GGW). The severe and extensive drought of the 1970's–1990's led many to assess future climate and promote strategies to counter the gradual southward expansion of the Sahara. The idea for the GGW, a wall of trees intended to slow desert encroachment, grew out of this period of tremendous upheaval and human tragedy. Despite partial recovery in the local rainfall regime, we know far too little about whether the GGW strategy can even work. Further, it seems disingenuous to ignore the climatic envelope, which sets the boundaries within which forest-water and land-atmosphere interactions occur. Applying what we call the “forest-water and land-atmosphere interaction lens” to landscape restoration as a tool for achieving improved resilience and human welfare in the Sahel provides meaningful input for re-thinking the GGW strategy. We upgrade current knowledge with the specific biophysical conditions likely to support appropriate forest-water and land atmosphere interactions in the region and further fit such approaches within the context of the climatic envelope. The principal components of an improved strategy include a focus on large scale precipitation recycling all the way from the West African coast on into the Sahel, as well as improved tree, shrub and forest cover in the Sahel proper to promote infiltration, groundwater recharge, rainfall triggering potential and land surface cooling. Agroforestry can further broadly promote landscape resilience in the greater region. Strategies broadly focused on increasing rainfall recycling, water availability and the promotion of landscape resilience appear more likely to steer future efforts in useful directions. © 2020 The Authors","Ecosystem-based adaptation; Forest landscape restoration; Forest-water interactions; Great Green Wall; Sahel; Sub-Saharan Africa","Conservation; Forestry; Groundwater; Land reclamation; Rain; Restoration; Biophysical conditions; Ground water recharge; Land atmosphere interaction; Landscape restoration; Large-scale precipitation; Partial recovery; Principal Components; Water availability; Water recycling; ground water; rain; water; agroforestry; environmental assessment; environmental restoration; forest management; land-atmosphere interaction; reforestation; strategic approach; water availability; Article; biophysics; climate; ecosystem restoration; environmental resilience; forest; landscape; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; recycling; shrub; tree; water and water related phenomena; welfare; Africa; drought; ecosystem; forest; human; tree; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Africa, Northern; Droughts; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086369186

Concerns about potential impacts and uncertainties of climate change on Eucalyptus plantations productivity are arising and studies about that are still scarce. This study assesses the effects of climate change on Eucalyptus plantations productivity across a geographic gradient in Brazil by mid- and end-century and quantifies the uncertainty of climate and productivity projections. Ten global circulation models (GCM) under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios, for the 2040–2069 and 2070–2099 periods were used for future climate projections. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model was used to simulate the Eucalyptus mean annual increment (MAI, m3 ha−1 yr−1) at seven years for eight locations in Brazil. The response of Eucalyptus productivity is expected to be site-specific and will mostly depend on the balance between the possible negative effects of increasing temperatures and the potential productivity increments caused by higher CO2 concentration. Plantations located in South and Southeast Brazil are expected to experience increases in MAI, while those located in Center-North Brazil will experience more pronounced MAI reductions. Uncertainties in projections are higher under RCP8.5 and for the end-of-century, especially for annual rainfall and MAI. Future climate projections from GCMs coupled with a Eucalyptus simulation model provide valuable information to facilitate the exploration of potential strategies and guidance of policy decision-making for forestry adaptation to climate change on a regional or national scale. However, forest companies and foresters should be cautious when using projected information for local-scale adaptation options, as the uncertainties in climate (especially in rainfall) and productivity projections are substantially large. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM Eucalyptus model; Climate change uncertainties; Eucalyptus productivity; Global circulation models; Temperature stresses","Climate models; Decision making; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum prospecting; Productivity; Rain; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change projections; Eucalyptus plantations; Future climate projections; Global circulation model; Increasing temperatures; Mean annual increments; Potential productivity; Climate change; agrometeorology; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; environmental gradient; greenhouse gas; plantation forestry; precipitation assessment; rainfall; temperature effect; Brazil; Decision Making; Eucalyptus; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Plantations; Productivity; Rain; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087486668

Emissions are mainly clustered along major ship routes both in open seas and close to densely populated shorelines. Major air pollutants emitted include sulfur dioxide, NOx , and primary particles. Sulfur and NOx are both major contributors to the formation of secondary fine particles (PM2:5) and to acidification and eutrophication. In addition, NOx is a major precursor for ground-level ozone. In this paper, we quantify the contributions from international shipping to European air pollution levels and depositions. This study is based on global and regional model calculations. The model runs are made with meteorology and emission data representative of the year 2017 after the tightening of the SECA (sulfur emission control area) regulations in 2015 but before the global sulfur cap that came into force in 2020. The ship emissions have been derived using ship positioning data. We have also made model runs reducing sulfur emissions by 80% corresponding to the 2020 requirements. This study is based on model sensitivity studies perturbing emissions from different sea areas: The northern European SECA in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, the Atlantic Ocean close to Europe, shipping in the rest of the world, and finally all global ship emissions together. Sensitivity studies have also been made setting lower bounds on the effects of ship plumes on ozone formation. Both global-and regional-scale calculations show that for PM2:5 and depositions of oxidised nitrogen and sulfur, the effects of ship emissions are much larger when emissions occur close to the shore than at open seas. In many coastal countries, calculations show that shipping is responsible for 10% or more of the controllable PM2:5 concentrations and depositions of oxidised nitrogen and sulfur. With few exceptions, the results from the global and regional calculations are similar. Our calculations show that substantial reductions in the contributions from ship emissions to PM2:5 concentrations and to depositions of sulfur can be expected in European coastal regions as a result of the implementation of a 0.5% worldwide limit of the sulfur content in marine fuels from 2020. For countries bordering the North Sea and Baltic Sea SECA, low sulfur emissions have already resulted in marked reductions in PM2:5 from shipping before 2020. For ozone, the lifetime in the atmosphere is much longer than for PM2:5, and the potential for ozone formation is much larger in otherwise pristine environments. We calculate considerable contributions from open sea shipping. As a result, we find that the largest contributions to ozone in several regions and countries in Europe are from sea areas well outside European waters. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

In this work, a novel integrated scanning electrochemical cell microspectroscopy (iSECCMS) capability is developed by combining a high spatial resolution electrochemical scanning probe with in situ fluorescence spectroscopy. Using 6-carboxyfluorescein as a fluorescent probe, the iSECCMS platform is employed to measure the effect of the detrimental generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed at the active sites of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Carbon-supported tantalum-doped titanium oxide (TaTiOx) catalysts, a potential Pt-group-metal-free (PGM-free) cathode material explored for low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), is used as a representative model ORR system, where generation of intermediate H2O2 instead of fully oxidized H2O is a major concern. We establish that the iSECCMS platform provides a novel and versatile capability for spatially resolved mapping of in situ ROS generation and activity during the kinetically-limited ORR and may, therefore, aid the future characterization and development of high-performance PGM-free PEFC cathodes. © Copyright © 2020 Edgecomb, Xie, Shao, El-Khoury, Johnson and Prabhakaran.","fuel cell; in situ fluorescence probe; oxygen reduction reaction; peroxide generation; reactive oxygen species",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094936914

In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance—or partial N balance—the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions.

More complete assessments of net landscape C balances (NLCB) are needed that integrate both emissions by fire and transfer to aquatic systems, two key loss pathways of terrestrial C. These pathways can be particularly significant in the wet–dry tropics, where fire plays a fundamental part in ecosystems and where intense rainfall and seasonal flooding can result in considerable aquatic C export (ΣFaq). Here, we determined the NLCB of a lowland catchment (~140 km2) in tropical Australia over 2 years by evaluating net terrestrial productivity (NEP), fire-related C emissions and ΣFaq (comprising both downstream transport and gaseous evasion) for the two main landscape components, that is, savanna woodland and seasonal wetlands. We found that the catchment was a large C sink (NLCB 334 Mg C km−2 year−1), and that savanna and wetland areas contributed 84% and 16% to this sink, respectively. Annually, fire emissions (−56 Mg C km−2 year−1) and ΣFaq (−28 Mg C km−2 year−1) reduced NEP by 13% and 7%, respectively. Savanna burning shifted the catchment to a net C source for several months during the dry season, while ΣFaq significantly offset NEP during the wet season, with a disproportionate contribution by single major monsoonal events—up to 39% of annual ΣFaq was exported in one event. We hypothesize that wetter and hotter conditions in the wet–dry tropics in the future will increase ΣFaq and fire emissions, potentially further reducing the current C sink in the region. More long-term studies are needed to upscale this first NLCB estimate to less productive, yet hydrologically dynamic regions of the wet–dry tropics where our result indicating a significant C sink may not hold. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon dioxide; fire-related emissions; fluvial carbon transport; inland waters; land carbon sink; methane; net ecosystem carbon budget; seasonal wetland","carbon balance; carbon sink; catchment; fire; methane; net ecosystem production; savanna; tropical environment; wetland; Australia; carbon; carbon dioxide; Australia; ecosystem; grassland; Australia; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Grassland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089391142

The continuous rise of the sea-level due to global warming is likely to have a devastating impact on the Sundarbans, a ‘World Heritage Site’, deltaic complex, albeit highly prone to extreme and/or adverse climatic events including disasters. Accordingly, keeping in view this issue, the present study was designed to understand the multi-criterion decision-making ability vis-à-vis adoption of different adaptation strategies among the farming community of the Indian Sundarbans. A total of 120 farmers, who were growing crops, rearing livestock, apart from being involved in fisheries, simultaneously, were selected from 5 blocks of the Indian Sundarbans. The study revealed 19 adaptation strategies followed by the farmers of the said locality. Further, to trace the best adaptation strategy, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used.

We examined how spatial variation in herbivory and climate influences flowering size and the occurrence of semelparity (reproducing once) versus iteroparity (reproducing multiple times) in the introduced range of an invasive plant, houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Houndstongue is a short-lived, semelparous perennial in its native range. In its introduced range, we previously documented increased rates of iteroparity and a higher median threshold flowering size compared to the native range. We hypothesized that the recent introduction of a specialist biocontrol insect (a root-boring weevil, Mogulones crucifer) would decrease threshold flowering size and reduce the proportion of iteroparous plants because M. crucifer preferentially attacks large individuals and may reduce overwinter survival. METHODS: We surveyed 24 sites across the northwestern United States to quantify the frequency of semelparity versus iteroparity and to estimate weevil abundance and used demographic data collected from six sites to estimate median threshold flowering size. RESULTS: We found that sites with greater winter precipitation and no weevils had a greater proportion of iteroparous plants. Sites with higher weevil attack had a lower median threshold flowering size. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in frequency of flowering and threshold flowering size that we documented in North American houndstongue populations, and the relationships between this variation and herbivory and climate, provide evidence for how selective pressures covary with the life histories of invasive plants. © 2020 Botanical Society of America","biological control; Boraginaceae; Cynoglossum officinale; delayed reproduction; facultative biennial; flowering frequency; iteroparity; monocarpy; semelparity; size-dependent flowering","abundance; abundance estimation; colonization; dicotyledon; herbivore; herbivory; introduced species; invasive species; life history; plant-herbivore interaction; precipitation (climatology); spatial variation; United States; Boraginaceae; Curculionidae; Cynoglossum officinale; Hexapoda; Mogulones; animal; Boraginaceae; herbivory; life history trait; United States; weevil; Animals; Boraginaceae; Herbivory; Life History Traits; Northwestern United States; Weevils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091372732

When more renewable energy (RE) sources are integrated into a grid, declining wholesale market prices reduce the incentive to build new thermal capacity – leading to the ‘missing money’ problem; intermittent RE requires more fast-responding (peak-load) generation to maintain system stability. Some regions use capacity payments to incentivize investment in new peak-load capacity. For a fossil-fuel dominated system, we find that battery storage might replace peak gas as a fast-responding generating asset. Specifically, we determine whether Alberta can eliminate coal-fired power and further reduce reliance on natural gas using a hybrid RE system that includes battery storage. We employ 10 years of provincial wind, solar and load data and a mathematical programming model to simulate the choice of optimal generation mixes under various carbon tax scenarios. We find that high carbon taxes incentivize greater wind integration and battery storage, but that solar photovoltaic (PV) remains uneconomical. Coal and gas-fired baseload capacities can be partially substituted by the renewables, but, in the absence of battery storage, fast-responding, open-cycle gas capacity is required to maintain system reliability. A battery can potentially replace some fast-responding gas capacity, thereby mitigating the ‘missing money’ problem, but this is not always the case. Overall, CO2 emissions can be reduced by some 20 percent but at a cost of $200/tCO2 or more. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Battery; Capacity factor; Fossil fuels; Missing money; Renewable energy","Carbon; Coal storage; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas fuel storage; Gases; Investments; Mathematical programming; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; System stability; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Mathematical programming models; Optimal generation; Peak load generations; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaics; System reliability; Battery storage; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; natural gas; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy storage; feasibility study; incentive; natural gas; numerical model; pollution tax; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost; electricity; gas; missing money; renewable energy; solar energy; storage; tax; wind; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086708607

These interfacial sites play a vital role in many renewable applications, for instance, catalytic CO2 reduction. Postsynthesis deposition of metal oxide on supported metal catalysts can not only create such interfacial sites but also prevent particle sintering at high temperature. Here, we report a sol-gel-based strategy to synthesize an atomically dispersed ""precatalyst"". In contrast to the deposition on catalysts containing preformed nanoparticles, overcoating this material before reductive treatment can inhibit particle growth during thermal activation steps, yielding highly accessible, sintering-resistant Pd clusters that are less than 2 nm in diameter. This synthetic approach allows us to engineer interfacial sites while maintaining high metal accessibility, which was difficult to achieve in previous overcoated materials. Notably, engineering the Pd-ZrO2 interface into an inverted interface with an amorphous ZrO2 overcoat might facilitate a C-O cleavage route instead of a mechanism containing a bicarbonate intermediate during CO2 hydrogenation. We also observed that carbon deposition occurring on methanation sites could be a key factor for improving CO selectivity. Alteration of the reaction pathway, along with the deactivation of certain sites, led to 100% CO selectivity on the ZrO2@Pd/ZrO2 catalyst. This work demonstrated that overcoated materials could represent a promising class of heterogeneous catalysts for selective CO2 conversion over noble metals, which have higher rates and thermal stability compared to state-of-the-art Cu-based catalysts.

The building structural frame itself is responsible for 20–30% of whole-life carbon over 50 years. This figure will double once we build net-zero operational carbon buildings. Carbon savings in the use of materials are therefore he key to reducing the environmental impact of buildings. Recent studies have shown that up to 40% of material in building structural frames could be successfully removed without affecting design code compliance. This unnecessary overdesign of buildings is in part due to a lack of structural optimisation, and acceptance by designers of conservative serviceability assumptions that represent the “low hanging fruit” of reducing embodied carbon in buildings. This paper examines steel frames buildings to determine the carbon savings that can be achieved for cross-section optimisation, as this is the most accessible form of optimisation, without changing the floor system and beam layout. For this purpose the Lightest Beam Method (LBM) was developed that studied non-composite universal beams (UB) members in buildings. Choosing the lightest section with the Eurocodes we can achieve 26.5% of steel savings by mass, with a half of beams governed by serviceability limit states (SLS). If deflection is calculated using variable loads, the proportion of beams governed by the SLS drops to 31.1% giving additional 2.2% mass savings. The highest steel savings of 34.5% can be achieved for lower natural frequency assumptions (3 Hz) and using the average rather than the characteristic steel yield strength. In this case the proportion of beams by mass governed by SLS drops to 19.7%. Based on available case studies it was found that 1/3 of steel in the frames could have been saved which represents 36% of initial embodied carbon or 5% of whole-life carbon for the building over 60 years. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers","initial embodied carbon; member optimisation; steel structures; whole-life carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087220556

The experiment was conducted in a 50-year-old sugarcane field on soils classed as Cambissolo Háplico (Inceptisol). Four plots were sampled: a) burning of sugarcane for harvest for 37 years (SCB37); b) renewal of the sugarcane field and burning for harvest for 3 years (SCB3); c) renewal of the sugarcane field without burning for harvest for 3 years (SCWB), and d) renewal of the sugarcane field and burning for harvest with the application of vinasse for 3 years (SCV). Chemical and physical characterization of SOM was performed by solid-state spectroscopy (UV–vis, ATR-FTIR e 13C NMR CP/MAS) and chemometric techniques. The results showed that sugarcane burning drastically impacts SOM content and its chemical structure, however, the application of vinasse preserves and restores the soil from the fire effects. Content of soil OC, particulate OC, mineral-associated OC, humic acid, humin and light fraction OM that were affected by fire, had an increase and recovery of contents by the vinasse application. Solid state spectroscopy showed that labile structures were lost in humic acids (HA) by fire and recalcitrant structures were preserved. The application of vinasse incorporated fragments of lipids and carbohydrates in HA structure. Burning sugar cane straw affects the integrity of soil organic matter but can be restored by applying vinasse. © 2020","13C NMR spectroscopy; Green management; Humic substances; Soil attributes; Soil organic carbon; Stubble burning","Biogeochemistry; Fires; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Harvesting; Organic acids; Restoration; Soils; Sugar cane; Chemometric techniques; Farming practices; Physical characterization; Soil organic matters; Solid state spectroscopies; Structural qualities; Structure of soils; Sugarcane cultivation; Organic carbon; carbohydrate; humic acid; lipid; organic carbon; soil organic matter; carbohydrate; cultivation; lipid; organic carbon; soil amendment; soil organic matter; spectroscopy; sugar cane; Article; Brazil; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical structure; chemometrics; coculture; environmental impact; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; harvest; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; soil analysis; solid state; sugarcane; ultraviolet spectroscopy; vinasse; wildfire; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086640604

This study assessed the effect of reduced emissions during the lockdown period, due to COVID-19, on air quality in three Italian cities, Florence, Pisa, and Lucca. For this study, we compared the concentration of particulate matter PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3 measured during the lockdown period, with values obtained in the same period of 2019. Our results show no evidence of a direct relationship between the lockdown measures implemented and PM reduction in urban centers, except in areas with heavy traffic. Consistent with recently published studies, we did, however, observe a significant decrease in NO2 concentrations among all the air-monitoring stations for each city in this study. Finally, O3 levels remained unchanged during the lockdown period. Of note, there were slight variations in the meteorological conditions for the same periods of different years. Our results suggest a need for further studies on the impact of vehicular traffic and industrial activities on PM air pollution, including adopting holistic source-control measures for improved air quality in urban environments. © 2020 by the authors.

However, impacts of emission reduction on regional air quality are not well quantified. This study evaluates the impacts of emission reduction and inter-annual meteorological conditions on regional air pollution transport in BTH region by employing Community Multiscale Air Quality model embedded with the Integrated Source Apportionment Model (CMAQ-ISAM). Results suggest that the regional transport contributed 32.5%–68.4% of total PM2.5 mass concentrations and 52.4%–83.2% of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium in 2017. During 2014–2017, the annual averaged PM2.5 concentrations in BTH region decreased by 33%, of which the decrease of local emissions, inter-regional transport and transport from outside the BTH region contributed for 47%, 25%, and 28%, respectively. Emission reductions (91%) mitigate not only the impacts of local sources, but also influence the regional transport with similar magnitude, demonstrating the effectiveness of multiple regional joint controls. The variation of meteorology contributes only 9% to the decrease of PM2.5 in BTH, with higher contributions from the change of regional transport compared to local sources since the regional transport is more sensitive to the meteorology variation. The impacts of meteorological variations are considerable, with over 20% on the relative changes of local and regional contributions, and up to 40% on regional transport in spring and winter. Therefore, more strengthened regional joint air pollution control is suggested in winter and spring for this region. © 2020","BTH region; Emission reduction; Meteorological changes; PM2.5; Regional transport","Air quality; Emission control; Meteorology; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Community multi-scale air quality models; Meteorological condition; Meteorological variation; PM2.5 concentration; Regional air pollution; Regional air quality; Regional transport; Atmospheric movements; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; air quality; ammonium; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; meteorology; nitrate; particulate matter; pollutant transport; source apportionment; sulfate; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air transportation; Article; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085959016

However, management of these even-aged plantations to maximize the joint benefits of wood production and carbon sequestration objectives for forest managers and policymakers remains unclear, especially under the stringent targets of 2 °C climatic change mitigation. Therefore, an efficient theoretical framework based on the typical Hartman model was developed in this paper to determine the optimal rotations of even-aged plantations, in which multiple wood products and carbon pools within an infinite time horizon were considered. As an example, the sensitivity of the optimal rotations and their corresponding land expectation values (LEVs) with respect to different carbon pools (i.e., wood products, bioenergy, harvested residuals, stump roots, and naturally generated dead organic matter), as well as a set of stand conditions (site index and stand density) and economic parameters (carbon price and discount rate) were quantitatively evaluated for state-owned larch plantations in northeast China. The results showed that the alternative carbon pools could increase the optimal rotations of larch plantations by 1–3 years for a commonly used management scenario (site index = 16 m, carbon price = 100 CNY/ton)). The optimal rotations decreased linearly with increasing site indices (R2 = 0.95) and initial densities (R2 = 0.98) but increased linearly with increasing carbon prices (R2 = 0.99); however, significant negative exponential trends were observed with increasing discount rates (R2 = 0.92). Except for some extreme cases (site index ≤12 m, discount rate ≥ 6%), the optimal rotations of LEVs are usually larger than those of maximizing sustainable timber yield, in which the differences between them were as much as approximately 4 years of site index (20 m), 6 years of initial density (6666 trees/ha), 15 years of carbon price (1000 CNY/ton) and 9 years of discount rate (3%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pools; Climatic change; Faustmann model; Larch plantation; Optimal rotation; Wood products","Carbon dioxide; Lakes; Rotation; Wood products; Carbon sequestration; Economic parameters; Infinite time horizon; Land expectation value; Larch plantations; Management scenarios; Negative exponential; Theoretical framework; Forestry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous tree; discount rate; forestry production; management practice; mitigation; plantation; rotation; state owned enterprise; sustainability; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Lakes; Larix; Management; Plantations; Rotation; Wood Products; China; Larix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087197541

Biological processes already meet these requirements, but show restrictions in case of treatment of complex volatile organic compound (VOC) mixtures and space demand. Innovative approaches combining advanced oxidation and biofiltration processes seem to be a solution.

Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the southwestern US are threatened by climate change and deforestation. Information about geographic patterns of provenance variation in budburst phenology is needed to make decisions about selecting seed sources for future planting. In this study, provenance variation in the budburst phenology of ponderosa pine seedlings was examined using common garden studies. Seedlings from 21 provenances, representing an elevational gradient in Arizona and New Mexico, were planted in July 2018 at a ponderosa pine-dominated field site in northern Arizona. Field budburst was monitored weekly on all seedlings in the spring of 2019. Field budburst was compared with budburst timing of the same provenances measured under greenhouse conditions. The hypotheses for this study were that (1) budburst varies among provenances, with earlier budburst in low-elevation provenances, and (2) differences in budburst timing among provenances are consistent for seedlings grown in greenhouse and field environments. Field results show that provenances vary in budburst date and that low-and middle-elevation provenances break bud sooner than high-elevation provenances. Field budburst date had a moderate, positive correlation with provenance mean annual precipitation (r = 0.522) and a moderate, negative trend with latitude (r = −0.413). Budburst date of provenances in the greenhouse had a moderate, positive trend with budburst date in the field (r = 0.554), suggesting application of greenhouse results to field plantings.

However, its use, benefits and interests may be different depending on gender. This paper aims at analyzing the gender differential impact of the use of seasonal forecast on the main crop yields (rice, maize, sorghum, millet and groundnut) and farm income in Senegal. We collected data from 1481 farmers (44% women) in four regions of Senegal. We applied the counterfactual outcomes framework of modern evaluation theory to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) of the use of the seasonal forecast on crop yield and farm income. The results showed a significant impact of the use of the seasonal forecast (SF) in the main crop yields and the agricultural income for farmers in Senegal. This impact varies according to the sex and the type of the crops. The users (men and women) of the seasonal forecast gained on average 158 kg/ha and 140 kg/ha more yield than the non-users, respectively, for millet and rice crops. The impact of the use of SF is greater for men on millet (202.7 kg/ha vs. 16.7 kg/ha) and rice (321.33 kg/ha vs. −25.3 kg/ha). However, it is greater for women on maize (210 kg/ha vs. −105 kg/ha). Potential users of seasonal forecast had also a positive and significant impact of 41$ per ha on the income. The additional income is more important for men (56$) than women (11$). These findings suggest that the use of seasonal forecast increases the productivity of rural communities and affects men and women differently. The access to and use of SF should therefore be widely promoted among farmers’ organizations; women’s associations should be particularly targeted. © 2020 by the authors.

Quantification of the pollution reduction is not straightforward due to effects of transport, meteorology, and chemistry. We have analyzed the NOx emission reductions calculated with an inverse algorithm applied to daily NO2 observations from TROPOMI onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. This method allows the quantification of emission reductions per city and the analysis of emissions of maritime transport and of the energy sector separately. The reductions we found are 20–50% for cities, about 40% for power plants, and 15–40% for maritime transport depending on the region.

Furthermore, it remains unclear how climate change will influence its frequency and distribution. We investigated the impact of climate change on the projected spatial distribution of favorable habitats for V. paradoxa. Species distribution modeling techniques implemented in MaxEnt combined with GIS were used to forecast the current and future distribution of V. paradoxa. We selected two climatic scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and two global climate models (MPI-ESM-MR and HadGEM2-ES) to encompass the full range of variation in the models. Presence records of the species were collected and linked to bioclimatic and edaphic variables. The most characteristic and least correlated variables were selected for modeling after a collinearity test. Under current climatic conditions, ~51% of the national area was found to be favorable for cultivation and conservation of the species. Under future climate projections, our models predict that favorable habitats of this species will decline by 12% (RCP4.5) and 13% (RCP8.5) by 2070.

Our aim was to assess the infiltration of vegetated urban soils and to identify the soil parameters affecting infiltration in order to explore the potential of these soils for run-off mitigation under a Mediterranean climate with extreme precipitation episodes. We compared vegetated soils in the “urban” zone of the Marseilles’ 16th district (France) either lying on former clay quarries or tile factories (T) or not (NT) and with different land-uses. We used a simplified method to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), measured penetration resistance in the first 0.15 m (Qd) and analysed physico-chemical properties in the first horizon. Levels of run-off production were estimated according to Kfs and an adaptation of USDA Hydrologic Soil Groups. All soils were Technosols or Anthrosols regardless of their prior history. We found that land-use history influenced Kfs, with T soils and soils with current vegetated land-use younger than 13 years having lower Kfs than NT soils and soils with land-use older than 13 years. Soil organic matter content influenced Kfs positively when soils were young, while vegetation cover and penetration resistance (most of the soils had Qd &gt; 2 MPa) had not a clear effect on Kfs. Overall, combining Kfs and soil depth, 14.3% of the T soils and 84.6% of the NT soils had low levels of run-off production. It is therefore recommended that 1) Technosols or Anthrosols should be characterised for their unique physico-chemical and physical properties but also for their land-use history, and 2) the infiltration of these soils should be considered in spatial planning documents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Compaction; Infiltration; Run-off; Technosols; Tile industry; Urban soils","Climatology; Hydraulic conductivity; Infiltration; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Urban planning; Extreme precipitation; Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity; Hydrologic soil groups; Mediterranean climates; Penetration resistances; Physico-chemicals; Simplified method; Soil organic matter contents; Soils; hydraulic conductivity; land use change; physicochemical property; runoff; spatial planning; urban area; vegetation cover; Bouches du Rhone; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086640586

While evidence-based pharmacological studies utilize a variety of chemical-induced metabolic and toxicological disease models that in part recapitulate the natural mode of disease pathogenesis, the mode of actions of these disease models are likely underexplored. Conventionally, the mechanistic principles of these disease models are established as direct tissue toxicity through redox imbalance and pro-inflammatory injury. However, emerging evidences suggest that the mode of action of these chemicals could be largely associated with changes in gut microbial populations, diversity and metabolic functions, affecting pathological changes along the gut-liver and gut-pancreas axis. Especially in these disease models, reversal of disease severity or less sensitivity to induced disease pathogenesis has been observed when germ-free or antibiotic-supplemented microbiota-depleted rodents were treated with disease causing chemicals. Thus, by summarizing evidences from in vivo pharmacological interventions, this review revisits the mode of action of carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis, diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and alloxan- and streptozotocin-induced diabetes through the light of gut microbiota. How changes in gut microbiome affects tissue-level toxicity likely through intestinal-level mechanisms like gastrointestinal inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction has also been discussed. Additionally, this review discusses potential pitfalls of inconsistent experimental models that precludes defining the gut microbial effects in evidence-based pharmacology. Collectively, this review emphasizes the underexplored role of microbial intervention in experimental pharmacology and aims to provide direction towards redefining and establishing microbiome-centric alternative mode of action of chemical-induced metabolic and toxicological disease models in pharmacological research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cirrhosis; Diabetes; Dysbiosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Microbiome; Pharmacology","alloxan; carbon tetrachloride; diethylnitrosamine; paracetamol; diet; evidence based medicine; human; intestine flora; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver toxicity; microbial community; pathogenesis; Review; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; animal; disease model; intestine; microbiology; pathology; toxic hepatitis; Animals; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Intestines",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088995136

Furthermore, a large area of forest land has been changed to other land-use types like agricultural land is becoming a serious problem in Wondo Genet district. This situation largely contributed to deforestation and forest degradation. Hence, assessing the efficiency of adopting an alternative source of energy was found to be very important. This study was carried out to examine the role of biogas technology in fuelwood saving and carbon emission reduction in Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The multi-stage sampling procedure was followed to select sample households. A total of 152 households (54 adopters and 98 non-adopters) were involved in the household survey. Moreover, 25 test subjects were taken randomly from both adoption categories to conduct Kitchen Performance Test. Descriptive statistics and independent-sample t-test were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the major fuel sources for domestic use were plantation forest, natural forest, crop residue, and animal dung, accounting 46.71 %, 30.92 %, 15.13 %, and 7.24 %, respectively. Among the 54 sampled biogas plants, 32 (59.26 %) were a digester size of 6 m3 whereas the remaining 22 (40.74 %) were of 8 m3. The annual fuelwood saving potential of the technology was found to be 1423.06 kg with an emission reduction potential of 2.1 tons of CO2 e per biogas plant annually. Accordingly, all functional biogas plants were estimated to reduce about 91.63 tons of carbon emission annually.

Efforts to monitor air pollution in different countries are uneven, largely due to the high capital costs of reference air quality monitors (AQMs), especially for airborne particulate matter (PM). In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, few cities operate AQM systems. It is thus important to examine the potential of alternative monitoring approaches. Although PM measurements can be obtained from low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs), data quality can be an issue. This paper develops a new method using raw aerosol size distributions from multiple, surface-based low-cost OPCs to constrain the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) component-specific, column aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which contain some particle-size-resolved information. The combination allows us to derive surface aerosol concentrations for particles as small as ∼ 0.1 µm in diameter, which MISR detects but are below the OPC detection limit of ∼ 0.5 µm. As such, we obtain better constraints on the near-surface particulate matter (PM) concentration, especially as the smaller particles tend to dominate urban pollution. We test our method using data from five low-cost OPCs deployed in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, from 1 May 2016 to 2 March 2017. As MISR passes over Nairobi only once in about 8 d, we use the size-resolved MISR AODs to scale the more frequent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived AODs over our sites. The size distribution derived from MISR and MODIS agrees well with that from the OPCs in the size range where the data overlap (adjusted-R2 ∼ 0.80). We then calculate surface-PM concentration from the combined data. The situation for this first demonstration of the technique had significant limitations. We thus identify factors that will reduce the uncertainty in this approach for future experiments. Within these constraints, the approach has the potential to greatly expand the range of cities that can afford to monitor long-term air quality trends and help inform public policy. © Author(s) 2020.

However, the design and analysis of direct injection–compressed natural gas systems are challenging due to small injector geometries and high-speed gas flows including shocks and discontinuities. The injector design typically involves either a multi-hole configuration with inwardly opening needle or an outwardly opening poppet-type valve with small geometries, which make accessing the near-nozzle-flow field difficult in experiments. Therefore, predictive simulations can be helpful in the design and development processes. Simulations of the gas injection process are, however, computationally very expensive, as gas passages of the order of micrometers combined with a high Mach number compressible gas flow result in very small simulation time steps of the order of nanoseconds, increasing the overall computational wall time. With substantial differences between in-nozzle and in-cylinder length and velocity scales, simultaneous simulation of both regions becomes computationally expensive. Therefore, in this work, a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle-flow model for an outwardly opening poppet-type injector is developed. The model is validated by comparison with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation results for different nozzle pressure ratios. The quasi-one-dimensional nozzle-flow model is dynamically coupled to a three-dimensional flow solver through source terms in the governing equations, named as dynamically coupled source model. The dynamically coupled source model is then applied to a temporal gas jet evolution case and a cold flow engine case. The results show that the dynamically coupled source model can reasonably predict the gas jet behavior in both cases. All simulations using the new model led to reductions of computational wall time by a factor of 5 or higher. © IMechE 2019.","compressed natural gas; Direct injection; internal combustion engines; outwardly opening poppet-type injector; quasi-one-dimensional model","Combustion; Combustion equipment; Compressed natural gas; Compressibility of gases; Flow of gases; Gas emissions; Internal combustion engines; Large eddy simulation; Mach number; Nozzle design; One dimensional; Rocket nozzles; Design and development process; Gas injection process; Indicated thermal efficiency; outwardly opening poppet-type injector; Predictive simulations; Quasi-one dimensional; Quasi-one-dimensional model; Three-dimensional flow; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076861942

An initial assessment of the potential effects of COVID-19 emission reductions was made using a set of six scenarios that variously assumed annual European and global emission reductions of 30% and 50% for the energy, industry, road transport and international shipping sectors, and 80% for the aviation sector. The greatest ozone reductions during the growing season reached up to 12 ppb over crop growing regions in Asia and up to 6 ppb in North America and Europe for the 50% global reduction scenario. In Europe, ozone responses are more sensitive to emission declines in other continents, international shipping and aviation than to emissions changes within Europe. We demonstrate that for wheat the overall magnitude of ozone precursor emission changes could lead to yield improvements between 2% and 8%. The expected magnitude of ozone precursor emission reductions during the Northern Hemisphere growing season in 2020 presents an opportunity to test and improve crop models and experimentally based exposure response relationships of ozone impacts on crops, under real-world conditions.

However, recent work from the Bahamas shows that diagenesis alters the δ238U signatures of bulk carbonates by effectively creating a positive and variable offset from seawater. Therefore, finding a sedimentary archive that reliably records and preserves the δ238U signal from seawater becomes fundamental. Calcitic brachiopod shells may provide such an archive, as their shell structure can endure the effects of diagenesis and, thus, their δ238U signatures can record the U isotope composition of the seawater in which they lived. To explore whether calcitic brachiopods can more robustly record seawater δ238U than bulk carbonates, we analyzed brachiopod shells and their host carbonate matrices from five different stratigraphic levels across the upper Silurian ‘Lau’ Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE). Using the data from brachiopod shells, our results suggest that seawater δ238U values were relatively stable and lower than present day (δ238U = –0.58 ± 0.11‰, 2sd, n = 17), indicative of a more anoxic ocean state across the positive CIE. We also find that carbonate matrices display a distinctive positive δ238U offset from contemporaneous seawater that varies between beds. Some beds show a ca. +0.30‰ offset, similar to what is described in the Bahamas; whereas others display no offset from the inferred seawater U-isotope composition. We propose the variability of the observed δ238U offset to be a function of the degree of U(VI) exchange between anoxic porewaters and seawater. A diminished U(VI) exchange would define a closed-system style of diagenesis and mute the net isotope offset expressed between sediments and contemporaneous seawater. Some of the factors affecting the degree of U(VI) exchange include organic matter fluxes into the sediments and diagenetic fluid flow rates, which could vary due to relative sea-level changes. As a result, the observed δ238U variability of the analyzed carbonate matrix samples could be the result of the environmental changes caused by the sea-level fluctuations described for the studied stratigraphic interval. We conclude that calcitic brachiopod shells provide an important archive for evaluating the δ238U of ancient oceans and the style of diagenesis of U in marine carbonates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brachiopod shells; Carbonate diagenesis; Late Silurian; Ocean anoxia; U isotopes","anoxia; brachiopod; carbonate rock; diagenesis; isotopic composition; marine sediment; sequence stratigraphy; Silurian; uranium isotope; Bahamas; Brachiopoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087005173

Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a widely used approach for predicting potential shifts in species distributions, which can in turn support ecological conservation where environmental change is expected to impact population and community dynamics. Improvements in SDM accuracy through incorporating intra- and interspecific processes have boosted the SDM field forward, but simultaneously urge harmonizing the vast array of SDM approaches into an overarching, widely adoptable, and scientifically justified SDM framework. In this review, we first discuss how climate warming and land-use change interact to govern population dynamics and species’ distributions, depending on species’ dispersal and evolutionary abilities. We particularly emphasize that both land-use and climate change can reduce the accessibility to suitable habitat for many species, rendering the ability of species to colonize new habitat and to exchange genetic variation a crucial yet poorly implemented component of SDM. We then unite existing methodological SDM practices that aim to increase model accuracy through accounting for multiple global change stressors, dispersal, or evolution, while shifting our focus to model feasibility. We finally propose a roadmap harmonizing model accuracy and feasibility, applicable to both common and rare species, particularly those with poor dispersal abilities. This roadmap (a) paves the way for an overarching SDM framework allowing comparison and synthesis of different SDM studies and (b) could advance SDM to a level that allows systematic integration of SDM outcomes into effective conservation plans. © 2020 The Authors.

Rewetting is essential for the restoration of drained peatlands, but the level of success including greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation largely depends on the soil microbiome interactions under the prevailing biogeochemical conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of inundation of drained iron (Fe) -rich peat topsoils on nutrient release, surface water quality, GHG production and consumption, and on the composition and activity of the microbial community. The effect of the addition of different potential electron acceptors on methane (CH4) production and consumption were studied in incubation experiments. In response to inundation, porewater concentrations of Fe, total inorganic carbon, ammonium, and phosphorus increased. CH4 emissions increased in the control (i.e. without any additions) and Fe(III) oxide amended incubations upon inundation. This could be explained by the increase in the relative abundance of methanogens even though Fe(III) was previously hypothesized to lower methanogenic activity. In contrast, nitrite, nitrate, and sulfate-rich incubations inhibited methanogenesis. The prolonged exposure to nitrogen oxides stimulated denitrification with nitrous oxide (N2O) as the main gaseous product, together with an increase in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms. Our results demonstrate that insights into the changes in microbial communities in relation to soil geochemistry explain differences in responses observed in different peat soils observed upon inundation. The increase in emissions of the potent GHGs CH4 and N2O from Fe-rich peat topsoils are a major adverse effect in the early stage of inundation. © 2020 The Authors","Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Methanogenesis; Microbial diversity; Nitrogen; Restoration of drained peatlands","Denitrification; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Peat; Restoration; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Water quality; Wetlands; Biogeochemical conditions; Denitrifying microorganisms; Greenhouse gas production; Methanogenic activity; Microbial community composition; Porewater concentrations; Production and consumption; Total inorganic carbon; Soils; abundance; biogeochemical cycle; denitrification; greenhouse gas; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; peat soil; peatland; relative abundance; soil microorganism; topsoil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089519459

Most Australian forecast valuations have focused on fertiliser decisions to wheat operations, and few assessments have evaluated the benefit of incremental improvements of forecast skill. These gaps have limited our understanding of forecast value to the broader agriculture sector and the benefit of investments to improve forecast skill. To address these gaps, we consistently assessed forecast value for seven Australian case studies (southern grains, northern grains, southern beef, northern beef, lamb, cotton, and sugar). We implemented a three-stage methodology which consisted of engagement with industry practitioners; modelling production under different climatic and environmental conditions; and economic modelling to evaluate forecast value for eleven levels of forecast skill. Our results show that forecast value was often low and highly variable. Value was found to vary based on forecast attributes (forecast skill, resolution and state), industry application and prevailing conditions (environmental and market). This is the first Australian valuation study where the same methodological approach was applied across multiple industries, incremental improvements in skill were valued, and prevailing conditions were explicitly evaluated for impact on value. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","Australia; beef; cattle; cotton; grains; lamb; seasonal forecast; sheep; sugar","agricultural production; cattle; cotton; decision making; fertilizer application; investment; seasonal variation; sheep; Australia; Bos; Gossypium hirsutum; Ovis aries; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088462464

But, anthropogenic practices such as livestock grazing, grazing related excreta nitrogen (N) deposition, and manure/fertilizer N application have the potential to reduce the effectiveness of grassland C sink through increased nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions. Although the effect of anthropogenic activities on net greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in grassland ecosystems have been investigated at local to regional scales, estimates of net GHG balance at the global scale remains uncertain. With the data-model framework integrating empirical estimates of livestock CH4 emissions with process-based modeling estimates of land CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes, we examined the overall global warming potential (GWP) of grassland ecosystems during 1961-2010. We then quantified the grassland-specific and regional variations to identify hotspots of GHG fluxes. Our results show that, over a 100-year time horizon, grassland ecosystems sequestered a cumulative total of 113.9 Pg CO2-eq in plant and soil, but then released 91.9 Pg CO2-eq to the atmosphere, offsetting 81% of the net CO2 sink. We also found large grassland-specific variations in net GHG fluxes, with pasturelands acting as a small GHG source of 1.52 143 Tg CO2-eq yr-1 (mean 1.0 s.d.) and rangelands a strong GHG sink (-442 266 Tg CO2-eq yr-1) during 1961-2010. Regionally, Europe acted as a GHG source of 23 10 Tg CO2-eq yr-1, while other regions (i.e. Africa, Southern Asia) were strong GHG sinks during 2001-2010. Our study highlights the importance of considering regional and grassland-specific differences in GHG fluxes for guiding future management and climate mitigation strategies in global grasslands. © 2020 The Author(s).

The optimal reactor is designed to be a Ni-covered quartz slit with a confined reaction space (length × width × height = 85 × 13 × 0.55 mm3). The slit structure of this reactor offers a spatially confined environment for effectively suppressing Cu evaporation and modulating the growth kinetics of graphene. In addition, the Ni cover serves as a carbon absorbent for regulating the local concentration of carbon species within the slit reactor, which increases the monolayer content of the produced graphene.

Since fuel combustion is responsible for a large fraction of UK emissions it is expected that surface NO2 concentrations would reduce as a result. However*over parts of the UK, surface NO2 concentrations have increased following the implementation of travel restrictions. NO2 measurements from 142 Automatic Urban and Rural Network sites are combined with meteorological data from the Met Office high-resolution weather prediction model to build site specific models. These models predict NO2 concentrations given no change in emissions. It is found that both meteorological and emission changes contribute to the observed changes in NO2 concentrations. Given no change in emissions, changes in meteorology between pre-and post-lockdown periods would have led to a mean increase in NO2 concentrations of +6%. Conversely, changes in emissions would have led to a mean reduction in NO2 concentrations of-18%, resulting in the observed total change in NO2 concentrations of-12%. However at some sites the reduction in emissions is smaller than the increase in NO2 concentrations due to meteorology. The largest increases associated with changes in the meteorology are seen at rural sites (+20%) where NO2 measurements are representative of large areas and thus dominated by the regional advection of secondary NO2 from Europe. Conversely, the largest decreases associated with reduced emissions are found at urban traffic and urban background sites (-27% and-14% respectively) where NO2 concentrations are representative of local areas and thus dominated by local reduction in emissions from vehicles. As lockdown measures are relaxed, NO2 concentrations are likely to return to pre-COVID levels, but these results demonstrate that changes in our behaviour can result in positive impacts on air quality and illustrate the effectiveness of travel-reducing strategies in urban areas. © 2020 The Author(s).

The δ13C of pedogenic carbonate (δ13Cc) has been widely used to document the rise and expansion of C4 plants over the Cenozoic. This application requires a fundamental presumption that in soil pores, soil-respired CO2 dominates over atmospheric CO2 during the formation of pedogenic carbonates. However, the decoupling between δ13Cc and δ13C of soil organic matter (δ13CSOM) have been observed, particularly in arid regions, suggesting that this presumption is not always valid. To evaluate the influence of atmospheric CO2 on soil δ13Cc, here we performed systematic δ13C analyses of paleosols across the Chinese Loess Plateau, with the sample ages spanning three intervals: the Holocene, the Late Pleistocene, and the mid-Pliocene warm period. Our paired δ13Cc and δ13CSOM data reveal broadly divergent trending patterns. Using a two-component CO2-mixing model, we show substantial incorporations of atmospheric CO2 (up to 60%) into soil pore space during carbonate precipitation. This result readily explains the enrichment of δ13Cc and its divergence from δ13CSOM. As a consequence, δ13C of pedogenic carbonates formed under semiarid and/or arid conditions are largely driven by regional aridity through its control on soil CO2 composition, and thus cannot be used to evaluate the relative abundance of C3 versus C4 plants. Nonetheless, these carbonates can be applied for atmospheric CO2 reconstructions, even for periods with low CO2 levels. © 2020 Geological Society of America.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Carbonation; Organic compounds; Arid conditions; Carbonate precipitation; Chinese Loess Plateau; Late Pleistocene; Pedogenic carbonates; Relative abundance; Soil organic matters; Three interval; Soils; aridity; carbon dioxide; carbonate; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleosol; pedogenesis; Pleistocene; Pliocene; reconstruction; soil organic matter; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092131500

The use of integrated renewable-storage energy systems is a more beneficial solution to this problem over individual solutions; however, most design studies only focused on single-type buildings. Thus, this study aims to optimally design an integrated energy system for mixed-use buildings using HOMER Grid. The objective is to minimize the net present costs, subject to capacity limits, energy balances, and operational constraints. Economic metrics were used to evaluate and compare the proposed system to the varying design cases such as business-as-usual, stand-alone renewable source, and stand-alone energy storage. The case study considered a mixed-use building in a tropical area, with a solar photovoltaic system as the renewable energy source and lithium-ion battery as the energy storage system technology. The results show that the integrated system is the most financially attractive design case. It has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.1384 US$ kWh−1, which is significantly less than the 0.2580 US$ kWh−1 baseline. The system also provides electricity cost savings of 294 698 US$ y−1, excess electricity of 35 746 kWh, and carbon emission reduction of 550 tons annually for a mixed-use building with daily average consumption of 4557-kWh and 763-kW peak demand. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","energy storage system; mixed-use buildings; optimization model; renewable energy source; techno-economic analysis","Architectural design; Costs; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Tropics; Carbon emission reductions; Energy storage systems; Integrated energy systems; Integrated systems; Levelized cost of electricities; Operational constraints; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaic system; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083778111

Although UAs have been individually examined for their CO2 emissions, a nation-wide investigation and comparison of the UAs in China is lacking. To reveal the low-carbon development performance of the major UAs in China, we identify the clustering patterns of CO2 emissions of 14 UAs using the spatial autocorrelation analysis on city-level CO2 emissions and investigate the scaling effect among the cities within UAs. Results show that from 2005 to 2015, UAs in eastern and central China were high-high (the center and the surroundings featured high levels of CO2 emission) clustered in total emissions, whereas low-low clustered in per-unit-GDP emission. In western and southern China, UAs like Chengdu-Chongqing showed a high-low clustering pattern in total emissions but a low-low clustering pattern in per-capita emission.

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

A Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) has been employed to mimic real world scenarios associated with fire propagation within railway carriages in order to develop safety guidelines for railway passengers. Comprehensive parametric investigations on the effects of ignition location, intensity and cabin upholstery have been carried out. It has been observed that a fire occurring near the exits of the carriage results in a lower smoke layer height, due to the local carriage geometry, than an identical fire igniting at the center of the carriage. This in turn causes the smoke density along the aisleway to vary by around 30%. Reducing the ignition energy by half has been found to restrict combustion, thus reducing smoke density and carbon exhaust gases, reducing the average temperature from 170 °C to 110 °C. Changing the material lining of the seating has been found to cause the most significant change in output parameters, despite its relative insignificance in bulk mass. A polyester sample produces a peak carbon monoxide concentration of 7500 ppm, which is 27× greater compared with nylon. This difference has been found to be due to the fire spread and propagation between fuels, signifying the polyester’s unsuitability for use in railway carriages. © 2020 by the authors.","Combustion analysis; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Fire dynamics; Smoke distribution; Thermal plume","Carbon monoxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Density of gases; Exhaust gases; Ignition; Polyesters; Railroad car equipment; Railroads; Smoke; Carbon monoxide concentration; Fire dynamics simulator; Numerical investigations; Parametric investigations; Railway passengers; Real-world scenario; Safety guidelines; Smoke layer height; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092341502

Resistance to triclabendazole, one of the principal veterinary medicines used to prevent losses, has been reported and is now considered widespread in fluke endemic regions of the UK. Methods Thirteen farmers participated in a trial in 2013 and the triclabendazole resistance status was obtained for each farm. Based on these results, a knowledge exchange programme on fluke control was delivered to nearly 100 farmers in the region. In this follow-up study, 11 farmers involved in the original trial, participated in semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews in July 2017. Results Overall, participants identified benefits from participating in the 2013 trial, gaining information about triclabendazole resistance on their farms and knowledge about fluke control. The information on their farm's resistance status was a driver for changing their liver fluke control programmes. Factors such as habitual and repetitive behaviours, grazing restrictions due to agri-environmental schemes, economic pressures and climate change were identified that could impede or prevent the adoption of new control strategies. Conclusions The study highlights the significance of resistance to triclabendazole and the impact of knowledge exchange programmes in changing liver fluke control practices. © 2020 British Veterinary Association 2020.

They constitute an important aspect of the current Common Agricultural Policy. Increasing or maintaining soil organic carbon (SOC) content under arable farming has been acknowledged as a primary target of European agriculture. SOC-preserving agriculture needs its techniques to be tailored to local conditions, namely, the combination of factors related to the environment (climate and soil characteristics), to the farming system (land use type, farm specialization, crop management), but also to the social and cultural context (market and availability of production means, subsidies, farmers’ education, propensity for innovation and change). In this paper we present inspirational ideas and show success examples of local adaptations strategies to increase or maintain SOC content in soils under arable farming in Europe. They include: · Adoption of soil management strategies to improve SOC storage in irrigated systems. · Precision farming and other high-tech solutions able to generate local diagnosis and adaptive strategies for increasing SOC and reducing greenhouse gasses emissions. · Innovative strategies for extending soil cover periods and introducing cover crops in rotations in areas with limited water availability or prone to harsh weather conditions. · Management of rainfed and low input crops to maintain and increase SOC in dry climates and erosive prone soils. These case studies could facilitate the setting up of OGs and the application of innovative practices in different European countries. © 2020","Conservation agriculture; Cover crops; SOC; Soil fertility; Sustainable land management","adaptive management; arable farming; cover crop; European Union; innovation; organic carbon; soil cover; soil management; soil organic matter; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089597436

The Kingdom of Bahrain has witnessed burgeoning municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rate due to socio-economic development. The authorities of this Small Island Developing State, which is located in arid environment, plan to produce 5% of the total electricity demand from renewable energy sources by 2025 and then double it to 10% by 2035.

Results envisaged that maximum landfill gas (LFG) emission rates will be in 2020 following landfill closure by the end of 2019, as an intentional scenario, with a maximum electricity generation potential of 57.4 GWh that could provide power to 488 households. Revenues from carbon credits and electricity sales were US$97.8 million and US$64.8 million, respectively, for the period 2020–2035.

However, little is known about how microbial communities and their underlying metabolic processes will be affected by these environmental changes in freshwater sedimentary systems. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed sediments from Lake Hazen, NU Canada. Here, we exploit the spatial heterogeneity created by varying runoff regimes across the watershed of this uniquely large high-latitude lake to test how a transition from low to high runoff, used as one proxy for climate change, affects the community structure and functional potential of dominant microbes. Based on metagenomic analyses of lake sediments along these spatial gradients, we show that increasing runoff leads to a decrease in taxonomic and functional diversity of sediment microbes. Our findings are likely to apply to other, smaller, glacierized watersheds typical of polar or high latitude ecosystems; we can predict that such changes will have far reaching consequences on these ecosystems by affecting nutrient biogeochemical cycling, the direction and magnitude of which are yet to be determined. © Copyright © 2020 Colby, Ruuskanen, St.Pierre, St.Louis, Poulain and Aris-Brosou.","climate change; high arctic; high-throughput sequencing; metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs); microbial ecology","Arctic; article; biogeochemical cycling; Canada; climate change; community structure; ecology; ecosystem; high throughput sequencing; lake sediment; latitude; metagenome; metagenomics; microorganism; nonhuman; nutrient; runoff; warming; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093832587

Manufacturing companies are particularly targeted, for example, to reduce CO2 emissions, offer sustainable products, etc. Research in this field has significantly increased in recent years. Most research states the importance of collaboration with upstream and downstream entities as a critical success factor when aiming for a sustainable supply chain and proposes various collaborative mechanisms (CMs) to enable firms in the implementation of a sustainability-oriented initiative. The goal of this paper is to investigate the role of collaboration in these initiatives and explore the proposed CMs via a systematic literature review method. A total of 404 articles were reviewed and the multitude of CMs proposed in the literature were classified into seven categories: relationship management, contractual and economic practices, joint practices, technological and information sharing practices, governance practices, assessment practices, and supply chain design. This systematic mapping of the field provides an in-depth view of the current state of research as well as research gaps. It also intends to help practitioners by highlighting the role played by these mechanisms in four phases of sustainable supply chain deployment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaborative mechanisms; implementation of sustainability; inter-firm collaboration; sustainability-oriented innovation; sustainable supply chains; systematic literature review","Supply chains; Sustainable development; Critical success factor; Information sharing practices; Inter-firm collaboration; Manufacturing companies; Relationship management; Research opportunities; Sustainable supply chains; Systematic literature review; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071992936

Not only policymakers are involved in this aim and experts of interdisciplinary aspects but also the irreplaceable involvement of citizens which with their behavior can make the difference and get much closer to the seventeen goals of the sustainable development by 2030. In this framework, the Territorial Energetic and Environmental Planning provides operational solidity to the concept of Sustainable Development, giving more responsibility to local administrations (as it is due according to subsidiarity), with the Central Government that guarantees the respect of the principles of Subsidiarity and Glocalization. Province of L'Aquila (in the Abruzzo Region, Italy) has been a leading player of this program and, in 2012, has realized the ambitious goal of having favored a Covenant, joining all the 108 Municipalities of the Province. Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics (DIIIE) of the University of L'Aquila designed the Sustainable Energy Action Plants (SEAP) and the monitoring phase of all the Municipalities through a scientific methodology which matched the goal of SEAPs with the dimension of the Municipality. In order to go deep into SEAP's analysis, in this paper Authors describes the second uploading and necessary steps: a quantitative analysis of the Baseline Emission Inventory, the quantification of the SEAPs planning actions and the definition of the Monitoring Emission Inventory. This second step was done for the Municipality of Avezzano, one of the main Municipality of the L'Aquila Province, and gave the quantitative dimension of the CO2 emissions referred to the year 2017, compared with 2005 baseline emissions.

The climate-induced risk assessment of coastal areas subject to flooding plays an essential role in planning effective measures for adaptation plans. However, in European legislation, as well as in the regional plans adopted by the member states, there is no clear reference to urban settlement, as this concept is variable and difficult to categorise from the policy perspective. This lack of knowledge makes it complicated to implement efficient adaptation plans. This research examines the presence of the issue in Portugal’s coastal settlements, the European coastal area most vulnerable to rising sea levels, using the case of seashore streets as the most exposed waterfront public urban areas. Using the morphometric classification of the urban fabric, we analyse the relationship between urban typology and legislative macro-areas aimed at providing integrated adaptation plans. The study suggests that there is only a minimal relationship between the proposed classification and the geographical zones currently identified in coastal planning policies.

The present paper illustrates the results of the first set of measurements carried out in the BiomethER project (EULIFE). BiomethER aimed to design and build two innovative bio-methane production plants, located in Emilia Romagna region (Italy), fed by different feedstock: the first one with sewage sludge and the other with landfill waste. Biogas extracted by the anaerobic digester was cleaned and upgraded to biomethane for road vehicles application. To verify the compatibility of biomethane in conventional compressed natural gas engine (CNG) vehicles, three passenger cars have been tested with two gases: conventional natural gas and bio-methane coming by BiomethER sewage sludge plant. Test concerned dynamic performances and exhaust emissions and was operated on the chassis dynamometer facility, in ENEA Casaccia Research Centre. Preliminary results showed no appreciable deviation was noticeable for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions between the two fuels, acceleration and maximum power were almost the same for the three vehicles tested. The WTW evaluation of GHG emissions for the biomethane resulted in up to 79% lower in comparison with natural gas provided by the Italian pipeline. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Dynamometers; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Road vehicles; Sewage sludge; Vehicle performance; Anaerobic digester; Chassis dynamometers; Design and build; Dynamic performance; Methane production plant; Passenger vehicles; Performance and emissions; Research centres; Compressed natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097130565

In this paper, a generalization and some systematization of gas manifestations recorded in the Russian Arctic is carried out. The published data on most typical gas emission cases have been summarized in a table and illustrated by a map. The tabulated data include location, signatures, and possible sources of each gas show, with respective references. All events of onshore and shelf gas release are divided into natural and man-caused. and the natural ones are further classified as venting from lakes or explosive emissions in dryland conditions that produce craters on the surface. Among natural gas shows on land, special attention is paid to the emission of natural gas from Arctic lakes, as well as gas emissions with craters formation. In addition, a description of the observed man-caused gas manifestations associated with the drilling of geotechnical and production wells in the Arctic region is given. The reported evidence demonstrates the effect of permafrost degradation on gas release, especially in oil and gas fields. © 2020 by the authors.

For the correlation analysis, the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and nighttime LST and maximum, minimum, and mean SAT were measured at 79 weather stations of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2008 to 2018. As a result of the correlation analysis between SAT and LST, the maximum SAT (TMX) had a good correlation with the daytime LST of Terra MODIS, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.8◦ C, and the minimum SAT (TMN) showed a good correlation with the nighttime LST of Terra MODIS, with an R of 0.93 and RMSE of 4.2◦ C. When analyzing temperature characteristics by land use (urban, paddy, upland crop, forest, grass, wetland, bare field, and water), it was confirmed that the climate mitigation effect of the wetland and vegetation area appeared in the LSTs and the observed SAT. In the cold wave period, the average temperatures for urban and wetland areas was the highest, and the average temperature for wetland and forest was not higher than that of other land use classes. As the SAT results predicted through the LSTM model, the accuracy of the TMN during the cold wave period was 0.59 for the coefficient of determination (R2), 3.1◦ C for RMSE, and 0.76 for the index of agreement (IoA), while the accuracy of the TMX for the heat wave period was 0.24 for R2, 2.23◦ C for RMSE, and 0.63 for IoA. © 2020 by the authors.

In fact, research has outlined that urban areas depend on global supply chains for their day-to-day basic functions, including energy supplies, food and safe access to potable water. The disruption of global supply chains can leave many urban areas in a very vulnerable position, in which their citizens may struggle to obtain their basic supplies, as the COVID-19 crisis has recently shown. Therefore, solutions aiming to enhance local food, water and energy production systems, even in urban environments, have to be pursued. The COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted in the scientific community the problem of people’s exposure to outdoor and indoor pollution, confirmed as a key element for the increase both in the transmission and severity of the contagion, on top of involving health risks on their own. In this context, most nations are going to adopt new preferential policies to stimulate the development of relevant sustainable energy industries, based on the electrification of the systems supplied by renewable energy sources as confirmed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Thus, while there is ongoing research focusing on a COVID 19 vaccine, there is also a need for researchers to work cooperatively on novel strategies for world economic recovery incorporating renewable energy policy, technology and management. In this framework, the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) conference provides a good platform for researchers and other experts to exchange their academic thoughts, promoting the development and improvements on the renewable energy technologies as well as their role in systems and in the transition towards sustainable energy systems. The 14th SDEWES Conference was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It brought together around 570 researchers from 55 countries in the field of sustainable development. The present Special Issue of Energies, specifically dedicated to the 14th SDEWES Conference, focuses on four main fields: energy policy for sustainable development, biomass energy application, building energy saving, and power plant and electric systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Correlations between PM2.5 and key gaseous pollutants were studied to identify linked trends as a means of understanding the impacts of air pollution control in China. In most cities, the PM2.5-NO2 correlation coefficients were higher than the PM2.5-SO2 correlation coefficients, and the gap tended to expand as air quality improved. Multiple linear regression also indicated that PM2.5 concentrations were more sensitive to changes in NO2 than in SO2. The rate of decrease in the PM2.5 concentration with a decreasing NO2 concentration is nearly 3 times higher than that with SO2. These results support the priority of controlling NOx to further reduce PM2.5 pollution in China. The chemistry behind this was twofold: (1) NOx can be converted into nitrate, and (2) NOx contributes to atmospheric oxidation capacity. The decrease in PM2.5 concentration always coincided with an increase in O3 concentration when the PM2.5 concentration was higher than 50 μg m-3. However, the correlation between PM2.5 and O3 tended to change from negative to positive as air quality improved, indicating O3 and PM2.5 control could both benefit from reducing the concentrations of gas precursors.

A few species of plants have the capability to grow in such a climate. However, those plants are not suitable as a food source. The aim of this work is to design and construct an indoor automatic vertical hydroponic system that does not depend on the outside climate. The designed system is capable to grow common type of crops that can be used as a food source inside homes without the need of large space. The design of the system was made after studying different types of vertical hydroponic systems in terms of price, power consumption and suitability to be built as an indoor automated system. A microcontroller was working as a brain of the system, which communicates with different types of sensors to control all the system parameters and to minimize the human intervention. An open internet of things (IoT) platform was used to store and display the system parameters and graphical interface for remote access. The designed system is capable of maintaining healthy growing parameters for the plants with minimal input from the user. The functionality of the overall system was confirmed by evaluating the response from individual system components and monitoring them in the IoT platform. The system was consuming 120.59 and 230.59 kWh respectively without and with air conditioning control during peak summer, which is equivalent to the system running cost of 13.26 and 25.36 Qatari Riyal (QAR) respectively. This system was circulating around 104 k gallons of nutrient solution monthly however, only 8–10 L water was consumed by the system. This system offers real-time notifications to alert the hydroponic system user when the conditions are not favorable. So, the user can monitor several parameters without using laboratory instruments, which will allow to control the entire system remotely. Moreover, the system also provides a wide range of information, which could be essential for plant researchers and provides a greater understanding of how the key parameters of hydroponic system correlate with plant growth. The proposed platform can be used both for quantitatively optimizing the setup of the indoor farming and for automating some of the most labor-intensive maintenance activities. Moreover, such a monitoring system can also potentially be used for high-level decision making, once enough data will be collected. This work presents significant opportunities for the people who live in the gulf region to produce food as per their requirements. © 2020 by the authors.

The National Chi Nan University (NCNU), located in Puli, Nantou County in central Taiwan, suffered a significant landslide because it is in the worst-hit location and with the worst geological structure. During the earthquake, a massive amount of soil collapsed from a slope that measures 250 m in width and 80 m in height, blocking the entrance to NCNU completely. A failure investigation and dynamic simulation of the reinforced slope/wall were conducted by the finite element software PLAXIS with the time history of acceleration recorded near the site during the Chi-Chi earthquake. The seismic source is assigned on the lower boundary of the finite element mesh. The Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model is used for geological materials. The results indicate that the soil mass and reinforced slope/wall above the weak boundary moves at a greater scale compared to that below the dip plane. The principal directions of displacement of the mesh above and below the dip plane are different, which also indicates that the simulated failure plane occurs along the dip plane. For renovation work, instead of using the traditional concrete structures, the designer, in consideration of environmental sustainability, adopted some green measures. The measures included roadway alignment adjustment, soil nails, a vegetated reinforced soil slope/wall with wraparound facing, and geoweb with vegetation. Completed in 2002, this project withstood several major typhoons and earthquakes in the past 17 years. It has been proved successful in terms of sustainability factors, such as safety, durability, reliability, ecology, landscape, reduction of waste, and carbon emission. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Chi Nan University slope failure; Chi-Chi earthquake; Dynamic simulation; Failure investigation; Finite element method (FEM); MSE wall/slope; Slope renovation; Sustainability","Computer software; Failure (mechanical); Geology; Mesh generation; Motor transportation; Reinforcement; Soils; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Failure investigation; Finite element meshes; Finite element software; Geological materials; Geological structures; Principal directions; Reinforced soil slopes; Earthquakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090325811

Conservation areas managed for wildlife refuges can be considered a network, permitting the tracking of current climate conditions within the network under projected future climates. Objectives: We ask how many classes of temporal climate dynamics exist within a set of 48 refuges that comprise a network of conservation areas. Methods: We identified the current-climate conditions of 48 US National Wildlife Refuges using their annual average of minimum temperature and annual precipitation. We then mapped the movement of analogous climates for each refuge from current to future-time periods under four climate projections. We identified distinct types of analog climate dynamics among the network of wildlife refuges that can inform climate-adaptive natural resource planning. Results: We identified five analogous climate categories: (1) disappearing climates; (2) single-analogous climates; (3) multiple-analogous climates; (4) enduring climates; and (5) climate hubs, with some refuges occupying up to three classes. Using four climate projections, we found 10–25 refuges are climatically disappeared; 8–16 whose climate conditions appear in only one other unit; three whose current climate appears in many other refuges; three that are climatically stable; and four that are climate hubs. Conclusions: The relative geographic isolation of refuges makes them particularly appropriate for use as nodes in a network-based climate assessment. The climate classification of the nodes can help inform selection from among multiple refuge management strategies based on their relative analogous climate dynamics. For example, new refuges could be identified to account for species inhabiting climatically disappearing refuges. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Analogous climates; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Network analysis; US National Wildlife Refuge System; Wetlands","climate change; climate classification; climate conditions; natural resource; precipitation (climatology); refuge; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; wild population; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089363885

The intrinsic nonlinearity of thermo-optical conversion described by blackbody radiation laws generates intermodulation harmonics, among which the sum and difference frequencies are easily measured by lock-in amplifiers connected in series or in parallel. Double modulation heterodyne PTR avoids superposition with harmonics generated in nonlinear homodyne PTR by laser modulation distortion. Useful expressions are derived for the determination of temperature variations of the target relative to its absolute temperature, independently of emissivity. In order to determine one or the other temperature, calibration of one of them is necessary. The effects of spectral and temperature dependence of emissivity are also discussed. Local self-heating of a glassy carbon target could be estimated using two superposed laser sources modulated at 30 Hz and 40 Hz. This application opens the path to perform temperature-dependent thermophysical properties' investigations in a non-contact manner, with a simple setup. Absolute temperature was determined on the surface of a Peltier element modulated at 0.1 Hz, at the location irradiated by a laser beam modulated at 1 Hz.

To enable practical quantum photonic devices, the emission rates of solid-state quantum emitters need to be substantially enhanced and the emitted signal must be directly coupled to an on-chip circuitry. The photon emission rate speed-up is best achieved via coupling to plasmonic antennas, while on-chip integration can be realized by directly coupling emitters to photonic waveguides. The realization of practical devices requires that both the emission speed-up and efficient out-coupling are achieved in a single architecture. Here, a novel architecture is proposed that combines chip compatibility with high radiative emission rates—a quantum plasmonic launcher. The proposed launchers contain single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds as quantum emitters that offer record-high average fluorescence lifetime shortening factors of about 7000 times. Nanodiamonds with single NVs are sandwiched between two silver films that couple more than half of the emission into in-plane propagating surface plasmon polaritons. This simple, compact, and scalable architecture represents a crucial step toward the practical realization of high-speed on-chip quantum networks. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","in-plane emission; nitrogen-vacancy centers; plasmonic launchers; quantum plasmonics; single-photon sources","Electromagnetic wave polarization; Launching; Nanodiamonds; Network architecture; Particle beams; Particulate emissions; Photonic devices; Photons; Quantum optics; Fluorescence lifetimes; Photon emission rate; Photonic waveguides; Propagating surface plasmons; Quantum-information processing; Radiative emissions; Scalable architectures; Single-photon source; Surface plasmons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088813404

From the perspectives of carbon intensity and carbon inequality, this study develops an improved carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions-reduction index to quantify emissions-reduction pressure on 284 cities in China. Results indicate that driven by the decrease of overall carbon intensity and the rise of inter-city carbon inequality, emissions-reduction pressure on 41.38% of provinces and 49.65% of cities was greater than the overall national level; emissions-reduction pressure on 52.35% of cities exceeded the provincial average level. The central government determines national emissions-reduction pressure by adjusting carbon-inequality tolerance between cities and determines carbon-inequality preference based on population and economic output principles. These determinations become benchmarks for local governments’ CO2 emissions-reduction pressure. Provinces and cities that exceed benchmarks become foci for promoting energy savings, emissions reduction, and low-carbon development in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon inequality; Carbon intensity; Chinese city; Emissions-reduction pressure; Policy preference","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; equity; state role; Article; benchmarking; carbon footprint; China; city; economic development; energy conservation; environmental policy; pressure; China; city; government; socioeconomics; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development; Local Government; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087886530

However, there is a limited understanding of different urbanization factors’ roles in PM2.5 pollution. Using satellite-derived PM2.5 data from 2002 to 2017, we investigated the spatiotemporal evolution and the spatial autocorrelation of PM2.5 pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Afterwards, the impacts of three urbanization factors (population urbanization, land urbanization and economic urbanization) on PM2.5 pollution were estimated by a spatial Durbin panel data model (SDM). Obtained results showed that: (i) PM2.5 pollution was larger in the north than in the south of YRD; (ii) Lianyungang and Yancheng cities had significant increasing trends in PM2.5 pollution from 2002 to 2017; (iii) the regional median center of PM2.5 pollution was observed in the Nanjing city, with gradual shifting to the northwest during the 16-year period; (iv) PM2.5 pollution showed significant and positive spatial autocorrelation and spillover effect; (v) population urbanization contributed more to the increase in PM2.5 pollution than land urbanization, while economic urbanization had no significant impact.

The positions of variable geometry turbocharger vanes and exhaust gas recirculation valve are predominantly regulated by dual-loop proportional–integral–derivative controllers to achieve predefined set-points of intake air pressure and exhaust gas recirculation mass flow. The set-points are determined by extensive mapping of the intake air pressure and exhaust gas recirculation mass flow against various engine speeds and loads concerning engine performance and emissions. However, due to the inherent nonlinearities of diesel engines and the strong interferences between variable geometry turbocharger and exhaust gas recirculation, an extensive map of gains for the P, I, and D terms of the proportional–integral–derivative controllers is required to achieve desired control performance. The present simulation study proposes a novel fuzzy logic control scheme to determine appropriate positions of variable geometry turbocharger vanes and exhaust gas recirculation valve in real-time. Once determined, the actual positions of the vanes and valve are regulated by two local proportional–integral–derivative controllers. The fuzzy logic control rules are derived based on an understanding of the interactions among the variable geometry turbocharger, exhaust gas recirculation, and diesel engine. The results obtained from an experimentally validated one-dimensional transient diesel engine model showed that the proposed fuzzy logic control scheme is capable of efficiently optimizing variable geometry turbocharger and exhaust gas recirculation positions under transient engine operating conditions in real-time. Compared to the baseline proportional–integral–derivative controllers approach, both engine’s efficiency and total turbo efficiency have been improved by the proposed fuzzy logic control scheme while NOx and soot emissions have been significantly reduced by 34% and 82%, respectively. © IMechE 2018.","diesel engine; Exhaust gas recirculation; fuzzy logic control; variable geometry turbocharger","Air intakes; Atmospheric pressure; Computer circuits; Control nonlinearities; Controllers; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Gas emissions; Geometry; Intake valves; Mass transfer; Turbomachinery; Control performance; Derivative controllers; Engine operating conditions; Exhaust gas recirculation valves; Fuzzy logic control; Performance and emissions; Strong interference; Variable geometry turbocharger; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060130251

The majority of the local dwellers rely on traditional solid fuels for cooking and heating, which can emit large amounts of particles into both indoor and outdoor environments. In this study, we measured the real-time household concentrations of PM2.5 and explored the association between personal daily PM2.5 exposure and blood pressure (BP). Cooking and heating activities with different energies made a great variation in the household PM2.5 air pollution, and residents using biomass had the highest personal PM2.5 exposure. Temperature and relative humidity are both significantly linear correlated with household PM2.5 air pollution. Besides, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was demonstrated to be positively associated with personal PM2.5 exposure: with each 10-μg/m3 incremental PM2.5 concentration when controlling all the other factors, SBP will increase by 0.36 mmHg (95% confident interval (CI) 0.05–0.0.77 mmHg). If solid fuels could be replaced with clean energies, personal PM2.5 exposure and SBP would reduce by more than 21% and 3.7%, respectively, calling for efficient intervention programs to mitigate household air pollution of cave dwellings and protect health of those residents. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Blood pressure; Cave dwellings; Energy type; Indoor and outdoor air; PM2.5 exposure; Rural areas","blood; cave; concentration (composition); heating; particulate matter; public health; rural area; China; Loess Plateau; air pollutant; air pollution; blood pressure; China; cooking; environmental monitoring; heating; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; rural population; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Blood Pressure; China; Cooking; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Humans; Particulate Matter; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086712558

Based on the clustering-triggered emission mechanism, through-space conjugation and conformational rigidification of nonaromatic chromophores are crucial to photoluminescence, which are also dependent on molecular arrangement. Herein, polyamide-6 (PA-6) with well-defined molecular arrangements was thus studied. The luminescence from the PA-6 solution is enhanced upon aggregation from solution to amorphous solid and further boosted with the formation of highly regular molecular arrangement. More importantly, both blue and green fluorescence from PA-6/formic acid (FA) solutions were observed because of the variable clusters formed among PA-6 and FA. To make clear of this, PA-6 cast film (PCF) and PA-6 electrospun film (PEF) were prepared and belonged to α- (antiparallel molecular arrangement) and γ(parallel molecular arrangement)-form crystals, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, and Raman measurements. The relationship between molecular arrangement and luminescence of PA-6 molecules was clarified by their photophysical properties in solids and solutions. Notably, color-tunable cryogenic phosphorescence of PA-6 solids was also detected. Such aggregation-enhanced emission and tunable phosphorescence of PA-6 solids are ascribed to the formation of diversified amide clusters together with remarkably rigidified molecular conformations owing to the highly regular molecular arrangement in the aggregated states. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Amides; Amorphous materials; Chromophores; Conformations; Cryptography; Gamma rays; Phosphorescence; Anti-counterfeiting; Conformational rigidification; Fourier transform infra reds; Green fluorescence; Molecular arrangements; Molecular conformation; Photophysical properties; Raman measurements; Solid solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092749775

We used amino sugars (ASs) and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as microbial biomarkers to assist in identifying the effect of practices of agricultural management on the microbial community. We determined the contents and compositions of ASs and PLFAs in the soils of five long-term (12 years) practices of land management: bare land (BL), grassland (GL), and land with continuous wheat (WC), soybean (SC), and maize (MC) cropping systems. BL and GL were not fertilized, but WC, SC, and MC were supplied with either mineral fertilizer (WCF, SCF, and MCF, respectively) or no fertilizer as controls (WC, SC, and MC, respectively). The contents of ASs and PLFAs in WC, SC, and MC were somewhere in the middle of those between GL and BL. Soils amended with maize material accumulated more ASs than soils amended with soybean or wheat material. The AS contents were 7.2 and 10.3% lower in WCF and SCF than WC and SC, respectively, but were 6.4% higher in MCF than MC. The contribution of fungi to the pools of soil organic carbon were significantly lower when mineral fertilizer was added, indicated by structural equation modeling under a continuous supply of N. The new carbon accumulated by microbes was positively contributed more by residues derived bacteria than from fungi. These results indicated that long-term practices of land management significantly altered the soil microbial communities and their contribution to SOC accumulation. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Amino sugar; Land management; Microbial community; Mineral fertilization; Phospholipid fatty acid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089431305

After a careful mechanistic study, the reduction was probably accomplished with the large numbers of electrons contained in r-CDs rather than the oxidation of its functional groups. Additionally, a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that the r-CDs were nontoxic to wildlife and human beings. Consequently, the r-CDs were used as an alternative to toxic reductants (SnCl2 or NaBH4) for the sensitive and in situ determination of mercury by cold vapor generation (CVG) coupled to a miniature point discharge optical emission spectrometer (μPD-OES). Limit of detection of 0.05 μg/L was obtained for Hg2+, with relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 5.4% at a concentration of 5 μg/L. The accuracy of r-CDs induced CVG-μPD-OES was validated by the determination of mercury in a certified reference material (DOLT-5, dogfish liver) and five natural water samples collected from different rivers and lakes in Chengdu City. Since r-CDs are nontoxic and prepared from abundant and inexpensive sucrose, the r-CDs induced CVG-μPD-OES retains the great potential for the inexpensive and environmentally friendly field analysis of mercury in natural water. The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by the analysis of a certified reference material and several water samples with satisfactory results. © 2020 The Author","Carbon dots; Cold vapor generation; Mercury analysis; Reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088029669

Based on these new dating results as well as their cultural attributes, these sites could be confidently divided into four chronological phases (Phase 1: Late Yangshao and Majiayao culture; Phase 2: Qijia culture; Phases 3 and 4: Siwa culture) but a significant gap was identified at ca. 3600-3000 cal yr BP in this region. Comparison of this interval to high-resolution paleoclimate records from Tianchi Lake suggests it could be attributed to the dramatic drop in temperature at this time. Accordingly, archaeobotanical evidence with a refined chronology shows the adoption of cold-tolerant subsistence cereal grains such as barley on the NETP (Northeast Tibetan Plateau). Drawing from various lines of knowledge (chronology, palaeoclimate, archaeobotany, and archaeology), it is reasonable to conclude that, even when confronting a similar magnitude of climate change, local human societies could vary tremendously.

However, many developing countries still lack the public awareness of the concepts of UGIs and their ES, including the benefit & monetary value of the UGIs’ services, the willingness to pay (WTP) for the UGIs’ services. The relationship between the benefits & monetary value of and the WTP for the services of UGIs has not been extensively investigated. These two aspects were respectively defined as ES supply and as ES demand in the current study, in which their relationship was scientifically described. Meanwhile, the influential factors of the deviation between ES supply and ES demand were explored. Adopting Guangzhou City (China) as a case, the main ES supply of UGIs in three public green spaces including air pollutant removal, daytime temperature reduction, rainwater runoff regulation, and noise abatement was first assessed with field measurements. Further, the main ES demand including people's preferences, satisfaction, and WTP for the UGIs’ ES was analyzed with survey and statistical analysis. In total, 405 valid questionnaires were distributed to collect the data of ES demand and were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and a binary logistic regression model. The monetary valuation was used to unify the benefit valuation standards provided by different ESs, so as to more intuitively reflect the contribution of different ESs and compare these with ESs demand which uses WTP as one of the indicators. The results showed significant differences between ES supply and ES demand. The major evidence was that the regulation services could supply most of the ES benefits, while the cultural services were the most demanded by respondents. People had diverse sensitivity to the different types of ES provided by the UGIs. Cultural services were the most easily perceived by the respondents and considered as the top one, followed by regulation services. In addition, the outcome of the survey revealed different criteria regarding ES demand by people, and varying influencing factors for people's satisfaction and WTP.

In the context of global population growth, environmental degradation, and resource shortages, the interrelationship between the water, energy, and food has become increasingly important. In this paper, the city of Ordos in China was selected as a study area. Firstly, this paper sorted out relevant research literature and fully understood the concept of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Then, an optimization model of WEF system was constructed based on interval number multi-objective programming, which took the comprehensive coordination deviation degree of the WEF system security and carbon dioxide emission minimization as the target. At the same time, the optimization model was constructed with full consideration of constraints such as economic benefit, water resource consumption, energy production, food production and environmental pollution emission. The results showed that the production of coal, thermal power, hydropower, wind power, and food all show an upward trend. Among them, the production of hydropower has the largest change, and the food production has the smallest change. In terms of water resource utilization, food production has the largest allocation of water resources accounting for nearly 80%, followed by coal production, thermal power generation and hydropower generation. The smallest allocation is natural gas. In particular, the allocation of water for coal production and hydroelectric power generation has increased significantly. Finally, the policy recommendations were put forward to promote the sustainable development of WEF system in Ordos. The optimization research on the WEF system can help to ensure the WEF system security in Ordos and promote the sustainable development of WEF system, which also can provide reference for other regions. © 2020 by the authors.","Interval number multi-objective programming; Optimization research; Ordos; Water-energy-food system","carbon dioxide; coal; natural gas; water; computer simulation; environmental degradation; hydroelectric power; linear programing; literature review; numerical model; optimization; population growth; power generation; research work; sustainable development; Article; China; city; controlled study; economics; energy; energy yield; food; food industry; geothermal energy; hydropower; policy; pollution; sustainable development; trend study; water resource consumption; water resource utilization; wind power; catering service; water supply; China; Ordos; China; Cities; Food Supply; Water; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092923385

Evaluating the viability of near-miscible flooding requires experimental exploration of a specific region in pressure–temperature space. The near-miscible pressure field is bounded on one side in P, T space by the MMP (minimum miscible pressure). This paper provides robust empirical correlations to estimate the MMP for both pure and impure CO2 and for prediction of the near-miscible pressure region for CO2-oil. Many slim tube analyses, lacking high density data points, systematically underestimate the MMP, when the near miscible region is not accounted for. They are based on 147 published data sets that include: slim tube experimental determination of MMP; interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and CO2; concentration of solution gas; and purity of the CO2. This paper is the first to begin a systematic exploration of the pressure-temperature space within which near-miscible effects characterize CO2 floods. Our new correlations provide a basis for identifying and investigating the nature of near miscible effects associated with existing CO2 floods. For a case study of an offshore field we determined that lower and upper pressure boundaries for effective near-miscible flooding, are 0.87 MMP and 1.07 MMP at reservoir temperatures. The proposed model is the first empirical correlation for the prediction of near-miscible pressure region, it will provide the basis for both screening the relative potential of oil reservoirs for economically viable miscible or near-miscible CO2-flooding. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Floods; Forecasting; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Concentration of solutions; Economically viable; Empirical correlations; Experimental determination; Miscible flooding; Pressure boundary; Reservoir temperatures; Systematic exploration; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085949846

Over the past decade, people have made tremendous efforts to discover the microorganisms responsible for N2O production, elucidate metabolic pathways, establish production models and formulate mitigation strategies. The ultimate goal of all these efforts is to shed new light on how N2O is produced and how to reduce it, and one of the best ways is to find key opportunities by integrating the information obtained. This review article critically evaluates the knowledge gained in the field within a decade, especially in N2O production microbiology, biochemistry, models and mitigation strategies, with a focus on denitrification. Previous research has greatly deepened the understanding of the N2O generation mechanism, but further efforts are still needed due to the lack of standardized methodology for establishing N2O mitigation strategies in full-scale systems. One of the challenges seems to be to convert the denitrification process from a net N2O source into an effective sink, which is recommended as a key opportunity to reduce N2O production in this review. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Mitigation strategies; Nitrous oxide; Wastewater treatment","Denitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Sewage treatment plants; Denitrification process; Full-scale system; Generation mechanism; Metabolic pathways; Mitigation strategy; Nitrous oxide production; Production models; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide; denitrification; metabolism; nitrous oxide; wastewater treatment plant; biofilm; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; mathematical model; microbial community; nitrification; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; process optimization; Review; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; bioreactor; human; waste water; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Humans; Nitrous Oxide; Waste Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087915482

The corresponding taxi exhaust reduction issue is also with rather significance for traffic emission mitigation in urban areas. By taking Shanghai as an empirical case, this paper analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of multimode travelers by combining the taxi FCD (from Qiangsheng Inc.), the metro smartcard data and the GPS trajectories of Mobike, one of the most popular shared bicycles in China, 2018). Binomial logit models (BNL) were proposed to estimate mode choices for both peak and off-peak periods by incorporating socio-economic, demographic, urban morphology, land use properties, and various trip-related variables. The choices between metro and taxi, Mobike and taxi were analyzed, respectively, with the corresponding influential factors identified. The results indicated that the percentage of residential and commercial land uses, the number of educational facilities have significant impacts on travel mode choice during peak hours, while the percentage of commercial land, the number of hospitals and bus lines are more prominent during off-peak periods. To quantify the emission reduction benefits, localized calculation of automobile exhaust was established according to the Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) based measurements obtained from the Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) experiments. Then, five corresponding emission mitigation schemes were proposed based on the model findings, and the cost-benefit of each countermeasure was further analyzed. Comparing with releasing the peak-hour crowdedness of metro stations, increasing Mobike supply, updating taxis into electric vehicles, and equipping taxis with catalytic converters, the scheme of removing non-motor vehicle restrictions was found with the shortest payback period and was consequently recommended as accordance with the proposal of urban eco and non-motorized transportation. Findings of this study is useful for transportation management in improving the mode share of metro and bicycles, thus to alleviate the congestion and auto emissions in urban areas. © 2020","Cost-benefit analysis; Exhaust emission model; Logit regression model; Removing the non-motor vehicle restrictions (on road); Travel mode selection; Urban travel big data","cost-benefit analysis; data set; emission control; exhaust emission; transportation economics; travel behavior; urban area; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088829714

Planting also requires significant investment to ensure successful seedling establishment. However, initial seedling growth and survival is a common missing link in forest growth and yield models as they are predominantly designed to project established trees often post canopy closure. The multitude of both biotic and abiotic factors that influence growth and mortality of planted seedlings during the establishment phase is less examined. This is likely due to the high variability and complexity of this type of analysis, as well as the general lack of available data. The current study utilized annual measurements of 13,701 seedlings beginning immediately after planting to evaluate growth and mortality of planted interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mirb.] Franco) and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) seedlings across multiple contrasting sites in northern Idaho and eastern Oregon for the first two years. Our results indicate that growth and mortality of seedlings were strongly influenced by their initial diameter and height such that slimmer and taller seedlings had higher mortality, while diameter and height growth was positively related to initial diameter and height, respectively. Weather conditions, especially measures of temperature and precipitation, had a similarly important role on seedling growth and mortality. The effects of root growth potential and competing vegetation were generally insignificant as pre-planting chemical preparation was applied to all sites. Improved western larch seedlings from seed orchards had higher growth rates with small increases in mortality compared to wild collected sources, but improved Douglas-fir had minimal gains in growth and much higher mortality. The developed seedling models readily fit into the architecture of current individual tree growth and yield models, which extend these models' ability to forecast seedlings during and after establishment. The identified influential factors and specific differences in seedling growth and mortality during the establishment phase provide critical information and guidance to the increasingly important reforestation practice of planting, and the overall analytical framework presented in this analysis is generally applicable to species beyond Douglas-fir and western larch. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Competing vegetation; Containerized seedling; Seedling quality; Soil parent material; Surficial ash deposits; Weather conditions","Investments; Reforestation; Carbon sequestration; Chemical preparation; Forest growth and yield; Influential factors; Interior Douglas-fir; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Root growth potential; Seedling establishment; Seed; analytical framework; canopy architecture; coniferous tree; diameter; forest management; forestry production; growth response; mortality; plantation forestry; reforestation; seedling establishment; Growth; Larix Occidentalis; Mortality; Planting; Pseudotsuga Menziesii; Reforestation; Seedlings; Idaho; Oregon; United States; Larix occidentalis; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087747958

The separation of sunlit and shaded leaves has been shown to be an effective leaf-to-canopy upscaling method for modeling vegetation GPP. In this study, the performance of the Integrated Carbon-Canadian Land Surface Scheme (IC-CLASS) based on Farquhar's photosynthetic model and the two-leaf approach was compared against that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP algorithm using the light use efficiency (LUE) approach, validated with eddy covariance (EC) measured GPP over a variety of terrestrial ecosystems in Canada. There were systematic differences between the IC-CLASS simulated GPP and the MODIS GPP product in spatial distribution patterns. The differences were due to inherent shortcomings of the LUE modeling approach where a constant maximum LUE value is specified for each biome type, ignoring the variation of shaded leaf contribution to total GPP. The IC-CLASS model separates the sunlit and shaded leaves and the bias in simulating GPP was minimized. The IC-CLASS performed better than the MODIS GPP algorithm compared with monthly and annual GPP derived from EC flux data at 13 Canadian Carbon Program sites. The differences between the IC-CLASS and the MODIS GPP estimates were larger in more clumped canopies (i.e. forests), because of the increase in the shaded leaf fraction. Different LUEs in sunlit and shaded portions of the canopy should be considered for effective and reliable estimation of GPP at regional scale. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

In order to reduced dependency of fossil energy, the solar-assisted post-combustion CO2 capture system are proposed and studied in past decade. Nevertheless, the most of existing feasibility studies on solar-assisted CO2 capture system are steady-state analysis under certain fixed working conditions, which tend to ignore the impact of fluctuations in weather conditions and even lead to a misguiding on feasibility study. Hence, the dynamic simulation model is necessary as it could provide more detailed information and close to the actual situation. This study presents a design of a solar-assisted 5-step temperature-vacuum swing adsorption CO2 capture (SOL-TVSA) system for an industrial emission source. Verified by experiments of core unit, a dynamic simulation system is established and the influences of cyclic parameters on dynamic performance are evaluated. Results show that when vacuum pressure is lower than 6 kPa and desorption temperature exceeds 70 °C, the recovery rate and purity of TVSA system can exceed 95% and 85% respectively. When the volume-area ratio is below 0.3, the annual amount of CO2 captured by SOL-TVSA system could exceed 2.11 ton and solar fraction can exceed 38.81%.

Besides, to evaluate bioclimatic architecture strategies based on recent investigations and the guidelines proposed by Givony, Olgyay, among others. A numerical assessment was performed on the dynamic simulation software DesignBuilder, where the building's passive strategies are evaluated in terms of operative temperature, relative humidity (rH), PMV, PPD, and discomfort hours (DH). All three houses, the HVA, HCA, and HRES were tested in three different locations within Panama City. Results showed that the strategies in HVA perform best for reducing rH levels, but the HRES performs best in overall thermal comfort performance, apart yet from the high rH levels encountered. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Architectural design; Computer software; Energy policy; Planning; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Bio-climatic architectures; Building typologies; Comfort performance; Indoor environment; Operative temperature; Overall thermal comforts; Simulation software; Vernacular architecture; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097165423

We quantified total carbon stocks (C) of three arid Avicennia marina stands in Qatar and report an aboveground biomass allometric equation and the first below ground biomass allometric equation in the region. The allometric relationships indicate that below ground mangrove C stocks in arid locations are more important than previously reported. Comparison of previously published and our locally developed allometric equations show that A. marina in Qatar allocate comparatively more biomass to below ground components than the same species in tropical humid settings, which is consistent with plant adaptations to living in stressed conditions. Total C stocks were 45.70 ± 3.70 Mg C ha−1, of which tree and soil C stocks to 50 cm depth represented 10.18 ± 0.82 Mg C ha−1 and 35.52 ± 2.88 Mg ha−1 respectively. Soil C stocks to 1 m depth were 50.17 ± 6.27 Mg C ha−1. Overall, mangroves sustain relatively small C stocks in the arid, hypersaline environment of Qatar, which may be due to both relatively low tree productivity and growth, as well as limited rainfall-driven transport of terrigenous sediment inputs. By providing further estimates of mangrove carbon at their climatic extremes, these results can contribute to a better quantification of global mangrove carbon, reduce uncertainty in below ground tree C estimates from arid mangroves and have implications for mangrove carbon stocks in the face of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass allocation; Blue carbon; Mangrove allometry; Mangrove below ground; Mangrove carbon stock","aboveground biomass; allometry; arid region; belowground biomass; biomass; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; extreme event; humid environment; mangrove; Qatar; Avicennia marina; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088955298

All require awareness, information, and achievable actions to contribute to moving towards healthy oceans, the base of a robust blue economy. Ocean Watch, a program run by Ocean Wise Conservation Association, was created to translate scientific understanding, combined with community and traditional knowledge, to empower local action for improved marine health. Clear improvements have been made in the Átl'k_a7tsem/Txwnéwu7ts/Howe Sound marine environment, which have been captured in an updated report following from the original 2017 publication. Information within the reports illustrates the connection of communities and the marine environment through articles describing seven themes, which are: (1) Species and Habitat; (2) Clean Water; (3) Sense of Place; (4) Coastal Development and Livelihoods; (5) Stewardship and Governance; (6) Oceanography and Climate Change; and (7) Seafood. Articles such as the 2017 article: ""Sea Stars: wasting disease taking its toll"" gave background, rationale for importance, current status, current actions, and recommended actions to improve the health status (healthy, caution, critical, limited/no data). The health status for 10 of 28 reassessed articles improved largely due to actions taken by local communities, as recommended in the 2017 report. However, more work is needed, especially for areas of marine health that were not improving and to address threats from climate change. Establishing a sustainable socio-ecological relationship with the ocean is necessary if we are to protect and restore the health of all components of the ecosystem. Empowering communities to take action improves ocean health, which is inherently linked to the health of individuals, communities, and economies. © 2020 by the authors.","Blue economy; Marine biodiversity; Ocean pollution; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092489747

New techniques have been developed to induce artificial biocrusts formation as a tool for restoration of degraded drylands, and among them soils inoculation with cyanobacteria adapted to environmental stress. Improvement of soil properties by cyanobacteria inoculation is largely related to their ability to synthesize exopolysaccharides (EPS). However, cyanobacterial EPS features [amount, molecular weight (MW), composition] can change from one species to another or when grown in different conditions. We investigated the differences in growth and polysaccharidic matrix features among three common biocrust-forming cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune, Scytonema javanicum, and Phormidium ambiguum), when grown in liquid media and on sandy soil microcosms under optimal nutrient and water, in controlled laboratory conditions. We extracted and analyzed the released EPS (RPS) and sheath for the liquid cultures, and the more soluble or loosely-bound (LB) and the more condensed or tightly-bound (TB) soil EPS fractions for the sandy soil microcosms. In liquid culture, P. ambiguum showed the greatest growth and EPS release. In contrast, on the sandy soil, S. javanicum showed the highest growth and highest LB-EPS content. N. commune showed no relevant growth after its inoculation of the sandy soil. A difference was observed in terms of MW distribution, showing that the higher MW of the polymers produced by P. ambiguum and S. javanicum compared to the polymers produced by N. commune, could have had a positive effect on growth for the first two organisms when inoculated on the sandy soil. We also observed how both RPS and sheath fractions reflected in the composition of the soil TB-EPS fraction, indicating the role in soil stabilization of both the released and the cell attached EPS. Our results indicate that the features of the polysaccharidic matrix produced by different cyanobacteria can influence their growth success in soil. These results are of great relevance when selecting suitable candidates for large-scale cyanobacteria applications in soil restoration. © Copyright © 2020 Chamizo, Adessi, Torzillo and De Philippis.","cyanobacteria liquid culture; EPS molecular weight distribution; EPS monosaccharidic composition; sand inoculation; sandy soil microcosms; semiarid soil","carbohydrate; chlorophyll a; exopolysaccharide; fructose; fucose; galactose; glucose; mannose; monosaccharide; polymer; rhamnose; ribose; uronic acid; xylose; algal growth; Article; bacterium culture; biomass; cell aggregation; chlorophyll content; controlled study; cyanobacterium; dry weight; ED50; environmental stress; flow rate; fluorescence; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrophobicity; incubation time; inoculation; ion exchange chromatography; microbial community; microbial diversity; microcosm; molecular weight; nonhuman; Nostoc commune; nutrient; Phormidium; protein content; quantum yield; refraction index; retention time (chromatography); sandy soil; Scytonema; size exclusion chromatography; soil inoculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095803553

It is hence well known that at ammonium levels above 2500 mg/l, methanogenic bacteria are inhibited, which leads to both reduced methane (CH4) production and increased organic pollution of the leachate. In the present paper, and for the first time, data on a full-scale landfill indicating ammonia inhibition of waste degradation is presented. The leachate of the landfill is characterized by extremely high concentrations of chloride (up to 70,000 mg/l) and ammonium–nitrogen (up to 20,000 mg/l). These high pollution levels are explained by the following facts: first, the landfill is located in an arid climate (annual precipitation of 200 mm), resulting in low fresh water infiltration; and second, leachate or concentrate resulting from reverse osmosis treatment at the site has been recirculated. The high ammonium levels obviously caused inhibitory effects on the anaerobic degradation, which resulted in chemical oxygen demand concentrations in the leachate of far above 300,000 mg/l. Furthermore, a comparatively low level of landfill gas (LFG) generation and a shift towards higher carbon dioxide and lower CH4 contents in the collected LFG was observed. Based on the gas compositional data, the overall reduction in CH4 generation was assessed to be 50%. In order to reduce organic leachate pollution and to enhance LFG production at the site investigated, fresh (rain) water infiltration should be enhanced and the recirculation of leachate or treatment residues derived thereof should be terminated. © The Author(s) 2020.","Ammonium; biodegradation; inhibition; leachate recirculation; municipal solid waste landfill","Ammonia; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Chlorine compounds; Infiltration; Water pollution; Ammonia inhibition; Anaerobic degradation; Annual precipitation; Compositional data; Leachate pollution; Leachate recirculation; Reverse osmosis treatments; Water infiltration; Leachate treatment; ammonia; biogas; carbon dioxide; chloride; fresh water; methane; nitrogen; ammonia; ammonia; ammonium; arid region; biodegradation; chemical oxygen demand; infiltration; inhibition; landfill; leachate; municipal solid waste; organic pollutant; recirculating system; reverse osmosis; anaerobic digestion; Article; chemical oxygen demand; degradation; desert climate; greenhouse gas; hazardous waste site; landfill leachate; leaching; methanogenic bacterium; osmosis; oxygen consumption; pH; priority journal; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; solid waste management; waste management; waste water management; bioreactor; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; water pollutant; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084979917

The procedure is based on expert evaluation of the expected improvement in crop yield on adoption of CA in a particular scenario or ‘state’, a state being a specified set of soil conditions captured by a standard soil profile description from a specified agroecological zone (AEZ) of Zambia. Mixed groups of scientists including soil scientists, agronomists, agricultural economists and other environmental scientists, facilitated by experienced senior researchers, were presented with multiple subsets each of three states, and asked to rank the states in each subset with respect to expected yield improvement under CA. The groups of scientists could be divided into two sets. Each set comprised two groups, and the agreement on ranking between groups within each set was larger than would be expected if the ranking were done at random. For both sets of groups the ranking could be modelled with respect to properties of the soil, and the contrast between AEZ. The models revealed two contrasting groups of conceptual assumptions. One group broadly expected larger absolute yield improvements from conservation agriculture in settings where water is most likely to be limiting and the carbon status of the soil is poor. By contrast, the other group expected larger improvements where water was less likely to be limiting. These contrasting views are relevant to current discussions as to whether conservation agriculture, which is promoted as a ‘climate smart’ strategy for cropping, is sufficiently attractive for smallholder producers in conditions where crop production is already challenging, and whether the potential benefits in areas where water availability is not of itself a common limitation should be considered. The elicited models could be translated directly into competing hypotheses to be tested, perhaps in on-farm trials of conservation agriculture practices over contrasting soils in the different AEZ. The method, based on modelling the ranking process, could be of more general interest for the elicitation of expert opinion about complex soil, crop and environmental systems. © 2020 The Authors","Conservation agriculture; Elicitation; Probabilistic inversion; Soil surveys","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Soils; Agro-ecological zones; Conservation agricultures; Environmental factors; Environmental scientists; Environmental systems; Expected improvements; Potential benefits; Water availability; Soil conservation; agricultural practice; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; environmental factor; smallholder; soil profile; soil property; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087329468

This study aimed to develop an adequate understanding of arracacha crop water management for irrigation purpose. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficient (Kc) were determined based on water balance evaluation on a daily basis in volumetric lysimeter-scale experiments during the crop growing season. Meteorological data base of monthly temperature and precipitation, in Cajamarca (Tolima region, Colombia), from 1980 to 2011 were analyzed. Arracacha soil characterization was carried out in the region. Furthermore, crop water requirement and Net Irrigation Requirement were determined, using Cropwat model, for different hydrological years: Average, El Niño and La Niña. Results showed that total water consumption for arracacha root was 820 mm along the whole growing season. The development stage was the largest stage, nevertheless, the highest water consumption was registered at the Mid-stage which was 39.4 % of the total water consumption. Seasonal crop coefficients were 0.57, 0.72, 0.95 and 0.90 at Initial (Init), Development (Dev), Mid and Late stage, respectively. Furthermore, high yield reductions are expected in the Mid-stage if limited water is supplied. The proposed modeling framework could be recommended for arracacha farmers to select the most suitable scenario for better agricultural water resources management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cropwat; Lysimeter; Net irrigation requirement; Upland crop; Water scarcity","drought stress; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; lysimeter; upland region; volume change; water budget; water management; water use efficiency; Cajamarca; Colombia; Peru; Tolima; Arracacia xanthorrhiza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086849033

The analysis is focused on the EU countries, since they adopted policy measures able to promote advanced biofuels as a strategic solution for a competitive and sustainable transport sector. In this regard, four classes of feedstocks have been taken into account: wastes, vegetable oils, agricultural and forestry residues. Their availability is studied with the aim to respect the European targets in terms of emissions without neglecting possible negative impacts on environment and biodiversity. A metric for the classification of the different solutions is proposed on the basis of feedstocks availability, technology readiness levels (TRL), quality of the produced biofuel as well as feedstock and production costs. It is possible to conclude that, even if the several interesting alternatives currently available have a high ranking in the proposed metric and must be taken in consideration, green diesel is today the most convenient solution for producing advanced biofuel without risks of technological failures and feedstocks shortage. This analysis can provide insights to encourage the development of advanced biofuels in EU, especially for some of the Member States as Germany, France and Italy. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Feedstocks; Advanced biofuels; Appropriate technologies; Comprehensive analysis; Forestry residues; Strategic solutions; Sustainable transport; Technological failures; Technology readiness levels; Biofuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097146289

Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 × 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha−1) was higher in AFS (26.79 ± 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 ± 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Natural succession; Restoration; Tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085325384

The need to reduce emissions caused by fossil fuel dependence and to foster the use of renewable energy sources has driven the development of zero-emissions powertrains. These clean transportation technologies are not only necessary to move people but to transport the increasing demand for goods and services that is currently taking place in the larger cities. Full electric battery-powered vans seem to be the best-placed solution to the problem. However, despite the progress in driving range and recharge options, those and other market barriers remain unsolved and the current market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is not significant. Based on the development of hydrogen fuel cell stacks, this work explains an emerging powertrain architecture concept for N1 class type vans, that combines a battery-electric configuration with a fuel cell stack powered by hydrogen that works as a range extender (FC-EREV). A literature review is conducted, with the aim to shed light on the possibilities of this hybrid light-duty commercial van for metropolitan delivery tasks, providing insights into the key factors and issues for sizing the powertrain components and fuel management strategies to meet metropolitan freight fleet needs. © 2020 by the authors.

Pure rapeseed methyl ester (RME)and used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) are characterised by well-to-tank greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of 54% and 88% compared to pure B0 petrodiesel, respectively. Captive fleets such as public transport buses could benefit from these GHG reductions by increasing the biodiesel content of their fuel because they have a consequent yearly fuel consumption. The aim of this paper is to compare on-road tailpipe emissions of a diesel bus when increasing the biodiesel concentration in the fuel. The tests were carried out on a standard city bus belonging to the Euro V EEV emission standard that was equipped with a portable emission measurement system measuring NO, NO2, PN, CO and CO2 at the tailpipe. The bus followed the SORT which is representative of urban bus driving. The heavy urban on-road measurements indicated increased NOx emissions (24-26%), decreased PN emissions (43-45%) and slightly decreasing CO emissions for B30 RME and UCOME compared to B7. A measurement uncertainty analysis showed that the CO emissions were less reliable. Similar conclusions were drawn for the easy urban on-road bus emission measurements with smaller differences between B7 and B30 RME and UCOME. © 2020 by the authors.

This study presents an in-depth analysis of the SST patterns of the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas on interannual and seasonal timescales from 1982 to 2018. The results reveal potential relationships between SST and climatic variables in order to improve our understanding of underlying physical mechanisms influencing the SST variations in a changing climate. Our findings disclose that the Arctic Ocean shows an overall warming trend, and the Nordic Seas have the highest SST compared to its neighboring seas. The Barents Sea shows spatially varying seasonal trends due to ice cover changes and warm water circulation within the Nordic Seas. Correlation analysis was also performed to facilitate further understanding of climate-induced SST changes. It reveals that climate variables interact differently with the Arctic Ocean SST on a regional scale and vary with different degrees of influence.

Currently, there are no paleofire records from the Western Carpathians that provide the long-term range of natural variability to contextualise the response of upper-montane forests to future environmental change and disturbance regimes. We present the first high-resolution Holocene fire history record from the upper-montane ecotone from the High Tatra Mountains, Slovakia, as well as provide a regional synthesis of pan-Carpathian drivers of biomass burning in upper-montane forests. Our results illustrate that forest composition and density both greatly influence biomass burning, creating two different climate-fuel feedbacks. First, warmer conditions in the early Holocene, coupled with generally higher abundances of Pinus sp., either P. cembra and/or P. mugo/sylvestris, created a positive climate-fuel relationship that resulted in higher amounts of biomass burning. Second, cooler and wetter late Holocene conditions led to denser Picea abies upper-montane forests, creating a negative climate-fuel feedback that reduced biomass burning in upper-montane forests across the Carpathians. Given that warmer and drier conditions are expected across the entire Carpathian region in the future, our results illustrate how future climate change could potentially create a positive climate-fuel relationship within upper-montane forests dominated by Picea abies and Pinus cembra and/or P. mugo/sylvestris. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carpathians; Fire; Forest composition; Forest density; Holocene; Macrofossils; Picea abies; Pollen; Sedimentary charcoal; Upper-montane","Biomass; Deforestation; Fuels; Plants (botany); Disturbance regime; Environmental change; Forest compositions; Montane forests; Natural variability; Summer temperature; Warmer conditions; Western carpathians; Climate change; biomass burning; coniferous tree; environmental change; fire history; forest fire; Holocene; long-term change; montane forest; Carpathians; Slovakia; Tatra Mountains; Picea abies; Pinus cembra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087732734

In the N-cycle, release of N2O is boosted upon a drop of pH in the environment. Here, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus was grown in batch mode in the presence of nitrate, to study the effect of pH in the denitrification pathway by gene expression profiling, quantification of nitrate and nitrite, and evaluating the ability of whole cells to reduce NO and N2O. At pH 6.5, accumulation of nitrite in the medium occurs and the cells were unable to reduce N2O. In addition, the biochemical properties of N2O reductase isolated from cells grown at pH 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 were compared for the first time. The amount of this enzyme at acidic pH was lower than that at pH 7.5 and 8.5, pinpointing to a post-transcriptional regulation, though pH did not affect gene expression of N2O reductase accessory genes. N2O reductase isolated from cells grown at pH 6.5 has its catalytic center mainly as CuZ(4Cu1S), while that from cells grown at pH 7.5 or 8.5 has it as CuZ(4Cu2S). This study evidences that an in vivo secondary level of regulation is required to maintain N2O reductase in an active state.

However, its functions also have some negative effects or associated disservices, such as the emission of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) and allergens. This work aims to analyze the effect that urban environmental conditions and air pollutants have on pollen emissions of plane tree. The study has been carried out in Granada, in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, a city with a Mediterranean climate and one of the most polluted in Spain. Granada is also one of the Mediterranean cities in which the increase in the percentage of the population affected by allergy to Platanus pollen in recent decades has been most significant. The 1992–2019 Platanus pollen data series has been considered to establish the main aerobiological parameters, trends and correlations with meteorological variables and particulate and gaseous atmospheric pollutants, both before and during the flowering period. The average Seasonal Pollen Integral (SPIn) of about 2700 pollen grains has shown a significant increase throughout the series. This increase in allergen emissions could be related to the increase in crown volume associated with tree growth, but also to other environmental factors. Precipitation and minimum temperatures of the winter prior to flowering were the parameters that have shown the most influence with SPIn, while O3 and NOx are the pollutants that have the most effect on the peak value. Due to the good adaptation that London plane has to changing climatic conditions in urban environments, its hegemonic presence as an element of Urban Green infrastructure must be reviewed so that the net balance of ecosystem services is not diminished by the disservices. © 2020","Allergens; Ecosystem disservices; Green infrastructure; London plane tree; Pollination; Urban ecosystem services","Allergens; Ecosystems; Indium compounds; Phosphorus compounds; Pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric pollutants; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Environmental conditions; Environmental factors; Mediterranean cities; Mediterranean climates; Meteorological variables; Minimum temperatures; Sulfur compounds; allergen; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; allergen; aerobiology; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; pollen; pollination; precipitation (climatology); tree; urban area; adaptation; air pollutant; Article; climate change; environmental factor; environmental temperature; flowering; humidity; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; particulate matter; plant parameters; Platanus x hispanica; pollen allergy; pollination; precipitation; priority journal; Seasonal Pollen Index; Spain; tree; tree growth; urban area; wind speed; winter; city; ecosystem; England; pollination; Andalucia; Granada [Andalucia]; Iberian Peninsula; Spain; Platanus; Platanus x acerifolia; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Cities; Ecosystem; London; Pollination; Spain; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086078158

The mass contribution of nitrate relative to sulfate in PM2.5 has tended to increase in many regions globally, but how this change affects aerosol pH remains in debate. In this way, we measured PM2.5 ionic species and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate in the eastern China, and predicted aerosol pH using the ISORROPIA-II model. When nitrate to sulfate molar ratio increases and thus PM2.5 is gradually enriched in ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), aerosol pH tends to increase. The oxidation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by hydroxyl radical is responsible for most of nitrate formation (generally above 60%). These indicate that nitrate formation through gas-to-particle conversion involving ammonia and nitric acid results in increasing aerosol pH with increasing molar ratio of nitrate to sulfate. Conversely, aerosol pH is expected to decrease with increasing relative abundance of nitrate as ammonia emissions are lowered. Our research concludes that it should be considered to reduce aerosol NH4NO3 by reducing the precursors of nitric oxide and ammonia emissions, to substantially improve the air quality (i.e., reduce PM2.5 levels and potential nitrate deposition) in China. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aerosol pH; Nitrate formation; Nitrate to sulfate ratio; Particle nitrate","acidity; aerosol; air quality; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; isotopic composition; nitrate; nitric oxide; oxygen isotope; particulate matter; reduction; sulfate; China; sulfate; aerosol; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; pH; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Particulate Matter; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087060633

However, there is still a large demand for MoOx QDs with long-wavelength emission by a facile strategy but these are more challenging to obtain. Herein, we rationally designed and successfully prepared nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped green emitting MoOx QDs (N,P-MoOx QDs) through a microwave-assisted rapid method. They exhibit a maximum emission at 500 nm under a 430 nm excitation. Moreover, by controlling their sizes in the process, we find that such a strategy enables the tuning of the emission color of N,P-MoOx QDs from green to blue. N,P-MoOx QDs show a significant fluorescence response to pH changes, and also display pH-sensitive near-infrared localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at 866 nm. An effective and simple pH probe with a dual-signal response is achieved using N,P-MoOx QDs. As environmental sensors, N,P-MoOx QDs can be applied for sensitive detection of the concentrations of permanganate and captopril, offering the linear range from 0.08 to 25 μM and 0.1 to 31 μM, respectively. Benefitting from the effect of doping nitrogen and phosphorus, the probe could detect a wide range of pH changes (2-9) and is endowed with superior biocompatibility. Further, it is successfully used to ""see""the intracellular pH variation by fluorescence confocal imaging. These findings not only demonstrate the achievement of a promising multifunctional probe for biosensing and environmental detection, but also pave the way for the fabrication of transition metal oxide QDs with tunable optical properties.

To tackle this issue, a port authority can develop emission reduction plans and projects, whose performance is tracked through an air emissions inventory (EI). Despite the attention on EI methodologies in the past, little research has focused on the implementation of methodologies in information systems. Therefore, a case study is conducted in this paper to investigate the motivation for creating EIs and the obstacles in the EI-creation process from an information systems perspective. The results indicate that data confidentiality and weak information systems are major obstacles, which hinder the creation of high-quality EIs and generate additional costs.

This extraordinary situation has led to a reduction in air pollution levels measured in the whole Po Valley, usually known as one of the most polluted areas in Europe in terms of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown on the air quality improvement. In particular, an interrupted time series modelling approach is employed to test if a significant change in the level and the trend of the pollutant time series has occurred after the lockdown measure. The case study regards the city of Brescia (Northern Italy) and focuses on the comparison of the period before (January 1st–March 7th, 2020) and after (March 8th–March 27th, 2020) the lockdown. By adjusting for meteorology and Sunday effect, the results show that a significant change in air quality occurring in the post intervention period was observed only for a single NO2 station located in a heavy traffic zone. In particular, the estimate of the time series slope, i.e. the expected change in the concentration associated with a time unit increase, decreases from -0.25 to -1.67 after the lockdown. For the remaining stations, no significant change was found in the concentration time series when comparing the two periods. This confirms the complexity of air pollutant concentration dynamics for the considered area, which is not merely related to emission sources but depends also on other factors as, for example, (micro and macro) meteorological conditions and the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, which are all independent of the lockdown measure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ARMAX model; Change in level and trend; Counterfactual; Interrupted time series regression; PM10 and NO2 concentrations; Po Valley","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Viruses; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality improvement; Concentration-time; Meteorological condition; Nitrogen dioxides; Particulate Matter; Post interventions; Time-series modelling; Time series; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; disease spread; infectious disease; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; virus; air pollution; air quality; Article; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; Coronavirinae; human; particulate matter; physical phenomena; priority journal; time series analysis; traffic accident; wind speed; Brescia; Italy; Lombardy; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088115325

Interventions are available to offset many of the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture, and they can be tailored to local conditions often through relative modest investments. However, little quantitative information is available to guide investment or policy choices at a time when countries and development agencies are under pressure to implement policies that can help achieve Sustainable Development Goals while coping with climate change. Among smallholder adaptation options, developing seeds resilient to current and future climate shocks expected locally is one of the most important actions available now. In this paper, we used national and local data to estimate the costs of climate change to smallholder farmers in Malawi and Tanzania. We found that the benefits from adopting resilient seeds ranged between 984 million and 2.1 billion USD during 2020–2050. Our analysis demonstrates the benefits of establishing and maintaining a flexible national seed sector with participation by communities in the breeding, delivery, and adoption cycle. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Climate policy; Improved seeds; Smallholders","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Food supply; Developing seed; Development agencies; Local conditions; Policy choices; Quantitative information; Smallholder farmers; Sub-saharan africa; Tropical countries; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coping strategy; food security; investment; smallholder; sustainable development; vulnerability; Malawi; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089977052

Existing approaches to modeling building electricity consumption span a range of structural methodologies, spatial resolutions, and temporal scales, potentially leading to divergent projections. This paper compares how two models with different structures and resolutions respond to a common set of population and climate drivers in the western U.S. The BEND model simulates hourly residential and commercial building electricity consumption at the county scale by weighting the results of simulations of thousands of representative buildings. In contrast, the projected electricity demand in GCAM-USA is determined for each state, year, sector (residential/commercial), and service (e.g., heating, cooling, and others), based on population, income, technology, energy prices, and average annual climate. This paper aggregates the two models’ results to a common resolution: annual residential and commercial building electricity consumption by state. Both models show similar responses to future projected population change and climate change, with population change having the larger impact between the two. Differences are primarily due to how the models capture changes in the aggregate energy efficiency of the building stock as it evolves over time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Climate change; Electricity consumption; Multi-scale modeling; Population change","Aggregates; Climate change; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Housing; Investments; Office buildings; Scales (weighing instruments); Service industry; Commercial building; Comparative studies; Different structure; Divergent projection; Electricity demands; Electricity-consumption; Investment decisions; Spatial resolution; Climate models; climate effect; comparative study; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy use; global climate; investment incentive; population structure; price determination; residential energy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088391436

Nonetheless, the capacity planning of the SESs is challenging as it needs to fulfil the fluctuating demand from a long-term perspective, in addition to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources (RESs). Owing to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the capacity planning problem, an efficient technique must be employed to achieve a cost-effective system. Existing techniques are, subject to some constraints on the derivability and continuity of the objective function, prone to premature convergence, computationally demanding, follows rigorous procedures to fine-tune the algorithm parameters in different applications, and often do not offer a fair balance during the exploitation and exploration phase of the optimization process. Furthermore, the literature review indicates that researchers often do not implement and examine the energy management scheme (EMS) of a microgrid while computing for the capacity planning problem of microgrids. This paper proposes a rule-based EMS (REMS) optimized by a nature-inspired grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for long-term capacity planning of a grid-independent microgrid incorporating a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, a battery (BT) bank and a diesel generator (Dgen). In which, a rule-based algorithm is used to implement an EMS to prioritize the usage of RES and coordinate the power flow of the proposed microgrid components. Subsequently, an attempt is made to explore and confirm the efficiency of the proposed REMS incorporated with GOA. The ultimate goal of the objective function is to minimize the cost of energy (COE) and the deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP). The performance of the REMS is examined via a long-term simulation study to ascertain the REMS resiliency and to ensure the operating limit of the BT storage is not violated. The result of the GOA is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The simulation results indicate that the proposed technique's superiority is confirmed in terms of convergence to the optimal solution. The simulation results confirm that the proposed REMS has contributed to better adoption of a cleaner energy production system, as the scheme significantly reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emission and COE by 92.4%, 92.3% and 79.8%, respectively as compared to the conventional Dgen. The comparative evaluation of the algorithms shows that REMS-GOA yields a better result as it offers the least COE (objective function), at $0.3656/kW h, as compared to the REMS-CSA at $0.3662/kW h and REMS-PSO at $0.3674/kW h, for the desired DPSP of 0%. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to highlight the effect of uncertainties on the system inputs that may arise in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management scheme; Grasshopper optimization; Metaheuristic algorithms; Pareto-optimal front; PV; Rule-based algorithm","Biomimetics; Cost effectiveness; Electric load flow; Energy management; Energy management systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Cuckoo search algorithms; Energy management schemes; Exploitation and explorations; Off-grid electrification; Optimization algorithms; Pre-mature convergences; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy systems; Microgrids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088132960

Data from XMM-Newton, Suzaku, Swift, and NuSTAR are combined to obtain a broadband, multi-epoch view of the source. There is spectral variability in the 3-10 keV band over the 18 yr. An analysis of the NuSTAR and Suzaku lightcurves also suggests rapid variability in the 3-10 keV band, which is consistent with the NLS1 definition of the source. However, no variability is seen below 3 keV on any timescale. Two distinct physical models are adopted to describe the data above and below ∼ 3, keV. The low energies are dominated by a hot, diffuse gas likely associated with a starburst component at large physical scales. The higher-energy spectrum is dominated by emission from the central region. Ionized partial covering and relativistic blurred reflection are considered for the central region emission. In both cases, the underlying power law has a photon index of Γ ∼ 2.3-2.4. A distant reflector, a neutral partial covering component with a covering fraction near ∼1, and contributions from starburst emission are always required. The blurred reflection model requires a reflection-dominated spectrum, which may be at odds with the low emissivity index and radio properties of the source. By contrast, the two absorption components required in the ionized partial covering model may correspond to the two distinct regions of polarization observed in the optical. Regardless of the physical model, spectral changes between epochs are driven by the absorption components - and on short timescales, by intrinsic active galactic nucleus variability. © 2020.

This paper analyses changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arising from the shift from straw incorporation to biomethane and bioethanol production. The biomethane concept comprises comminution, anaerobic digestion and amine washing. It additionally provides an organic fertilizer. Bioethanol production comprises energetic use of lignin, steam explosion, enzymatic hydrolysis and co-fermentation. Additionally, feed is provided. A detailed consequential GHG balance with in-depth focus on the time dependency of emissions is conducted: (a) the change in the atmospheric load of emissions arising from the change in the temporal occurrence of emissions comparing two steady states (before the shift and once a new steady state has established); and (b) the annual change in overall emissions over time starting from the shift are assessed. The shift from straw incorporation to biomethane production results in net changes in GHG emissions of (a) −979 (−436 to −1,654) and (b) −955 (−220 to −1,623) kg CO2-eq. per tdry matter straw converted to biomethane (minimum and maximum).

If the atmospheric load of emissions arising from different timing of emissions is neglected in case (a), the change in GHG emissions differs by up to 54%. Case (b) reveals carbon payback times of 0 (0–49) and 19 (1–100) years in case of biomethane and bioethanol production, respectively.

There is, however, increasing interest in offshore wind development in many coastal regions of the United States. As offshore wind grows in those regions it will displace existing and future electric generation assets, which will lead to changes in the emissions from the electric power sector. This research explores combinations of two electric sector drivers, offshore wind capital costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) caps, to measure the changes in the energy mix and quantify offshore wind's impact on electric sector emissions. An energy system modeling approach is applied, using a nested parametric sensitivity analysis, to generate and explore potential energy futures and analyze the air quality and greenhouse gas emissions benefits of offshore wind as an energy source. The analysis shows that offshore wind capacity was added due to cost reductions more than CO2 cap stringency, though both increased capacity additions. Capacity varied more by CO2 cap stringency at higher prices and less at lower prices. CO2 mitigation led to reductions in all five emissions investigated, regardless of offshore wind cost. Offshore wind-specific reductions were only consistent across all CO2 caps for CO2 and methane (CH4), though offshore wind-specific reductions were found for all emissions in the absence of CO2 caps. Results are presented nationally, analyzing the differences in adoption of offshore wind and how this technology provides a broader range of emission reduction options for the power sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Cost optimization; Energy system scenarios; Offshore wind energy","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Offshore oil well production; Potential energy; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Capacity additions; CO2 mitigation; Coastal regions; Electric generation; Electric power sector; Emission reduction; Energy system model; Parametric sensitivity analysis; Offshore technology; air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coastal zone; cost analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; electricity industry; wind power; Asia; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087395305

Displacement of the SPCZ causes variability in rainfall, tropical-cyclone activity and sea level that affects South Pacific island populations and surrounding ecosystems. In this Review, we synthesize recent advances in understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for the SPCZ location and orientation, its interactions with the principal drivers of tropical climate variability, regional and global effects of the SPCZ and its response to anthropogenic climate change. Emerging insight is beginning to provide a coherent description of the character and variability of the SPCZ over synoptic, intraseasonal, interannual and longer timescales. For example, the diagonal orientation of the SPCZ and its natural variability are both the result of a subtle chain of interactions between the tropical and extratropical atmosphere, forced and modulated by the underlying sea surface temperature gradients. However, persistent biases in, and deficiencies of, existing models limit confidence in future projections. Improved climate models and new methods for regional modelling might better constrain future SPCZ projections, aiding climate change adaptation and planning among vulnerable South Pacific communities. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090122441

However, few studies have accounted for the cumulative and interacting impacts of climate change on forest productivity and natural disturbances; even fewer have considered drought impacts when projecting wood supply. We modeled how disturbance- and drought-induced tree mortality will affect wood supply in three regions of Canada's boreal forest over a 200-year period under three climate-forcing scenarios. We project strong declines in overall aboveground biomass due to increases in mortality caused mainly by increased drought and wildfire, particularly in drier, western regions. Using two management strategies, we show that maintaining current long-term sustainable harvesting levels will be extremely challenging depending on the level of anthropogenic climate forcing. Increased wildfire activity under severe climate forcing will strongly decrease the availability of harvestable stands. In western areas that are already water-limited, harvesting levels will need to be low to remain sustainable. Our results show that Canada's future wood supply and sustainable forest management practices are highly vulnerable to changes in climate; hence adaptation actions are needed to lower these vulnerabilities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drought-induced mortality; Forest disturbances; Forest management; Harvest intensity; LANDIS-II; Species compositions; Sustainable operations","Drought; Fires; Forestry; Timber; Above ground biomass; Anthropogenic climate; Forest productivity; Forestry operations; Management strategies; Natural disturbance; Sustainable forest management; Sustainable harvesting; Climate change; aboveground biomass; agrometeorology; boreal forest; climate forcing; drought stress; forest management; forestry production; mortality; nature-society relations; sustainable forestry; timber harvesting; Drought; Fires; Forestry; Harvesting; Mortality; Supply; Sustainable Forest Management; Wood; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087591703

The plant supplies carbon substrates and other nutrients to the bacteria in exchange for fixed nitrogen. The exchange occurs across a plant-derived symbiosome membrane (SM), which encloses rhizobia to form a symbiosome. Iron supplied by the plant is crucial for rhizobial enzyme nitrogenase that catalyses nitrogen fixation, but the SM iron transporter has not been identified. We use yeast complementation, real-time PCR and proteomics to study putative soybean (Glycine max) iron transporters GmVTL1a and GmVTL1b and have characterized the role of GmVTL1a using complementation in plant mutants, hairy root transformation and microscopy. GmVTL1a and GmVTL1b are members of the vacuolar iron transporter family and homologous to Lotus japonicus SEN1 (LjSEN1), which is essential for nitrogen fixation. GmVTL1a expression is enhanced in nodule infected cells and both proteins are localized to the SM. GmVTL1a transports iron in yeast and restores nitrogen fixation when expressed in the Ljsen1 mutant. Three GmVTL1a amino acid substitutions that block nitrogen fixation in Ljsen1 plants reduce iron transport in yeast. We conclude GmVTL1a is responsible for transport of iron across the SM to bacteroids and plays a crucial role in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. © 2020 The Authors.

As these events occurred in a (tectonically active) region of oil and gas production and storage, the question was raised, whether stress perturbations due to underground industrial activities could have induced or triggered the shocks. Following expert recommendations, in 2014, the Italian Oil &amp; Gas Safety Authority (DGS-UNMIG, Ministry of Economic Development) published guidelines (ILG - Indirizzi e linee guida per il monitoraggio della sismicità, delle deformazioni del suolo e delle pressioni di poro nell’ambito delle attività antropiche), describing regulations regarding hydrocarbon extraction, waste-water injection and gas storage that could also be adapted to other technologies, such as dams, geothermal systems, CO2 storage, and mining. The ILG describe the framework for the different actors involved in monitoring activities, their relationship and responsibilities, the procedure to be followed in case of variations of monitored parameters, the need for in-depth scientific analyses, the definition of different alert levels, their meaning and the parameters to be used to activate such alerts. Four alert levels are defined, the transition among which follows a decision to be taken jointly by relevant authorities and industrial operator on the basis of evaluation of several monitored parameters (micro-seismicity, ground deformation, pore pressure) carried on by a scientific-technical agency. Only in the case of liquid reinjection, the alert levels are automatically activated on the basis of exceedance of thresholds for earthquake magnitude and ground shaking – in what is generally known as a Traffic Light System (TLS). Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia has been charged by the Italian oil and gas safety authority (DGS-UNMIG) to apply the ILG in three test cases (two oil extraction and one gas storage plants). The ILG indeed represent a very important and positive innovation, as they constitute official guidelines to coherently regulate monitoring activity on a national scale. While pilot studies are still mostly under way, we may point out merits of the whole framework, and a few possible critical issues, requiring special care in the implementation. Attention areas of adjacent reservoirs, possibly licenced to different operators, may overlap, hence making the point for joint monitoring, also in view of the possible interaction between stress changes related to the different reservoirs. The prescribed initial blank-level monitoring stage, aimed at assessing background seismicity, may lose significance in case of nearby active production. Magnitude – a critical parameter used to define a possible step-up in activation levels – has inherent uncertainty and can be evaluated using different scales. A final comment considers the fact that relevance of TLS, most frequently used in hydraulic fracturing operations, may not be high in case of triggered tectonic events. © 2019, The Author(s).","Alert system; Anthropogenic seismicity; Italy; Monitoring guidelines","fluid injection; guideline; hydraulic fracturing; hydrocarbon reservoir; induced seismicity; monitoring; seismicity; stress change; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Emilia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077589250

First, they exhibit less interest in the structural level of social problems. Secondly, they are supposed to incline towards the idea of welfare conditionality. And thirdly, they are evolving towards increasingly shallow technical, box-ticking professionals. As such, this generation of social workers seems to conform with a policy climate in which social justice is increasingly under pressure. It is our contention that this debate is one-sided and negative. It dismisses the perspective of the social workers themselves. For organisations in social work, it might appear paradoxical that the youngest generation of social workers—although submersed in the context of workfare—hold the key to revising institutional processes and guidelines. Based on generational theory, however, we argue that social work needs to consider the ability of the newest generation to signal procedural and institutional barriers that hinder the pursuit of social justice. © The Author(s) 2019.

Monte Carlo method is implemented to probabilistically estimate output variables, representing uncertainties from input data such as solar generation, vehicles demand and building load. Simulations are based on local irradiance data and electricity demand measurements collected by a local monitoring system installed in the building. The analysis comprehends a study time horizon of 10 years and evaluates transformer load and voltage level, carbon emissions avoided, and the financial feasibility of the project. Results show the connection of a PV system with penetration level of 15.6% can significantly reduce transformer overload occurrence by 69% and decrease overload duration time on average from 4 to 1 h at 10th year. PV system can reduce PEV CO2 emission by 97.4% on average compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. From a financial perspective, the project is feasible and economically attractive with a payback time that ranges from 6 to 8 years, being an attractive solution to the Amazon region to support a cleaner energy matrix. © 2020 by the authors.

For the planar solid tin target, the 4d-5p transitions of Sn8+-Sn10+ ions are shown to dominate the long-wavelength part of the measured spectrum and transitions of type 4d-4f + 4p-4d are visible in absorption. For the droplet target case, a clear increase in the charge state distribution with increasing laser intensity is observed. This qualitatively demonstrates the potential of using long-wavelength out-of-band emission features to probe the charge states contributing to the strong unresolved transition array at 13.5 nm relevant for nanolithography. © 2020 The Author(s).

Earlier studies of bus systems have identified a need to further investigate societal costs, total cost of ownership, energy use on a yearly basis to account for seasonal variations, and noise during acceleration. Addressing those needs was the purpose of this study. Investigations were made in five cities in Sweden that have recently implemented different electric buses in their respective public transport system. Based on results from these investigations and earlier studies, new and developed models where designed and applied on electric buses on route 1 in Karlskrona, as a representative example. It was found that there were significant savings in societal costs and total cost of ownership when compared to diesel and biogas powered buses, mainly due to decreased noise, no emissions in the use phase, and decreased energy use. © 2019 The Author(s).

One of the difficulties is that the perceived benefits associated with a CCS facility for local communities tend to be low compared to its perceived burdens. As is the case for other low carbon technologies, community compensation (or community benefits) has been suggested as a way to restore this perceived imbalance. A diverse literature has looked into the role of community compensation across various land uses and research fields. Synthesis is limited, while at the same time, the provision of community compensation in practice is moving from an ad hoc to a more institutionalized approach. Therefore, it is important to take stock of the literature. This paper provides a review of the community compensation literature in the form of four debates, drawing together environmental social science research on different low carbon technologies (e.g. CCS, renewable energy). In addition, current practices in community compensation for four European countries are discussed. The two parts of this paper are brought together in a set of lessons for the provision of community compensation for future CCS projects; in turn, suggestions for further research are made to address remaining knowledge gaps. © 2020 The Author(s)","Acceptance; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS); Community benefits; Community compensation; Community engagement","Environmental technology; Land use; Social sciences computing; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Current practices; European Countries; Local community; Low-carbon technologies; Perceived benefits; Renewable energies; Social science research; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; knowledge; land use; local participation; research; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089801790

Box 9502, Leiden, RA  2300, Netherlands","Observation of CO formed during electrochemical CO2 reduction using Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) is complicated by the fragmentation of CO2 in the course of the ionization process. Since much more CO2 than CO enters the vacuum of the mass spectrometer, the ion current for mass 28 is dominated by the CO+-fragment of CO2. By reducing the cathode potential of the ion source of the mass spectrometer from −70 V to −27.5 V, fragmentation of CO2 is reduced to a negligible degree. This allows direct observation of electrochemically formed CO by measuring the ionic current for mass 28. We show that this method is superior to matrix calibration in which the ionic current for mass 44 corrected by the CO+/CO2+-intensity ratio is subtracted from the ionic current for mass 28. Using this method, we compare DEMS results for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at gold electrodes obtained in two different cells, a conventional DEMS cell with the working electrode sputtered onto the membrane in contact with the vacuum and a flow cell where the interface to the vacuum is separated from the working electrode. We show that in the conventional cell at the interface between electrolyte and vacuum, the local CO2 concentration is reduced as the nearby vacuum interferes with the equilibria of reactions involving gases, and the local pH is increased. Therefore, in DEMS cells where the working electrode is positioned in the vicinity of the interface, the onset potential for CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution are shifted and the observed faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction are considerably reduced compared to literature values. This can be rectified by using flow cells that allow a spatial separation between vacuum/electrolyte interface and working electrode. We describe how the Dual Thin Layer Cell can be calibrated for detecting CO, thus allowing quantification of evolved amounts of CO from the ionic current for mass 28. © 2020 The Authors","CO-detection; CO2 reduction reaction; DEMS; Flow cell; Mass spectroscopy","Carbon dioxide; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ion sources; Ionization of gases; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Metal drawing; CO detection; CO2 reduction; DEMS; Flow cells; Mass spectroscopy; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078145617

We have analyzed the atmospheric emissions of the main greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, CH4, and N2O) and other pollutants (NOx, CO, NMVOC, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and BC) from various sectors such as private road transport, freight, public transport, agriculture machines, thermal power plants, residential, commercial, and governmental from January 2005 to April 2020. We focused on the months with the greatest restrictions of COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina (March and April 2020). The results show emissions reduction up to 37% for PM10, PM2.5, and BC, consistent with observed from satellite images and up to 160% for NOx, CO, NMVOC, and SOx. However, the residential sector has increased their emissions by 8% for the same period. As a consequence, 3337 Gg of CO2eq of GHG emissions were reduced, corresponding to a 20% reduction compared to the same period in 2019. Besides, a 26% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) was observed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that each Tg of GHG reduction was associated to a 0.16% reduction of the GDP from the analyzed sectors. Thus, without a voluntary reduction in consumption associated to significant cultural and technological changes, reduction in GHG would still be associated with deepening inequalities and asymmetries between high and low consumption sectors (i.e., with better (lesser) education, health, and job opportunities), even within countries and cities. © 2020 by the authors.

They are important carbon reservoirs and when degraded (e.g., erosive processes, fires, draining and plowing) massive carbon dioxide volumes are released. This leads to increase greenhouse effect and induce serious land subsidence. Thus, mapping the volume of peat deposits is crucial in order to estimate the carbon mass and the potential release of carbon dioxide and consequent loss in soil elevation. Despite the importance of such estimations, forecasting and quantifying the peat thickness is still a challenge. Direct sediment coring provides local information that is difficult to extend to large territories. Indirect geophysical methods are unable to resolve lithological contrasts in the presence of saltwater contamination in coastal areas. In this work, we show the results obtained using two contact-less electromagnetic methods for the characterization of peat deposits in a peatland site of the Venice coastland, Italy. Specifically, a multi-frequency portable instrument (FDEM) and an airborne time-domain electromagnetic one (AEM), known for their very high and relatively low vertical resolution respectively, were used to collect data over a former wetland then reclaimed for agricultural purposes. Additional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data are used together with sediment core data to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the contact-less methods. Results show that both FDEM and AEM are very effective in detecting the presence of the peat layer, despite its low thickness (<2 m) and the high electro-conductive subsoil because of saltwater contamination. However, the AEM method overestimated the peat thickness while the FDEM could accurately resolve the peat thickness even where the layer was thinner than 1 m. When compared to the electrical features extracted from the ERT, discrepancies are on average lower than 30%; when compared to the borehole data, discrepancies are on average slightly higher than 6%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Airborne electromagnetics; Contact-less geophysical methods; FDEM; Peat thickness; Peatland volume","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Deposits; Greenhouse effect; Lithology; Soils; Time domain analysis; Wetlands; Agricultural purpose; Electrical resistivity tomography; Electromagnetic methods; Geophysical methods; Local information; Portable instrument; Time domain electromagnetics; Vertical resolution; Peat; carbon; salt water; carbon dioxide; electrical resistivity; electromagnetic method; peat soil; sediment core; subsoil; agricultural land; airborne electromagnetic method; analytic method; Article; case study; controlled study; electrical resistivity tomography; frequency domain electromagnetic method; Italy; lagoon; measurement accuracy; peat thickness; peatland; priority journal; seashore; sediment; thickness; tomography; wetland; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086145251

These measures are often characterized by geographical fragmentation, as jurisdictions typically select their own renewable targets without coordinating with neighboring regions. However, the literature on renewable policies has not examined the effects of cross-border interactions and coordination, especially in a multi-model comparison to examine robustness to structural and parametric uncertainties. This paper assesses the impacts of regional and international renewable policy coordination on economic, environmental, and planning outcomes in the North American power sector. Using a multi-model comparison with eight energy-economic models, the analysis demonstrates how prospective renewable mandate trade formulations impact power sector outcomes like capacity planning decisions, costs, emissions, trade, and infrastructure investments. Model results suggest that renewable policy coordination can lower costs by up to 20% for the stringencies examined here. Fragmentation lowers gas-fired generation, but coal and nuclear are also displaced, especially when regions comply without trade. Policy costs decrease for the U.S. with higher regional and international coordination, but magnitudes vary by model. Restricting coordination leads to higher capacity investments, and absent incentives to enhance efficiency, grids do not share resources to balance variability. Transmission investments and trade are highest with international policy coordination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Instrument choice; Model intercomparison; Policy coordination; Power sector; Renewable energy; Trade","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Geographical regions; Energy-economic model; Gas-fired generation; Infrastructure investment; International coordination; International policies; Parametric uncertainties; Renewable electricity; Transmission investments; Investments; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; investment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087126644

In 2018, the inaugural USDA Northeast Climate Hub’s Graduate Climate Adaptation Partners (GradCAP) Program was launched to provide professional development opportunities and a platform for collaboration to graduate students studying climate resilience in agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture. This essay represents the unified voice of this consortium of emerging leaders. Here we offer perspectives, experiences, and recommendations for building capacity among ECRs, specifically with regard to interdisciplinary research, long-term research, and community engagement. We discuss these three tenants, which we term Convergence, Continuity, and Community, as essential elements in the development of successful leaders prepared for the complex challenges ahead. We encourage institutions, particularly universities and government agencies, to commit resources and pursue structural changes to provide support for mentorship and training that span these focal areas.

The current GCMs’ data are, however, too coarse to use directly at the regional and local scales for climate change studies. Two widely used statistical downscaling methods, namely LARS-WG and SDSM models, were used to study the current and future climate change of Tana Basin, Ethiopia. Four GCMs (GFCM21, HadCM3, MPEH5, and NCCCS) for LARS-WG and two GCMs (HadCM3 and CanESM2) for SDSM with different emission scenarios were evaluated. Overall results indicated an acceptable response of the models to simulate and forecast climatic variables under HadCM3 and CanESM2 GCMs. Rainfall results downscaled by LARS-WG from the four GCMs indicated high intermodal variabilities and non-consistence; Increasing trend of rainfall showed on three of the GCMs while one GCM showed a decreasing trend in the range of − 9.6% to 45.2%. The four GCMs rainfall average ensemble value showed an increasing trend ranging from 3.9% to 18.8%, which is also consistent with HadCM3 projections ranging from 4.1% to 19.2%. However, the downscaled results from all four models showed increasing maximum and minimum temperature for all time periods. The mean annual maximum and minimum temperature change increased from 0.9 °C to 2.9 °C and 0.6 °C to 2.5 °C, respectively, while annual mean relative change of rainfall ranged from 9.9% to 44.7%. Both SDSM and LARS-WG methods were obtained good monthly rainfall data series than daily rainfall data series in the study area. However, both models with the selected GCMs (HadCM3 and CanESM2) performed reasonably well to simulate temperature than rainfall. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ethiopia; GCMs; LARS-WG; SDSM; Statistical downscaling model; Tana basin","Climate models; Rain; Adaptation strategies; Climatic variables; Emission scenario; Global climate changes; Global climate model; Hydrological cycles; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Statistical downscaling; Climate change; air temperature; basin analysis; climate modeling; downscaling; future prospect; global climate; numerical model; rainfall; statistical analysis; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089474276

In the light of these data, the answer to the question of whether glass powder could be considered as a stabilizing additive with sea water in lime-stabilized clayey soil so that clayey soil could be used in road pavement and embankment construction has been investigated. A series of experimental studies conducted to determine the effect of additives on the geotechnical properties of the clayey soil such as moisture-density relationships, strength, and consistency. The samples were prepared by blending 5% lime and different percentages of powdered glass such as 10%, 20% and 25% with three different clayey soil that were used as subgrade soil. The results of the tests indicate that powdered glass, sea water and clayey soils are very compatible to react with each other and additives improve geotechnical properties of clayey soils in a way so that it decreases plasticity index and increases workability of clayey soils. In addition, the additives increase California bearing ratio and unconfined compressive strength of clayey soils up to ten times depending on usage rates. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Lime; Powdered glass; Sea water; Soil stabilization","Additives; Blending; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Conservation; Digital storage; Glass; Lime; Seawater; Soils; California bearing ratio; Construction and demolition; Embankment construction; Geotechnical properties; Moisture density; Plasticity indices; Stabilizing additives; Unconfined compressive strength; Soil testing; carbon footprint; clay soil; compressive strength; demolition; embankment; pavement; seawater; soil stabilization; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091285515

However, the potential to secure or increase forest ecosystem services, while securing the habitat requirements of taxa remains unclear, especially within the context of uncertain climate and socio-economic developments. To tease out the associated trade-offs and synergies, we used 10 case study landscapes within nine countries throughout Europe. Starting with the current status of the forests in the case study landscapes, we simulated forest development 100 years into the future. Simulations were embedded in three combined climate and socio-economic frame scenarios based on global and European policies which varied in their climate change mitigation efficiency. Scenarios were translated into country specific projections of climate variables, and resultant demands for wood products. Forest management regimes were projected to vary in response to these scenarios at local scales. The specific combinations of alternative forest management practices were based on parallel research and input from local forest stakeholders. For each case study, a specific forest growth simulator was used. In general, the climate scenarios applied did not cause fundamentally different ecosystem service outputs at the case study level. Our results revealed almost no reduction in outcomes for biodiversity indicators with an increase in wood production, and in some cases synergistic results occurred when diversity was actively promoted as part of the management concept. Net carbon uptake was not strongly correlated with biodiversity, indicating that biodiversity-friendly forest management doesn't need to curtail carbon sequestration. Notably, we obtained heterogeneous results for the relation between sustainable wood production and net carbon uptake. Most scenarios resulted in a more or less reduced net carbon uptake over the long term, often due to stand age class distribution shifts. Levels of sustainable wood production varied widely during the simulation period, from significant increases (Sweden, Lithuania) to minor changes (Slovakia, Turkey) and slight decreases (Ireland, Netherlands). We place our results within the larger context of European forest policy and the challenges of simulating and contrasting forest biodiversity and the ecosystem services that societies depend on. © Copyright © 2020 Biber, Felton, Nieuwenhuis, Lindbladh, Black, Bahýl', Bingöl, Borges, Botequim, Brukas, Bugalho, Corradini, Eriksson, Forsell, Hengeveld, Hoogstra-Klein, Kadıoǧulları, Karahalil, Lodin, Lundholm, Makrickienė, Masiero, Mozgeris, Pivoriūnas, Poschenrieder, Pretzsch, Sedmák and Tuček.","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; ecosystem services; Europe; forest management; simulation; sustainability; wood production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094669827

However, the traditional direct distribution mode has high carbon emissions, an uncertain delivery time, and a low delivery efficiency. Uncoordinated resource allocations and unreasonable network layouts of terminal distributions have shackled green development within the express delivery industry. Considering the trend of green logistics, this study innovatively proposes a comprehensive and environmentally friendly mode for city distribution based on end crowdsourcing service stations (ECSSs). This study also adopts node centrality indices of complex network theory to evaluate the node importance of existing terminal distribution outlets. The comprehensive weights of the indices are obtained via the three-scale AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and TOPSIS (Technology for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) methods to identify the candidate nodes for ECSSs. Finally, a location model is built to determine the optimal location to establish the ECSSs. A real-world case study was conducted to provide the location scheme of ECSSs in Beijing, China. Environmental benefits as well as economic and social benefits can be substantially achieved through the implementation of the new mode. The results show that carbon emissions can be reduced by 23.79–28.49% for the end of the distribution, 16.27–16.35% for the front-end, and approximately 17% for the entire distribution. Additionally, the loading rate of vans for the front-end of the distribution can be improved by 15.77%. © 2020 by the authors.

They are especially important due to their superior light focusing ability, from free-space wavelengths to the sub-wavelength range. Although noble metal plasmonic enhancement has been recognized as one of the most important strategies in photocatalysis, the high cost and limited spectral range absorption of noble metals remain the biggest challenges for their practical application, which has led to a gradual shift in the focus on the abundant and less expensive non-noble metal plasmonics. Recently, various non-noble plasmonic materials such as non-noble metals (Cu, Al, Ni and Bi), metal oxides and chalcogenides (WO3-x, MoO3-x, NiO, MNbO3, where M = Ca, Sr or Ba; Fe2O3, SrTiO3, In2O3, Cu2-xS and Bi2Se3), nitrides (TiN, ZrN, HfN and WN) have emerged as efficient photocatalysts.

Addressing climate change is the most important public priority of the 21st Century. Unlike many issues, however, this issue is being driven by both science and its interface with politics. The main institution for bridging this division between science and international politics is the IPCC. As such it is the main source of the facts from which climate change policy is developed. This book describes the ways in which the IPCC arrives at these facts and so can be sure they are complete and evidence based. Seldom in history has science had such a direct relationship with politics. The negotiation of an international policy regime requires, at its outset, an agreement on the facts. In this case, the facts are scientific, complex and contentious. Governments have recognized this and have, by using the IPCC, set up institutional machinery to provide facts from a source and in a manner that they can accept. The way in which the IPCC functions is unique in that it melds the way in which science achieves consensus with the way governments do at the international level. Starting with a process to examine, review and debate scientific findings leading to a consensus about scientific fact, usually expressed as probabilities that the findings will hold over time, the IPCC then concludes by using the kind of consensus-development mechanism that the United Nations typically uses to achieve agreements leading to the formation of policy regimes. The book examines the structure of the IPCC, its composition and its procedures in order to achieve an understanding of its role and future. This book addresses how climate change science was developed; how climate change impacts have been analyzed by various scholars, agencies, and other stakeholders; what roles international, nongovernmental and governmental organizations play in addressing climate change issues. The book incorporates climate change deniers' arguments and counter arguments. It also does not shy away from some problematic results (for example the immature data interpretation of IPCC, particularly in its 2007 report). Finally, the book also presents a case study of climate change impacts, including air, water and soil pollution, in major South Asian cities. © 2020 River Publishers.

However, there is limited recognition of how land use impacts benthic assemblages, their bioturbation potential, and OC burial in mangrove forests and tidal flats. Here we evaluated the effects of mangrove deforestation on benthic bioturbation potential (BPc), sediment accretion rates (SARs), and OC and total nitrogen (TN) burial in mangrove soils and tidal flat sediments from three estuaries in tropical Brazil. SARs based on 210Pb dating varied significantly among undisturbed estuaries (2.1–18.6 mm yr−1) and the OC and TN burial rates were respectively 46% and 16% higher than global averages. The cleared mangrove sites had a twofold lower SAR, 40-fold lower OC burial, and over 100-fold lower TN burial when compared to undisturbed forests, revealing the pervasive impacts of land use. Variation in benthic assemblage structure and BPc among sites suggests that the composition and activity of macrofaunal communities may facilitate OC burial in some cases, yet the global extent and significance of bioturbation requires further study. Our work reveals a strong spatial variability in C burial in undisturbed mangrove forests and a decreased capacity of mangroves to accumulate C and sediments due to land use effects. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the evaluation of proposals to minimise or treat food waste, such as through separate disposal streams, is difficult because those impacts are not registered through normal market price signals. This paper presents non-market valuations for a hypothetical kerbside DFW collection service from a survey of households in two local government areas in the Central Queensland region, Australia. Choice modelling (CM) and contingent valuation methods (CVM) were employed to elicit potential participation and estimate willingness to pay (WTP) of the community for a domestic food waste collection service. Latent class analysis results for the sub-groups supporting an improvement option revealed that cost, odour and fortnightly collection frequency limit both WTP for and participation in the potential kerbside collection program. While there was support because it would extend the lifespans of the local landfills, potential reduction of methane emissions was not a strong driver. No difference in support or willingness to pay could be identified between the two local government populations.

However, the actual energy saving from retrofit projects often falls short of expectations. One of the main reasons for this is occupant behaviour being addressed inadequately in energy models. Large variations in occupant behaviour may not have been considered (or are averaged) when making predictions of retrofit savings, and occupants may exploit energy efficiency to improve their comfort by increasing the use of heating and appliances. Unfortunately, Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), as one of the main platforms to provide retrofit advice in the UK, use the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) with standard behavioural input to generate retrofit recommendations. This research has developed a modelling approach incorporating household archetypes to improve the reliability of retrofit advice and offer more targeted retrofit strategies that consider occupants’ behavioural variations. It developed five household archetypes using statistical analyses of data obtained from a questionnaire survey. It showed that retrofit effectiveness vary significantly, distinguished by the use of household archetypes. It also illustrated that using household archetypes can yield higher savings compared with the conventional method in EPCs at urban level. The results suggested that energy retrofits on an urban scale using such tailored approach with household archetypes could save a further 20% of the annual energy costs and reduces the payback by typically 2 years. This research demonstrates that using a modelling approach with household archetypes for energy retrofit design can significantly improve overall saving potential while maintaining occupant comfort. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building performance modelling; Energy retrofit; Energy saving; Household archetypes; Retrofit recommendation","Energy efficiency; Heating; Surveys; Annual energy costs; Assessment procedure; Conventional methods; Energy performance; Occupant behaviour; Occupant comforts; Questionnaire surveys; Retrofit strategies; Retrofitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086887314

A farmer's decision-making is associated with their knowledge of beneficial insects and pests. This study aimed to assess local knowledge of entomofauna in relation to associated management practices, within a context of socio-cultural and environmental change. The research was carried out in Santa Lucía, a small mestizo village located in the deforestation frontier of the Peruvian Amazon. Mestizos are migrants, or descendants of migrants, from non-Amazonian regions of Peru. First, freelistings were conducted with a group of 19 female and 25 male farmers to evaluate their theoretical knowledge of insects, and to select the most salient insects associated with cassava, maize, and plantain. Second, two focus groups (which separated women and men) evaluated the practical knowledge of management practices for the most salient insects in the context of climate change. The most salient insects were collected and identified to the minimum possible taxonomic level. The results showed that farmers have a negative perception of entomofauna associated with cassava, maize, and plantain, as they considered insects to be harmful to their staple crops. Most farmers are not aware of the importance of beneficial insects such as pollinators and natural enemies. The findings of the study further showed that mestizo farmers did not have any management practices to preserve beneficial entomofauna, half of the insects they regarded as pests did not present any associated management practices, and the other half applied both sustainable (preventive and curative) and unsustainable practices (e.g., use of pesticides). The paper further discusses the dynamics of mestizo local knowledge on entomofauna in a changing environment and concludes that local capacities should be built to enrich knowledge about the recognition, biology, and ecological role of entomofauna (e.g., pollination, natural predation), and associated management practices (e.g., agroecological preventive practices that decrease pest incidence and protect pollinators, instead of curative practices) as an adaptation strategy to climate change. © Copyright © 2020 Beltrán-Tolosa, Cruz-Garcia, Solis and Quintero.","agroecological practices; beneficial insects; climate change; local knowledge; pests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094962787

The present study aims to assess the changes in air quality before and during lockdown in the four major metropolitan cities of India viz., Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. The data on major air quality parameters and meteorological parameters was collected for 15 days before lockdown (i.e., March 10th–March 24th, 2020) and 15 days after implementation of lockdown (25th March–April 8th, 2020). The lockdown measures reflected a significant reduction in air pollutants, most significant fall was estimated for NO2 (29.3–74.4%) while the least reduction was noticed for SO2. On the contrary, levels of ground level ozone were found to be increased (except in Mumbai), could be related to the lower utilization of O3 owing to decrease of NOx in the environment. Since, the lockdown period has been extended, therefore further reduction of most pollutants is expected. Among the various metrological parameters, significant increase in diurnal temperature was observed at Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai, however relative humidity has changed significantly only in Mumbai. In the absence of any major violent meteorological phenomena in India during recent months the significant difference in air quality parameters could be majorly attributed to the effect of lockdown measures. However, the regional differences may be because of the local emission of pollutants and the prevailing effects of secondary pollutants. These observations highlight the contribution of anthropogenic sources in air pollution, therefore, sustainable polices for mitigation of air pollution are essential in India. © The Author(s).","Air Pollution; Air Quality; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; Metropolitan cities","Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality parameters; Anthropogenic sources; Diurnal temperatures; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological phenomena; Metrological parameters; Metropolitan cities; Regional differences; Air quality; air quality; anthropogenic source; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; metropolitan area; parameter estimation; pollution policy; Chennai; Delhi; India; Kolkata; Maharashtra; Mumbai; Tamil Nadu; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091286948

Research to better understand the impacts of, and response to, climate shocks is critical to improve the resilience and well-being of affected people and places. This paper builds on the findings of a focus collection on this topic to provide a concluding and forward-looking perspective on the future of social-ecological research on climate resilience. Drawing on an expert workshop to identify research gaps, we distinguish 20 priorities for future research on climate resilience. These span four key themes: Systems and Scales, Governance and Knowledge, Climate Resilience and Development, and Sectoral Concerns. Given the need and urgency for evidence-based policies to address the climate crisis, the analysis considers the importance of understanding how findings on social-ecological resilience are used in policy, rather than solely focusing on how it is generated. Many of the priorities emphasise the governance systems within which climate research is produced, understood and used. We further reflect on the state of current evidence generation processes, emphasising that the involvement of a wider range of voices in the design, implementation and dissemination of climate resilience research is critical to developing the efficient and fair interventions it is meant to support. © 2020 The Author(s).

These retrofit targets also recommend switching from oil boilers to electrical heat pumps. One area-based approach to retrofit is neighbourhood scale. Ideally with local community participation, neighbourhood retrofit improves a group of structurally similar homes, of the same archetype. Defined home archetypes already exist for 20 European countries thanks to previous research. That same research attempted steady-state calculations of space heating energy using the ISO 13790 Seasonal Method. Those calculations diverged from measured energy use by a large gap. Taking example home archetypes from Ireland, this study narrowed this energy-use gap by incorporating realistic parameters and schedules. Physical white-box models were constructed in DesignBuilder, and simulated by EnergyPlus with local weather data. The simulations combined realistic heating schedules, internal gains, infiltration and ventilation; converging simulation energy use with typical measurements and mostly achieved model calibration indices. Therefore, the resultant energy-use data was capable of tuning future grey-box models to investigate home energy use across ranges of heating patterns and heating setpoints. The aims of this study are threefold. First, devise a repeatable method to produce heat energy-use values by simulating white-box models of home archetypes, that enable tuning of future grey-box models. Second, specify the heating variables that result in acceptable energy-use gaps between simulation of home archetype models and their typical measurements. Third, test if the retrofits of three Irish home archetypes under a typical occupant schedule, achieve national climate action targets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy simulation; Climate action plan; DesignBuilder; EnergyPlus; Heat pump; Home energy retrofit; Primary energy saving; TABULA","Heating; Retrofitting; Tuning; Electrical heat pumps; Energy retrofit; European Countries; Grey-box models; Local community; Model calibration; Steady state calculations; White-box models; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087883931

It is regularly proposed as one of the main uses for REDD+ projects (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, few studies have characterized the cocoa agroforestry systems in this country. Hence, this research proposes to determine the impact of distance from Kisangani (the unique city in the landscape) and land-use intensity on the floristic composition of cocoa agroforests in Bengamisa-Yangambi forest landscape in the Congo Basin. The results revealed that species diversity and density of plants associated with cocoa are influenced by the distance from Kisangani (the main city in the landscape and province). Farmers maintain/introduce trees that play one or more of several roles. They may host caterpillars, provide food, medicine, or timber, or deliver other functions such as providing shade to the cocoa tree. Farmers maintain plants with edible products (mainly oil palms) in their agroforests more than other plants. Thus, these agroforests play key roles in conserving the floristic diversity of degraded areas. As cocoa agroforestry has greater potential for production, biodiversity conservation, and environmental protection, it should be used to slow down or even stop deforestation and forest degradation. © 2020 by the authors.

Scientific research in the 21st century has considerably improved our knowledge of soil organic matter and its dynamics, particularly under the pressure of the global disruption of the carbon cycle. This paper reviews the processes that control C dynamics in soil, the representation of these processes over time, and their dependence on variations in major biotic and abiotic factors. The most recent advanced knowledge gained on soil organic matter includes the following. (1) Most organic matter is composed of small molecules, derived from living organisms, without transformation via additional abiotic organic polymerization; (2) microbial compounds are predominant in the long term; (3) primary belowground production contributes more to organic matter than aboveground inputs; (4) the contribution of less biodegradable compounds to soil organic matter is low in the long term; (5) two major factors determine the soil organic carbon production ""yield"" from the initial substrates: the yield of carbon used by microorganisms and the association with minerals, particularly poorly crystalline minerals, which stabilize microbial compounds; (6) interactions between plants and microorganisms also regulate the carbon turnover time and therefore carbon stocks; (7) among abiotic and biotic factors that regulate the carbon turnover time, only a few are considered in current modeling approaches (i.e., temperature, soil water content, pH, particle size, and sometimes C and N interactions); and (8) although most models of soil C dynamics assume that the processes involved are linear, there are now many indications of nonlinear soil C dynamics processes linked to soil OM dynamics (e.g., priming). Farming practices, therefore, affect soil C stocks not only through carbon inputs but also via their effect on microbial and organomineral interactions, yet it has still not been possible to properly identify the main mechanisms involved in C loss (or gain). Greater insight into these mechanisms and their interdependencies, hierarchy and sensitivity to agricultural practices could provide future levers of action for C sequestration in soil. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

Oil-contaminated sites could nonetheless be used for agricultural purposes in arid regions provided they are managed appropriately. The present study introduces the successful application of a novel nitrogen-fixing, aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial isolate for the bioremediation of agricultural soils contaminated by oily wastewater. The isolate was recovered from uncontaminated soil and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia-SR1 (MH634684). It successfully utilized various aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene as its sole carbon source and presented with plant growth promoting (PGP) properties such as indoleacetic acid and ammonia production and phosphate solubilization. The efficacy of this novel S. maltophilia-SR1-N2 fixing bacterial isolate at reducing aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity of oily wastewater was validated by its ability to promote the growth of canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivated in soils contaminated with oily wastewater. Inoculating S. maltophilia-SR1 on canola growing in soil amended with different concentrations of oily wastewater significantly increased chlorophyll content and soluble carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids compared with uninoculated plants. Oily wastewater contamination induced the accumulation of high levels of hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide and caused plasma membrane degradation in uninoculated canola plants. In contrast, the presence of S. maltophilia-SR1 in soil contaminated with various oily wastewater concentrations upregulated nitrate, total nitrogen, nitrate reductase, and nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants in the plants.

However, some local regulations have forbidden antifreeze additives (even non-toxic ones) to avoid groundwater pollution in case of pipe leakage. This paper presents a techno-economic and environmental analysis of four different fluids: propylene glycol at 25% and 33% weight concentrations, calcium chloride at 20% weight concentration (CaCl2 20%), and pure water. Thermal loads from 36 case studies in six different climate zones are used to perform BHE sizing and compare the abovementioned fluids from the economic, operational, and environmental points of view. The economic analysis and the carbon footprint assessment are performed on a life cycle of 25 years considering the installation (BHE drilling, fluid) and operation (heat pump and ground-side circulation pump energy demand, fluid replacement) of the simulated GSHPs. Results highlight that using pure water as a heat carrier fluid is convenient for cooling-dominated buildings but, for heating-dominated buildings, this choice leads to a noticeable increase of the BHE needed length which is not compensated by the lower operational costs. On the other hand, avoiding the use of antifreeze additives generally leads to a reduction of the lifetime carbon footprint, with a few exceptions in very cold climates. CaCl2 20% proves to be a good choice in most cases, both from the economic and the environmental points of view, as it allows a strong reduction of the installed BHE length in cold climates with a low additional cost and carbon footprint. © 2020 by the authors.

Under other scenarios, drier soil conditions may lead to a reduction in biodegradation of trace organics in vadose zone soil. © 2020 Elsevier LtdClimate change will impact soil properties such as soil moisture, organic carbon and temperature and changes in these properties will influence the sorption, biodegradation and leaching of trace organic contaminants to groundwater. In this study, we conducted a modeling case study to evaluate atrazine and estrone transport in the subsurface under current and future climate conditions at a field site in central Nebraska. According to the modeling results, in the future, enhanced evapotranspiration and increased average air temperature may cause drier soil conditions, which consequently reduces the biodegradation of atrazine and estrone in the water phase. On the other hand, greater transpiration rates lead to greater root solute uptake which may decrease the concentration of atrazine and estrone in the soil profile. Another consequence of future climate is that the infiltration and leaching rates for both atrazine and estrone may be lower under future climate scenarios. Reduced infiltration of trace organic compounds may indicate that lower trace organic concentrations in groundwater may occur under future climate scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural production; Climate change; Groundwater; Subsurface transport; Trace organics","Agriculture; Biodegradation; Contamination; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Herbicides; Infiltration; Leaching; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Soil pollution; Agricultural productions; Average air temperature; Climate change impact; Future climate scenarios; Subsurface transport; Trace organic compounds; Trace organic contaminants; Transpiration rates; Climate change; atrazine; estrone; estrone; agricultural production; atrazine; biodegradation; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); flow modeling; groundwater; infiltration; leaching; vadose zone; agricultural land; agriculture; air temperature; Article; biodegradation; case study; cattle manure; climate change; controlled study; evapotranspiration; irrigation (agriculture); leaching; maize; Nebraska; pollution transport; soil moisture; water transport; agriculture; climate change; Nebraska; United States; Zea mays; Agriculture; Atrazine; Climate Change; Estrone; Nebraska",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086853148

On the other hand, the suction of unsaturated soils in the field, especially as part of long-term measurements, is documented very rarely and references on the subject are very few and for very few places around the world. The scarceness of this kind of measurements denies researchers perception of the anticipated suction and its possible loss or retention as a result of climatic conditions, especially in countries with warm temperate climate. Suction measurements from temporary and permanent stations in Greece and Cyprus are presented in the paper. From these -admittedly few-measurements until today, the large magnitude of suction that may occur both during summer and winter is presented, along with the possibility of long periods of these suctions being maintained. Another consequence is the range of suction values that sensors should be able to measure in regions of similar climatic conditions in order to cover the range of expected values as obtained from the measurements available so far. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2020.",,"Soils; Climatic conditions; Continuous updates; Degree of saturations; Geotechnical investigations; Long-term measurements; Suction measurements; Temperate climate; Unsaturated soil; Soil surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097156669

The steric repulsions of bulky cyclohexyl substituents prevent additional ligand coordination to the silver atoms in 1. Compounds obtained feature the bimetallic eight-member cyclic core [AgPCP]2. The intramolecular argenthophilic interaction (d(Ag···Ag) = 2.981 Å) was observed in complex 1. In contrast, the coordination of pyrazole led to the elongation of Ag···Ag distance to 3.218(1) Å in 2a and 3.520 Å in 2b. Complexes 1 and 2a possess phosphorescence both in the solution and solid state. Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations demonstrate the origin of their different emission profile. In the case of 1, upon excitation, the electron leaves the Ag–P bonding orbital and locates on the intramolecular Ag···Ag bond (metal-centered character). Complex 2a at room temperature exhibits a phosphorescence originating from the3(M + LP+N)LPhCT state. At 77 K, the photoluminescence spectrum of complex 2a shows two bands of two different characters:3(M + LP+N)LPhCT and3LCPh transitions.

However, the difficulty of effectively drying sorghum in some regions means that it may require different handling than previously studied grassy feedstocks. This study compares the delivered cost and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of field drying and baling, module storage (wrapped, densely packed biomass), pelletizing, and ensiling. Ensiling has not been widely considered for use in bioenergy production. For farms within 66 km of the biorefinery, ensiled biomass is of the lowest cost and GHG strategy despite additional cost and energy demand for hauling wet biomass. Field drying and baling, if feasible, is the most cost-effective option for sorghum between 66 km and 104 km, beyond which pellets are preferable. A 2000 bone-dry-metric ton (bdt)/day biorefinery can source sorghum with 18 bdt/ha yield cultivated on 5% of surrounding land at costs ranging from $122 (silage) to $167 (pellets)/bdt and a life-cycle GHG footprint of 111 (silage) to 179 kg CO2e/bdt (pellets). With 28 bdt/ha biomass yield, 10% cultivation of surrounding land, and low fertilizer application, costs can range from $66 (silage) to $85 (pellets)/ bdt and GHG footprint of 43 (silage) to 96 kg CO2e (pellets)/bdt. © 2020 American Chemical Society","Bioenergy; Biomass; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life-cycle assessment; Silage; Sorghum; Technoeconomic analysis","Agronomy; Artificial life; Biofuels; Biomass; Cost effectiveness; Drying; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Pelletizing; Refining; Additional costs; Bioenergy productions; Biofuel production; Bone dry metric tons; Drought tolerances; Energy demands; Fertilizer applications; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096513650

South America is one of largest contributors to BB emissions globally. After Amazonia, BB emissions from open and agricultural fires of Northern South America (NSA) are the most significant. Recent evidence shows a strong correlation between fire counts in NSA and Brown Carbon in some Colombian cities, suggesting a substantial seasonal contribution of regional BB sources to air pollution levels in the densely populated areas of NSA. In this work we use the atmospheric regional chemical transport model WRF-Chem to assess the contribution of open BB events to pollutant concentration and to estimate potential health impacts associated with wildfire events in NSA. Three nested domains are used to simulate atmospheric composition in the Northern part of South America and the Caribbean. Simulations included biogenic and anthropogenic emissions from a global emission inventory merged with local emissions for the city of Bogotá. Two modelling scenarios were considered, a base case without BB emissions (NO_FIRE) and a sensitivity scenario with BB emissions. Simulations were carried out for periods of strong BB activity in NSA. In the NO_FIRE scenario, aerosol concentrations are unrealistically low. When BB emissions are is included background PM2.5 concentrations increase 80%. The increment in aerosol concentrations is mainly driven by Secondary Organic Aerosols. In the case of Bogotá, the most densely populated city in the domain, monthly mean increase in PM2.5 is 3.3 μg m−3 and 4.3 ppb for O3. Modeled meteorological and air pollution fields are in better agreement with observations when high spatial resolution (3 × 3 km) is used in the simulations. The total estimated short-term all-cause mortality associated to BB during February in the region is 171 cases, 88 PM2.5-related and 83 O3-related mortality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Biomass burning aerosol; Biomass burning emissions; Health impacts; Regional atmospheric transport; Secondary organic aerosols","Aerosols; Agricultural robots; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Budget control; Health; Particulate emissions; Aerosol concentration; Anthropogenic emissions; Chemical transport models; High spatial resolution; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Regional chemical transport model; Secondary organic aerosols; Atmospheric movements; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; brown carbon; concentration (composition); correlation; emission; health impact; pollutant source; wildfire; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; all cause mortality; Article; atmosphere; biomass; burn; Caribbean; chemical composition; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); health impact assessment; meteorology; particulate matter; plume; pollution transport; population density; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; South America; topography; urban area; wildfire; biomass; Brazil; city; environmental monitoring; human; North America; Colombia; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; Brazil; Caribbean Region; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; North America; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086635645

A strong relationship exists between the composition, the metallographic structure, and the mechanical properties of metals. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is one of the techniques that can be used in situ to access the carbon content of samples. This paper presents a thorough investigation of the influence of key experimental parameters on the analytical implementation of LIBS, proposes a suitable protocol for carbon quantification, and discusses its limitations. We demonstrate that the global carbon concentration can be obtained with the help of a large laser spot, but this is not sufficient to separate all steel phases. To overcome this problem of spatial distribution and to achieve quantitative measurements, a smaller laser spot has been used and a specific analytical procedure has been developed. As a result, a smaller spot is needed for detecting the different steel phases and to show the metallographic structure. On a macro-scale, a preliminary sampling can be performed with a larger laser spot on the objects in situ in order to locate the high carbon content, such as cementite (Fe3C), for further analysis. On a micro-scale, the different phases of steel and their distribution in the object should be precisely and locally determined with a smaller laser spot, even on nonequilibrium structures. This opens up prospects for researchers to quantify the presence of different phases within the steel matrix and correlate such findings with the technological background behind steel making in historical times. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Archaeological ferrous metals; Carbon content; Heritage science; Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) implementation; Quantitative analysis; Steel phase characterization","Atomic emission spectroscopy; Carbides; Metallography; Metals; Steelmaking; Analytical procedure; Carbon concentrations; Experimental parameters; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Metallographic structure; Nonequilibrium structures; Quantitative measurement; Temporal information; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090038471

This study evaluated SOC from three USDA soil databases for Maine, a state that is nearly 90% forested. These databases were: (1) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), (2) NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO), and (3) Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA). We compared estimates of SOC density and concentration among databases and analyzed relationships between key soil properties and SOC densities and concentrations. Estimates of SOC density to a 20 cm depth which allows comparison among all three databases were 77 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1, 95 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1, and 39 ± 2.2 Mg ha−1 for SSURGO, RaCA, and FIA, respectively. Significant differences existed among databases in SOC density at shallow depth increments, and marked differences existed among databases in the soil depths measured. Analysis of the influence of soil texture and drainage class on SOC highlighted the importance of silt and clay in SOC retention. A hypothetical increase in forest and agricultural SOC was compared to reported Maine GHG emissions to illustrate potential policy implications in the use of soil databases. We conclude that all three databases are valuable but not interchangeable. The database should be carefully chosen to match the objectives of the user. © 2020 The Authors.

Although the disaster-specific and the generic adaptation measures have been largely researched, there are limited empirical studies, particularly those that conducted an analysis at the sub-national level and used a dataset of more than 50 years. Considering human development and different loss and damage indicators is another advantage. Employing zero-inflated negative binomial and fixed effects models, this study produces three major findings. First, an increasing trend is observed for the reported loss and damage indicators across the states. Second, both human development and income are mostly found as statistically insignificant, indicating that the states are not becoming flood-resilient with respect to the present development. Third, there is a lack of evidence of learning effect, however, disaster risk management programme mitigates risk. Therefore, the paper suggests that the ongoing development strategies must take into account climate risk and address the persistent adaptation deficit. These findings could have larger policy implications since Indian states are likely to encounter such events frequently, and they also provide inputs to several states’ action plans on climate change. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Floods; Human development; Income; Indian states; Loss and damage; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094953278

It can be defined as an opening covered with wooden lattice for ventilation, daylight, privacy, and an aesthetic appeal for houses. The motivation for this work stems from the lack of existing field studies on the ventilation and thermal performance of buildings incorporated with Mashrabiya and the potential to enhance its capabilities by combining it with different passive cooling techniques. The present study aims to investigate the influence of Mashrabiya on the indoor environment in a traditional building situated in a hot climate. The case study selected for this work is the Baeshen House which is located in the heart of historic Jeddah and the area with the most traditional Mashrabiyas in Saudi Arabia. The field data of air temperature, relative humidity, globe temperature, and air velocity were collected for two similar rooms (one open Mashrabiya and one close) in the building during typical hot summer conditions when the outdoor temperature ranged between 40 and 41.6 °C in the afternoon. Different techniques of passive/evaporative cooling strategy were integrated with the Mashrabiya: thermal mass, water pots, water spray, and cloth. The results showed that the closed Mashrabiya contributed to reducing the flow of hot air into rooms during the afternoon, and the indoor temperature was maintained at 35.4–35.8 °C. Increasing the speed of airflow into the room by opening the Mashrabiya had a minimal effect during the afternoon, but it was observed that the night cooling improved. It was found that the most effective strategy was the use of wetted cloth near the inlet of the Mashrabiya (33.8 °C indoor average when the outdoor temperature was at 41.6 °C). The study demonstrated that comfortable conditions could be attained between 1 and 9 a.m. during hot summer conditions. Overall, the Mashrabiya with evaporative cooling was not able to provide comfort during the midday, and other strategies should be considered for hot summer conditions. Future work will focus on investigating different materials and strategies to enhance the performance of Mashrabiyas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Comfort; Field measurements; Hot climate; Indoor thermal environment; Jeddah; Mashrabiya; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Saudi Arabia; Thermal performance","Atmospheric temperature; Clothes; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Space heating; Evaporative cooling; Evaporative cooling techniques; Indoor environment; Islamic architectures; Outdoor temperature; Passive cooling techniques; Thermal performance of buildings; Traditional buildings; Air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088888513

Closer integration between heating/cooling and electricity systems can provide additional flexibility required to support the integration of variable renewables and other low-carbon energy sources. This paper proposes a framework for identifying cost-efficient solutions for supplying district heating systems within both operation and investment timescales, while considering local and national-level interactions between heat and electricity infrastructures. The proposed optimisation model minimises the levelised cost of a portfolio of heating technologies, and in particular Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and polygeneration systems, centralised heat pumps (HPs), centralised boilers and thermal energy storage (TES). A number of illustrative case studies are presented, quantifying the impact of renewable penetration, electricity price volatility, local grid constraints and local emission targets on optimal planning and operation of heat production assets. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the cost-optimal TES capacity could increase by 41–134% in order to manage a constraint in the local electricity grid, while in systems with higher RES penetration reflected in higher electricity price volatility it may be optimal to increase the TES capacity by 50–66% compared to constant prices, allowing centralised electric HP technologies to divert excess electricity produced by intermittent renewable generators to the heating sector. This confirms the importance of reflecting the whole-system value of heating technologies in the underlying cost-benefit analysis of heat networks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Combined heat and power; District heating; Heat pumps; Polygeneration; System integration; Thermal energy storage","Carbon; Climate change; Costs; District heating; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Heat storage; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; Additional flexibilities; Combined heat and power; District heating system; Electricity price volatilities; Heat and electricity; Low-carbon energy systems; Polygeneration system; Renewable generators; Cost benefit analysis; climate change; combined heat and power; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; energy storage; optimization; sensitivity analysis; timescale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088103686

The energy source for cold storage is supplied by the photovoltaic power plant and battery system and electric supply of local utility. Its simple construction makes it unique from the conventional cold storages. A comparison analysis is also done between proposed and conventional cold storage in terms of efficiency, capital and running cost of the system and their accessibility. The results show that the proposed system is efficient, easy to access and can be installed at low cost. As the proposed cold storage consists of photovoltaic panel and battery bank system which decreases the running cost of the cold storage and makes is suitable for the rural site where the grid is not available or available for few hours.

This study evaluated temporal and spatial variations of four major air pollutant concentrations across Malaysia before (March 4, 2020–March 17, 2020) and during the implementation of different phases of Movement Control Order (MCO) (March 18, 2020–May 12, 2020) from 65 official regulatory air quality stations. Results showed that restriction in daily and economic activities has remarkably reduced the air quality in all sub-urban, urban, and industrial settings with relatively small contributions from meteorological conditions. Overall, compared to before MCO, average concentrations of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 reduced by 23.1%, 21.74%, and 54.0%, respectively, while that of SO2 was constant. The highest reduction of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were observed in stations located in urban setting, where 63% stations showed significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) for PM2.5 and CO, while all stations showed significant reduction in NO2 concentrations. It was also revealed that 70.5% stations recorded lower concentrations of PM2.5 during MCO compared to before MCO, despite that high numbers of local hotspots were observed simultaneously from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Spatial analysis showed that the northern part of Peninsular had the highest significant reduction of PM2.5, while the highest of NO2 and CO reduction were found in stations located in the central region. All pollutants exhibit similar diurnal trends when compared between pre-and during MCO although significant lower readings were observed during MCO.

Apart from their substitution by other compounds with lower environmental impact, one of the plausible approaches to meet the legal requirements is the formulation of new refrigerant blends containing a low GWP compound (e.g., hydrofluoroolefins) mixed with one HFC that provides the necessary thermodynamic characteristics to act as an effective refrigerant. Thus, the recovery and reuse of HFCs seems a promising approach to increase their lifespan and reduce their production. However, current regeneration technologies that are based on distillation are highly energy-intensive. Therefore, the development of novel separation processes to selectively separate HFCs is needed for the practical implementation of circular economy principles in the use of refrigerants. This work is a step forward on using ionic liquids (ILs) to selectively separate F-gases. The advanced molecular-based soft-SAFT equation of state (EoS) is used as a tool to assess the potential of ILs as a solvent platform for the selective separation of the compounds forming the R410A refrigerant blend: R32 and R125. Soft-SAFT is employed to model the absorption of these HFCs into different ILs with different fluorinated anions. Ternary diagrams are then predicted for the absorption of R32/R125 mixtures into selected ILs to evaluate the competitive selectivity between both compounds. Based on this study, a potential ionic liquid candidate is chosen and a process simulation is performed to estimate the approximate energy cost of the separation and recovery process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and IIR","Ionic liquid; Process simulation; R410A; Selectivity; Soft-SAFT; Solubility","Distillation; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Equations of state; Global warming; Ionic liquids; Laws and legislation; Recovery; Refrigerants; Current regeneration; European regulation; Global warming potential; Legal requirements; Novel separation process; Process simulations; Selective separation; Thermodynamic characteristics; Fluorocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085578286

Resorting to a combination of approaches, namely, molecular dynamics to obtain the relaxed geometries and tight-binding calculations validated against ab initio modeling, we find that magic angle physics occur in collapsed carbon nanotubes. Velocity reduction, flat bands, and localization in AA regions with diminishing moiré angle are revealed, showing a magic angle close to 1°. From the spatial extension of the AA regions and the width of the flat bands, we estimate that many-body interactions in these systems are stronger than in twisted bilayer graphene. Chiral collapsed carbon nanotubes stand out as promising candidates to explore many-body effects and superconductivity in low dimensions, emerging as the one-dimensional analogues of twisted bilayer graphene.

However, policies are based on attributional life cycle assessments (LCAs) that do not account for market constraints and consider byproducts either available burden-free to the user (cutoff approach) or partially responsible for the emissions generated in the upstream processes (allocation). The goal of this study was to investigate whether these approaches (and incentives) could lead to a mismanagement of byproducts and to suboptimal solutions in terms of regional GHG emissions. The use of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) in Ontario was studied, and an optimization model to find the least GHG-intense way of using GGBS was developed. Results showed that producers should replace 30 to 40% of portland cement in high-strength concrete to minimize the regional GHG emissions associated with concrete. However, traditional LCA approaches do not suggest this solution and are estimated to lead to up to a 10% increase in concrete GHG emissions in Ontario. The substitution method, which assigns emissions or credits to byproducts based on emissions associated with the products they may displace, can yield decisions consistent with the regional emission optimization model. A revision of current policies is recommended to include market constraints. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Blast furnaces; Commerce; Gas emissions; Green manufacturing; High performance concrete; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Optimization; Portland cement; Slags; Constrained resources; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; High strength concretes; Industrial by-products; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Optimization modeling; Suboptimal solution; Substitution method; Greenhouse gases; cement; concrete; concrete; emission; greenhouse gas; optimization; slag; Article; carbon footprint; furnace; life cycle assessment; Ontario; slag; building material; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Construction Materials; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093892576

Energy and emission parameters such as specific energy consumption (SEC), emission factors (EFs) of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC) were used to compare four different types of cookstoves. These included top-feed forced draft (TF-FD), top-feed natural draft (TF-ND), front-feed natural draft (FF-ND) and front-feed traditional (FF-TR) cookstoves. Controlled cooking test (CCT) was used as the test protocol. The results showed the performance of improved cookstove technologies can vary based on the fuel used for cooking. It was observed that emission factors for PM and CO increased by 67–96% and 45–90% respectively when all three improved cookstoves were tested with three fuel combinations against wood as cooking fuel. Among the tested cookstoves, a marked difference was observed between performance of forced draft and natural draft cookstoves. Forced draft cookstoves emitted higher amount of all pollutant emissions compared to natural draft cookstoves when used with mustard stalks in combination with either wood or cowdung. The results are of critical importance given that forced draft cookstoves have been promoted in geographical regions where fuel mix use is prevalent. Therefore, forced draft cookstove might not be the right choice when the goal is climate mitigation and reduction in impact on human health. It is imperative to study comprehensively the influence of various field variables on performance of cookstoves, which have severe implications on the performance of cookstoves. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BC/PM ratios; Controlled cooking test; Cookstove performance; Emission factors; Particulate emissions; Specific energy consumption","Carbon monoxide; Energy utilization; Geographical regions; Wood; Climate mitigations; Cooking technology; Emission factors; Energy and emissions; Field variables; Particulate Matter; Pollutant emission; Specific energy consumption; Fuels; black carbon; carbon monoxide; fuel; carbon monoxide; assessment method; black carbon; carbon monoxide; detection method; emission; equipment; geographical region; particulate matter; performance assessment; public health; rural area; Article; climate; combustion; comparative study; cooking; cookstove technology; cow; energy consumption; exhaust gas; food intake; household; human; India; mustard; particulate matter; plant stem; reference value; rural area; structured questionnaire; vegetable; wood; air pollutant; chemistry; cooking; indoor air pollution; procedures; soot; technology; India; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Cooking; Household Articles; India; Particulate Matter; Soot; Technology; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086121917

In this paper, pathways are developed towards achieving a 1.5° degree scenario for land-transport for four emerging economies (Brazil, India, Kenya and Vietnam). The aim is to highlight the key opportunities and challenges for low-carbon transport in countries with rapidly growing mobility demand. The main focus of this paper is to reconcile actual and required emission reduction targets and develop plausible pathways to achieve these targets. The paper also identifies potential strategies and measures for these countries to follow these pathways. The analysis considers the contributions of “avoid” (cutting travel growth), “shift” (to lower CO2 modes) and “improve” (vehicle and fuel CO2 characteristics) interventions to decarbonisation scenarios. These scenarios aim to inform renewed Nationally Determined Contributions and shed light on the feasibility of deep decarbonisation pathways that would be in line with the Paris Agreement. Results from this study show that achieving 1.5DS would require dramatic changes in travel patterns, technology and fuels, and major intensification of current policy approaches. Decarbonization solutions will need to include greater use and investment of efficient modes, major shifts toward near-zero carbon fuels such as clean electricity, systems integration, modal shift and urban planning solutions. Although the socio-economic situations and national transport systems differ between the selected countries, some fairly similar strategies appear likely to be core to the mitigation effort, such as rapid growth in light- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification and investments in public transit systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; GHG emissions; Low-carbon scenarios; Paris agreement; Transport sector","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decarbonization; Emission control; Fuels; Investments; Emission reduction targets; Global climate changes; Heavy duty vehicles; Low carbon transport; Public transit systems; Strategies and measures; Systems integration; Transportation strategies; Economics; comparative study; emission control; feasibility study; mobility; technological development; transportation development; transportation policy; travel behavior; travel demand; Brazil; India; Kenya; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090234050

Despite conspicuous signals of warming and ocean acidification in global marine sedimentary records, changes in upper ocean thermal stratification and productivity have been less comprehensively understood across the MECO. Here we examined stratigraphic records of the middle Eocene succession (43.1–38.6 Ma) at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1408 in the Northwest Atlantic, to provide a detailed local environmental reconstruction and to bring new insights on spatiotemporal evolution of coupled hydrography and productivity across the MECO based on global comparison. The present temperature–oxygen isotope calibration inferred at least ~3 °C warming in the upper ocean during the MECO at the study site. Whereas further inter-proxy calibration is required, the present estimation supports expanded meridional surface temperature gradient in both hemispheres during the late middle Eocene. Vertical gradients in planktic foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratios revealed that relatively mixed upper water column prevailed during and immediately (~150 kyr) before the MECO. The observed ~102 kyr-scale local shifts in hydrography was possibly driven by the ~2.4-myr eccentricity modulation in the development of seasonal thermocline, rather than greenhouse gas forcing. Planktic and benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates at Site U1408 decreased and increased during the MECO and adjacent cooling episodes, respectively. The relationships between carbonate productivity and local hydrography varied through time in the Northwest Atlantic. Instead, we suggest that marine carbonate productivity and ocean chemistry was controlled by multiple eccentricity-scale changes in weathering intensity and nutrient supply, widely across the major ocean basins. Hypothesized prevailing decline in productivity agrees with a possible warming mechanism of the MECO, although it is challenged by several existing micropaleontological records suggesting increased bio-silica production and eutrophication at varying oceanographic settings. Further integration of different types of proxies and quantitative assessments will help understand complex biotic changes during significant global carbon cycle perturbations in a greenhouse world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum; Northwest Atlantic; Planktic foraminifera (planktonic foraminifera); Site U1408","Calibration; Eutrophication; Greenhouse gases; Hydrology; Isotopes; Navigation; Oxygen; Productivity; Silica; Stratigraphy; Weathering; Eccentricity modulation; Environmental reconstruction; Greenhouse-gas forcing; Integrated ocean drilling programs; Oxygen isotope ratios; Quantitative assessments; Spatiotemporal evolution; Surface temperature gradient; Oceanography; carbon cycle; carbonate; climate change; Eocene; eutrophication; global perspective; hydrography; micropaleontology; ocean acidification; Ocean Drilling Program; oxygen isotope ratio; paleoceanography; upper ocean; water column; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087592645

Only on smaller scales can infrastructure be managed by private companies or through local collective initiatives. Within this framework of water cycle management, there is an increasing movement of the population towards cities where economic activity is concentrated. This scenario is particularly pronounced in certain regions of the world and makes it necessary to rethink whether decentralised treatment offers a way of ensuring the servicing of wastewater treatment in new urban developments, alleviating pressure on facilities that are at the limit of their capacity. In this study four systems were evaluated: two centralised and two decentralised configurations, from an environmental and economic perspective, posing as working hypothesis how different wastewater treatment schemes influence the carbon footprint of the population living in a neighbourhood. The analysis of the results identifies that the decentralised systems present a reduction in the carbon footprint of residents of around 20–23 % depending on the technology considered. In addition, reclaimed water can meet the water quality requirements for irrigation of the green areas in the neighbourhood. Although decentralised systems have higher construction costs, they can be amortised due to lower energy consumption, so the payback time is estimated to be 8–9 years, lower than that of centralised systems. Considering the problems associated with changing and replacing existing networks, decentralised wastewater treatment systems is especially recommended for new dwelling developments, based on its environmental and economic indicators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralised systems; Economic approach; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Resident carbon footprint; Water reuse",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086921343

More recently, the potential for using stormwater harvested from permeable pavements was recognised as a potential additional water resource. The objective of this study was to estimate the reduction of environmental impacts caused by traditional drainage systems and centralised water utilities if permeable pavement systems were used to harvest stormwater for nonpotable purposes in buildings. The lifecycle environmental impacts and costs associated with the proposed pavements and hydraulic systems were assessed. The city of Glasgow was chosen as a case study. We used the Netuno computer programme to estimate the potential for potable water savings considering the use of stormwater for nonpotable purposes and the SimaPro software to perform a lifecycle assessment (LCA). With the implementation of permeable pavements and stormwater utilisation, great reductions in lifecycle emissions (i.e., CO2-, SO2-, and PM2.5-equivalent emissions) were observed. The proposed system also proved to be economically feasible, i.e., a payback period equal to 16.9 years. The results show the economic and environmental feasibility of permeable pavements when used on a large scale, proving to be an important strategy to reduce water and environmental stresses caused by centralised water utilities and traditional drainage systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, little is known about factors which have driven regional air-conditioning (AC) energy consumption over time, since the literature is limited to cross-sectional studies that lack differentiation between climatic and non-climatic influences. Future projections for the EU's electricity sector may therefore neglect the potential implications of rapidly growing AC demand. We develop a novel decomposition framework, which breaks down residential space cooling energy consumption in EU-28 countries into the effect of different components from 2000 to 2015. Decomposition is extended to panel data models identifying specific drivers of space cooling's climate-sensitive components. Finally, we explore scenarios of residential AC energy consumption up to 2050 and evaluate their impact on summer time peak loads. AC diffusion was found to be the key driver of space cooling energy consumption, but this effect was partly counterbalanced by efficiency gains. While weather influences AC equipment ownership rate in EU-28 households, personal income has a larger marginal effect. In baseline scenarios, AC diffusion saturates by 2050, while modestly increasing sectoral final energy use. Still, our range of scenario values for space cooling energy consumption in 2050 exceed the majority of those originating from recently published projections. In a future renewables-driven electricity system, energy security risks may emerge from a scenario of fast AC up-take in new and renovated buildings, especially for colder European countries where modelled peak cooling electricity demand is shown to outgrow the projected expansion of solar capacity. These findings have important implications for the EU's strategy to decarbonise energy supply. © 2020 The Author(s)","AC diffusion; Decomposition analysis; Panel data model; Peak demand; Space cooling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091153354

The adoption of heat pumps has the potential to significantly re-shape typical domestic load profiles, however uptake within the UK is currently limited and the effects of wide-scale adoption on distribution networks is not well understood. Heat pump demand is highly sensitive to temperature, lessening load profile diversity, but is also influenced by behavioral routine and is therefore not entirely deterministic.

Local hotspots of nutrient enrichment found in up to 4000-year-old archaeological deposits can be used to explore the recycling and long-term retention of nutrients in arctic ecosystems. Methods: We investigated old Inuit and Norse deposits (known as middens) and adjacent tundra ecosystems along a wet-dry fjord gradient in western Greenland to explore the isotopic fingerprinting of plant and soil carbon and nitrogen (13C/12C and 15N/14N) derived from human presence. Results: At all locations we observed a significant isotopic fingerprint in soil and plant N related to human deposits. This demonstrates a century-long legacy of past human habitation on plant and soil characteristics and indicates a surprisingly high N retention in these ecosystems. This is consistent with the significantly higher plant biomass in areas with archaeological deposits. Conclusion: Vegetation composition and N in plants and soils displayed marked differences along the wet-dry fjord gradient. Furthermore, the profound nutrient enrichment and organic matter accumulation in archaeological deposits compared to surrounding tundra demonstrates a century-long legacy of past habitation on plant and soil characteristics as well as efficient N cycling with surprisingly limited N loss. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Archaeological remains; Low Arctic; Soil chemistry; Stable isotopes; Vegetation","archaeology; fjord; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; nutrient enrichment; organic matter; phytomass; recycling; soil carbon; tundra; Arctic; Arctic; Greenland; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089739977

To conduct this research, crop model namely the FAO-AquaCrop (Version 6.0) was selected to simulate grain yields of rice crops based on different scenarios of crop broadcasting calendar (CBC). The results point out that the grain yield of winter-spring (WS) and summer-autumn (SA) cropping seasons can increase up to 6.2% and 5.3% if the CBC is delayed from 7 to 14 d compared to the current broadcasting calendar (baseline) in the two experimental areas while the grain yield of the autumn-winter (AW) cropping season can increase 6.4% if the CBC is shifted 14 d compared to the baseline. In general, a shift in the CBC for all rice broadcasting crops compared to the baseline can be considered as an effective solution to minimize the negative impacts of weather factors as well as contribute to improve rice productivity. © 2020, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the determinants of pollution from transportation. The aim of this study is to analyze the impacts of economic growth, renewable energy consumption and urbanization on CO2 emissions from transport sector in an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework for European countries. To end this, second-generation panel long-run estimates and non-causality test are applied on the dataset from 1980–2014. Empirical pieces of evidence show that increases in renewable energy consumption mitigate carbon emissions from transportation, while urbanization has statistically insignificant positive impact on pollution. An increase in renewable energy consumption reduces CO2 from transportation by about 12 percent. The EKC hypothesis is validated. Moreover, unidirectional causality runs from renewable energy, economic growth and urbanization to emissions in transport sector. The findings of this study suggest strengthening the sustainable transportation system by promoting eco-friendly and energy-efficient modes of transportation and increase the environmental awareness of urban population and their overall concerns related to environmental issues caused by transportation. This study provides concrete evidence to the policy makers of European countries for especially sector-based renewable energy projects, drawing attention to the greenhouse gas impact of European transportation sector.

Further, we used beta regression to determine the share of annual farm income generated by diversification. Most cocoa farmers in our study region diversify farm income as a strategy to reduce climate change impacts. These strategies comprise crop and livestock diversification, intercropping of cocoa farms, provision of labour for other farmers, and agricultural-related economic off-farm activities. Factors that influence income diversification include the age of the farm, access to credits, extension contacts, the information sources on climate change, and government support.

It is found that effective implementation of the presently decided national pollution control regulations should allow further economic growth without major deterioration of ambient air quality, but will not be enough to reduce pollution levels in many world regions. A combination of ambitious policies focusing on pollution controls, energy and climate, agricultural production systems and addressing human consumption habits could drastically improve air quality throughout the world. By 2040, mean population exposure to PM2.5 from anthropogenic sources could be reduced by about 75% relative to 2015 and brought well below the WHO guideline in large areas of the world. While the implementation of the proposed technical measures is likely to be technically feasible in the future, the transformative changes of current practices will require strong political will, supported by a full appreciation of the multiple benefits. Improved air quality would avoid a large share of the current 3-9 million cases of premature deaths annually. At the same time, the measures that deliver clean air would also significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to multiple UN sustainable development goals.

However, unlike other components of the climate system, the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention. This focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions remain a priority for climate and Earth scientists. Despite the enormous progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better groundwater-climate change adaptation strategies and modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation modeling; Climate change; Future considerations; Groundwater; Models; Physical basis; Socioeconomic dimension","Aquifers; Climate models; Earth (planet); Groundwater resources; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability and change; Complex physical process; Direct and indirect impacts; Future climate projections; Ground-water hydrology; Groundwater interaction; Less-developed regions; Climate change; aquifer; climate change; feedback mechanism; groundwater; hydrology; land surface; recharge; simulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086988336

Land use and soil characteristics affect N2O emissions. There are not enough assessments in Argentina to quantify N2O emissions from commercial forest plantations. This research aimed at quantifying N2O fluxes from Eucalyptus grandis plantations and at identifying factors explaining emission variability. The study was carried out in Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos Province, Argentina (33°1′17″S, 58° 13′37″W) on Eucalyptus grandis plantations in four different situations: at two ages (2–4 yr and 8–10 yr), on two contrasting texture soils (coarse and fine), and on a medium-textured sodic soil in a natural forest (shrubland). Greenhouse gas emissions (N2O and CO2) were measured 12 times between August 2016 and October 2017. Emission rates and annual N2O emissions were low in all evaluated treatments (average emission rate: 2.62 µg N2O-N m−2h−1, and average annual emission: 0.226 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). These rates are considerably lower than those of agricultural situations in the same region. This can be explained by the null use of nitrogen fertilization and by the absence of atmospheric nitrogen- fixing crops in forestry plantations. The use under natural forest showed the highest cumulative annual emissions (0.698 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1) possibly because of its woody leguminous species composition and its higher soil water content. N2O emissions in fine 2-4y, coarse 2-4y, and in coarse 8-10y were in average 0.0896 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1 with no statistically differences between them. The fine 8-10y N2O emissions did not differ from the natural forest neither from the other treatments (0.261 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). Soils with higher clay content showed a trend toward higher N2O emissions than sandy soils. NO3-N level in soil was the variable that best explained N2O-N emissions (p &lt; 0.001). Since nitrate content and CO2 emission were the variables most associated with nitrous emissions, it can be hypothesized that in clay soils greater emissions can be originated by higher nitrification as a result of their higher organic matter content or due to a denitrification provoked by the depletion of oxygen in a high consumption respiration process, and poor oxygen renewal caused by the increased amount of micro-aggregates and pores. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Eucalyptus grandis; Green house gasses; Nitrous oxide; Soil","Aggregates; Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Clay; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Particulate emissions; Soil moisture; Textures; Atmospheric nitrogen; Average emission rate; Eucalyptus plantations; Nitrogen fertilization; Nitrous oxide emissions; Organic matter content; Soil characteristics; Species composition; Gas emissions; denitrification; fertilizer application; forest soil; land use; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; plantation; quantitative analysis; sandy soil; soil emission; soil respiration; soil water; Carbon Dioxide; Clay; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Nitrogen; Argentina; Entre Rios; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086571717

Research on soil and plant carbon responses to warming are often based on short-term (' 10 year) warming experiments. Furthermore, carbon budgets from boreal forests, which contain at least 10–20% of the global soil carbon pool, have shown mixed responses to warming. In this study, we measured carbon and nitrogen budgets (i.e., soil and understory vegetation carbon and nitrogen stocks) from a 13-year greenhouse warming experiment in an Alaskan boreal forest. Although there were no differences in total aboveground + belowground pools, the carbon in the moss biomass and in the soil organic layer significantly decreased with the warming treatment (− 88.3% and − 19.1%, respectively). Declines in moss biomass carbon may be a consequence of warming-associated drying, while shifts in the soil microbial community could be responsible for the decrease in carbon in the soil organic layer. Moreover, in response to warming, aboveground plant biomass carbon tended to increase while root biomass carbon tended to decrease, so carbon allocation may shift aboveground with warming. Overall these results suggest that permafrost-free boreal forests are susceptible to soil carbon loss with warming. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Boreal forest; Carbon budget; Field experimental warming; Global climate change; Nitrogen budget","biomass allocation; boreal forest; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; permafrost; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; understory; Alaska; United States; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089446719

This is done by investigating an optimal sizing methodology for a hybrid photovoltaic (PV) biogas energy system in Ramtha, Jordan in case of on-grid and off-grid system's configurations. The multi-objective grey wolf optimisation algorithm is used to get non-dominant solutions of loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and total current cost (TCC) in a case and GHG emissions with TCC in another case. Hourly measured real values of solar irradiance, temperature, municipal solid wastes and load demand are obtained from formal institutions in Jordan. Detailed mathematical modelling is performed for the proposed system to precisely evaluate its performance. Non-dominant Pareto points are discussed in each Pareto front. These include affordable, compromised, and reliable or environmental Pareto points. The on-grid system is found to be more reliable and cost-effective than the off-grid PV biogas energy system. Further, the compromised solution of the on-grid system is found to be environmentally friendly.

Fast acclimation of photosynthetic apparatus to the environmental stresses and fluctuations of light intensity and light quality plays an important role in supporting effective photosynthesis. The bioengineered photosynthetic systems responsible for energy dissipation (non-photochemical quenching) and stomatal functioning, as well as some enzymes of CO2 fixation system alongside with introduction of effective mechanisms found in algae or cyanobacteria into chloroplasts, can be used for conservation of effective photosynthesis during such fluctuations.

The Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Agenda have placed great emphasis on collaborative frameworks and the private sector’s crucial contribution to closing the climate gap in terms of investment and leadership in innovation. However, there has not been a concise follow-up and assessment of the private sector’s practical involvement and contribution, whether policy and legislative frameworks and planning approaches are suitable to enable this involvement, and who would lead in delivering the climate agenda locally. The present article addresses this gap reporting on case observations regarding the delivery of climate interest and sustainability through urban development in London and Copenhagen—two European cities of different sizes and varying government approaches. Thereby, the article assesses patterns of private-sector involvement and governance around climate adaptation and mitigation and locates gaps around its involvement in delivering the climate agenda. The analysis clarifies overarching differences in governance and frameworks for the involvement of the private sector between the two cities, attributing this on the local level partly to city size and scale, but to a great extent to ‘city leadership’ in the built environment and sustainable urban innovation in general. A crucial finding highlights the importance that cities further establish platforms for collaborative learning, specifically around pilot urban projects, thereby stimulating voluntary private engagement. Another key finding is in the potential effectiveness of strategies by public agencies such as city governments to incentivise private actors and simultaneously monitor sustainability effects both broadly at the city level, and specifically at urban project level using ecological, circular and life-cycle approaches. Further implications of the analysis point to the importance of developing a more nuanced approach to understanding the different roles fulfilled by the ‘private sector’ in the built environment and the necessity of creating an information base addressing the life cycle of development projects and business processes and comparing their impacts.

Many studies on greenery systems, such as green roofs and green walls, have demonstrated that greenery systems support energy saving and improve thermal conditions in the building sector. This paper summarizes, discusses, and compares greenery systems and their contributions to the reduction of the urban heat index, the reduction of internal and external buildings’ wall temperatures, and the reduction of the energy consumption of buildings. The fundamental mechanisms of greenery systems, which are thermal insulation, evapotranspiration, and shading effect, are also discussed. The benefits of greenery systems include the improvement of stormwater management, the improvement of air quality, the reduction of sound pollution, the reduction of carbon dioxide, and the improvement of aesthetic building value. The summarized materials on the greenery systems in the article will be a point of references for the researchers, planners, and developers of urban and rural areas, as well as the individual’s interest for future urban and rural plans. © 2020 by the authors.

However, climate change also helps to free up conventional thinking, by making people come to terms with the idea that the future will not be the same as the past. Throughout the past twenty years, there has been much attention directed towards the design of structurally diverse and species-rich naturalistic vegetation for utilisation in urban areas. The aims of this study were to test whether species derived from Continental, near Mediterranean and Temperate maritime grasslands grown in designed meadow-like communities became fitter or less fit under different climate change scenarios. A community of thirty-six species from these three climatic types were chosen to represent a gradient from well-fited to poorly-fited to the current British climate. The species were chosen to share similar morphological characteristics, in terms of canopy height and structure. They were also chosen for their colourful flowers from spring to autumn, to maximise attractiveness to the public. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different climate scenarios on the fitness and growth performance of these species with three watering regimes (50 % increase in precipitation; 50 % decrease in precipitation; and ambient), and two different temperature treatments (ambient and ambient plus 3 °C). The study showed that water availability and temperature have a significant impact on plant species fitness for green space under future climate change scenarios, particularly changed in concert with one another. Poorly fited species used in the study were intolerant of high levels of moisture, but increasing air temperature reduced the negative effect of additional water. Designed naturalistic plant communities of temperate and near Mediterranean plant species are a potentially sustainable element for urban landscape under future UK climate change scenarios. This study is the first to look at the effects of climate fitness on designed communities of native and non-native meadow plant species in urban landscapes. © 2020","Climate change; Naturalistic design; Species fittness; Urban landscape","air temperature; climate change; fitness; grassland; greenspace; herb; landscape; plant community; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; urban area; urban ecosystem; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087945782

Traditional techniques for detecting and quantifying toxic metals in the atmosphere are either not real time, hindering identification of sources, or limited by instrument costs. Spark emission spectroscopy is a promising and cost-effective technique that can be used for analyzing toxic metals in real time. Here, we have developed a cost-effective spark emission spectroscopy system to quantify the concentration of toxic metals targeted by the US EPA. Specifically, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb solutions were diluted and deposited on the ground electrode of the spark emission system. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was optimized and employed to detect useful features from the spark-generated plasma emissions. The optimized model was able to detect atomic emission lines along with other features to build a regression model that predicts the concentration of toxic metals from the observed spectra. The limits of detections (LODs) were estimated using the detected features and compared to the traditional single-feature approach. LASSO is capable of detecting highly sensitive features in the input spectrum; however, for some toxic metals the single-feature LOD marginally outperforms LASSO LOD. The combination of low-cost instruments with advanced machine learning techniques for data analysis could pave the path forward for data-driven solutions to costly measurements. © 2020 Author(s).",,"cost analysis; ecotoxicology; electrode; heavy metal; machine learning; optimization; quantitative analysis; spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093516756

This can be attributed to the greater responsibility of developed economies for climate change, and the greater socio-demographic, political and technological challenges faced by their less-developed counterparts. This paper attempts to address this gap by examining the practicality of implementing Personal Carbon Trading (PCT) for personal road transport in Kenya. PCT is investigated with a focus on political considerations, potential system operation and the distributional impact of quota allocation to motorists. Three quota allocation methods are modelled using data from a survey of 500 motor vehicle owners in Nairobi and Mombasa counties. Equal per-capita, equal per-vehicle and needs-based allocation methods are modelled and assessed to determine the distributional impact on various groups of interest. Emissions were found to be highly correlated to vehicle engine size and the number of dependents per vehicle, but not to area of residence or income levels. None of the three allocation methods disproportionately imposed burdens on vulnerable groups, and all exhibited progressive tendencies. The proposed system is intended to add new insight into the possibility of PCT becoming a globally inclusive policy option. Key Policy Insights Despite PCT being a bold policy proposal even for developed countries, less developed counterparts can meet the political, institutional and technological requirements to implement it. The wealth of functionality available through SIM card features on cheap and abundant mobile phones may unlock a simple and cost-effective, globally-applicable PCT system. Public resistance to fuel price increases stems from the lower income demographic which is, conversely, rewarded with surpluses under PCT. Equal-per capita allocation remains the most progressive method. Needs-based allocation is highly progressive and may be worth considering when more stringent targets are deemed necessary. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emissions; Energy; personal carbon trading; transport","developing world; emission inventory; emissions trading; energy use; environmental economics; policy approach; policy implementation; road transport; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087501329

Recent efforts in the physical sciences have focused on the development of seasonal climate forecasts, with increased emphasis on tailoring this information to user needs at the local scale. Advances in science communication have progressed understandings of how to leverage subjective decision-making processes and trust to communicate risky, probabilistic information. Yet, seasonal climate forecasts remain underutilized in local decision-making, due to challenging divides between the physical and social sciences and the lack of an approach that combines expert knowledge across disciplines. We outline an interdisciplinary, multi-method approach to communicate local-scale predictive information by advancing a co-produced “package” that pairs a highly visual bulletin with public engagement sessions, both developed with direct user-developer engagement, leveraging existing networks and novel inclusion of uncertainty through locally relevant analogies to enhance the understanding of probabilistic information. Systematic observations revealed some level of understanding among the target audience, yet identified major processes of confusion that inhibit forecast utility. Probabilistic predictions communicated in reference to “normal” years proved to be an unintelligible comparison for individuals, given preferences for certainty in interpreting risk-related information. Our approach addresses key gaps in the literature and serves as a framework for bridging the disconnect between forecast development and science communication to advance communication and integration of climate predictions for community benefit. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Ethiopia; Interdisciplinary; Public engagement; Science communication; Seasonal climate forecast","Climatology; Decision making; Community resiliences; Decision making process; Decision-making practices; Predictive information; Probabilistic information; Probabilistic prediction; Science communications; Seasonal climate forecast; Forecasting; climate change; decision making; forecasting method; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; probability; risk; risk assessment; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090772128

In this paper, published data (about 50 sources) on findings of these paleosols mostly on the territory of paleocontinents Laurussia and Pangea are summarized. For visualization of this information, sketch maps of paleosol distribution for Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian times have been developed. Their analysis shows that most of Devonian paleosols belonged to the groups of azonal and intrazonal soils; soils of wetlands predominated. The discoveries of Middle and Late Devonian zonal soils—Oxisols and texturally differentiated Alfisols—in the area of Voronezh High (south Russia) are unique. Most of Mississippian paleosols also belonged to azonal and intrazonal soils. The wide distribution of wetland paleosols in the Mississipian subperiod was also reflected in the increased area of coal basins (8% of land in comparison with 1% in Devonian). In the area of the Moscow sedimentary basin, along with Histosols, zonal paleosols—Spodosols and others—have been described. Pennsylvanian soil cover consisted of azonal, intrazonal, and zonal soils. In North America and Western Europe, swampy soils were still widely distributed (22% of land was occupied by coal basins). Oppositely, in the area of the Moscow sedimentary basin, Pennsylvanian paleosols of semiarid and arid ranges with palygorskite as the major clay mineral were widely present. The differentiation of Pennsylvanian soil cover of Laurussia and Pangea reflects the changes in climatic zonality of the planet with an increase in the degree of climatic contrast. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Carboniferous; Central Devonian field; Devonian; Moscow sedimentary basin; paleosols","Carboniferous; Devonian; differentiation; Histosol; knowledge; paleoclimate; paleosol; Pangaea; sedimentary basin; texture; visualization; Moscow [(ADS) Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094614777

At each selected study area, soil samples were obtained regular from ten sites vertical positions along the wind at the region. The distance between one examination site and another was 100 meters, by auger for depth 0–30 cm. All soil samples at every site was brought to the laboratory, then air-dried, crashed and sifted through a 2 mm mesh in order to remove large debris, stone, gravel, plant materials, and other materials and stored in plastic containers until laboratory tests and then the Ten samples represent every position were mixed to get a composite sample for the implementation of biological experimentation.

After 45 years of planting, the height of the plants and the vegetative and root parts of the plant were measured and dried to obtain the dry weight of the two plant parts. The results showed that the soil had a sandy clay loam texture with a bulk density of 1.55 Mg.m−3, with an increase in the values of the electrical conductivity of the soil near the factory and its decline after 750 m, with the high content of soils of calcium carbonate. The soil content of total cadmium ranged between 1.8–7.2 mg.Kg−1, while total lead content was ranged from 80.0 to 540.0 mg.Kg−1, while the bioavailable portion were ranged between 0.16–0.81 and 0.2–17.3 mg.Kg−1 for Cd and Pb respectively, indicating that both elements exceeded their permissible limits in soil, with a clear tendency to decrease the soil content of both elements by moving away from the fertilizer plant. The distance of 2000 m follows the apparent decrease in the soil content of both elements.

Produced hot gasses flow into the hot temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) to raise the compressed air temperature up to the gas turbine inlet temperature. Besides this, the MCFC unit is utilized both for producing additional power for the retrofitting CO2 separation unit. Finally, a cryogenic separation unit has been utilized for liquid CO2 production and for recovering H2 and CO from the fuel cell anode exhausts.

Grassland ecosystems are not an exception, with climate change compounding contemporary pressures such as habitat loss and fragmentation. In this study, we assess the climate resilience of Themeda triandra, a foundational species and the most widespread plant in Australia, by assessing the relative contributions of spatial, environmental and ploidy factors to contemporary genomic variation. Reduced-representation genome sequencing on 472 samples from 52 locations was used to test how the distribution of genomic variation, including ploidy polymorphism, supports adaptation to hotter and drier climates. We explicitly quantified isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) and predicted genomic vulnerability of populations to future climates based on expected deviation from current genomic composition. We found that a majority (54%) of genomic variation could be attributed to IBD, while an additional 22% (27% when including ploidy information) could be explained by two temperature and two precipitation climate variables demonstrating IBE. Ploidy polymorphisms were common within populations (31/52 populations), indicating that ploidy mixing is characteristic of T. triandra populations. Genomic vulnerabilities were found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the landscape, and our analysis suggested that ploidy polymorphism, along with other factors linked to polyploidy, reduced vulnerability to future climates by 60% (0.25–0.10). Our data suggests that polyploidy may facilitate adaptation to hotter climates and highlight the importance of incorporating ploidy in adaptive management strategies to promote the resilience of this and other foundation species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; genomic diversity; genomic vulnerability; landscape genomics; polyploidy; Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass)","article; Australia; climate resilience; controlled study; genetic association; genetic isolation by distance; genomics; major clinical study; nonhuman; polyploidy; precipitation; Themeda triandra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090986897

Quetta is a selected city in Pakistan as the best fit location based on annual average daily solar radiations (AADSR) data retrieved from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) meteorological data. Helioscope software is used to select −15◦ tilt and 180◦ azimuthal angles, which further increased Quetta’s AADSR value from 5.54 kWh/m2 /d to 5.93 kWh/m2 /d. For research significance, a realistic approach is undertaken by proper selection of solar panel type based on Quetta’s annual average temperature, load categorization, user selection and inputs from a solar energy expert. Finally, initial cost, investment and GHG mitigation analysis are carried out in RETScreen Expert software, which validates the minute but the prominent role of a single, end energy user by mitigating 122 tons of CO2 in 25-year project life span.

Among feasible storage options, deep saline aquifers are believed to have the largest storage capacity for the gas collected from industrial processes. The first CO2 storage project at a commercial scale in a saline aquifer is in the Sleipner field of the Utsira storage formation in Norway. The long ongoing storage operation in the Sleipner field has been the subject of several past studies attempting to recreate the observed injected CO2 plume migration behaviour. History matching is a method to adjust the input parameters of the model in a way to minimise the mismatch between the simulated and the actual production data in reservoir engineering and applicable to carbon sequestration. Typical parameters adjusted in history matching are porosity, absolute and relative permeability data. In this study, we used an adjoint-based optimisation tool and showed the importance of caprock morphology in finding an accurate plume match. Using a set of synthetic models, we initially minimised the mismatch between the observed and simulated CO2 plume outline by modifying the caprock topographical details. After testing the optimisation tool on the synthetic models, we applied the methodology to the Sleipner benchmark 2019 model and improved the plume match by locally adjusting caprock elevation within seismic detection limits. We subsequently improved the match by calibrating porosity, permeability, CO2 density and injection rate together in an experiment in which we calibrated all the parameters, including the caprock morphology, to find a better match. The results showed an improvement of around 8% (compared with the original model) in the plume match resulting from an average absolute elevation change of 3.23 m in the model while keeping the other parameters constant. Calibrating the porosity, permeability, CO2 density and injection rate resulted in a 5% improvement in the match, and once caprock morphology was included in the optimisation process, the match improvement increased by 16%. We changed the caprock elevation within a range lower than the seismic detection limit, and results showed that even a few metres variations in the elevation have significant impacts on the plume migration and trapping mechanism in the Sleipner model. The method presented in this work results in a better match than the original seismic data for the Sleipner model. © 2020 The Authors.

Current emission factor models need to be updated to reflect new technologies and materials and to incorporate the effects of changing driving habits and speeds. While emission regulations drive technical innovations that are significantly reducing PM emissions in vehicle exhaust, non-exhaust automotive emissions remain unregulated. Current emission factor models need to be updated to reflect the changes caused by new technologies, materials, and speed-dependent vehicle usage. Most research regarding brake emissions relies on a laboratory setting. Laboratory testing has allowed researchers, application engineers, data modeling engineers, and environmental agencies to generate large datasets for multiple vehicle configurations and friction couple designs. However, these results can be inconclusive or confusing to compare at best, due to the lack of a standardized method. This paper reports on a six-vehicle campaign conducted under standardized, repeatable, and reproducible conditions. By relying on state-of-the-art speed control systems, the inertia dynamometer can recreate specific driving profiles derived from field measurements. The study involved testing brake corners from six vehicles. The test plan included original equipment service parts, or OES, and aftermarket friction couples, or AM, on an enclosed brake inertia dynamometer. The individual friction couples include the friction material along with the commonly used mating disc or drum per the market survey performed early during the project. This approach reflects the OE brake configuration and subsequent brake replacement jobs. The test cycle used represents vehicle usage in California. The project relied upon approved testing protocols, test system validation, adjustment of cooling airspeeds, and interlaboratory evaluation for filter weighing methods. The results from more than 80 tests show the effects of axle position, friction couple formulation, as well as vehicle size, type, and speed. These results show substantial variation in brake PM emissions by vehicle application and friction couple type. © 2020SAE International.

This research investigated the diversity, volume yield, biomass and carbon sequestration of tree species in urban forests in two Nigerian cities (Port Harcourt and Ilorin) selected using simple random sampling. In Nigeria there is no record of quantitative assessment of carbon sequestration in urban forests. Biodiversity and growth data were obtained from about 20% of the built-up areas of the two cities. Non-destructive approach was used for above ground biomass estimation. Biomass data was used to quantify carbon stock to estimate the amount of carbon sequestrated by the urban forests in the two cities. The results revealed a total of 746 individual trees distributed among 37 species and 19 families in Port Harcourt, while 556 individual trees distributed among 46 species and 18 families in Ilorin urban forest. Shannon-Wiener diversity index for Port Harcourt was 3.39 while that of Ilorin was 3.61. The total carbon stored by the urban forest of Port Harcourt was estimated at 67,979.08 tons and Ilorin urban forest carbon stored was estimated at 91,512.49 tons. The average carbon density of the urban forest of Port Harcourt was estimated at 136.15 tons/ha and 7.82 tons/ha was estimated for Ilorin urban forest. Tree species diversity has greater impact on biomass accumulation which determines carbon sequestration and mitigation of harsh climatic conditions. Selection and planting the right species as avenue trees, building parks and gardens, urban landscaping can improve urban forest carbon sequestration and producing other urban forest ecosystem functions. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biomass; Carbon storage; Ecosystem functions; Species diversity; Urban forests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083846074

The process of urban expansion does not include assessment of ecosystem services (ES). This has been causing unintended environmental problems. This study aims to uncover ES of three most important land use types (cropland, agroforestry, and grassland) that are threatened by land expropriation for urban expansion in Bahir Dar City. The study applied a participatory approach using community perception and expert judgments (N = 108). Respondents were asked to locate their perceptions on the use of 35 different ES, and then to evaluate the potential of the land use. Respondents were shown to have the ability to differentiate between ES and land use in terms of their potential to deliver ES. The results show that agroforestry is expected to have a high relevant potential to deliver 31% of all ES, but cropland 20% and grassland 14%. Food, fodder, timber, firewood, fresh water, energy, compost, climate regulation, erosion prevention, and water purification and treatment were identified as the ten most important services. It is not only the provisioning services that are being supplied by the land use types which are expropriated for urbanization, but also regulating, supporting and cultural services. To ensure sustainable urban land development, we suggest the consideration of the use of ES and the potential of the land use to supply ES when making land use decisions, including land expropriation for urban expansion. © 2020 by the authors.

It plays a significant role in the global economy, employing over 125 million people. However, it is possible that this vital crop is threatened by changing climate conditions and fungal infections. This paper reviews how suitable areas for coffee cultivation and the toxigenic fungi species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium will be affected due to climate change. By combining climate models with species distribution models, a number of studies have investigated the future distribution of coffee cultivation. Studies predict that suitable coffee cultivation area could drop by ~50% under representation concentration pathway (RCP) 6.0 by 2050 for both Arabica and Robusta. These findings agree with other studies which also see an altitudinal migration of suitable cultivation areas to cooler regions, but limited scope for latitudinal migration owing to coffee’s inability to tolerate seasonal temperature changes. Increased temperatures will see an overall increase in mycotoxin production such as aflatoxins, particularly in mycotoxigenic fungi (e.g., Aspergillus flavus) more suited to higher temperatures. Arabica and Robusta’s limited ability to relocate means both species will be grown in less suitable climates, increasing plant stress and making coffee more susceptible to fungal infection and mycotoxins. Information regarding climate change parameters with respect to mycotoxin concentrations in real coffee samples is provided and how the changed climate affects mycotoxins in non-coffee systems is discussed. In a few areas where relocating farms is possible, mycotoxin contamination may decrease due to the “parasites lost” phenomenon. More research is needed to include the effect of mycotoxins on coffee under various climate change scenarios, as currently there is a significant knowledge gap, and only generalisations can be made. Future modelling of coffee cultivation, which includes the influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilisation and forest management, is also required; however, all indications show that climate change will have an extremely negative effect on future coffee production worldwide in terms of both a loss of suitable cultivation areas and an increase in mycotoxin contamination. © 2020 by the authors.

Characterising the large-scale structure in the Universe from present times to the high redshift epoch of reionisation is essential to constraining the cosmology, the history of star formation, and reionisation, to measuring the gas content of the Universe, and to obtaining a better understanding of the physical processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution. Using the integrated emission from unresolved galaxies or gas clouds, line intensity mapping (LIM) provides a new observational window to measure the larger properties of structures. This very promising technique motivates the community to plan for LIM experiments. Aims. We describe the development of a large field-of-view instrument, named CONCERTO (for CarbON CII line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch), operating in the range 130-310 GHz from the APEX 12-m telescope (5100 m above sea level). CONCERTO is a low-resolution spectrometer based on the lumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) technology. Spectra are obtained using a fast Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), coupled to a dilution cryostat with a base temperature of 0.1 K. Two two kilo-pixel arrays of LEKID are mounted inside the cryostat that also contains the cold optics and the front-end electronics. Methods. We present, in detail, the technological choices leading to the instrumental concept, together with the design and fabrication of the instrument and preliminary laboratory tests on the detectors. We also give our best estimates for CONCERTO sensitivity and give predictions for two of the main scientific goals of CONCERTO, that is, a [CII]-intensity mapping survey and observations of galaxy clusters. Results. We provide a detailed description of the instrument design. Based on realistic comparisons with existing instruments developed by our group (NIKA, NIKA2, and KISS), and on the laboratory characterisation of our detectors, we provide an estimate for CONCERTO sensitivity on the sky. Finally, we describe, in detail, two of the main scientific goals offered by CONCERTO at APEX. © The CONCERTO collaboration 2020.","Cosmology: observations; Instrumentation: detectors; Instrumentation: spectrographs; Telescopes","Cosmology; Cryostats; Fast Fourier transforms; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Galaxies; Mapping; Sea level; Signal receivers; Spectrometers; Titanium compounds; Front end electronics; Instrument designs; Integrated emissions; Kinetic inductance detectors; Large field of views; Large scale structures; Low-resolution spectrometer; Wide field of view; Spacecraft instruments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093969412

Worse conditions occur in low-income countries where the use of coal in household stoves is a common practice. The present paper aims at demonstrating that the combination of waste-to-energy (WtE) plants (based on direct or indirect waste combustion technologies) and direct electric heating (DEH) would be beneficial to reduce air pollution and, meanwhile, optimize the local waste management. Specifically, a WtE plant powering a DEH network will be compared with two reference scenarios of domestic heating: the use of wood/pellet stoves and coal stoves. The results show that shifting to a DEH system, powered by the nearby WtE plant, would reduce the emissions of total suspended particles, NOx, CO, VOCs, dioxins, PAHs and heavy metals by >99%, 27%, 97%, 96%, 93%, 94% and 32%, respectively, with respect to the use of solid fuel in household stoves. In addition, the higher degree of atmospheric dispersion of the off-gas from the stack of the WtE plant is expected to further reduce the impacts in terms of air quality, as estimated by an approach based on the concept of dilution factors. The avoided transportation of waste to other waste facilities outside the region would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions with respect to coal combustion and biomass burning, by 63% and 3%, respectively. The integration of local WtE and DEH could be also “mild”, opening to scenarios that could improve the local air quality without renouncing totally to the habits of domestic wood combustion in mountainous regions. Mild-DEH could be designed to integrate the domestic use of wood with electrical heaters, reducing fuel use and air pollution. © 2020","Domestic heating; Emission balance; Environmental impact; Environmental sustainability; Road transport; Waste to energy","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Coal; Coal transportation; Electric heating; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Stoves; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wood; Atmospheric dispersion; Environmental benefits; Low income countries; Mountainous regions; Rural and remote areas; Solid fuel combustion; Total suspended particles; Waste to energy process; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; coal; dioxin; fuel; heavy metal; nitrogen oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; volatile agent; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; carbon emission; environmental impact; heating; mountain region; road transport; rural area; sustainability; waste management; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biomass energy; carbon footprint; combustion; controlled study; dilution; direct electric heating; energy resource; environmental impact; organic pollution; pollution transport; power supply; priority journal; rural area; soil pollution; suspended particulate matter; temperature related phenomena; waste disposal facility; waste management; waste-to-energy plant; wood; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086426429

To establish context, we briefly overview the history of the United States NPS and other relevant federal agencies' roles and responsibilities in protecting federal lands that have been set aside due to their value as areas of natural beauty or historical or cultural significance [3]. We present a case study of Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) situated within the Bakken Shale Formation-a lucrative region of oil and gas deposits-to examine potential impacts if areas of TRNP, particularly areas designated as “wilderness,” are opened to resource extraction, or if the development in other areas of the Bakken near or adjacent to the park's boundaries expands [4]. We have chosen TRNP because of its biodiversity and rich environmental resources and location in the hydrocarbon-rich Bakken Shale.

Hourly electricity demand data was collected and analyzed for the province of Ontario. It is evident that health-related pandemics have a detrimental and direct influence on the concept of the smart city. This is manifested through various social, economic, environmental, technological and energy-related changes. The overall electricity demand of the province for the month of April of this year amidst pandemic conditions declined by 14%, totaling 1267 GW. A unique trend of reciprocating energy demand exists throughout the week. The post-COVID-19 indicates higher energy demand in the earlier part of the week and a lower demand in the latter part of the week. Pre-pandemic, the days of highest electricity demand were in the latter part of the work week (Wed-Fri) in addition to the weekend. Post-pandemic, the highest electricity demand occurred in the earlier part of the week (Mon-Tue). Hourly electricity demand shows a clear curve flattening during the pandemic, especially during peak hours of 7–11 in the morning and 5–7 in the evening, resulting in significant demand reductions during these periods. Lastly, due to COVID-19, GHG emission reductions of 40,000 tonnes of CO2e were achieved along with savings of $131,844 for the month of April. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19 pandemic; Electricity demand reduction; Energy conservation; Smart city",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088651661

A prerequisite for creation of artificial convective clouds is the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere; this is an encouraging factor as water vapor is present even in regions with an arid climate. Furthermore, numerous cases of convective cloud development under the influence of powerful heat sources are known, even for days lacking conditions for natural cloud development. In this paper, we analyze the results and failure causes of worldwide experiments with meteotrons, which are stationary installations designed to initiate powerful updrafts. To enhance meteotron jet buoyancy, a combined method based on use of a turbojet engine is proposed; the jet output by the engine creates an aerosol cloud that absorbs shortwave solar radiation. An overview of mathematical models of convective jets is given and the assumptions made during mathematical formulation of the problem are analyzed. Theoretical and laboratory results are compared. A mathematical model of a convective jet is proposed and an analytical solution is obtained in cylindrical coordinates. It is shown that the upward flow velocity decreases to a minimum at an altitude where the jet and environment temperatures are aligned. In contrast, the jet radius increases and, at the temperature equalization height, the jet adopts an umbrella form. We conclude that, for an artificially created stream to contribute to development of cloud convection, the temperature equalization height should be equal to or greater than the condensation level. The results obtained in this study can be used in the trials on creation of artificial updrafts and clouds. © 2020",,"Clouds; Engines; Equalizers; Flow velocity; Turbojet engines; Water vapor; Aerosol clouds; Cloud development; Combined method; Convective clouds; Cylindrical coordinates; Environment temperature; Mathematical formulation; Presence of water; Precipitation (meteorology); artificial neural network; atmospheric convection; cloud classification; cloud condensation nucleus; cloud microphysics; experimental study; feasibility study; jet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083394212

Introducing amino groups as substituents to molecular catalysts is a promising approach towards improving capture and reduction of CO2. This review explores recently developed state-of-the-art molecular catalysts with a focus on heterogeneous and homogeneous amine molecular catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.

Methods: Data on the monthly abundance of Anopheles stephensi larvae and adults were gathered from earlier studies conducted between 2002 and 2019 in malaria prone areas of southeastern Iran. Climatic data for the studied counties were obtained from climatology stations. Generalized estimating equations method was used for cluster correlation of data for each study site in different years. Results: A significant relationship was found between monthly density of adult and larvae of Anopheles stephensi and precipitation, max temperature and mean temperature, both with simple and multiple generalized estimating equations analysis (P<0.05). But when analysis was done with one month lag, only relationship between monthly density of adults and larvae of Anopheles stephensi and max temperature was significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: This study provides a basis for developing multivariate time series models, which can be used to develop improved appropriate epidemic prediction systems for these areas. Long-term entomological study in the studied sites by expert teams is recommended to compare the abundance of malaria vectors in the different areas and their association with climatic variables.
