In the households and tertiary sectors, where energy is mainly used for heating, one should also expect a shift away from fossil fuels (including natural gas) to renewables. In the REFLEX project the energy and emission scenarios were developed for various sectors with the use of ASTRA, ELTRAMOD, TIMES-HEAT-EU and FORECAST models for analysing the longterm situation up to 2050. The paper presents the results of the evaluation of air quality and health impacts associated with direct emissions of air pollutants from households and tertiary sector based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. Ambient concentration of air pollutants in Europe was calculated with the use of Polyphemus Air Quality System. Health impacts were estimated based on the concentration-response functions for PM2.5, which is responsible for the most significant impacts to human health. The study shows that according to analysed scenarios, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions from residential and tertiary sectors in Europe will decrease by 30 times untill 2050 compared to 2015. These emission reductions lead to improvement of the air quality. The largest reduction in PM2.5 ambient concentrations is observed over Poland. Consequently, it is expected that in 2050 the negative impact of air pollution on human health as well the associated external costs will be reduced in EU-28. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health; Service industry; Sustainable development; Air quality systems; Ambient concentrations; Direct emissions; Emission reduction; Energy and emissions; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Response functions; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101684711

An identify the energy consumption gives information to forecast the energy saving. The research aims to utilize rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) at non-academic buildings in Malaysia's educational institution. A detailed energy audit has been conducted at Politeknik Sultan Azlan Shah (PSAS) involving three non-academic buildings to identify the buildings' energy usage. The three different building involved is the Islamic Centre (Mosque), Sports Centre, and Multipurpose Hall. The energy audit analysis is divided into four end-load groups comprising lighting, fans, air conditioning, and other equipment to identify each type of load's energy consumption. Which equipment consumes the highest amount of energy in non-academic buildings in PSAS is determine. The results show that the highest energy consumption at the Islamic Centre and Multipurpose Hall is an air conditioner for a while Sports Centre is lighting equipment. Annual power generation and energy bill savings are calculated based on rooftop solar PV installation for self-consumption. From the feasibility analysis, the forecast of energy-saving for at-least 5% per year has been estimated. It significantly reduces the amount of carbon emission release to the environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Lighting; Recreation centers; Religious buildings; Smart city; Solar buildings; Sports; Carbon emissions; Educational institutions; Energy audit; Energy bills; Energy usage; Feasibility analysis; Lighting equipment; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102459126

Precipitation and temperature are used as climate-representative variables. Indeed, using a new analysis on spatial modeling, this work demonstrates the direct and indirect effects of precipitation as well as temperature on the climate migration of a governorate and those of neighboring governorates through the production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants. In addition, spatial modeling shows that the impact of climate change on migration through cereal and olive production differs from that of irrigated plants, thus demonstrating the importance of taking explicit account of the spatial effects between governorates. The decline in a farmer’s income in (a) governorate is a factor in rural exodus and migration to other governorates with water and a more favorable climate. This cause-and-effect phenomenon is known as negative externalities because some regions are forced to suffer from the consequences of the arrival of a new population. The originality of this method is that it allows the impact of spatial externalities to be taken into account in an effective way. The data used describe the 24 Tunisian governorates. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; C21; Climate change; Climate migration, spatial econometrics; F22; O13; Q54; Spatial externality","Economics; Governors; Cause and effects; Indirect effects; Negative externalities; Spatial effect; Spatial externalities; Spatial modeling; Tunisia; Climate change; climate change; governance approach; income distribution; irrigation system; migratory population; nature-society relations; precipitation assessment; questionnaire survey; temperature profile; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100730819

We live in a world where environmental data is increasingly being amassed and models are generating finer scale and increasingly dense numbers of outputs, resulting in the production of high level scientific information on climate and ocean. However, the knowledge generated is often inaccessible, incomprehensible and misunderstood by society. Given that society has access to many levels of information through various forms of media, how do we better share this knowledge, and improve understanding of how society is impacting their immediate and remote surroundings and what behavioral changes are needed for reducing those impacts? In this paper, we assess the level of environmental and ocean awareness among young learners. We argue that, despite the wide range of environmental data available and a common use of a broad range of media, this group is not aware of or interested in climate related issues. This paper highlights the challenges in bringing researchers, data managers and educators together to provide consistent, up-to-date messages that can appeal to and can be understood by modern societies. It also highlights insufficiencies in environmental school education, including those concerning the “uncertainty” concept, which is a fundamental part of any scientific process. In identifying these challenges, we propose a pathway for improving societal knowledge on climate and ocean changes that takes advantage of the technological abilities for environmental data collection, storage and processing, global and regional research, as well as good practices in ocean literacy and climate and ocean education. © Copyright © 2021 Zielinski, Bolzacchini, Evans, Ferrero, Gregorczyk, Kijewski, Kotynska-Zielinska, Mrowiec, Oleszczuk, Pakszys, Piechowska, Piwowarczyk, Sobieszczanski and Wichorowski.","climate adaptation and mitigation; climate and ocean change; climate and ocean literacy; environmental data and observations; integrated knowledge sharing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102318593

In this study, we examined soil organic C (SOC) protection mechanisms in alpine meadow, typical steppe and desert grassland ecosystems located in the Gansu province of China. We also examined which microbial taxonomic groups are associated with physically protected C and unprotected C. Soil samples for the study were collected from 0∼10 and 10∼20 cm soil depths from a desert in Ping Shan Hu county, typical steppe in Huanxian county and alpine meadow in Maqu county. The soil samples were subjected to the soil physiochemical fractionation to identify physically, chemically and biochemically protected and unprotected C. The soil bacterial and fungal communities were examined by DNA metabarcoding using Illumina sequencing, and redundancy analysis was used to identify microbial taxa with close associations with physically protected C and unprotected C. The alpine meadow consisted of the largest SOC stock, mostly physically protected (87.14 %), while also consisting of a large amount of unprotected C. Typical steppe and desert SOC stocks were smaller but the C was in chemically protected stable forms (86.25 % and 60.22 % respectively). The redundancy analysis identified bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and the fungal phyla Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota as microbial groups that were significantly related to physical C protection and unprotected C. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Carbon stabilization; Grasslands; Soil microbial community; Soil organic carbon pools; Soil organic carbon protection mechanisms","Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chytridiomycota; Matthiola; Proteobacteria; Verrucomicrobia; Zygomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098109784

Benefiting from the surficial Bi vacancies (VBi) and Bi−O vacancies (VBi−O) in this atomically thin architecture, the local atomic arrangement was tuned so that the subnanometer Ag/AgCl clusters were successfully incorporated. An enhancement of photocatalytic activity for NO removal was achieved in which the activity is 3 times higher than that of Bi12O17Cl2 and 1.8 times higher than that of defective Bi12O17Cl2.

The results showed the aerosol absorptions were observed approximately 5–8 times greater in winter (395 Mm−1 at 370 nm and 99 Mm−1 at 880 nm, respectively) than those in autumn (49 Mm−1 at 370 nm and 18 Mm−1 at 880 nm, respectively). BC was the dominant light absorbing carbonaceous component at all wavelengths (from 370 nm to 950 nm). BrC absorption (370 nm) maximized during winter with 41% of the total aerosol absorption, and was lower in autumn (16%). The light absorption contributions of primary BrC (BrCpri) were higher than that of secondary BrC (BrCsec) in four seasons, with more than 67% of total BrC light absorption. The seasonal absorption Ångström exponents (AAEs) of BrC, BrCpri, and BrCsec were directly derived with the highest values (3.91, 3.69, and 4.94, respectively) in wintertime. The BrCpri contributed much higher solar absorptions percentage to BC than BrCsec. The results underlined the primary emissions of urban BrCpri and BC, implying that the strategies of energy efficiency enhancement and energy structure reformation will be very important in reducing primary emissions in China. Such investigations should be conducted in other developing countries with severe air pollution. © 2020","Black carbon; Light absorption; Primary brown carbon; Secondary brown carbon","aerosol; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; brown carbon; radiative forcing; seasonal variation; urban pollution; urban site; wavelength; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097198354

Disrupting the intermolecular association of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) with its cell surface receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. The association is a typical peptide-mediated interaction, where the hACE adopts an α1-helix, which can form a two-helix bundle with the α2-helix, to pack against a flat pocket on the S protein surface. Here, we demonstrate that the protein context of full-length hACE plays an essential role in supporting the hACE2 α1-helix recognition by viral S protein. Energetic analysis reveals that the α1-helical peptide (αHP) and also the two-helix bundle peptide (tBP) cannot bind effectively to S protein when they are split from the hACE protein. The context contributes moderately and considerably to the direct readout (DR) and indirect readout (IR) of peptide recognition, respectively. Dynamics simulation suggests that the two free peptides exhibit a large intrinsic disorder without the support of protein context, which would incur a considerable entropy penalty upon binding to S protein. To restore the IR effect lost by splitting peptides from hACE, we herein propose employing hydrocarbon stapling and cyclization strategies to constrain the free αHP andtBP peptides into their native ordered conformations, respectively. The stapling and cyclization are carefully designed in order to avoid influencing the peptide DR effect, which has been demonstrated to improve the peptide binding affinity (but not specificity) to S protein. The stapling/cyclization-imposed conformational constraint can effectively minimize the unfavorable IR effect (i) by reducing the peptide flexibility and entropy cost upon their binding to S protein, and (ii) by helping peptide pre-folding into their native state to facilitate the conformational selection by S protein. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; hydrocarbon; peptide derivative; vitronectin; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; peptide; protein binding; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; viral protein; alpha helix; Article; binding affinity; cyclization; entropy; molecular dynamics; peptide analysis; process optimization; protein binding; protein conformation; protein folding; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; structure analysis; binding site; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Binding Sites; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Peptides; Protein Binding; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Viral Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099771449

This study considers the historical transfer of carbon emissions and measures the cumulative net carbon emissions of China's provinces based on the principle of consumer responsibility. It draws up an initial allocation plan for carbon emission rights in China's provinces in 2020, based on the principles of equity, efficiency, and sustainability. The carbon emission and carbon intensity efficiencies of the provinces under this distribution scheme were also evaluated. The results show that the historical net carbon export area mainly consists of energy-intensive provinces and economically underdeveloped poor and remote provinces. Additionally, the historical net carbon import area mainly consists of energy-starved and economically developed provinces. Provinces with high-value ecological services (Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia) or with large economies and dense populations (Shandong, Guangdong, and Sichuan) will receive higher carbon emission rights, while those with developed economies (Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin) will receive lower carbon emission rights. Provinces with a good ecological environment (Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang) as well as certain economically underdeveloped western provinces (Chongqing, Sichuan, and Yunnan) will have abundant carbon space in the future. Provinces with rapid economic development (Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu) and resource-based provinces (Shanxi and Liaoning) with a high historical carbon output have little carbon space. Considering the historical carbon transfer, the carbon emission rights allocation system will benefit resource-based industrial provinces (Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning) and less developed western provinces (Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Xinjiang) in improving their carbon emission efficiency. This study provides a new research idea for formulating a more equitable and efficient allocation scheme for carbon emission rights. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation scheme; Carbon emission rights; Efficiency evaluation; Historical carbon transfer; Initial allocation","Economics; Emission control; Sustainable development; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emission rights; Ecological services; Efficiency evaluation; Efficient allocations; Emission reduction targets; Good ecological environments; Initial allocations; Carbon; biomass allocation; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; emissions trading; equity; export; historical record; sustainability; Beijing [China]; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Heilongjiang; Jiangsu; Liaoning; Nei Monggol; Ningxia Huizu; Shaanxi; Shandong; Shanghai; Shanxi; Sichuan; Tianjin; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092307146

The 2019 modelling results showed good and reliable performance of the RAEMS in modelling PM2.5 concentrations over 55 cities in the YRD region. Herein, the analysis results indicated the importance of local emissions on PM2.5 concentration at both provincial and city scales, with contribution rates of 54%–65% and 62.3%−70.7%, respectively. The contribution of mutual inner-regional transport among provinces was clear, contributing varied proportions (1%–22%) among themselves and similar proportions (23%–29%) to the provincial city PM2.5 concentration. The cross-regional transport contributed from regions outside the YRD provided relatively weaker contributions of 3.3%–10.6%. However, this contribution doubled during cold air events. Note that the temporal trend of PM2.5 over Shanghai is largely dominated by the contributions from Zhejiang and Jiangsu, whereas the other provinces are highly self-dominated. In addition to controlling local emissions to decrease the PM2.5 pollution rate, varied effects were found by reducing inner-regional transport.

In the present study, N2O emissions from a pilot-scale Carrousel oxidation ditch under various chemical oxygen demand (COD) to nitrogen ratio (COD/N) and aeration rates were systematically investigated. The highest N2O emission factor was 0.142 ± 0.013%, at COD/N of 5 and aeration rate of 1.8 m3 h−1, which was much lower than the majority of previous studies. The results could be attributed to the high internal recycle ratio of the oxidation ditch process which lightened the burden of influent load to the system. The profiles of N2O emissions and dissolved N2O concentration along the channels showed a distinct spatial variation that N2O emissions primarily occurred in the aeration zones due to the air stripping effect. However, both the aeration and anoxic zones contributed to N2O generation due to autotrophic nitrification (AN), which was considered to be the main N2O generation process. In addition, two simulated shock-load conditions, ammonia overload shock and aeration failure shock, were carried out to explore the response of the biological nitrogen removal (BNR) system. The results indicated that both shock-loads lead to excessive N2O emissions, especially at higher aeration rates, which could be explained by the improved N2O generation by AN process during the shock-load period. This study offered new insights into the role of operational parameters to N2O emission and the alternative approach for N2O mitigation during both the steady-state operation and shock-load conditions in the oxidation ditch process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aeration failure shock; Ammonia overload shock; Nitrous oxide; Oxidation ditch","ammonia; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; aeration; ammonia; chemical oxygen demand; nitrification; oxidation; spatial variation; wastewater treatment plant; aeration; Article; autotrophy; chemical oxygen demand; effluent; nitrification; nitrogen concentration; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation; steady state; biochemical oxygen demand; bioreactor; denitrification; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096610376

Most major cities in China expand their subway systems to handle this problem. This study takes both long-and short-term effects of subway expansions on air quality and its corresponding health implications into account based on a network density-based time series analysis and a distance-based difference-in-differences analysis. The daily and hourly monitor-level air quality data on Nanjing from 13 May 2014 to 31 December 2018, combining with corresponding weather variables, are used to quantify the effect of subway expansions on local air pollution caused by eight new subway lines in Nanjing. The results reveal that subway expansions result in a statistically significant decrease in the air pollution level; specifically, the air pollution level experiences a 3.93% larger reduction in the areas close to subway lines. Heterogeneous analysis of different air pollutants indicates that the air pollution reduction effect of subway expansions is more significant in terms of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) and CO. A back-of-the-envelope analysis of the health benefits from this air improvement shows that the total number of yearly averted premature deaths is around 300,214 to 443,498. A set of alternative specifications confirm the robustness of our results. These results provide strong support for putting more emphasis on the environmental effect of subway expansions in the cost-benefit analysis of subway planning. © 2021 by the authors.

The inocula were derived from a treatment plant for treating pharmaceutical wastewater plus a small amount of municipal sewage (PMS), a treatment plant for treating fluoridated hydrocarbon wastewater (FHS), and a treatment plant for treating the comprehensive wastewater in an industrial park (CIS). There were slight differences among the degradation patterns of the 4-FA for the three inocula, whether during the enrichment period or the high concentration shock period. In contrast, it was observed that the degradation efficiency of 2,4-DFA initially varied with the inocula. The FHS-derived inoculum was determined to be optimal, exhibiting the earliest degradation reaction only after an acclimation of 7 days had the highest degradation rate constant of 0.519 h−1, and had the fastest recovery time of three weeks after high concentration shock. Additionally, compared with the PMS-derived inoculum, the CIS-derived inoculum exhibited an earlier degradation reaction within three weeks, and a higher microbial diversity, but a lower shock resistance and degradation rate constant of 0.257 h−1. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that each final consortium was different in composition, and the microbial consortia developed well on the inoculum and substrate. In comparison of the similarity among the three 2,4-DFA enrichment cultures, the higher similarity (63.9–70.0%) among three final consortia enriching with 4-FA was observed. The results indicated that the inoculum played an important role in the degradation of FAs and the microbial bacterial communities of final consortia, and the effect extent might well depend on the fluorinated level of FAs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","2,4-difluoroaniline; 4-fluoroaniline; Acclimation; Inoculum; Microbial community","Batch reactors; Degradation; Industrial water treatment; Rate constants; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Comprehensive wastewaters; Degradation efficiency; Degradation patterns; Degradation rate constants; High-throughput sequencing; Microbial communities; Pharmaceutical wastewater; Sequencing batch reactors; Sewage treatment plants; biodegradation; community structure; drug; industrial location; inoculation; microbial community; oxic conditions; sewage; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Bacteria (microorganisms); 2,4-difluoroaniline; 4-fluoroaniline; aniline derivative; bioreactor; bioremediation; microflora; sewage; Aniline Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Microbiota; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099096417

This is the first attempt to explore the latest features of carbon emission transmissions from electricity sector to the final domestic consumption of China in 2002–2015, combining MRIO-based Structural Path Analysis and transmission-based emission method. Results show that: (1) Although inter-provincial transmissions are increasing significantly, emission transmissions within intra-provincial trading are dominated. (2) 30 provinces are classified into two types, i.e., consumption centers and production centers. Both the inter-provincial transmission paths in consumption centers and production centers show the grid-level agglomeration and provincial heterogeneity. The inflow paths in consumption centers are mainly sourced from the production of Eastern China and South China, while the outflow paths for production centers are caused by the consumption in Central China, Guangdong and Jiangsu. Inter-provincial linkages are intensified and perform the feature of territorial propinquity. (3) Both intra-grid and inter-grid transmission nodes show an agglomeration trend of “electricity sector < intermediate sectors < electricity sector < consumption”. These intermediate sectors include manufacture sectors, energy-intensive sectors and service sector.

Most studies have focused on energy consumption control in a single region; however, high-resolution analysis of energy consumption and personalized energy policy-making, for multiple regions with differentiated development, have become a complicated challenge. Using the logarithmic mean Divisia index I (LMDI) decomposition method based on energy allocation analysis (EAA), this paper aims to establish a standard paradigm for a high-resolution analysis of multi-regional energy consumption and provide suggestions for energy policy-making, taking 29 provinces of China as the sample. The process involved three steps: (1) determination of regional priorities of energy consumption control by EAA, (2) revealing regional disparity among the driving forces of energy consumption growth by LMDI, and (3) deriving policy implications by comparing the obtained results with existing policies. The results indicated that 29 provinces can be divided into four groups, with different priorities of energy consumption control according to the patterns of coal flows. Most provinces have increasing levels of energy consumption, driven by increasing per capita GDP and improving living standards, while its growth is restrained by decreasing end-use energy intensity, improving energy supply efficiency, and optimization of industrial structures. However, some provinces are not following these trends to the same degree. This indicates that policy-makers must pay more attention to the different driving mechanisms of energy consumption growth among provinces. © 2021 by the authors.

Using a bottom-up methodology, the annual emissions of SO2, NOX, CO, NH3, primary fine particle matters (PM2.5), black carbon, and organic carbon were estimated to decline 70%, 22%, 49%, 72%, 64%, 65%, and 86%, respectively, while a slight increase was found for the non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during 2012–2016. The inter-annual change in NOX emissions was consistent with that in tropospheric NO2 column from satellite observation. Using air quality modeling (AQM), the city-scale emission inventory was further evaluated through comparisons between the simulated and observed concentrations of selected species. For SO2, NO2 and PM2.5, the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean errors (NMEs) for most cases were within 20% and 50% respectively, implying the reliability of the emission inventory. Regarding chemistry species, the modeling performance was better for sulfate and black carbon than nitrate and ammonium. From 2012 to 2016, the average of monthly PM2.5 concentrations for January, April, July, and October in Nanjing was found to decline 28% and 25% with AQM and ground observation, respectively, implying the benefit of emission control on aerosol pollution.

The results show that in 2015, the total ESV reached 2,239.56 billion yuan in Gansu Province, with ESV gradually increasing from the northeast to the southwest, and the high-value areas of service function being located in Qilian and Longnan Mountains. The forest and grassland ecosystems contributed the most to the ESV. From the perspective of value composition, local climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance functions are the main service functions of Gansu Province. From 2000 to 2015, ESV increased by 3.43 billion yuan in the province. The value of forest and urban ecosystems continued to increase, whereas the value of cultivated land ecosystem continued to decrease. In terms of spatial characteristics of the service value change, the area that experienced value reduction gradually moved from the central part of Gansu Province to the surrounding areas. The evaluation method proposed in this paper provides a relatively comprehensive evaluation scheme for the spatiotemporal dynamic evaluation of ESV in complex ecological environments. © 2021 Zhao et al.

Previous studies mainly focused on a single metabolic organ, and the difference in scaling exponents among different organs was insufficiently discussed. We systematically sampled 1532 shrub individuals grown under two habitats from 13 forest sites across eastern China, and measured the nutrient concentrations of different organs to explore the characteristics of the N vs. P scaling exponents and the underlying influencing factors. The N vs. P scaling exponents varied among shrub organs. Plant functional groups (PFGs), climate zones, soil nutrient status and habitats significantly affected the N vs. P scaling exponents. The N vs. P scaling exponents of stems and coarse roots for deciduous, legume and typical shrubs were higher than those of evergreen, non-legumes and understory shrubs, respectively, and were lower in tropical region than in other regions. Stems and coarse roots showed a resistant response to nutrient limitation and a compliant response to high nutrient availability. The N vs. P scaling exponents of leaves and fine roots were not affected by PFGs and were mainly controlled by soil P and N availability, respectively. Our results suggest that these variations in the N vs. P scaling exponents and their influencing factors among different plant organs should be considered when these exponents are used in stoichiometric growth models. These results advance our understanding of plant nutrient allocation strategy in response to functional groups and environmental changes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological stoichiometry; Nutrient allocation; Organs; Scaling exponent; Shrubs","Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Investments; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Environmental change; Nutrient concentrations; Nutrient limitations; Plant functional groups; Scaling exponent; Stoichiometric growth; Tropical regions; Vegetation productivity; Scaling laws; biomass allocation; concentration (composition); growth modeling; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; parameter estimation; phosphorus; shrub; trade-off; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092612250

Due to a poor understanding of water ecology and the extensive mining of salt resources, concerns are mounting about declining groundwater levels, shrinking salt marshes, and other problems associated with the simple yet extremely fragile water ecosystem of salt marshes in arid salt lake areas. This study assessed the ecological status of water resources in the downstream salt marsh area of West Taijinar Lake in the Qaidam Basin, China (2010-2018). Using data from a field investigation, the water ecosystem was divided into an ecological pressure subsystem, an environmental quality subsystem, and a socio-economic subsystem according to an analytic hierarchy process. Each subsystem was quantitatively assessed using the ecological footprint model, the single-factor index, and available data for the salt marsh area. The results showed that water resources were always in a surplus state during the study period, whose development and utilization had a safe status. Surface water had low plankton diversity with no evidence of eutrophication, but its Cl- and SO42- concentrations were too high for direct industrial water uses. Groundwater quality was classified into class V because of high salt concentrations, which could be considered for industrial use given the demand of industrial production. The socio-economic efficiency of water resources was high, as distinguished by decreased water consumption per 10,000 yuan GDP and excellent flood resistance. In conclusion, the ecological status of water resources was deemed good in the study area and this could help sustain regional development. However, since the water ecology in this area is mainly controlled by annual precipitation, it would be challenging to deal with the uneven distribution of precipitation and flood events and to make full use of them for groundwater recharge. This study provides insight into the impact of salt lake resource exploration on water ecology, and the results can be useful for the rational utilization of water resources in salt marshes in other arid areas. © 2021 Zhao et al.

Such projections are absent because of a near-universal lack of urban representation in global-scale Earth system models. Here, we combine climate modelling and data-driven approaches to provide global multi-model projections of urban climates over the twenty-first century. The results demonstrate the inter-model robustness of specific levels of urban warming over certain regions under climate change. Under a high-emissions scenario, cities in the United States, Middle East, northern Central Asia, northeastern China and inland South America and Africa are estimated to experience substantial warming of more than 4 K—larger than regional warming—by the end of the century, with high inter-model confidence.

However, it remains unclear whether the functions of these two cortical regions that are involved in emotional regulation, which are usually active in non-social situations, could be generalized to the regulation of social pain as well. This study employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the causal relationship between the DLPFC/VLPFC and the emotional regulation of social pain via distraction and reappraisal. Ninety human participants (45 males and 45 females) initially underwent either active (DLPFC/VLPFC, n=30/30) or sham (vertex, n=30) TMS sessions. Participants were then instructed to use both distraction and reappraisal strategies to downregulate any negative emotions evoked by social exclusion pictures. Convergent results of the subjective emotional rating and electrophysiological indices demonstrated that: (1) both the DLPFC and VLPFC highly facilitate the downregulation of affective responses caused by social exclusion, revealing a causal role of these lateral PFCs in voluntary emotional regulation of both non-social and social pain; and (2) these two cortical regions showed relative functional specificity for distraction (DLPFC) and reappraisal (VLPFC) strategies, which helps to refine the cortical targeting of therapeutic protocols. In addition, the TMS effect was sustainable for at least 1 h, showcasing the potential feasibility of using this method in clinical practice. Together, these findings provide cognitive and neural evidence for the targeting of the VLPFC and/or the DLPFC to improve emotional regulation abilities, especially in social contexts.

Exposure to extreme heat causes labor supply declines, but studies to quantify the economic effects from future climate changes are limited. In this study, we adopt two different exposure-response functions relating extreme heat to the loss of labor working minutes or labor productivity. We estimate that temperature differences between 2006 and 2016 relative to 1980–1990 led to labor losses of ~$1.7 billion annually in the USA. Under the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario, approximately 1–1.8 billion workforce hours will be lost annually in the 2050s, and 1.5–4.4 billion hours will be lost by the 2100s, depending on the exposure-response function used. The lost hours lead to an estimated $51–119 billion in losses by the 2100s, without considering future climate adaptation, demographic, employment, wage structure, or economic changes. Whereas 2006–2016 losses correspond to 0.07% of the 2016 GDP, the 2100s losses rise roughly fourfold to 0.3%, which are mainly caused by the increases of extreme heat conditions with population growth a secondary factor. With the climate change mitigation strategies of the RCP4.5 scenario, 600–2600 million hours of lost labor per year could be avoided in the 2100s, saving $20–78 billion depending on the chosen exposure-response function. We also evaluated the effect of decarbonizing the energy sector in a manner consistent with the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement, finding that these lead to ~77 million avoided lost work hours worth ~$2.5 billion annually by the 2050s with global collaboration but insignificant impacts with US action alone. Though uncertainties and limitations exist in the study, we find that extreme heat will cause large economic losses to US businesses, especially in southern states (from California to Florida), though widespread climate change mitigation has the potential to substantially reduce these losses. We find that uncertainties among the exposure-response functions used to derive the economic effects of extreme heat on labor are much larger than those from the climate models. Previous studies using only one exposure-response function may exhibit substantial biases and likely underestimate uncertainties associated with the effect of climate changes on labor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Extreme heat; Labor; Market cost; RCPs","Climate models; Economic and social effects; Employment; Losses; Population statistics; Productivity; Climate change mitigation; Future climate; Global collaboration; Heat conditions; Labor productivity; Population growth; Response functions; Temperature differences; Climate change; climate change; extreme event; Gross Domestic Product; heat flow; labor supply; mitigation; nature-society relations; population growth; wage; California; Florida [United States]; France; Ile de France; Paris; United States; Ville de Paris; Florida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100864400

Synthetical assessment of coastal vulnerability is crucial for effective interventions and long-term planning. However, there have been few studies based on integrative analyses of ecological and physical characteristics and socioeconomic conditions in urban coastal areas. This study developed a holistic framework for assessing coastal vulnerability from three dimensions - biophysical exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity - and applied it to the coast of Bohai Economic Rim, an extensive and important development zone in China. A composite vulnerability index (CVI) was developed for every 1 km2 segment of the total 5627 km coastline and the areas that most prone to coastal hazards were identified by mapping the distribution patterns of the CVIs in the present and under future climate change scenarios. The CVIs show a spatial heterogeneity, with higher values concentrated along the southwestern and northeastern coasts and lower values concentrated along the southern coasts. Currently, 20% of the coastlines with approximately 350,000 people are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards. With sea-level rises under the future scenarios of the year 2100, more coastlines will be highly vulnerable, and the amount of highly-threatened population was estimated to increase by 13–24%. Among the coastal cities, Dongying was categorized as having the highest vulnerability, mainly due to poor transportation and medical services and low GDP per capita, which contribute to low adaptive capacity. Our results can benefit decision-makers by highlighting prioritized areas and identifying the most important determinants of priority, facilitating location-specific interventions for climate-change adaptation and sustainable coastal management. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Coastal zone management; InVEST; Sea level rise; Vulnerability assessment","Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Decision making; Hazards; Landforms; Sea level; Climate change adaptation; Distribution patterns; Integrative analysis; Physical characteristics; Socio-economic conditions; Spatial heterogeneity; Synthetical assessment; Vulnerability index; Climate change; climate change; coastal zone; coastal zone management; holistic approach; human activity; sea level change; three-dimensional modeling; vulnerability; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; economic development; gross national product; priority journal; sea level rise; seashore; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; acclimatization; city; human; Bohai Rim; China; China; Acclimatization; China; Cities; Climate Change; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098510746

This article assesses the impact of population, energy taxes, and energy prices on greenhouse gas emissions from the residential and industrial energy consumption in Europe. The paper establishes a theoretical framework that predicts that rising energy prices and increased energy taxes will reduce residential and industrial GHG emissions. According to this framework, it is expected that the labor force will have an impact on industrial greenhouse gas emissions depending on wages elasticity. Between 2007 and 2017, panel data from 21 European countries were used to test the proposed hypothesis. First, a complete sample test was conducted. The results confirmed the proposed hypothesis. In addition, it was found that the size of the population increased residential greenhouse gas emissions, while the urbanization process reduced these emissions. Next, the sample was divided according to the economic development level. The split sample analysis shows the regional heterogeneity of population factors and energy costs impacts on GHG emissions.

Herein, time-dependent density functional theory and reduced two-state model are adopted to investigate the photoinduced charge transfer in interfaces. According to the excitation energy and orbital coupling, the light driven mechanism of CO2RR on gold nanoparticles can be described as follows: the light induces electron excitation and then transfers to the physisorbed CO2, and CO2 can relax to a bent structure adsorbed on gold nanoparticles, and the adsorbed C-O bonds are dissociated finally. Moreover, our calculated results demonstrate that the s, p, and d electron excitations of gold nanoparticles are the major contribution for the CO2 adsorption and the C-O dissociation process, respectively.

However, the air quality co-benefits of differentiated policies remain unclear. Here we combine a multi-regional dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and an extend response surface model (ERSM) to investigate the impact of nationally uniform and subnationally differentiated carbon pricing policies on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in China. All policies examined lead to the same accumulated national CO2 emissions (2020–2050), with the 2030 emissions attaining China's national abatement target. We find that, when subnational policies differentiated according to provincial PM2.5 concentrations are implemented, the higher-than-average carbon price over more polluted provinces results in twice as much reduction in CO2 and air pollutant emissions in 2050 as the national policy. As a result, the subnational policies cause larger PM2.5 concentration reductions in these provinces (9%–18%) than the national policy (7%–11%). Also, the subnational policies eliminate high PM2.5 exposure of over 45 μg/m3 which 12% people suffer from under the national policy. The subnational policies substantially reduce regional disparity in PM2.5 pollution and hence improve environmental equity. The results suggest that subnationally differentiated carbon policies are a promising instrument to mitigate severe pollution and promote environmental equity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Co-benefits; Differentiated carbon policy; Environmental equity; Multi-regional CGE model; PM2.5","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Pollution control; Air pollutant emission; Computable general equilibrium model; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); National policies; PM2.5 concentration; Regional disparities; Regional dynamics; Response surface modeling; Carbon; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; concentration (composition); numerical model; particulate matter; policy approach; pollution tax; pricing policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097473458

Here, we employed a atmospheric chemistry-climate model and modified two crop models with considering the effects of diffuse fertilization and ozone, which were validated by multiple observations. Using the state-of-the-art modeling approach, we assess effects of ozone and aerosols on rice and wheat under two contrasting air pollution emission scenarios in China, rigorous emission controls versus current legislation. Currently, ozone and aerosol pollution together induces 11.3% yield losses for rice and 14.6% for wheat. Following the current legislation scenario, we simulate additional yield declines of 5.4% for rice and 0.4% for wheat. However, implementation of maximum feasible technological reductions in emissions relative to the current legislation scenario avoids rice and wheat yield losses by 14–15%, economically equivalent to 18.9 billion USD. Such remarkable benefits are primarily from ozone controls, whose mitigating effect is approximately double that of the aerosol reductions. This demonstrates that reprioritizing air pollution control targets from particulate aerosols alone to both aerosols and ozone can substantially alleviate crop losses in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol; Atmospheric chemistry model; Crop model; Diffuse radiation; Ozone","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Atmospheric chemistry; Climate models; Crops; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Chemistry-climate models; Mitigating effects; Ozone concentration; Particulate matter pollution; Policy scenario; Pollution emissions; Rice and wheat yield; State of the art; Air pollution; ozone; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; crop yield; environmental legislation; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution policy; wheat; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; controlled study; crop production; fertilizer application; harvest; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; wheat; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099822004

While previous studies have measured spatial carbon inequality and identified its drivers, few studies have explored these drivers at a sectorial level. Taking China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as a case study example, this study explores the drivers of spatial carbon inequality at the sectoral level and reveals the following key points. (1) The regional heterogeneity in CO₂ emissions driven by economic factors have increased from 2002 to 2012. (2) The wide spatial differences in CO₂ emissions are driven by per capita final demand, production structure, and final demand structure. (3) Driven by emission intensity, the production structure, and the final demand structure effects, the Electricity and heat production and supply, Smelting and pressing of metals, and Nonmetal mineral products have become the most critical sectors aggravating the spatial carbon inequality. (4) Driven by the production structure and final demand structure, most of the middle and lower reaches of the YREB emit more CO₂ in the aforementioned sectors. Our findings support the implementation of coordinated emission reduction plans in the YREB region. © 2020 The Authors","CO₂ emissions; Drivers; Inequality; Spatial structural decomposition analysis; Yangtze River economic Belt","Carbon; Emission control; Demand structures; Economic factors; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Emission reduction targets; Mineral products; Production structures; Spatial differences; Mineral industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095616146

This article quantifies the indirect effects on energy usage and PM 2.5 emissions of urban and rural residents' lifestyles in China during 2005–2015 according to the application of consumer lifestyle analysis. The results show that during this period, the degree of indirect impact on energy consumption of residents' living was 2.44–2.71 times as of direct impact, and there are large regional differences between those two impacts. PM 2.5 emissions from energy consumption per unit of households in North, Northeast and Northwest China are higher than that in other regions, while energy consumption in South China is relatively environmentally friendly. Residential, clothing and transportation are the most energy-intensive and PM 2.5-intensive activities among all indirect energy consumption activities. This is the first time that the CLA method has been used to analyze and calculate PM2.5 emissions caused by household energy consumption in a wide area of China through data collection over a longer period. The calculation results are more accurate than previous studies using other methods. Also, it provides factual evidence for key policies of energy saving and environmental protection, as well as pointing out the main sectors of household energy consumption that caused high PM 2.5 emissions for specific regions.

An obvious absorption enhancement in the near infrared region exhibited in UV-vis absorption spectra and a significant ESR signal at g=2.003 proves the existence of O vacancies. The abundant oxygen vacancies ensure that Faraday efficiency of WO3-OV gets improved to 25.45 % at −0.3 V (vs RHE), much superior to K-WO3 (FE: 9.33 %).

Through the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that the air quality of Urumqi in winter is poor and the concentration of pollutants is high. The energy control during the closing period played a positive role in pollutant emission reduction and effectively improved the quality of atmospheric environment. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Air quality; Disease control; Emission control; Energy utilization; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollutant concentrations; Atmospheric environment; Atmospheric pollutants; Pollutant emission; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101561469

The objective of this paper was to develop measurement models for the carbon dioxide emission factors of passenger cars. Road systems of downtown areas of four typical Chinese counties were explored and 12 types of basic road networks were recognized and defined. With PTV Vissim, microscopic traffic simulation models were set up for every type of basic road network, average speeds of the simulated cars were collected, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated using MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) software. For model development, the paper put forth two compound explanatory variables: the weighted average of segment lengths and the sum of critical ratios of volume to saturation flow rate. Six functional relationships for the variables were tested and the double exponential function was proven to be the most appropriate. Finally, for each of the 12 types of basic road networks, a measurement model for carbon dioxide emission factors was calibrated using the double exponential function for the variables. The measurement models can be used to estimate the carbon dioxide emissions of passenger cars concerning potential improvement schemes impacting traffic demand and/or traffic supply. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we focused on the five types of extreme agrometeorological events that greatly affect maize production in Northeast China, including chilling injury, drought, rainstorm, frost, and gale. We averaged the actual timing of phenological events from the study agrometeorological stations and divided the maize growing season into four growth stages: emergence—jointing, jointing—flowering, flowering—kernel milk, and kernel milk—physiological maturity. Based on the historical weather data from 1960 to 2017 in the study region, we derived the values of pertinent indices for the five types of study extreme agrometeorological events during the four selected maize growth stages. The results showed that chilling injury and drought were relatively more frequent during the four growth stages of maize from 1960 to 2017 in the Northeast China. As time goes on during the growing season of maize, the spatial coverage of chilling injury, frost, and gale all showed a decreasing trend. By contrast, the spatial coverage of drought showed an increasing trend during the study growth stages of maize. During growth stages of maize, chilling injury was the main extreme agrometeorological event before the 2000s, while drought became the main extreme agrometeorological event after the 2000s. Identifying the main extreme climate events that could cause yield loss is imperative, and it is important for farmers to acknowledge ongoing changes in these extreme climate events in order to take preventive measures if necessary. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"agrometeorology; crop production; drought; extreme event; growing season; growth response; maize; phenology; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096301788

The energy consumption related to land urbanization makes an important contribution to the increase in carbon emissions. In this study, an IPAT/Kaya identity model is used to understand how land urbanization affected carbon emissions in Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang, the three major cities in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from 2000 to 2017. Following the core idea of the Kaya identity model, sources of carbon emissions are decomposed into eight factors: urban expansion, economic level, industrialization, population structure, land use, population density, energy intensity, and carbon emission intensity. Furthermore, using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI), we analyze how the different time periods and time series driving forces, especially land urbanization, affect regional carbon emissions. The results indicate that the total area of construction land and the total carbon emissions increased from 2000 to 2017, whereas the growth in carbon emissions decreased later in the period. Energy intensity is the biggest factor in restraining carbon emissions, followed by population density. Urban expansion is more significant than economic growth in promoting carbon emissions, especially in Nanchang. In contrast, the carbon emission intensity has little influence on carbon emissions. Changes in population structure, industrial level, and land use vary regionally and temporally over the different time period. © 2021 by the authors.

China has experienced rapid growth in pollution emissions, energy consumption, and the effects of climate change. To achieve pollution reduction and energy savings targets, China's green loan policy implements a financing–pollution emissions reduction strategy for Chinese firms. Employing a difference-in-difference estimation method, we use Jiangsu Province manufacturing firm data for the period 2005 to 2013 to evaluate the effect of financing–pollution emission reduction policy tools on firm performance. Our analysis yields the following results. First, the financing–emission reduction policy has a “punishment” effect on highly polluting firm performance, including total factor productivity, profitability, and sales growth. Second, we find that these negative effects are weakened in dynamic processes. Further, pollution emissions are significantly reduced. Third, financial constraints act as the mechanism through which firm performance is punished, via the financial–emission reduction policy. Short-term and long-term bank financing decrease, while working capital and trade credit are increased to finance investment. Finally, with regard to ownership structure, state-owned firm performance is more likely to be penalized than other forms of ownership. © 2020","Difference-in-difference; Financial constraints; Financial–emission reduction policy; Firm performance","climate change; economic development; estimation method; manufacturing; ownership; pollution control; profitability; strategic approach; sustainability; total factor productivity; article; China; finance; investment; productivity; punishment; China; economic development; industry; policy; pollution; China; Jiangsu; China; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096369320

This situation arises most commonly when the vehicle is first started after overnight. To quantify emissions attributable to vehicle starts, a sizable collection of on-road commercial vehicle operating data is analyzed to identify start-up events and inspect associated emissions. Data was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Fleet DNA and from the Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT). Included are 500 + diesel vehicles with more than 42,000 recorded days, drawn from 25 vocational categories across the United States. Analysis shows that vehicle behavior, in terms of engine cold- and warm-operation, starts per day, soak time, and warm-up duration, differs significantly between vehicle vocations. Also, weighting factors for cold- and hot-starts currently used in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for heavy-duty emissions certification accurately represent real-world operations. Although the FTP includes a comparable fraction of cold operation, the hot fraction is much shorter than real-world operation due to limited test duration. The investigation also revealed that real-world engines operate for a significant amount of time when the engine coolant is in the “hot-stabilized” region, but the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) temperature is below its effective operating temperature of 200 °C. Of the vehicles under investigation, almost 20% of their operational time is within this condition. Thus, novel approaches to raise and maintain SCR temperature are highly required to further reduce engine emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cold start; Commercial vehicle; Federal Test Procedure; In-Use data; Selective catalytic reduction","Automobiles; Commercial vehicles; Diesel engines; Employment; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Selective catalytic reduction; Environmental researches; Federal test procedures; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Operating temperature; Real world operations; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Vehicle behavior; Weighting factors; Commercial vehicle operations; accuracy assessment; certification; diesel engine; road transport; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099516226

The results showed that most areas of Yantai belonged to the ecological surplus area, which were important sources of carbon sequestration services. Ecological compensation was needed, with a total amount of about 2.2 billion yuan. Qixia, Muping and Penglai had greater comparative ecological radiation force (CERF), and the total amount of carbon sequestration services transferred to the external areas was large.

A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select districts, kebeles, and sample respondents. Vulnerability as expected poverty approach was used to measure household-level vulnerability. Logit model was also used to assess factors contributing to households’ vulnerability. The study revealed that 73% of households were vulnerable to climate-induced shocks. Households with better farm experience, land size, livestock ownership, access to credit, access to extension service, social capital, access to climate information, non-farm income, and headed by a male were not vulnerable to climate change; whereas households who were living in low and midland agro-ecologies, far from the market, and participating in productive safety-net programs were vulnerable to climate change. The study indicated that the vulnerability of smallholder farmers was sensitive to the minimum income required to maintain daily life.

We use aircraft-based top-down measurements at the regional and facility-levels to determine emissions. Satellite data (TROPOMI CH4 data and VIIRS night-time flare data) provide independent estimates of emissions over 2 years. Our airborne estimate of the offshore region’s emissions is 2800 kg CH4 h−1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1700–3900 kg CH4 h−1), more than an order of magnitude lower than the Mexican national greenhouse gas inventory estimate. In contrast, emissions from the onshore study region are 29 000 kg CH4 h−1 (95% CI: 19 000–39 000 kg CH4 h−1), more than an order of magnitude higher than the inventory. One single facility—a gas processing complex that receives offshore associated gas—emits 5700 kg CH4 h−1 (CI: 3500–7900 kg CH4 h−1), with the majority of those emissions related to inefficient flaring and representing as much as half of Mexico’s residential gas consumption. This facility was responsible for greater emissions than the entirety of the largest offshore production region, suggesting that offshore-produced associated gas is being transported onshore where it is burned and in the process some released to the atmosphere. The satellite-based data suggest even higher emissions for the onshore region than did the temporally constrained aircraft data (&gt;20 times higher than the inventory). If the onshore production region examined is representative of Mexican production generally, then total CH4 emissions from Mexico’s oil and gas production would be similar to, or higher than, the official inventory, despite the large overestimate of offshore emissions. The main driver of inaccuracies in the inventory is the use of generic, non-Mexican specific emission factors. Our work highlights the need for local empirical characterization of emissions if effective emissions mitigation is to be undertaken. © 2021 The Author(s).

Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pools; Carbon sequestration; Pasture; Restoration ecology; Tropical forest","Carbon; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Global warming; Importance sampling; Isotopes; Lakes; Land use; Magnesium; Plants (botany); Restoration; Soils; Brazilian Atlantic forests; Carbon sequestration; Ecological dynamics; Ecological restoration; Environmental services; Passive restorations; Restoration techniques; Southeastern Brazil; Conservation; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094908471

Using the provincial panel data during 2000–2016 of China’s industrial sector, this paper first used a gravity model to study the spatial distribution and center of gravity of industrial CO2 emissions. Then, an integrated decomposition approach based on Shephard distance functions was adopted to study the driving factors of industrial carbon intensity. Results indicate that during 2000–2016, industrial CO2 emissions center of gravity gradually moved to the west. China’s industrial carbon intensity achieved considerable decline, with the annual change rate of 8.27%. The energy intensity decline, technology progresses of both production and energy saving were the most important factors facilitating carbon intensity decline. However, energy structure adjustment exerted positive effects in carbon intensity increase, although its effects were minor. Industrial carbon intensity witnessed decrease in almost all provinces except Xinjiang. The effects resulted from various factors were also different across provinces. Finally, suggestions were proposed to further decrease industrial carbon intensity. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon intensity; Center of gravity; Efficiency improvement; Industrial emission mitigation; Technological progress","carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; industrial emission; mitigation; panel data; spatial distribution; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; industry; technology; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Industry; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094827379

Although many studies have been conducted on the Ganga basin, however, trend observed in flow and sediment yield in Ganga River has been scarcely studied. Alteration in flow pattern and sediment transport in rivers brings remarkable impact on river geomorphology and entire ecosystem of the region. The present paper attempts to identify trends observed in Ganga River in terms of annual maximum and annual minimum discharges, water and sediment yield during monsoon season. The trend analysis was accomplished by performing the Mann-Kendall (M-K), Sen’s slope, and innovative trend analysis at various gauging sites along the river for the monsoon months. Significance of trend tests were tested at 5% significance level. Innovative trend analysis (ITA) revealed non-monotonicity within the time series and provided more detailed understanding of changes in hydrological changes. While observed annual maximum discharge showed a negative trend at almost all the sites, annual minimum discharge showed positive trend at gauging sites upstream of confluence of Yamuna River. Data of discharge and sediment load for monsoon months also revealed declining trends at most of the gauging sites. Water and sediment yields at all sites except Gandhighat showed a negative trend. Decline in trend of sediment and water yield is more pronounced in Western Ganga Plain (WGP) as compared to Eastern Ganga Plain (EGP). Incorporating these trends can be helpful for various water management projects in the future. Both climatic factors and human intervention appear to be responsible for the alteration in flow pattern of Ganga River. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Ganga River; Innovative trend analysis; Mann-Kendall test; Sen’s slope; Trend analysis","confluence; flow pattern; fluvial geomorphology; hydrological regime; parameterization; river basin; sediment analysis; sediment transport; time series analysis; trend analysis; Ganges River; India; Yamuna River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099822803

In this context, the present study was carried out at farmer’s field in central Kashmir region of India with the aim to acknowledge the potential of apple based agroforestry system for biomass production and carbon stock assessment for climate change mitigation. For conducting the study four intercrops viz., rajmash (Phaseolus vulgaris), green gram (Vigna radiata), french bean (P. vulgaris) and oats (Avena sativa) were intercropped with 11-year-old plantation of apple. The maximum total crop biomass was registered under control french bean and oats (7.85 t ha−1). Overall highest values of total biomass were observed under agroforestry system of apple + rajmash and Oats. The treatment, apple + rajmash and oats displayed highest values for both total tree biomass (29.16 t ha−1) and overall biomass of system (33.00 t ha−1). Maximum value of soil organic carbon (46.02 t ha−1) was observed under apple + green gram and oats. The highest ecosystem carbon was stored in the treatment involving the tree crop combination of apple + rajmash and oats (64.18 t ha−1) and is around 1.5 to 2 times higher than agriculture based system. The total ecosystem carbon in apple based land use system ranged between 53.23 and 64.18 t ha−1. These agroforestry systems in Himalayas can go a long way in augmenting the overall production and productivity by satisfying the rural livelihoods besides acting as effective carbon sink through carbon stockpiling and sequestration. The outcome of the present study can be significant in selecting different crop combinations for fruit based land use systems, future carbon studies, climate change contemplates, soil carbon stock estimation and land use planning along the lines of REDD + activities in other fragile Himalayan ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate; Crop combination; Fruit; Himalayas; Soil organic carbon","agroforestry; biomass; carbon sequestration; cereal; climate change; farming system; fruit; intercropping; land use planning; livelihood; mitigation; rural area; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Himalayas; Jammu and Kashmir; Avena sativa; Phaseolus vulgaris; Vigna radiata; Vigna radiata var. radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099064583

Its ecological restoration, economic development, and social progress are directly related to realizing China's national sustainable development goals (SDGs). With intensive field investigations, comprehensive analyses of statistical data, remote sensing data, and local monitoring data, this current research explored the achievements in local ecological restoration and economic development, discussed the main problems faced by the LP, and assessed the sustainable development status of the LP. Moreover, drawing from a 3C system approach (classification–coordination–collaboration), this research proposed the sustainable development strategies for more sustainable LP. We found that the LP's ecological restoration and economic development made remarkable achievements since 2000. However, the environment was still fragile and regional development was still lagging behind. In realizing SDGs, further improvements on clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, and climate action are needed. Coordinated and collaborated efforts are expected from multiple hierarchical levels including household, watershed, region, and nation in developing LP.

Generally, GPFs can be placed after a three-way catalysts (TWC) in the same can, or in a separate can downstream. As typical wall-flow filters, particulate matter is removed from the exhaust by physical filtration using a honeycomb structure similar to an emissions catalyst substrate but with the channels blocked at alternate ends. The goal of work was to the study the filtration efficiency and regeneration capacity of the GPF. Laboratory emission tests were carried out for one 2.0L gasoline turbo direct injection (GTDI) prototype vehicle according to the new World Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC). The data showed that the vehicle has a reliable and high GPF filtration efficiency to intercept the particulate pollution from the exhaust. Meanwhile, five 2.0L GTDI prototype cars from respective China stage 6 platforms were used for further study of soot accumulation and regeneration capacity. The results, in terms of modeled emissions in tests under real driving conditions of China cities (Nanjing and Hainan), showed that the heavy traffic road conditions lead to a low probability of soot regeneration. However, the GPF regeneration capacity of the test convoy was still adequate. In addition, the drive cycle exhibiting good road conditions with more aggressive driving behaviors offered a better regeneration environment due to the elevated GPF temperature and more frequent occurrence of deceleration fuel shut off (DFSO) creating an environment of excess oxygen content. © IMechE 2020.","China stage 6 emission regulation; filtration efficiency; Gasoline engine; gasoline particulate filter; regeneration","Catalysts; Digital storage; Direct injection; Efficiency; Gasoline; Honeycomb structures; Light weight vehicles; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; Roads and streets; Soot; Wall flow; Aggressive driving behaviors; Filtration efficiency; Particulate matter emissions; Particulate pollution; Regeneration capacity; Standard technology; Three way catalysts; Turbo direct injections; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092394919

Using an unbalanced panel data of firms and a newly constructed provincial EPU index in China, this paper estimates the impact of EPU on manufacturing firms' carbon emission intensity. We further test the likely channels through which EPU can affect firm emission intensity, including the innovation channel, share of fossil fuels in the total energy consumption channel, and energy intensity channel. The findings show that China's provincial EPU imposes a significantly positive impact on firms' carbon emission intensity. The channel analysis shows that EPU influences carbon emission intensity through the share of fossil fuels in the total energy consumption and energy intensity in the short run, but not firm innovation. The results indicate that manufacturing firms prefer to use cheap and dirty fossil fuels to respond to the rising EPU. This paper suggests that policymakers should pay careful attention to the increasing effect of EPU on carbon emission intensity which could undermine China's emission reduction efforts and other sustainable development goals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; China; Economic policy uncertainty; Energy intensity; Fossil fuel consumption","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Manufacture; Planning; Carbon emission intensities; Channel analysis; Economic policies; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Increasing effect; Manufacturing firms; Total energy consumption; Fossil fuels; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; manufacturing; Sustainable Development Goal; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098217545

Despite the high abundance of coarse litter (woody debris and coarse roots) in forest ecosystems, most studies have focused on linkages between fine litter (leaves and fine roots) and N dynamics and/or the soil microbial community. Methods: We investigated the association of fine and coarse litter with soil microbial biomass, community structure, and N mineralization at upper and lower slope positions on sedimentary rocks in a temperate forest dominated by Fagus crenata. Results: Greater coarse litter abundance and litter C-to-N ratio, and lower soil microbial biomass, bacterial abundance, and N mineralization potential were found in upper positions than in lower positions. Among litter traits, coarse litter abundance and litter C-to-N ratio were the best predictors of the microbial biomass and fungal-to-bacterial dominance, possibly due to differences in climatic stress among plant communities. Microbial traits were the best predictors of N mineralization potential. Conclusions: Fine litter traits and coarse litter abundance are likely linked to soil microbial characteristics and N mineralization in natural forests with variable topography. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bacteria; Coarse litter; Fungi; Microbial biomass; Nitrogen mineralization; Topography","abundance; bacterium; biomass; community structure; dominance; fungus; litter; microbial community; mineralization; nitrogen; plant community; sedimentary rock; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fagus crenata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095687609

In order to meet its 2030 carbon emission reduction pledges, the Chinese government has announced plans for a fully implementable national carbon ETS after 2020. This scheme is set to become the world’s most significant carbon trading market and it could cover half of all Chinese CO2 emissions (as much as 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide). In this study, we qualitatively analyze the Chinese ETS through the lens of three interconnected themes—equity, innovation, and awareness—which are disaggregated into six specific dimensions. We then explore these themes and dimensions with a mixed methods and original research design involving a survey of 68 Chinese experts as well as 34 semi-structured research interviews with respondents from local governments, financial institutions, technology service companies, universities, industries, and civil society groups. We find that uneven economic and social growth could exacerbate any initial permits allocation scheme that could be a cornerstone for an ETS. Substantial technological and institutional uncertainties exist that could also hamper development and enforcement. Low or negative awareness among the public and private sector were identified as also being significant barriers for ETS implementation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon trading; Climate policy; Emissions trading schemes; Energy justice; Equity","Carbon dioxide; Service industry; Surveys; Carbon emission reductions; Chinese Government; Emissions Trading Scheme; Financial institution; Public and private sector; Research designs; Social acceptance; Technology service; Emission control; carbon emission; civil society; economic growth; emissions trading; innovation; private sector; questionnaire survey; uncertainty analysis; China; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100687784

The impacts of the COVID-19 quarantine on the decline in fine particulate matter (PM2:5) were quantitatively assessed based on numerical simulations and observations in February. Relative to both February 2017 and the climate mean, anomalous southerlies and moister air occurred in the east of China in February 2020, which caused considerable PM2:5 anomalies. Thus, it is a must to disentangle the contributions of stable meteorology from the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown. The contributions of routine emission reductions were also quantitatively extrapolated. The toplevel emergency response substantially alleviated the level of haze pollution in the east of China. Although climate variability elevated the PM2:5 by 29% (relative to 2020 observations), a 59%decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a 20% decline from the expected pollution regulation dramatically exceeded the former in North China. The COVID-19 quarantine measures decreased the PM2:5 in the Yangtze River Delta by 72 %.

LFG emission and diffusion mechanisms were evaluated using static flux chambers and laboratory-scale diffusion columns. Overall, the greatest CH4 and CO2 emissions were consistently observed from the 200-mm-thick cover soil with an average flux rate of 39.2 mg m−2 h−1 and 3.07 × 103 mg m−2 h−1, respectively. In addition to CH4 and CO2, H2S migration through a 450-mm interim cover soil was also evaluated. The H2S emission rate was relatively more uniform at an average of 2.47 × 10−5 mg m−2 h−1. Long-term LFG emission was predicted using an emission model based on a first-order decomposition rate equation and compared with the static flux chamber method. The field-measured CO2, CH4 and H2S emissions were less than the estimated emissions from the emission model, by 22%, 85%, and 91%, respectively. Further, the diffusion coefficients of CH4, CO2, and H2S for the interim cover soils were determined using a laboratory-scale diffusion column test and compared with a three-parameter diffusion model. The measured and estimated diffusion coefficients for the three landfill gases were within the 10% variation limits. Based on these findings, the LFG emission rate varied depending on the physical-chemical properties of the cover soil (e.g., cover thickness, moisture content, compaction ratio, uneven distribution of soil), organic material content and age of buried refuse, and seasonal environmental conditions (such as temperature). Test results showed that fugitive CH4 emissions can be reduced one fourth by utilizing an appropriate cover soil (300-mm to 450-mm, CL) compared to cases with a thinner cover soil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cover soil; Diffusion coefficient; Emission rate; Landfill gas; Municipal solid waste; Static flux chamber","carbon dioxide; ferrous sulfide; methane; methane; carbon dioxide; compaction; concentration (composition); environmental conditions; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; Article; carbon footprint; decomposition; diffusion; diffusion coefficient; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; gas; landfill; mathematical model; moisture; municipal solid waste; physical chemistry; soil; soil compaction; static flux chamber; gas; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Gases; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097053700

Amid many hindrances, poor governance has been identified as one of the most pressing reasons for ineffective action to tackle multifaceted and integrative climate-water issues in Pakistan. This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects. In conclusion, a four-dimensional governance strategy, encompassing leadership, policy, institutions, and stakeholders is proposed to improve water sector resilience and adaptation to combat climate change in Pakistan. © 2021 The Authors.","Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climate governance; Policymaking; Resilience; Water governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101347350

In this study, taking the Low-carbon Pilot Program introduced in 2010 by the central government as an exogenous natural experiment, we investigate the impact of carbon regulation on the operating performance of SOEs by using the difference-in-differences (DID) strategy for the first time. We conduct a series of robustness tests on the estimated results, including a placebo test by changing the control group, a parallel trend test by advancing the introduction time of the policy, and an interference elimination of the self-selection bias by using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Furthermore, we examine the heterogeneous effects with regard to carbon intensity reduction targets. Finally, we use the heterogeneous stochastic frontier analysis method to measure the technical efficiency and analyze the influential mechanism of carbon regulation on the performance of SOEs. The results show that the carbon regulation policy significantly reduces the operating performance of SOEs. Through a series of robustness tests, we find that this conclusion is reliable. The higher the carbon intensity reduction target set by the central government is, the greater the negative impact of the carbon regulation policy on the performance of SOEs will be. Under the constraints of climate policies, SOEs acquire additional credit resources and launch a great quantity of inefficient investment. These actions inhibit the improvement of firms' technical efficiency and reduce the operating performance of SOEs. Therefore, the central government should strive to promote R&D activities related to low-carbon technology and improve the technical efficiency of SOEs when introducing any low-carbon policy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon regulation; Difference-in-differences; Heterogeneous stochastic frontier analysis; Low-carbon pilot program; Operating performance of SOEs; Propensity score matching","Climate change; Efficiency; Public policy; Stochastic systems; Carbon intensity reductions; Difference-in-differences; Interference elimination; Low-carbon technologies; Propensity score matching; State owned enterprise; Stochastic frontier analysis; Unintended consequences; Carbon; carbon emission; efficiency measurement; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; policy development; research and development; state owned enterprise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098090112

Elucidating the structure and reaction mechanisms of electrocatalysts at electrode-electrolyte interfaces is fundamental for advancing renewable energy technologies, including fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO2 reduction, and batteries, among others. One of the fundamental challenges in electrocatalysis is understanding how to activate and sustain electrocatalytic activity, under operating conditions, for extended time periods and with optimal activity and selectivity. Although traditional ex situ methods have provided a baseline understanding of heterogeneous (electro)catalysts, they cannot provide real-time interfacial structural and compositional changes under reaction conditions, which calls for the use of in situ/operando methods. Herein, we provide a selective review of in situ and operando characterizations, in particular, the use of operando synchrotron-based X-ray techniques and in situ atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in liquid/gas phases to advance our understanding of electrode-electrolyte interfaces at macro- A nd microscopic levels, which dictate the charge transfer kinetics and overall reaction mechanisms. The use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) enables direct probing of the local activity of electrocatalysts at the nanometer scale. In addition, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and the electrochemical quartz crystal balance (EQCM) enable the simultaneous identification of multiple reaction intermediates and products for mechanistic studies of electrocatalyst selectivity and durability. We anticipate that continuous advances of in situ/operando techniques and probes will continue to make significant contributions to establishing structure/composition-reactivity correlations of electrocatalysts at unprecedented atomic-scale and molecular levels under realistic, real-time reaction conditions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

However, air pollution remained significant, arousing questions about its causes and reawakening debate over the country's ultralow emission (ULE) policy. Here, we analyze the characteristics and causes of China's air pollution during this period to assess ULE's effectiveness. We find that the concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5, PM10), NO2, and CO in Wuhan decreased significantly during the lockdown. However, O3 and SO2 concentrations increased, though to different extents. The ULE policy promoted emission reductions, but emissions from coal-fired industries (e.g., thermal power and steel) remained the fundamental source of air pollution and appeared to have been underestimated in previous researches. In contrast, emissions from construction and transportation and the ULE's effectiveness may have been overestimated. The characteristics of air pollution in southern and northern cities support these conclusions. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the adjustment of China's energy and industrial structures, and identify more suitable mitigation measures for each region's characteristics. It is also necessary to strengthen the synergistic governance of pollutants and promote emission reduction technologies. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; China; China's ultra-low emission policy; COVID-19; Lockdown",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097668687

Conventionally, authigenic carbonate rocks/nodules are great proxy of AOM, but it only forms under an intermediate methane flow rate. It is thus vital to explore another carbon component proxy of AOM. In this paper, we investigate different carbon component features from a 5.2 m-long sediment core (SH-CL52) in the Shenhu region. We constrain the location of SMTZ based on the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) characteristic, pyrite content, TS/TOC and sulfur isotope, after that we discuss carbon component's isotopic response to AOM. Pyrite increases in 300–360 and 440–480 cmbsf, negative (NRMAF60mT - NRMAF80mT)/NRM values occurrence in 300–360 and 440–480 cmbsf, bulk-sediment δ34S values have positive excursion in 300–360 and 440–480 cmbsf and pyrite δ34S positive excursions appear in 300–360 and 440–480 cmbsf. All these reflect that at least two methane release events (MREs) are identified in 300–360 and 440–480 cmbsf in the core SH-CL52, respectively. In these zones, δ13CTC, δ13CTIC, δ13CFC and δ13CFGC variety is not discernable, but δ13CTOC has positive excursions which are most likely interpreted to the relatively higher methanogenesis rate in SMTZs. Our results suggest that δ13CTOC represents a potential proxy of SMTZ under high methane flux and shortduration condition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM); Carbon isotopes; Cold seep; Fine-grained carbonate; South China Sea; Total organic carbon (TOC)","anoxic conditions; carbon isotope; cold seep; fine grained sediment; marine sediment; methane; methanogenesis; oxidation; remanent magnetization; sediment chemistry; sediment core; total organic carbon; Pacific Ocean; Shenhu; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096177703

However, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration remains high in the Central Plains Economic Region (CPER). The Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System coupled with an on-line source-tagged model was applied to investigate the source apportionment of primary and secondary PM2.5 in the most polluted area of China from November 2017 to March 2018. On average, local emissions represent the largest contributor to ambient PM2.5 levels, followed by transport from circumjacent cities at five receptors in northern CPER. Under high PM2.5 concentrations (more than 150 μg/m3), 60%–70% of the primary PM2.5 is freshly emitted on the current day, while the contribution of the current day, one day ago, and two or more days ago are comparable to secondary aerosols. The estimation of contributions based on distance shows that the contribution from regions within 200 km reaches more than 80% of the primary PM2.5, while the contribution from long-range transport within 200–500 km still accounts for more than 20% of the secondary PM2.5 at the receptor sites. These results indicate that control measures of primary particle emission should be effective to reduce the primary PM2.5 levels within local and nearby regions, and control measures of gas phase precursors one or more days in advance should be beneficial to surrounding regions within 500 km. The process analysis results of the change in PM2.5 mass over the northern part of the CPER during increased PM2.5 periods illustrate that the existing particle total transport is smaller than the secondary aerosol chemical production and primary aerosol emissions since the westerly and southerly net inputs are mostly offset by the large net outputs at the east boundary in both cases. This finding indicates that the ambient PM2.5 mass in a selected area is strongly affected by the upstream region; meanwhile, the PM2.5 in this area also spreads to the downstream region. Joint prevention and control measures that cooperate with upstream regions for both primary particles and gas phase precursor emissions are crucial for improving the air quality over polluted areas.

However, just this reversible phase transition behaviors between λ and β phases made its high purity preparation be challenging, and the high energy consumption of present industrialized method also limited the high-level applications of β-Ti3O5. In this work, a novel carbothermal reduction method has been acquired to produce highly pure β-Ti3O5 compacts from titanium dioxide “wrapped” by phenolic resin served as carbon source. Their phase and microstructure evolutions during the whole reaction process were systematically characterized under the assistance of Rietveld refinement and SEM images. The highly active pyrolytic carbon of phenolic resin could deposit on the surface of TiO2 and this compacted state could promote the generated CO to accelerate the reaction process and decrease the addition of reductant, simultaneously. The reduction sequences were TiO2→ Ti4O7→ Ti3O5→ Ti2O3. The weight ratio of phenolic to precursor of 9.0% could achieve the pure β-Ti3O5 as high as 98.06% under the calcination temperature of 1250 °C for 4 h.

An atmospheric campaign was carried out from June 2017 to April 2018 to register the concentrations of typical chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (i.e., CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CFC-114) at the top of Mount Tai, northern China. The mixing ratios of CFC-11 CFC-12, CFC-113, and CFC-114 were 257, 577, 80, and 18 pptv, respectively. These values are similar to the reported data 10 years ago at Mount Tai. CFC concentrations correlated well with those of benzene (an anthropogenic tracer) and were not affected by either humidity, temperature, or solar radiation. However, CFC concentrations were considerably influenced by regional transport: their backward trajectory and the PSCF (potential source contribution function) analysis suggested that higher concentrations (CFC-12, CFC-113 and CFC-114) were detected under the influence of air mass from the industrial regions in mid-eastern China and CFC-11 was through long-range transport from northwestern (i.e., from the higher atmosphere in western China) air masses. Overall, the findings of this study suggested that CFCs still have emissions in China, but no significant increase in recent years. Mid-eastern China might be responsible for the CFC emissions. The conclusions also highlight the need for the enforcement of effective control policies and the management of emissions, in order to avoid increasingly severe scenarios. © 2018","Chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs); Concentrations; Mount Tai; Potential emission source regions","Atmospheric humidity; Chlorofluorocarbons; Meteorology; Ozone layer; Polyols; Backward trajectory; Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); Control policy; Emission sources; Long range transport; Potential source contribution function; Regional transport; Stratospheric ozone layers; Atmospheric movements; 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane; benzene; chlorofluorocarbon; cryofluorane; dichlorodifluoromethane; trichlorofluoromethane; air mass; altitude; CFC; concentration (composition); long range transport; mixing ratio; pollutant source; pollutant transport; air pollution control; air sampling; air temperature; altitude; Article; biogeographic region; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; humidity; measurement; ozone depletion; priority journal; solar radiation; China; Shandong; Tai Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091785454

Three-point bending experiments were performed with semi-circular coal specimens (SCB) after they were immersed in different CO2 pressures. The experimental results show that the pure modes I and II fracture toughnesses of coal samples gradually decrease with the growth of CO2-saturation pressure. Additionally, the fracture toughness reduces significantly after the CO2-saturation pressure exceeds 7.38 MPa, the threshold value of its supercritical state. When the CO2-saturation pressure arrives at 10 MPa, the degradation degree of the fracture toughness of the coal reaches the maximum. Furthermore, we tested the fracture toughness of coal SCB specimens under N2-saturation and CO2-saturation confining pressure conditions, respectively. As the N2-saturation confining pressure rises, the mode I and II fracture toughnesses increase gradually. The relationship between confining pressure and fracture toughness can be characterized by linear and quadratic functions for the mode I and mode II loading, respectively. The fracture toughness of coals decreases more rapidly under supercritical CO2 (scCO2)-saturation confining pressure than that under N2-saturation confining pressure. Furthermore, the theoretical values based on modified maximum tangential stress (MMTS) criterion that takes into account the effects of the T-stress are found to comply better with experimental results than those predicted by traditional maximum tangential stress (MTS) criterion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Confining pressure; Fracture toughness; Modified maximum tangential stress criterion; Supercritical carbon dioxide","Bending dies; Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Rock pressure; Confining pressures; Maximum tangential stress; Quadratic function; Saturation pressure; Supercritical CO2 (scCO2); Supercritical state; Theoretical values; Three-point-bending experiments; Fracture toughness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098574183

The simulation, which was validated by comparing surface meteorological parameters and BC concentration against in-situ observations over South Asia and the TP, provided a perspective on the seasonal variations and regional spatial patterns of BC concentration. Using a sensitivity simulation where BC emissions from biomass burning were removed from South Asia, this study found South Asian biomass burning emissions contributed up to 90% of BC mass over the TP during the pre-monsoon season, specifically emissions from western India for the simulated year. The emissions led to reduced surface radiative forcing, causing the temperature to decrease accordingly. However, column cloud water was increased. This study suggested that the biomass burning emissions from South Asia have significant impact on atmospheric BC over the TP, especially during the pre-monsoon season. Therefore, reducing biomass burning emissions from South Asia is potentially important for alleviating the effects of BC on climatic and environmental conditions over the TP and surrounding regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Climatic impact; South Asian biomass burning; Tibetan Plateau; WRF-Chem","Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Climate models; Biomass burning emissions; Chemistry transport model; Environmental conditions; In-situ observations; Meteorological parameters; Radiative forcings; Sensitivity Simulation; Surrounding regions; Biomass; black carbon; cloud water; unclassified drug; water; carbon; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; black carbon; climate effect; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; transport process; weather forecasting; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric transport; biomass; biomass burning; climate; climatic impact; controlled study; geographic and geological phenomena; India; meteorology; rainy season; seasonal variation; simulation; South Asia; Tibetan Plateau; aerosol; air pollutant; Asia; biomass; environmental monitoring; Tibet; China; India; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Asia; Biomass; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; India; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097773872

Three calcareous soils with different evolvement intensities were sampled from an evergreen broadleaved forest in the subtropical region of southwest of China to investigate the changes in different SOC fractions and microbial communities. The results showed that: (1) The contents of SOC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mineral protected organic carbon (MOC), and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) significantly decreased with increasing evolvement intensity of calcareous soil, but pH and the chemical composition of SOC, including Alkyl C, O-alkyl C, Aromatic C, and Carbonyl C, did not significantly change, suggesting that various SOC fractions synergistically decrease with the evolvement of calcareous soil. (2) The evolvement of calcareous soil had a substantial negative effect on total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), bacteria (i.e., Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative bacteria), fungi, and actinomycetes, but did not affect the ratio of fungi to bacteria. This result supported the conclusion that various SOC fractions were synchronously loss with the evolvement of calcareous soil. (3) Results from the multivariate statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between SOC fractions (including SOC, DOC, MOC, and ROC) and soil base cations, mainly calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al). This strengthens the fact that SOC stability largely depends on the complex relationship between organic matter and mineral composition in soil. Taken together, the reduction of SOC during the evolvement of soil in the karst areas accords with some mechanisms of previous studies (e.g., microbial composition and soil geochemistry), and also has its own unique characteristics (e.g., the relative contribution of carbons to chemical shift regions of CPMAS 13C-NMR spectra and F:B ratio). © 2021 by the authors.

Here we present a comprehensive characterization of aerosol composition and sources at an NCP mountain site during heating periods (November 12 to December 24, 2018) using a Quadrupole Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (Q-AMS). The average mass concentration of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) was 22.6 ± 29.9 μg/m3, in which organic aerosol (OA) and nitrate showed comparable contribution of 32.8% and 35.1%, respectively, followed by ammonium (15.3%), sulfate (13.9%) and chloride (2.6%). Secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) was found to dominated in polluted days (70%) which the aerosol level is 15 times higher than that in clean days which dominated by organics (54%). In addition, organics, nitrate and sulfate showed similar unimodal size distributions peaked at 600–800 nm in polluted days, which appear to be internally mixed that originated from regional transportation of aged aerosol. Whereas, the different size distribution mode of organics with SIA that peaked at smaller particle size (200–300 nm) in cleans days suggested contributions from local emissions. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and ME2 analysis showed oxidized organic aerosols (OOA) dominated the total OA (64%), while the contribution of the hydrocarbons-like OA (HOA) and biomass burning OA (BBOA) was comparable (15–21%). To evaluate the effect of air pollution control on the background aerosols chemistry, interannual variations in aerosol chemical compositions during heating periods in 2014–2018 were deduced combined with the trajectory cluster analysis. The results showed the aerosol source region was mainly from the urban agglomeration of NCP, which showed the largest decrease in aerosol mass concentration during the past five years. In addition, the aerosol compositions became to be SIA dominated gradually under different air mass influence condition, suggesting the air pollution control is more effective for the reduction of primary emissions than the secondary species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Background area; Chemical compositions and sources; North China Plain; Submicron aerosols","Aerosols; Air pollution; Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Cluster analysis; Factorization; Nitrates; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol mass concentration; Aerosol mass spectrometers; Interannual variation; Positive Matrix Factorization; Regional transportation; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Unimodal size distribution; Air pollution control; aerosol composition; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; background level; heating; mass spectrometry; pollution control; source apportionment; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092153857

In-situ mild alkaline (pH 8) enhanced two-stage continuous stirred tank reactors (ALK-2-CSTRs) were implemented to explore its efficiency in co-digesting WCO and sewage sludge with stepwise increase of WCO in the co-substrates. Results demonstrate that the ALK-2-CSTRs effectively promoted methane yield from the co-substrates via promoting hydrolysis, long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) degradation and protecting methanogens from exposure to high concentration of LCFAs directly. The maximum methane yield of the ALK-2-CSTRs is 39.2% higher than that of a single stage CSTR system at the optimal feed mixture of 45:55 (WCO:SS [VS]). The thermophilic operation applied to the stage-1 of the ALK-2-CSTRs failed to improve the methane yield when the methanogenic performance was stable; while upon WCO overloaded, the elevated temperature mitigated the deterioration of methanogenesis by stimulating the bioconversion of the toxic LCFAs, especially the unsaturated oleic acid. Microbial community analysis reveals the ALK-2-CSTRs stimulated the growth of lipolytic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which suggests the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway was promoted. Cost evaluation demonstrates the economical superiority of the ALK-2-CSTR over the prevailing strategies developed for enhancing methane yield from the co-substrates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline conditioning; Anaerobic co-digestion; Economic evaluation; Long chain fatty acids; Waste cooking oil","Alkalinity; Deterioration; Methane; Methanogens; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Oils and fats; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Elevated temperature; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Lipolytic bacteria; Long chain fatty acid; Methanogenic pathways; Microbial community analysis; Two-stage anaerobic digestions; Anaerobic digestion; long chain fatty acid; methane; oleic acid; anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; cost analysis; fatty acid; food waste; methane; methanogenic bacterium; sewage; sludge; waste treatment; alkalinity; anaerobic digestion; archaeon; Article; bacterial growth; biotransformation; chemical analysis; Clostridium; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; feasibility study; food processing waste; hydrolysis; lipid degradation; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; sludge digestion; waste cooking oil; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; cooking; digestion; sewage; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Cooking; Digestion; Methane; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097534951

The global warming is observed around the world, and the governments take measures to reduce CO2 emission to combat the rise of temperature. The temperature profile has been mainly modelled at global level. Yet, it necessarily models the temperature in cities because each city would have its own feature. Among various models to fit or simulate the temperature, the application of random walk model is rare. In this study, we used the random walk model to fit the temperature of the 21th century in 49 European capitals not only because the industrial revolution first appeared in Europe but also European governments commit and endorse the Paris Agreement. First, the yearly temperature was simplified as increase (+1) or decrease (-1) in comparison with previous year, whose addition in the 20th century in each of 49 European capitals construct a step-typed curve. Second, random walk model was used to fit these step-typed curves with the least squared method. Third, the widely used CRUTEM3 temperature in the 20th century in each of 49 European capitals was directly fitted using random walk. The results show that random walk can fit the step-typed curves and CRUTEM3 temperature. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Geodesy; Geology; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Random processes; Atmosphere temperature; CO2 emissions; European governments; Global temperatures; Industrial revolutions; Previous year; Random walk modeling; Temperature profiles; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101717832

Here, we investigate SE Asian-Pacific paleoclimate records to decipher the dominant underlying mechanism that governed tropical Asian-Pacific hydrology during MIS 3. Our results suggest that the glacial emergence of the Sunda Shelf likely altered the atmospheric circulation pattern in Southeast (SE) Asia and led to the realignment of rainfall patterns between Thailand and Indonesia during the last glacial period. We also propose that the long-term hydrological regime change in the tropical Asian-Pacific region during MIS 3 was mainly influenced by an El Niño-like mechanism. An intense El Niño-like condition led to strong aridity in SE Asia during mid MIS 3. By late MIS 3, an enhanced seasonality dampened the intensity of the El Niño-like conditions, thus, leading to muted aridity in SE Asia.

Regional reductions in air pollutant emissions required to eliminate the PM2.5 heavy pollution episode are also quantified. Our results found that meteorological conditions for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding “2+26” cities are the worst during the heavy pollution episode around the 2020 Spring Festival as compared with two other typical heavy pollution episodes that occurred after 2015. However, because of the substantial reductions in air pollutant emissions in the “2+26” cities in recent years, and the 32% extra reduction in emissions during January to February 2020 compared with the baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020, the maximum PM2.5 level during this heavy pollution episode around the 2020 Spring Festival was much lower than that in the other two typical episodes. Yet, these emission reductions are still not enough to eliminate regional heavy pollution episodes. Compared with the actual emission levels during January to February 2020, a 20% extra reduction in air pollutant emissions in the “2+26” cities (or a 45% extra reduction compared with baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020) could help to generally eliminate regionwide severe pollution episodes, and avoid heavy pollution episodes that last three or more consecutive days in Beijing; a 40% extra reduction in emissions (or a 60% extra reduction compared with baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020) could help to generally eliminate regionwide and continuous heavy pollution episodes.

However, whether improvement of air quality prevents respiratory diseases is unclear. Objectives: To examine whether the policy-driven reduction in PM2.5 concentration after 2013 was associated with improved lung function among Chinese adults. Methods: We compared the longitudinal measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF) before (2011) and after (2013 and 2015) China's clean air actions. Long-term exposure to ambient pollution was assessed using a state-of-the-art estimator of historical PM2.5 concentration, and its association with PEF was examined using a linear mixed-effects model. The robustness and homogeneity of the association were examined via sensitivity analyses. Results: We analyzed 35,055 repeated measurements from 13,959 adults. Mean of age at survey was 60.5 years (standard deviation = 9.7 yr). Compared with the reference in 2011, after the policy was implemented, the mean PEF was elevated by 9.19 (6.79-11.59) L/min and 36.64 (33.53-39.75) L/min in 2013 and 2015, respectively. According to the regression results, each 10-mg/m3 reduction of PM2.5 was associated with a 14.95 (12.62-17.28) L/min improvement of PEF. The significance of the association was not affected by adjustments for covariates, inclusion criteria, or the approach to control for the effects of age. Adults of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., those with an educational level of below middle school or rural residents) were more susceptible to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on PEF. Conclusions: We found a robust association between a reduction in PM2.5 and an increase in PEF among Chinese adults. The findings suggest that mitigation of air pollution can promote respiratory health. © 2021 by the American Thoracic Society.","Air pollution; Environmental policy; Particulate matter; Peak expiratory flow rate; Respiratory function tests","adult; adverse event; adverse outcome; age; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; Chinese; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; educational status; environmental policy; female; human; long term exposure; longitudinal study; lung function; major clinical study; male; middle school; particulate matter 2.5; peak expiratory flow; PM2.5 exposure; rural population; sensitivity analysis; social status; susceptible population; toxic concentration; air pollutant; environmental exposure; lung; particulate matter; prevention and control; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Lung; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101089121

Scientific understanding of the driving mechanism of runoff change is the basis of scientific utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development. In this study, runoff changes at different time scales were analyzed for the period 1960–2018, and the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff were investigated in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River Basin (SRB). A combination of mutation analysis and human-designed analysis was adopted to divide the study period into the baseline period and the variation period. The Mann–Kendall test (M−K) and Double Mass Curve method (DMC) were used to detect abrupt changes and quantify the relative effects of climate change and human activities on runoff. The results reveal a significant declining trend in annual runoff on the whole in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB, and there was an obvious recovery trend after the implementation of the Comprehensive Treatment Program of the SRB (CTSRB) in 2007. Abrupt changes occurred in 1976, 1991 and 2007, which divided the study period into the baseline period (1960–1975), the Variation Ⅰ period (1976–1990), the Variation Ⅱ period (1991–2006) and the Variation III period (2007–2018). The contribution of human activities to runoff reduction was 88.72%, whereas the contribution of climate change to runoff reduction was only 11.28%. Furthermore, the contribution of human activities to runoff reduction in the Variation Ⅰ period, Variation Ⅱ period and Variation III period was 89.44%, 93.02% and 83.69%, respectively. Therefore, human activities played the most dominant role in the variation of runoff, followed by climate change and upstream runoff. Further analysis of the impact of human activities on runoff indicated that agricultural irrigation was the dominant factor of runoff reduction.

The study of the structures of the UCC is very instructive for cleaner urban construction. With Beijing, Tianjin and Nanjing as cases, we innovatively establish urban carbon cycle network (UCCN) and study the UCCN indicators, the similarities and differences of the structural characteristics of UCC in different cities are revealed. (1) All weighted and non-weighted UCCNs are tightly connected with large node degrees. Relatively, Beijing's UCCNs are more clustered than Tianjin. (2) Both Beijing and Tianjin's UCCNs are mature and have small-world characteristics. Relatively, Beijing's UCCN is more stable and has more obvious small-world effects than Tianjin. (3) For Beijing, Carbon absorbed during photosynthesis, Carbon stored in natural vegetation, Carbon emitted from respiration and so on are important UCCN nodes with high links. For Tianjin, Fossil energy consumption and industrial manufacture related nodes have high links, being the main driving node of UCC. (4) The node centrality of UCCN in Beijing is overall smaller than that in Tianjin. The betweenness centrality of Carbon input from energy is greater than that of other nodes for Beijing's UCCN. For Tianjin, Carbon absorption of crops has a large betweenness centrality. (5) In cluster analysis of the UCC, Beijing, Tianjin and Nanjing's UCCNs all have large node degrees for vertical carbon output and artificial carbon storage in common. Many differences also exist. Beijing has the least significant horizontal carbon input, while Nanjing has the less significant horizontal carbon output. For Tianjin, the most critical module is horizontal carbon input. Our results are instructive for comparative urban carbon management strategies of the studied cities.

However, operating at high reaction rates produces locally alkaline conditions that convert reactant CO2 into cell-damaging carbonate salts. These salts precipitate in the porous cathode structure, block CO2 transport, reduce reaction efficiency, and render CO2 electrolysis inherently unstable. We propose a self-cleaning CO2 reduction strategy with short, periodic reductions in applied voltage, which avoids saturation and prevents carbonate salt formation. We demonstrate this approach in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with silver and copper catalysts, on carbon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based gas diffusion electrodes, respectively. When operated continuously, the C2 selectivity of the copper-PTFE system started to decline rapidly after only ≈10 h. With the self-cleaning strategy, the same electrode operated for 157 h (236 h total duration), maintaining 80% C2 product selectivity and 138 mA cm-2 of C2 partial current density, at a cost of <1% additional energy input. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Copper; Diffusion in gases; Electrodes; Electrolytic cleaning; Reaction rates; Salts; Alkaline conditions; Electrochemical conversion; Gas diffusion electrodes; Membrane electrode assemblies; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Product selectivities; Reaction efficiency; Valuable chemicals; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100996889

For plants, growth forms integrate traits related to competition or migration capacity, which determine their abilities to deal with the climate variability they face. Evergreen broad-leaved woody plants (EBWPs) are major components of numerous biomes in the subtropical and tropical regions. Hence, incorporating phylogenetic (temporal) and biogeographic (spatial) approaches, we assessed the relative importance of short- and long-term climate variability for biodiversity patterns of different growth forms (i.e., tree, shrub, liana, and bamboo) in EBWPs. We used a dated phylogeny and the distribution records for 6,265 EBWP species which are naturally occurred in China, and computed the corrected weighted endemism, standardized phylogenetic diversity and net relatedness index for the four growth forms, respectively. Ordinary least squares linear regressions, spatial error simultaneous autoregressive models, partial regression and hierarchical variation partitioning were employed to estimate the explanatory power of contemporary climate variability and climate-change velocity from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present. Our results showed that short- and long-term climate variability play complementary role in the biogeographic patterns of Chinese EBWPs. The former had larger effects, but the legacy effects of past climate changes were also remarkable. There were also differences in the effects of historical and current climate among the four growth forms, which support growth forms as a critical plant trait in predicting vegetation response to climate change. Compared to the glacial-interglacial climate fluctuation, seasonality as a unique feature of mid-latitude monsoon climate played a dominant role in the diversification and distribution of EBWP species at the macroscale. The results indicated that the relative importance of climate variability at different temporal scales may relate to distinct mechanisms. To understand effects of future climate change on species distribution more thoroughly, climate conditions in different time scales should be incorporated. © Copyright © 2021 Xu, Shen, Zhang, Zang and Jiang.","biodiversity patterns; climate variability; evergreen broadleaved woody plants; multi-scale; temporal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101208037

We use socioeconomic and climatic data from 1981 to 2015 to examine how climate variability led to variation in yield, as simulated by an economy–climate model (C-D-C). The sensitivity of crop yield to the impact of climate change refers to the change in yield caused by changing climatic factors under the condition of constant non-climatic factors. An ‘output elasticity of comprehensive climate factor (CCF)’ approach determines the sensitivity, using the yields per hectare for grain, rice, wheat and maize in China’s main grain-producing areas as a case study. The results show that the CCF has a negative trend at a rate of −0.84/(10a) in the North region, while a positive trend of 0.79/(10a) is observed for the South region. Climate change promotes the ensemble increase in yields, and the contribution of agricultural labor force and total mechanical power to yields are greater, indicating that the yield in major grain-producing areas mainly depends on labor resources and the level of mechanization. However, the sensitivities to climate change of different crop yields to climate change present obvious regional differences: the sensitivity to climate change of the yield per hectare for maize in the North region was stronger than that in the South region. Therefore, the increase in the yield per hectare for maize in the North region due to the positive impacts of climate change was greater than that in the South region. In contrast, the sensitivity to climate change of the yield per hectare for rice in the South region was stronger than that in the North region. Furthermore, the sensitivity to climate change of maize per hectare yield was stronger than that of rice and wheat in the North region, and that of rice was the highest of the three crop yields in the South region. Finally, the economy–climate sensitivity zones of different crops were determined by the output elasticity of the CCF to help adapt to climate change and prevent food production risks. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we show how suitably designed reflecting plasmonic metagratings can be potentially incorporated into a top-emitting organic light emitting device, resulting in large enhancement of light emissivity by effectively coupling out the light trapped in the waveguide modes. We describe how both periodic and quasiperiodic metagratings can be used to improve device performance.

This fact brings the need to study the agricultural carbon emissions (ACEs). Studies focusing on calculating the spatiotemporal changes of ACEs and analyzing the main factors for ACE changes have been conducted. The agricultural technology inputs (ATIs) as an important factor to influence ACEs have been identified. The traditional linear model was the commonly used method to study the relationship between ATIs and ACEs, whereas the impact of ATIs on ACEs in different areas might be complex and nonlinear due to the differences in trade openness causing different development levels of agricultural technologies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of trade openness on the relationship between ATIs and ACEs using a panel threshold model and put forward policy implications for the low-carbon agriculture development. The analysis was based on data from a panel of 31 provinces of China during 2003–2018. The results show that ATIs and ACEs increased from 2003 to 2018 and the spatial distribution of ATIs was similar to that of ACEs. The ATIs had a positive effect on ACEs with a significant single-threshold effect from trade openness. When the trade openness was below the threshold (0.1425), the positive effect of ATIs on ACEs was significant (coefficient, 0.117), whereas, when the trade openness was above the threshold (0.1425), the positive effect of ATIs on ACEs significantly decreased (coefficient, 0.062). Furthermore, industrial structure and agricultural economic development were the positive drivers of ACEs, while trade openness, education level of rural workers, R&D funding, and natural disasters had negative relationships with ACEs.

Most studies on microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling focus on surface soils (0–20 cm). However, relatively little is known about how structure and functioning of microbial communities shift with depth in a soil profile, which is crucial to understand biogeochemical cycling in deep soils. Methods: We combined a number of complementary techniques to investigate the microbial biomass, community composition and diversity, and potential functioning along soil profile (0–70 cm) in two alpine ecosystems (meadow and shrubland) on the Tibetan Plateau. Results: The microbial biomass and fungi:bacteria ratio declined significantly with depth, while the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria increased with depth in both ecosystems. Microbial community composition showed significant differences among soil depths and between ecosystems. The relative abundance of some phylum of archaea, bacteria or fungi (e.g. Basidiomycota, Bacteroidetes) changed significantly with soil depth and ecosystem type. Bacteria diversity declined with depth, while archaea richness (OTU number) increased with depth and fungi diversity and richness did not show clear trend with depth. The co-occurrence network analysis further showed that surface soil microbes were more connected and interacted among each other compared to deep soil microbes. Moreover, total enzymatic activities and soil C mineralization rate declined with depth in both ecosystems. We also detected shifts with depth in some functional guilds of bacteria (based on faprotax database) in both ecosystems and fungi (based on FUNGuild database) only in shrubland. Conclusions: The biomass, community composition and diversity, and potential functioning of microbial communities all shifted significantly along soil profile in both ecosystems, and the vertical patterns of diversity varied among different microbial groups. This may have important implications for carbon and nutrient cycling along the soil profile in alpine ecosystems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alpine ecosystem; DNA sequencing; Enzyme activity; PLFA; Soil depth; Soil microbes","fungus; microbial activity; relative abundance; soil depth; soil ecosystem; soil microorganism; soil profile; species diversity; species richness; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Archaea; Bacteroidetes; Basidiomycota; Negibacteria; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090755903

Labile organic matter and microbial community are vital intrinsic factors in controlling the mineralization of soil organic matter. Regulation of soil aggregate size on dissolved organic matter (DOM), the cellobiose hydrolyzing microbial community, and their roles in organic matter mineralization remains unclear. The mineralization of organic matter in large macroaggregates (LMA, &gt;2 mm), small macroaggregates (SMA, 0.25–2 mm), and microaggregates (MI, &lt;0.25 mm) from an Ultisol treated with long-term non-fertilizers (Ck), chemical fertilizers (NPK) and animal manure (AM) was observed in this study. The concentration and structure of DOM, activity of β-glucosidase, and the abundance, diversity, and community composition of GH1 (glycoside hydrolase family 1) microbial β-glucosidase encoding genes were investigated. The cumulative CO2-C emissions occurred in the order LMA &lt; SMA &lt; MI in each fertilization treatment and followed the sequence Ck &lt; NPK &lt; AM in each size of aggregate. The concentration of DOM in the soil aggregates increased as the aggregate size decreased, while the structural complexity of DOM followed the opposite trend. The activity of β-glucosidase in the smaller aggregates was higher than that in the larger aggregates, and the abundance and diversity of the GH1 microbial β-glucosidase genes generally echoed the same trend. The dominant microbial classes harboring GH1 β-glucosidase genes in the soil aggregates were Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Sordariomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes revealed significant differences among the aggregates. Redundancy analysis confirmed that microbial GH1 β-glucosidase community in the soil aggregates was primarily regulated by DOM concentration and pH. Structural equation modelling revealed that soil aggregates mainly regulated the β-glucosidase activity and DOM concentration and then the abundance and diversity of the GH1 microbial β-glucosidase genes in controlling organic matter mineralization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cellobiose hydrolyzing microbial community; Dissolved organic matter; Mineralization of organic matter; Soil aggregates","Aggregates; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Fertilizers; Genes; Hydrolysis; Microorganisms; Organic compounds; Plants (botany); Soils; Community composition; Dissolved organic matters; Glycoside hydrolase family 1; Labile organic matter; Microbial communities; Organic matter mineralization; Structural complexity; Structural equation modelling; Mineralogy; beta glucosidase; carbon; carbon dioxide; cellobiose; dissolved organic matter; fertilizer; glycosidase; glycoside hydrolase 1; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; cellobiose; fertilizer; climate change; community composition; dissolved organic matter; hydrolysis; microbial community; mineralization; soil aggregate; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; enzyme activity; Eurotiomycetes; Flavobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria; hydrolysis; manure; microbial community; microbial diversity; mineralization; nonhuman; organic matter mineralization; population abundance; priority journal; soil aggregation; soil fertilization; Sordariomycetes; trend study; animal; fertilization; microbiology; microflora; soil; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Animalia; Eurotiomycetes; Flavobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria; Sordariomycetes; Animals; Carbon; Cellobiose; Fertilization; Fertilizers; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092176203

However, if the HBD is also a halide receptor, the two will quench each other, decreasing the catalytic activity. Here, we propose a strained ion pair tris(alkylamino)cyclopropenium halide (TAC·X), in which TAC repels X. TAC possesses a positively charged cyclopropenium core that makes the vicinal C-H or N-H a nonclassical HBD. The interionic strain within TAC·X makes TAC a more electrophilic HBD, allowing it to activate the oxygen of the epoxide and making X more nucleophilic and better able to attack the methylene carbon of the epoxide. NMR titration spectra and computational studies were employed to probe the mechanism of the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides reactions under the catalysis of TAC·X. The 1H and 13C{1H}NMR titration spectra of the catalyst with the epoxide substrate unambiguously confirmed H-bonding between TAC and the epoxide.

On this basis, the spatial-temporal variation in the modelled ground-level NO2 concentration over China during the period of 2005–2019 was analysed. The results show that the TSCE-NO2 model proposed in this study provides a reliable estimation of the modelled ground-level NO2 concentration over China, effectively filling the spatial and temporal gaps in China's air quality ground monitoring network (the model's correlation coefficient, R, is 0.92, the mean absolute error, MAE, is 3.62 μg/m3, the mean square percentage error, MSPE, is 0.72%, and the root-mean-square error, RMSE, is 5.93 μg/m3). The analysis results of the spatial and temporal variation indicate that (1) the perennial ground-level NO2 concentration over China is high in the eastern area and low in the western area, and the high values are mainly distributed along the northern coast, the eastern coast, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the Pearl River Delta and the Sichuan Basin. (2) The modelled ground-level NO2 concentrations over China are highest in winter, followed by those in autumn and spring, and they are lowest in summer.

However, greenhouse gas (N2O, CH4 and CO2) emissions are the accompanying problem in CWs. To mitigate the net global warming potential (GWP) with the constant removal efficiency for contaminants is attracting wide attention recently. In this study, four CWs were established to explore the effects of substrate types (gravel, walnut shell, manganese ore and activated alumina) on contaminant removal and greenhouse gas emissions. CWs using manganese ore substrate with function of electronic exchange showed high removal efficiencies on COD (90.1%), TN (65.1%), TP (97.1%) and low greenhouse gas flux. The emission fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 were 0.07–0.20, 2.00–252.30 and 337.54–782.57 mg m−2 h−1, respectively. Especially, the lowest average CH4 emission flux in the manganese ore CW was only 2.00 mg m−2 h−1 while those of N2O in walnut shell CW was only 0.07 mg m−2 h−1, which will make a significant contribution on the mitigation of GWP of CWs. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that microbial community diversity and richness changed significantly among different substrates. The high pmoA and low mcrA, caused by the introduction of manganese ore as substrate, also explained why there was little CH4 emission in CWs. Our study provided new insights into GWP mitigation and contaminant removal enhancement in CWs using optimal substrate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Constructed wetlands; Contaminant removal; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Microbial community; Substrate types","aluminum oxide; carbon dioxide; manganese; RNA 16S; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; constructed wetland; global warming; greenhouse gas; microbial community; pollutant removal; reduction; sewage treatment; substrate; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; analytic method; Article; Bacteroidetes; carbon footprint; Chloroflexi; constructed wetland; Epsilonbacteraeota; Firmicutes; flow; gene; greenhouse effect; high throughput sequencing; hydraulic retention time; Iris pseudacorus; mcra gene; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; plant; pmoa gene; walnut; waste component removal; water management; water quality; water sampling; greenhouse gas; pollutant; wetland; Juglans; Environmental Pollutants; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096198405

In this study, we construct a green economy transformation decision-making model to establish dynamic optimisation simulation for the period 2016 to 2025. For this purpose, we use integrating methods of system dynamics, input-output modelling, and dynamic multi-objective programming. The simulation results verify the existing a negative development trend under the current situation along with the positive economic development (with acceptable levels of environmental pollution) when there is an increase of investments in clean production technologies. Technology advancement and cost reduction values are explored further. When the technological cost was reduced by 15%, both the highest economic elasticity and an optimal air pollutant control capacity can be achieved simultaneously. Additionally, the growth rate of Tangshan's GRP can reach 39%, while the NOX and SO2 emissions can be simultaneously reduced by 42% and 36%, respectively by the year 2025 (compared to the emission levels and GRP in 2016). Our study has improved upon previous research methods to put forward a specific optimisation path to achieve green economic transformation for steel-manufacturing cities through industrial structure adjustments and technological updates. This is also conducive to the sustainable development of similar cities that are characterized by heavy industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Green transformation; Input-output analysis; Scenario simulation; Steel city; Systematic dynamic model","Air cleaners; Air quality; Cost reduction; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Green manufacturing; Growth rate; Industrial economics; Industrial research; Multiobjective optimization; Steelmaking; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Decision making models; Dynamic multi-objective programming; Dynamic optimisation; Economic transformation; Environmental pollutions; Industrial structure adjustments; Steel manufacturing; Technology advancement; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093697104

However, most existing studies examined the changes in HWs that are derived from air temperature only, possible different changes in humid HWs that consider the combined effects of relative humidity (RH) are much less understood. This study investigates the spatial and temporal changes in two different HW types, namely, dry and humid HWs, in China from 1961 to 2014. Analysis results show that, on average, humid HWs in China occur 20% more frequently than dry HWs. Dry HWs are more commonly located in northern China, while humid events mainly appear in monsoonal southern and eastern regions. It is also found that all measures of both dry and humid HWs across China have been increasing during the past decades, and humid HWs exhibit a more prominent intensifying trend than dry ones. In particular, the national mean frequency, participating days, magnitude, and duration of dry (humid) HWs increased by 0.061 (0.069) events decade−1, 0.32 (0.39) days decade−1, 0.53 (0.62) °C decade−1, and 0.19 (0.21) days decade−1, respectively. These trends vary in different parts of China. The largest increment of dry HW frequency appears in the arid region of northwest China, while the fastest increase of the humid HW frequency is observed in southeastern China. Given the additional stress induced by high humidity to extreme high temperature, we suggest that future climate change mitigation and adaption should consider the change and impacts of humid heat events. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Climate change; CORDEX; Heat index; Humid heat waves; Long-term trend","Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Additional stress; Air temperature; Climate warming; Combined effect; High temperature; NorthWest China; Southeastern china; Spatial and temporal changes; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; heat wave; humid environment; humidity; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091006353

The heavy industry sector is the largest contributor to the growth of CO2 emissions. Investigating the driving factors of this industry's CO2 emissions has important practical value. This paper applies the geographically weighted regression model to survey this industry's CO2 emissions. Empirical results show that urbanization exerts a heterogeneous impact on CO2 emissions across provinces and regions. This is mainly due to the differences in urban real estate and transportation infrastructure investments. Economic growth drives CO2 emissions, and this effect varies significantly by region and province on account of the differences in fixed-asset investment. It is more reasonable for local governments to develop emerging economies based on their specific conditions. Energy efficiency has the highest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, because of the differences in R&amp;D personnel investment and the number of patents granted. The energy consumption structure has the largest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region since it consumes more coal.

Bimetallic-derived catalysts provide a useful platform to achieve atomically precise compositions and structures and, in turn, enhance the catalytic performance. Recently, their applications in simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and underutilized ethane (SU-CO2Et) have introduced opportunities for synthesizing four types of most essential industrial feedstocks, i.e., syngas, ethylene, aromatics, and oxygenates. Given the structural and mechanistic complexity of these reactions, it is of critical importance to discuss the current progress and future opportunities in the aspects of catalyst design, synthesis, characterization, and application in SU-CO2Et. By highlighting the multifunctional roles of bimetallic-derived catalysts, the SU-CO2Et strategy promises to advance the utilization of abundant shale gas and CO2 for the sustainable production of chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Bimetallic-derived catalysts have played a pivotal role in many industrially important catalytic processes.

We explored the environmental effects of subsidy on urban air pollution from the extensive and intensive margins and formulated a detailed panel dataset, covering 286 cities in China over the years 2006–2018. Moreover, the PSM-DID method and the instrumental strategy are used to confirm the robustness and validity of empirical results on the basis of comprehensive analysis of potential endogenous issues. The results indicate that the implementation of NEVs subsidy policy could significantly improve urban air quality in general, and as the subsidies scale increased by 1%, air pollution level will be reduced by about 0.15%. Then, from the perspective of the dynamic effect of subsidy, it not only has remarkable current environmental effect, but also an effective technology route in the long run. Simultaneously, compared with traditional intervention tools, subsidies enhance the diffusion of NEVs, reduce emissions of air pollutants while meeting residents' travel needs, and thus achieve incentive compatibility, which is the micro-foundation of environmental improvement. Nonetheless, we cannot simply believe the assertion that NEVs subsidy has positive environmental benefits to each region, as the non-clean generation of electricity in some areas will offset the potential environmental benefits. Additionally, the accelerated phase-out of NEVs subsidies at this stage may cause negative externalities of economy and environment, resulting the deadweight loss of industrial dividends accumulated in the early period. Based on above findings, governments should implement more flexible stimulus policies consistent with NEVs industry developments, rather than drastically reducing subsidies, while paying close attention to decarbonization of energy production stage. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Incentive policy; New energy vehicles; Pilot city; Urban air quality","Air quality; Economics; Electric vehicles; Comprehensive analysis; Environmental benefits; Environmental improvements; Incentive compatibility; Industry development; Negative externalities; New energy vehicles; Urban air pollution; Environmental technology; air quality; atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; empirical analysis; environmental economics; incentive; pollution control; subsidy system; urban pollution; adult; air pollutant; air quality; article; assertiveness; attention; China; city; controlled study; diffusion; economic aspect; electricity; energy yield; government; human; resident; travel; validity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090741628

It is therefore critical to identify the determinants of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MSW treatment and prepare potential GHG mitigation measures. A combined System Dynamics - Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index model is developed to identify the driving forces of GHG emission generated from MSW treatment and explore the mitigation potentials. Shanghai, a typical megacity in China is selected as a case study. Results showed that economic development, population scale and emission intensity were driving forces to induce GHG emissions from MSW treatment, while generation intensity and treatment structure were the factors to mitigate GHG emissions from MSW during 2000–2017. Scenario analysis further revealed that landfill gas utilization and MSW separation improvement were the most effective measures in reducing GHG emissions from MSW treatment, leading to about 88.07% and 85.48% of reduction compared with the business-as-usual scenario in 2050. Scenarios of improving incineration rate, reducing per capita MSW generation and restricting population growth will reduce GHG emissions by 72.29%, 30.06% and 0.30%, respectively.

However, there are few studies on the construction of a comprehensive governance mechanism for multi-river basins at the provincial level. To fill this gap, this paper took Henan Province of China, which straddles four river basins, as the study region. The chord diagram, overlay analysis, and carbon emission models were applied to the remote sensing data of land use to analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage caused by land-use changes in Henan Province from 1990 to 2018 to reflect the heterogeneity of the contribution of the four basins to human activities and economic development. The results revealed that food security land in the four basins decreased, while production and living land increased. Ecological conservation land was increased over time in the Yangtze River Basin. In addition, the conversion from food security land to production and living land was the common characteristic for the four basins. Carbon emission in Henan increased from 134.46 million tons in 1990 to 553.58 million tons in 2018, while its carbon absorption was relatively stable (1.67–1.69 million tons between 1990 and 2018). The carbon emitted in the Huai River Basin was the main contributor to Henan Province’s total carbon emission. The carbon absorption in Yellow River Basin and Yangtze River Basin had an obvious spatial agglomeration effect. Finally, considering the current need of land spatial planning in China and the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060 set by the Chinese government, we sug-gested that carbon sequestration capacity should be further strengthened in Yellow River Basin and Yangtze River Basin based on their respective ecological resource advantages. For future development in Hai River Basin and Huai River Basin, coordinating the spatial allocation of urban scale and urban green space to build an ecological city is a key direction to embark upon. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the extent to which current fast-growing disturbance by Tibetan pig rooting alters carbon stocks in these meadows and the underlying processes are still unclear. Methods: We conducted a 3-year study in meadows with three different plant communities on the southeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to explore the effects of rooting by Tibetan pigs on carbon stocks. Results: Rooting by Tibetan pigs decreased plant biomass carbon (PBC), soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and ecosystem carbon (EC) by 91.25%, 30.57%, 28.94%, and 40.47%, respectively. Soil moisture (SM) was the most significant factor negatively associated with PBC, SOC, and EC. Additionally, a decreased SM by rooting also exerted an indirect effect on MBC by directly reducing plant biomass. Conclusions: Rooting by Tibetan pigs diminishes carbon stocks by decreasing SM, threatening carbon stocks stored in alpine meadows. Thus, caging or reducing the breeding number of Tibetan pigs combined with restoring soil water levels would be effective ways to recover and maintain carbon stocks in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Microbial biomass carbon; Plant biomass carbon; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Soil environment; Soil organic carbon","alpine environment; carbon sequestration; disturbance; livestock; meadow; organic carbon; pig; rooting; soil moisture; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073923403

We then proceeded to use localized census-based concentration-response models and the value of statistical life estimates to calculate premature deaths and economic losses attributable to PM2.5 exposure across urban China. Finally, we estimated potentially avoidable mortality and corresponding economic losses by meeting the current 24-hour based guideline and various hypothetical indoor limits for PM2.5. In 2015 in urban areas of mainland China, the city-specific annual mean outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations ranged 9–108 μg/m3 and 5–56 μg/m3, respectively. Indoor exposures contributed 62%–91% daily and 68%–83% annually to the total time-weighted exposures. The potential reductions in total deaths and economic losses for the scenario in which daily indoor concentrations met the current guideline of 75 μg/m3, 37.5 μg/m3, and 25 μg/m3 were 16.9 (95% CI: 0.7–62.1) thousand, 87.7 (95% CI: 9.7–197.7) thousand, and 165.5 (95% CI: 30.8–304.0) thousand, respectively. The corresponding reductions in economic losses were 5.7 (95% CI: 0.2–34.8) billion, 29.4 (95% CI: 2.4–109.6) billion, and 55.2 (95% CI: 7.7–168.0) billion US Dollars, respectively. Deaths and economic losses would be reduced exponentially within the range of 0–75 μg/m3 for hypothetical indoor PM2.5 limits. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of reducing indoor concentrations of outdoor-originated PM2.5 in saving substantial lives and economic losses in China. The analysis provides quantitative evidence to support the implementation of an indoor air quality guideline or standard for PM2.5. © 2020 The Author(s)","Burden of disease; Environmental health; Healthy building; Indoor air quality guideline; PM2.5","Air quality; Indoor air pollution; Healthy buildings; Indoor air quality; Indoor concentration; Mass balance model; PM2.5 concentration; Potential reduction; Premature mortality; Value of statistical lives; Losses; air quality; concentration (composition); environmental quality; health risk; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; urban area; adult; ambient air; article; China; concentration response; controlled study; disease burden; disease simulation; environmental health; human; PM2.5 exposure; practice guideline; premature mortality; quantitative analysis; steady state; urban area; urban population; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; prevention and control; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098720989

However, there have been few studies on the sources of and long-term variation in ambient OVOCs. This study combined sensitive, near real-time measurements of VOCs by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) with an improved photochemical age parameterization method to quantify daytime sources of OVOCs in an urban atmosphere in China from 2014 to 2019, permitting the observation of the impacts of emission control strategies that were implemented during this period. Temporal variation in six key OVOCs (methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), formic acid, and acetic acid) were observed. The sum of concentrations of OVOCs was averagely 13% higher during the dry season (November to April), when winds transported polluted air masses to Shenzhen from the continent, than during the wet season, and peak diurnal levels occurred during the daytime year-round due to photochemical production and higher daytime anthropogenic emissions. The average dry season concentration of OVOCs declined from a peak of 30.3 ppb in 2015 to 18.7 ppb in 2019. The results of source apportionment showed that primary anthropogenic sources contributed the most to methanol, MEK, and acetic acid (32–51%); the dominant sources of acetaldehyde and formic acid were both primary and secondary anthropogenic sources; and biomass burning contributed a small fraction (5–11%) to the six OVOCs. From 2014 to 2019, contributions from primary anthropogenic sources of OVOCs decreased significantly by 50–60% due to intensive pollution control measures in Shenzhen, whereas pollution control measures had no observable impact on secondary OVOCs, indicating their formation was not limited by availability of their primary VOC precursors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic sources; Long-term observation; OVOCs; Source apportionment; Temporal variation","Acetaldehyde; Acetic acid; Acetone; Drought; Emission control; Formic acid; Mass spectrometry; Methanol; pH; Photochemical reactions; Proton transfer; Reaction intermediates; Volatile organic compounds; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic sources; Long term observations; Parameterization method; Photochemical production; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Air pollution; 2 butanone; acetaldehyde; acetic acid; acetone; formic acid; methanol; volatile organic compound; volatile organic compound; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission control; oxygenation; source apportionment; temporal variation; urban atmosphere; volatile organic compound; air sampling; Article; atmosphere; biomass; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); dry season; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; geography; photochemistry; pollution control; pollution transport; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; rainy season; seasonal variation; urban area; air pollutant; atmosphere; China; environmental monitoring; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; China; Environmental Monitoring; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098531715

Understanding the effect of each influencing factor on ECS is conducive to providing theoretical reference for the formulation of energy and environmental policies, howbeit it lacks studies about the main drivers of national and regional ECS in China. With the consideration of increasingly standardized formal environmental regulation (FER), an extended LMDI model is constructed to decompose the national and regional ECS from 1998 to 2017 into ten influencing factors. The ultimate goals of this concept are to explore the dominant factors of national and regional ECS at different time stages by employing temporal decomposition model, and to investigate the primary drivers that cause the disparity between provincial ECS and national average ECS by applying spatial decomposition model. The results reveal that the effect of FER, the reciprocal of industrial pollution control investment per unit GDP and economic development are the main factors leading to the change of national and regional ECS, specifically FER has a stronger effect on resource-based regions. Also, R&D intensity and R&D efficiency are important factors for ECS change. Energy efficiency and Per capita energy production are the leading factors of ECS disparity between 30 provinces and the national average. What's more, FER and R&D factors play important roles.

This resulted in unprecedented reductions in anthropogenic activity, and reduced emissions of certain air pollutants, namely oxides of nitrogen. The UK ‘lockdown’ was enforced on 23/03/2020, which led to restrictions on movement, social interaction, and ‘non-essential’ businesses and services. This study employed an ensemble of measurement and modelling techniques to investigate changes in air quality, atmospheric composition and boundary layer reactivity in the South East of the UK post-lockdown. The techniques employed included in-situ gas- and particle-phase monitoring within central and local authority air quality monitoring networks, remote sensing by long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Sentinel-5P's TROPOMI, and detailed 0-D chemical box modelling. Findings showed that de-trended NO2 concentrations decreased by an average of 14–38% when compared to the mean of the same period over the preceding 5-years. We found that de-trended particulate matter concentrations had been influenced by interregional pollution episodes, and de-trended ozone concentrations had increased across most sites, by up to 15%, such that total Ox levels were roughly preserved. 0-D chemical box model simulations showed the observed increases in ozone concentrations during lockdown under the hydrocarbon-limited ozone production regime, where total NOx decreased proportionally greater than total non-methane hydrocarbons, which led to an increase in total hydroxyl, peroxy and organic peroxy radicals. These findings suggest a more complex scenario in terms of changes in air quality owing to the COVID-19 lockdown than originally reported and provide a window into the future to illustrate potential outcomes of policy interventions seeking large-scale NOx emissions reductions without due consideration of other reactive trace species. © 2020 The Authors","Anthropause; Coronavirus; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide; Oxidative capacity; Ozone","Absorption spectroscopy; Air quality; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Hydrocarbons; Light absorption; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Remote sensing; Vanadium metallography; Viruses; Air quality monitoring networks; Anthropogenic activity; Long path differential optical absorption spectroscopies; Modelling techniques; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Organic peroxy radicals; Ozone concentration; Policy intervention; Uranium metallography; hydrocarbon; hydroxyl radical; methane; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; ozone; peroxy radical; radical; air quality; ambient air; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric chemistry; chemical composition; chemical reaction; COVID-19; nitrogen dioxide; oxidation; ozone; viral disease; 0 D chemical box modelling; absorption spectroscopy; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; atmosphere; chemical composition; communicable disease control; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy; environmental parameters; gas; geographic distribution; human; human activities; lockdown; oxidation; pandemic; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; remote sensing; Sentinel 5P; simulation; social interaction; TROPOMI; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Coronavirus; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092214550

Exposure windows and exposure-response functions (ERFs) are two critical components of accurate mortality burden estimation. Objective: We explored the potential heterogeneity of exposure windows and reassessed the PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China with novel ERFs. Method: Based on 1 km × 1 km satellite-retrieved PM2.5 and population data, provincial-level age structure, and mortality data, we applied the recent Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) with multiple exposure windows (1-year to 6-year during 2010–2015) to estimate age-specific PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China in 2015. Then, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Integrated Exposure-Response (IER) and Log-Linear (LL) models were exercised for comparative analysis. Result: The PM2.5-attributable mortality was the highest with a 3-year average exposure window (2013–2015). The GEMM-based total premature deaths were 133.2% [95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI): 93.6%–226.4%] and 14.2% (95% CI: 13.9%–16.8%) higher than the values obtained from the GBD2017 IER model and LL model, respectively. The national mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 was 1.94 (95% CI: 1.63–2.23) million, of which IHD and stroke were the leading causes, accounting for 27.3% and 23.0% of the total burden respectively. The mortality burden for the people over 80 years old was 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52–0.71) million, accounting for 31.9% (95%CI: 31.8%–32.0%) of the total burden. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential heterogeneity of PM2.5-attributable mortality burden associated with different exposure windows, especially when there are spatial-temporal variations in PM2.5 concentrations. The model comparison results suggest that the health impacts attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure in China may be much higher than previously estimated. The population over 80 years old has the highest PM2.5-attributable mortality burden. These findings have important policy implications for addressing air pollution at the provincial and national level in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Exposure window; Fine particulate matter; Global exposure mortality model; Long-term exposure; Premature mortality","Public policy; Comparative analysis; Critical component; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Multiple exposure; PM2.5 concentration; Policy implications; Response functions; Spatial temporals; Population statistics; cause of death; correlation; global perspective; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; satellite data; adult; age distribution; aged; all cause mortality; ambient air; cerebrovascular accident; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative study; controlled study; geographically weighted regression; global disease burden; human; lower respiratory tract infection; lung cancer; major clinical study; mortality rate; PM2.5 exposure; population; premature mortality; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical study; very elderly; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096984931

Therefore, a source-oriented version of the WRF-Chem model is developed in the study to conduct source apportionment of PM2:5in the North China Plain (NCP). A persistent and heavy haze event that occurred in the NCP from 5 December 2015 to 4 January 2016 is simulated using the model as a case study to quantify PM2:5contributions of local emissions and regional transport. Results show that local and nonlocal emissions contribute 36.3% and 63.7% of the PM2:5mass in Beijing during the haze event on average. When Beijing’s air quality is excellent or good in terms of hourly PM2:5concentrations, local emissions dominate the PM2:5mass, with contributions exceeding 50 %. However, when the air quality is severely polluted, the PM2:5contribution of nonlocal emissions is around 75 %. Nonlocal emissions also dominate Tianjin’s air quality, with average PM2:5contributions exceeding 65 %. The PM2:5level in Hebei and Shandong is generally controlled by local emissions, but in Henan, local and nonlocal emissions play an almost equivalent role in the PM2:5level, except when the air quality is severely polluted, with nonlocal PM2:5contributions of over 60 %. Additionally, the primary aerosol species are generally dominated by local emissions, with the average contribution exceeding 50 %. However, the source apportionment of secondary aerosols shows more evident regional characteristics. There fore except for cooperation with neighboring provinces to carry out strict emission mitigation measures, reducing primary aerosols is a priority to alleviate PM pollution in the NCP, especially in Beijing and Tianjin. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Currently, natural gas emission in OMIES has caused extra energy waste and environmental pollution. To reduce natural gas emission and improve the operating economy of OMIES, a bi-objective optimal scheduling model of OMIES is proposed in this paper, considering the overall operating cost(including the penalty cost of natural gas emission) as well as the operating state of the gas turbine generator units (GTGUs). The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) is introduced to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. And the constraint domination principle (CDP) is improved to handle all kinds of constraints involved in the mathematical model.

The heterogeneous distributions of the concentration and compositions of PM2.5 between the urban centre and the suburban areas lead to changes in the urban heat island (UHI) intensity. This study investigated the direct and indirect effects of PM2.5 and the impact of scattering and absorption by PM2.5 on UHI intensity in Nanjing, China, using numerical modelling. The results showed that both the direct and indirect effects of PM2.5 reduced the UHI intensity (approximately between 0.04 K and 0.07 K) during the daytime and strengthened it during the night-time (approximately between 0.05 K and 0.08 K). Furthermore, scattering and absorbing compositions have a comparable impact on UHI where the concentration of scattering compositions is nine times the concentration of the absorbing compositions. They both decreased UHI intensity during the daytime (up to approximately 0.1 K) and increased it during the night-time (up to approximately 0.12 K). The existence of absorbing compositions of PM2.5 and their high concentrations may have worked in tandem to mask the UHI phenomenon and other problems encountered in urban development in the last few decades. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical compositions; PM2.5; Radiative forcing effects; UHI intensities","Atmospheric temperature; Urban growth; Aerodynamic diameters; Chemical compositions; Heterogeneous distributions; Particulate Matter; Radiative effects; Scattering and absorption; Urban development; Urban heat island; Radiation effects; boundary layer; chemical composition; concentration (composition); heat island; particulate matter; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; suburban area; urban development; article; China; heat; night; particulate matter 2.5; radiative forcing; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099121548

Leakage at the up-dip margins of these systems may be highly variable if internal gas transmission by secondary migration is focused along fairways with favourable stratigraphic and structural characteristics. In this study of the Montney Formation, regional mapping of the methane content of produced gas reveals two orders of trends. The first-order regional trend is increasing methane content with depth and thermal maturity. Second-order trends are orthogonal or oblique to the first-order trend, and defined by curvilinear fairways with methane contents higher than expected from the first-order trend. They can be mapped for 10s km with some extending up-dip from the dry gas window into the oil window. Methane enrichment along second-order trends reflects fractionation of hydrocarbon fluids by a variety of processes including phase separation, secondary migration, fluid mixing and evaporative fractionation. Gas composition, recombination PVT and carbon isotope ratio data from produced fluids are used in three local case studies to show that methane-rich gas was driven up-dip by buoyancy forces and regional pressure gradient with migration focused along suitably oriented fairways of enhanced permeability and positive local structure. Secondary migration of methane-rich gas resulted in modified hydrocarbon compositions with leaner liquid contents and higher gas-oil ratios than expected from thermal maturity indicators. Recognition of secondary methane migration fairways is thus essential for hydrocarbon evaluation and exploitation in the Montney Formation, and conceivably in other analogous tight-hydrocarbon systems that have undergone significant uplift. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Basin uplift; Gas carbon isotope; Montney formation; Phase separation; PVT; Secondary migration; Tight hydrocarbons","Fractionation; Hydrocarbons; Methanation; Methane; Phase separation; Stratigraphy; Carbon isotope ratio; Enhanced permeability; Hydrocarbon compositions; Hydrocarbon evaluations; Hydrocarbon fluids; Hydrocarbon systems; Methane enrichments; Structural characteristics; Gases; carbon isotope; enrichment; hydrocarbon; mapping; methane; natural gas; separation; thermal maturity; uplift; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096575832

Some plants are equipped with a sewage pre-treatment plant, which is then directed to the sewerage system and the treatment plant. Others, on the other hand, have only a non-drainage tank. The parameters of technological sewage (TS) or processing technology could reduce sewage contamination rates. In addition to the quality of sewage from waste treatment plants, the emission of odours is also an important problem, as evidenced by the results obtained over the sewage pumping station tank. The conducted statistical analysis shows a significant positive correlation between odour concentration (cod ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Analysing the individual compounds, a high positive correlation was also found—the strongest being between H2 S, NH3 and VOCs. In the case of sewage compounds, the insignificant correlation between P total and other parameters was found. For the rest of the compounds, the highest positive correlation was found between COD and BOD and N-NO2 and N-NH3 as well as COD and N-NO2 . The dilution of sewage is only an ad hoc solution to the problem. Further work should be aimed at reducing sewage pollution rates. The obtained results indicate large pollution of technological sewage and a high level of odour and odorants concentration. The novelty and scientific contribution presented in the paper are related to analyses of various factors on technological sewage parameters and odour and odorant emission from TS tank at biogas plant processing municipal waste, which may be an important source of knowledge on the management of TS, its disposal and minimisation of emitted compound emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

One potential renewable energy source is biogas. Its role has been relatively small compared to other energy sources, but it could have a more central role to solve some specific challenges, e.g., to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions from traffic, or to act as a buffer to balance electricity production with consumption. This research analyses how the future of the biogas business in three case study countries is developing until 2030. The study is based on experts’ views within the biogas business branch in Germany, The Netherlands, and Finland. Both similarities and differences were found among the experts’ answers, which reflected also the current policies in different countries. The role of biogas was seen much wider than just to provide renewable energy, but also to decrease emissions from agriculture and close loops in a circular economy. However, the future of the biogas branch is much dependent on political decisions. To be able to show the full potential of biogas technology for society, stable and predictable energy policy and cross-sector co-operation are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

To better understand these challenges, we explored two key questions: (1) What additional data are needed to implement e-flows? and (2) What are the major socio-political barriers to implementing e-flows? We surveyed water and natural resource decision makers in the semi-arid Red River basin, Texas-Oklahoma, USA, and used social network analysis to analyze their communication patterns. Most respondents agreed that e-flows can provide important benefits and identified the same data needs. However, respondents sharply in their beliefs on other issues, and a clustering analysis revealed two distinct groups of decision makers. One cluster of decision makers tended to be bearish, or pessimistic, and believed that: current flow conditions are not adequate, there are many serious socio-political barriers to implementation, water conflicts will likely increase in the future, and climate change is likely to exacerbate these issues. The other cluster of respondents was bullish, or optimistic: they foresaw fewer future water conflicts and fewer socio-political barriers to implementation. Despite these differences, both clusters largely identified the same data needs and barriers to e-flows implementation. Our social network analysis revealed that the frequency of communication between clusters was not significantly different than the frequency of communication within clusters. Overall, our results suggest that the different perspectives of decision-makers could complicate efforts to implement e-flows and proactively plan for climate change.

In many cases, the potential value and feasibility of proposed projects vary across climate scenarios. A key goal is to identify areas where conservation outcomes can balance both environmental and human needs. We developed a conservation prioritization framework that jointly considers the value and feasibility of candidate projects across future climate scenarios. We then applied this framework to the challenge of meeting environmental flow targets across the Red River basin of the south-central United States. To estimate the conservation feasibility of meeting environmental flow goals in a river reach in each climate scenario, we used a basin-wide hydrologic planning tool to quantify the reduction in societal water usage needed to meet environmental flow targets. To estimate the biodiversity value of each river reach in each climate scenario, we used climate-driven species distribution models and species’ conservation status. We found that river reaches in the east-central portion of the basin may be good candidates for conservation investments, because they had high biodiversity value and high sociopolitical feasibility in all future climate scenarios. In contrast, sites in the arid western reaches of the basin had high biodiversity value, but low feasibility of achieving environmental flow goals. Our framework should have broad applicability given that the value and feasibility of conservation projects vary across climate scenarios in ecosystems around the world. It may serve as a coarse filter to identify sites for more detailed analyses and could be integrated with complementarity-based approaches to conservation planning to balance species’ representation across projects.

Here, we quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land-based biodiversity losses associated with final consumption in 162 regions in the European Union in 2010. For this purpose, we developed an environmentally extended multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model with subnational European information on demand, production, and trade structures subdivided into 18 major economic sectors, while accounting for trade outside Europe. We employed subnational data on land use and national data on GHG emissions. Our results revealed within-country differences in per capita GHG and land-based biodiversity footprints up to factors of 3.0 and 3.5, respectively, indicating that national footprints may mask considerable subnational variability. The per capita GHG footprint increased with per capita income and income equality, whereas we did not find such responses for the per capita land-based biodiversity footprint, reflecting that extra income is primarily spent on energy-intensive activities. Yet, we found a shift from the domestic to the foreign part of the biodiversity footprints with rising population density and income. Because our analysis showed that most regions are already net importers of GHG emissions and biodiversity losses, we conclude that it is increasingly important to address the role of trade in national and regional policies on mitigating GHG emissions and averting further biodiversity losses, both within and outside the region itself. To further increase the policy relevance of subnational footprint analyses, we also recommend the compilation of more detailed subnational MRIO databases including harmonized environmental data. © 2020 by Yale University","biodiversity loss; footprint analysis; greenhouse gas emissions; industrial ecology; multi-regional input–output analysis; subnational assessment","Biodiversity; Commerce; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Land use; Population statistics; Biodiversity loss; Country differences; Economic sectors; Environmental data; Footprint analysis; Per capita income; Population densities; Regional policies; Greenhouse gases; biodiversity; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; income; mitigation; population density; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086474291

Logging and wildfire are common widespread disturbances known to significantly reduce carbon stocks in carbon rich forests, such as, the tall forests of south-eastern Australia. Most tall forests in south-eastern Australia are dominated by globally unique resprouting Eucalypts that experience limited mortality after high severity wildfire. However, the most carbon dense forests in the region are dominated by non-resprouting Eucalypts that, like many other species associated with carbon dense forests around the world, experience stand replacement after high severity wildfire. We used space-for-time surveys to measure how above ground carbon stocks change with time since logging and time since wildfire in resprouting and non-resprouting Eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia. Logging reduced above ground carbon stocks much more than wildfire in both forest types. Carbon stock losses caused by wildfire were more substantial in non-resprouting forests than resprouting forests, which experience only minor losses after wildfire. The recovery of carbon stocks after wildfire began to asymptote after approximately 40 years but increased almost continuously with time since logging in both forest types. Carbon stock losses associated with logging represent a much greater departure from natural disturbance in resprouting forests, because wildfire causes relatively little carbon loss in resprouting forests compared to non-resprouting forests. This analysis highlights the need to consider specific biological responses when assessing forest carbon stock losses associated with disturbance. Consideration of these dynamics is essential in addressing carbon stock risk mitigation. © 2020","Above ground carbon; Disturbance history; Eucalyptus; Forest carbon; Forest management; Logging; Resprouting; Temperate forest; Wildfire","Carbon; Fires; Above-ground carbons; Biological response; Carbon stocks; Eucalypt forest; Forest carbons; Natural disturbance; Risk mitigation; South-eastern Australia; Forestry; carbon sequestration; comparative advantage; dicotyledon; disturbance; forest fire; resprouting; source-sink dynamics; wildfire; Australia; Carbon; Fires; Forestry; Forests; Logging; Australia; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094320612

Using detailed geospatial data from Earth-observing satellites and the national forest inventory, we quantify the net climate effect of losing forest across the conterminous United States. We find that forest loss in the intermountain and Rocky Mountain West causes net planetary cooling but losses east of the Mississippi River and in Pacific Coast states tend toward net warming. Actual U.S. forest conversions from 1986 to 2000 cause net cooling for a decade but then transition to a large net warming over a century. Avoiding these forest conversions could have yielded a 100-year average annual global cooling of 0.00088°C. This would offset 17% of the 100-year climate warming effect from a single year of U.S. fossil fuel emissions, underscoring the scale of the mitigation challenge.

The total NHx (gaseous NH3 and particle NH4+) was mostly in excess the need to neutralize acid compounds. During the whole study period, the aerosol pH with an average value of 4.05. From normal period into haze episodes, the aerosol pH tends to decrease and the concentration of all species (gases and particles) increases. Meanwhile, declined gas fractions exhibited that enhanced partitioning from HNO3, NH3 and SO2 to their corresponding particle phases.

Three different optical response models for the free-electron gas are adopted, including the classical Drude local response approximation, the nonlocal hydrodynamic model, and the generalized nonlocal optical response model. Nonlocal optical response leads to a blueshift and a reduction in the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate. Within all the three models, the resonance frequency is largely determined by the aspect ratio (the ratio of the nanorod length to the radius) and increases sharply with decreasing aspect ratio. For nanorod with a fixed length, it is found that the larger the radius is, the higher the resonance frequency is, and the smaller the enhancement is. However, if the length of the nanorod increases, the peak frequency falls sharply, while the spontaneous emission enhancement grows rapidly. For nanorod with a fixed aspect ratio, the peak frequency decreases slowly with increasing nanorod size. Larger nanorod shows smaller nonlocal effect. At a certain frequency, there is an optimal size to maximize the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate. Higher order modes are more affected by the nonlocal smearing of the induced charges, leading to larger blueshift and greater reduction in the enhancement. These results should be significant for investigating the spontaneous emission rate of a QE around a gold nanorod. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","gold nanorod; hydrodynamics; spatially nonlocal response; spontaneous emission rate","Aspect ratio; Blue shift; Electron gas; Electrons; Gold; Gold Nanorods; Natural frequencies; Spontaneous emission; Free electron gas; Higher-order modes; Hydrodynamic model; Non-local effect; Quantum emitters; Resonance frequencies; Spontaneous emission enhancement; Spontaneous emission rates; Nanorods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101093055

Over the next few decades, the U.S. electricity sector will need to double in size to accommodate electric vehicles, while transforming to run entirely on clean energy. To drive this transformation, states are increasingly adopting 100 percent clean energy targets. But fossil fuel corporations are pushing back, seeking to maintain their structural domination of the U.S. energy sector. This Article calls attention to one central but under-scrutinized way that these companies impede the clean energy transition: incumbent fossil fuel companies essentially run the United States' electricity grid, writing its rules in ways that favor their private interests at the expense of societal goals. In most of the country, entities known as Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) manage the electricity grid under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversight. These organizations, formed in the late 1990s, have a distinct intellectual lineage in the privatization and new governance movements of that time. Most RTOs are structured as private industry clubs, in which industry members “vote” on the rules for regional electricity markets and grid operation. This governance arrangement has proven successful at maintaining a reliable grid but often serves as an impediment to progress on clean energy. Over the twenty years of their existence, many RTOs have resisted incorporating clean energy and energy conservation measures into their grids and market rules, despite strong evidence that treating these resources commensurately would lower costs and improve market functionality. Now, several regions are pursuing reforms in the name of “investor confidence” and “fuel security” that privilege coal and natural gas resources-the same fossil fuels that many states are trying to phase out of their energy mix. This Article contends that the United States' functionally privatized mode of electricity governance must be reevaluated as regulatory priorities shift in response to climate change. U.S. electricity law suffers from a gaping and growing accountability gap, in which neither FERC nor states have the authority needed to make electricity markets bend to democratically established prerogatives that harm industry incumbents. To remedy the situation, federal and state regulators need more robust authority to shape energy market rules to public aims. Drawing from informative differences across RTOs, the Article concludes with four reform pathways, suggesting that FERC or Congress might (1) pare back RTOs' responsibilities, (2) enhance state and federal oversight capabilities, (3) police corporate agglomeration in the sector, and (4) explore public ownership or control over the grid.

Results show 3,093 carbon clusters and 432 sinks in 85 countries and regions are selected to achieve 92 GtCO2 mitigation by CCUS, 64% of which will be sequestered into sedimentary basins for aquifer storage and 36% will be used for CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery). Of the identified source–sink matching, 80% are distributed within 300 km and are mainly located in China, the United States, the European Union, Russia and India. The total cost is ~0.12% of global cumulative gross domestic product. Of countries with CO2-EOR, 75% will turn into profitable at the oil price over US$100 per barrel.

With the continuous development of cities, the problem of carbon emissions has received substantial attention. Analyzing the relationship between carbon emissions and city development is key to building low-carbon cities. This paper selects the revised Zipf's law to explore diverse carbon emission characteristics in different stages of city development and tries to verify the balance of city development and the rationality of key emitting sectors in China, thus filling a gap in this domain. Based on the analysis of different emitting sectors and diverse city categories, several discoveries are made. First, nearly 80% of Chinese cities have reached the ideal state of Zipf's law between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and city development. In general, carbon emissions and city development are basically matched at the present stage. Second, in cities, the carbon emissions of the agricultural and industrial processes sectors are relatively balanced and stable with the city development. In addition, only the traffic sector is in the stage of intensive development. Other sectors (industrial energy, rural household, urban household, services, and indirect emissions) need to be further optimized. Third, CO2 emissions in other type of cities are basically matched with the city development. Industrial cities, megalopolises and metropolises are in the stage of intensive development, while cities of other types (service-oriented cities and small-medium cities) need to be further optimized. Fourth, corresponding measures, such as adjusting energy and industrial structure, optimizing resource allocation, and promoting intensive production, need to be taken to optimize carbon emissions in cities of different types and in different emitting sectors. Our study provides a particular theoretical basis and practical value, for China and other countries in similar situations, to coordinate the matching correlation between city development and carbon emissions in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; City development; Rank-size rule; Zipf's law","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Computational linguistics; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Service industry; Carbon dioxide emissions; Continuous development; Corresponding measures; Industrial energy; Industrial processs; Industrial structures; Local development; Matching correlation; Urban growth; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; empirical analysis; traffic emission; urban development; urban pollution; agricultural procedures; Article; carbon footprint; China; city development; controlled study; empirical city test; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; geographic distribution; greenhouse gas; industrial production; industry and industrial phenomena; industry structure; population density; priority journal; process optimization; risk assessment; risk factor; social aspects and related phenomena; theory; traffic; validation study; Zipf law; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097585824

In this article, we review the current remote sensing-based knowledge on African dryland ecosystem dynamics and the main drivers of changes. Global CO2 enrichment, changes in rainfall regimes, and a decline in fire activity have collectively driven vegetation greening, woody plant increase and carbon dynamics in African drylands over recent decades, challenging the long-held desertification narrative.

These polluted corridors harbour vegetation on roadsides and traffic islands, planted solely for aesthetic appeal. Analysis of air pollution tolerance levels of existing plants can act as a scientific basis for efficient planning of the urban landscape. Sixty-seven species, including flowering, fruit-bearing, ornamental, shade-providing and timber-yielding species, were screened for their relative resistance to air pollution.

Age was estimated from 768 Largemouth Bass from six distinct populations. Largemouth Bass growth and longevity in northern Idaho was typical to populations at similar latitudes; however, growth was substantially slower than average compared with other populations throughout North America. Mean relative growth estimates of Largemouth Bass for ages 1–8 never exceeded the 25th percentile of the North American average, and relative growth was either stable or slightly increasing as a function of age for most study populations. Annual incremental growth was more variable across years than among populations. Growth tended to be positively related to precipitation during the growing season or mean minimum annual temperature, but the importance of either covariate was dependent on lake surface area. Approximately 50% of the variation in growth of Largemouth Bass was explained by precipitation during the growing season in lakes with a surface area ≤70 ha. In the largest study lakes (i.e., ≥600 ha), over 50% of the variability in incremental growth was attributable to mean minimum annual temperature. Similarity in lake surface area resulted in the most interannual growth synchrony, whereas less synchrony was observed as a function of proximity. We hypothesize that annual climate patterns are not spatially variable enough in northern Idaho to elucidate measurable effects on growth but that local geography may be more important for regulating how climate interacts with Largemouth Bass growth on a regional basis. We interpret our results to mean that the ecology and conservation of Largemouth Bass may benefit from a more complete understanding of the climate–growth relationships on a region-by-region basis, with particular consideration for ecosystem characteristics. © 2021 American Fisheries Society",,"assessment method; growing season; growth; lacustrine environment; lake ecosystem; lentic environment; longevity; perciform; precipitation (climatology); salmonid; spatiotemporal analysis; Idaho; Idaho County; North America; United States; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100473420

Therefore, it is vital to understand the role of different forests in regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this study, we have used eddy covariance (EC) tower-based atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements and satellite-retrieved column average CO2 concentration of 2018 to understand the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the sub-tropical forest in the foothills of northwest Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. EC study revealed that the CO2 concentration over the forest canopy peaks during mid-night to early morning and drop to a minimum during the afternoon. On a monthly scale, peak atmospheric CO2 concentration was observed during July in both the sites, which was a result of more release of CO2 by the forest ecosystem through ecosystem respiration and microbial decomposition. Enhanced photosynthetic activities during the late monsoon and post-monsoon resulted in the decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the forest ecosystem. Among the meteorological variables, rainfall was found to have the highest control over the seasonal variability of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite-retrieved column average CO2 (XCO2) was also examined to comprehend its reliability on an ecosystem scale. The OCO-2 retrieved XCO2 value was higher than the EC carbon flux tower-measured atmospheric CO2 concentration, which might be due to differences in the vertical resolution of the CO2 column and scale difference. However, the monthly atmospheric XCO2 retrieved from OCO-2 strongly adheres with the ground-measured monthly pattern. Our study highlights that forests with varying functional traits within the same climatic conditions show variability in the regulation of atmospheric CO2 concentration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycle; Deciduous broadleaved; Eddy covariance; Greenhouse gas; NDVI; OCO-2","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse effect; Orbits; Satellites; Tropics; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance towers; Meteorological variables; Microbial decomposition; Photosynthetic activity; Seasonal variability; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Subtropical forests; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; rain; carbon dioxide; atmospheric pollution; broad-leaved forest; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); deciduous forest; eddy covariance; forest canopy; greenhouse gas; NDVI; seasonal variation; subtropical region; Article; atmosphere; canopy; concentration (parameter); controlled study; ecosystem; India; measurement accuracy; net ecosystem exchange; photosynthesis; precipitation; rainy season; seasonal variation; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; forest; reproducibility; season; Himalayas; India; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; India; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100420450

In this study, we collected filter samples of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over four seasons in both 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 at an urban site in Shanghai, China, and comprehensively characterized the OS species in these PM2.5 samples using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole timeof-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (UPLC-ESI-QToFMS). Overall, we find that while the concentration of organic aerosols (OAs) decreased by 29 % in 2018-2019 compared to that in 2015-2016, mainly as a result of the reduction of anthropogenic pollutant emissions in eastern China, the annually averaged concentrations of 35 quantified OSs were similar in both years (65.5 ± 77.5 ng m-3 , 0.57 % ± 0.56 % of OA in 2015-2016 vs. 59.4 ± 79.7 ng m-3 , 0.66 % ± 0.56 % of OA in 2018-2019), suggesting an increased contribution of SOAs to OAs in 2018-2019 compared to 2015-2016. Isoprene-and monoterpene-derived OSs were the two most abundant OS families, on average, accounting for 36.3 % and 31.0 % of the quantified OS concentrations, respectively, during both sampling years, suggesting an important contribution of biogenic emissions to the production of OSs and SOAs in Shanghai. The abundance of biogenic OSs, particularly those arising from isoprene, exhibited strong seasonality (peaked in summer) but no significant interannual variability. In contrast, the quantified anthropogenic OSs had little seasonal variability and declined in 2018-2019 compared with those in 2015-2016. The C2 and C3 OS species that have both biogenic and anthropogenic origins contributed, on average, 19.0 % of the quantified OSs, with C2H3O6S-, C3H5O5S-, and C3H5O6S-being the most abundant species, together accounting for 76 % of the C2 and C3 OS concentrations in 2015-2016 and 2018-2019. 2-Methyltetrol sulfate (2-MTS, C5H11O7S-) and monoterpene-derived C10H16NO7S-were the most abundant OSs and nitrooxy OSs in summer, on average, contributing 31 % and 5 % of the quantified OSs, respectively, during the summertime of the sampling years. The substantially larger concentration ratio of 2-MTS to 2-methylglyceric acid sulfate (2-MAS, C4H7O7S-) in summer (6.8-7.8) compared to the other seasons (0.31-0.78) implies that low-NOx oxidation pathways played a dominant role in isoprene-derived SOA formation in summer, while highNOx reaction pathways were more important in other seasons. We further find that the production of OSs was largely controlled by the level of Ox (Ox= O3+NO2), namely the photochemistry of OS precursors, particularly in summer, though sulfate concentration, aerosol acidity, and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) that could affect the heterogeneous chemistry of reactive intermediates leading to OS for mation also played a role. Our study provides valuable insights into the characteristics and mechanisms of OS formation in a typical Chinese megacity and implies that the mitigation of Ox pollution can effectively reduce the production of OSs and SOAs in eastern China. ©",,"aerosol formation; annual variation; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); liquid chromatography; organic compound; particulate matter; pollution control; seasonal variation; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101765655

To assess the high instantaneous particle number (PN) emission characteristics, four hybrid electric vehicles with different technical parameters were tested under real-world driving conditions. The high instantaneous PN emission was clustered as high emission sets (HES) and HES were evaluated with the vehicle driving conditions and engine operating conditions. The results revealed that 20% of the accumulated particles are emitted within 2% of the driving time and 80% of the accumulated particles are emitted within 20% of the driving time. Most of the HES are observed at the speed lower than 60 km/h (urban speed limit), with relatively higher engine speed. HES have higher mean positive acceleration values than their RDE counterparts. But the largest acceleration doesn't represent high particle emission, because, with the electric motor, acceleration is decoupled with the engine variation. The HES could be observed at rich/lean fuel conditions, high/low state of charge, and before/after the engine is fully warmed-up depending on the vehicle's technical characteristics. Regeneration could increase the PN emission by a factor of five. Fuel-efficiency centered strategy should be combined with the pollutant-control centered strategy to achieve cleaner hybrid technology.

Aerosol concentrations are strongly influenced by rainfall via wet removal. Global climate models have been used to quantify their climate and health effects. However, they commonly suffer from a well-known problem of ‘too much light rain and too little heavy rain’. The impact of simulated rainfall intensities on aerosol burden at the global scale is still unclear. Here we show that rainfall intensity has profound impacts on aerosol burden, and light rain has a disproportionate control on it. By improving the representation of convection, the light-rain (1–20 mm d−1) frequency in two state-of-the-art global climate models is reduced. As a result, the aerosol burden is increased globally, especially over the tropics and subtropics, by as much as 0.3 in aerosol optical depth in tropical rain belts. It is attributed to the dominant contribution of light rain to the accumulated wet removal by its frequent occurrence despite its weak intensity. The implication of these findings is that understanding the nature of aerosol scavenging by rainfall is critical to aerosol–climate interaction and its impact on climate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric convection; climate effect; climate modeling; energy balance; global climate; optical depth; precipitation intensity; scavenging (chemistry); solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100190290

To address such challenges, flue gas quench (FGQ) is playing a vital role that links flue gas (FG) cleaning and wastewater treatment. In this study, a detailed analysis based on the material and energy balance is performed regarding the pollutant distribution in the flue gas and the wastewater within a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The real data from the reference CHP plant were used; and results show that the utilization of FGQ can result in less wastewater discharge (about 73 tonnes/d) together with less pollutant concentration to the municipal wastewater treatment plant, as compared to the system with only flue gas condenser but without FGQ. The integration of FGQ also results in less burden on the external freshwater use by increasing the amount of clean water for internal use (about 57 tonnes per day). In addition, the integration of FGQ can offer a potential annual energy saving of about 13.1 MWh in the municipal wastewater treatment plant due to the less wastewater coming from the CHP plant. © 2020 The Authors.

Here we present that the nanoporous CuBi2O4 photocathodes coated by a TiO2 overlayer with gradient thickness show improved CO2 reduction performance compared to pristine CuBi2O4. Different activity and selectivity for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction are observed when the thickness of TiO2 coating layer is set at two extreme values, i.e., less and longer than its Debye length. The CuBi2O4 with a thin TiO2 layer shows higher CO/H2 yield ratio, and the one with a thick layer exhibits lower CO/H2 ratio but higher yield for both CO and H2. All these are elucidated based on the results of Mott-Schottky plots, photocurrent response and SEM/TEM images. Results indicate that the TiO2 overlayer on CuBi2O4 is in favor of the generation and separation of electron/hole pairs, and thus facilitate CO and H2 production, while the nanoporous structure and the nonuniform TiO2 overlayer on CuBi2O4 have a great impact on mass transport, local pH, and exposed active sites and, thereby, on the CO production selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CuBi2O4/TiO2; Local pH; Mass transport; Nanoporous photocathode; Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction","Carbon dioxide; Copper compounds; Electrochemistry; Field emission cathodes; Hydrogen production; Oxide minerals; Photocathodes; Titanium dioxide; Co-production; CO2 reduction; Electrode/electrolyte interfaces; H2 production; Mott-Schottky plots; Nanoporous structures; Photocurrent response; Photoelectrochemicals; Bismuth compounds; carbon dioxide; titanium dioxide; titanium; titanium dioxide; carbon dioxide; coating; detection method; electrochemical method; electrode; inorganic compound; reduction; separation; Article; catalyst; chemical reaction; controlled study; electrodeposition; external bias; illumination; light intensity; reduction (chemistry); scanning electron microscopy; surface property; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; electrode; nanopore; Carbon Dioxide; Electrodes; Nanopores; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092156872

The episode of abrupt decay of pollution is mostly meteorological in origin and is controlled by the passage of synoptic systems. One affordable and effective measure for quickly reducing PM2:5 concentrations in northern China is to wait for a strong wind to arrive. However, it is still unclear how strong the wind needs to be and exactly what kind of synoptic system most effectively results in the rapid decay of air pollution episodes. PM2:5 variations over the 28 pollution channel cities of the Beijing region are investigated to determine the mechanisms by which synoptic patterns affect the decay processes of pollution episodes. This work shows more obvious day-To-day variations in PM2:5 concentration in winter than in summer, which implies that wintertime PM2:5 variations are more sensitive to meteorological factors. There were 365 decay processes from January 2014 to March 2020, and 97 of them were related to the effective wet deposition. In total, 26%-43% of PM2:5 pollutant is removed by the wet deposition in different seasons. Two dominant circulation patterns are identified in summer. All the other three seasons have three circulation types (CTs), respectively. The three CTs in spring show the same patterns as those in autumn and winter. The circulation patterns beneficial to the decay processes all exhibit a higher-Than-normal surface wind speed, a negative relative humidity anomaly and net outflow of PM2:5 from the domain. In addition, CT1 in spring, autumn and winter is controlled by northeasterly wind and features the most significant horizontal net outflow of air pollutants and effective upward spread of air pollutants to the free atmosphere. CT2 is the most frequent CT in autumn and winter, with the highest wind speed from the northwest, highest boundary layer height (BLH) and lowest relative humidity among the three CTs, all of which are favorable for the reduction of PM2:5 concentrations. In CT3, strong vertical wind shear within the boundary layer enhances the mixing of surface air pollutants, which is the extra cleaning mechanism besides dry and clean air mass inflow. PM2:5 concentrations show significant decreases of more than 37 %, 41% and 27% after the passage of CT1, CT2 and CT3, respectively. A dry airflow with a positive BLH anomaly and the effective horizontal outflow of air pollutants are the main reasons for the abrupt decay phase in summer. PM2:5 concentrations after the decay process show a significant decreasing trend from 2014 to 2020, reflecting successful emission mitigation.

The EXPLORE-YRD campaign helped construct a detailed air quality model to understand the formation of O3 and PM2.5 further, identify the key sources of elevated air pollution events, and design efficient emission control strategies to reduce O3 and PM2.5 pollution in YRD. In this study, we predicted the air quality during the EXPLORE-YRD campaign using the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality modelling system (WRF/CMAQ) and evaluated model performance on O3 and PM2.5 concentrations and compositions. Air quality was predicted using two sets of reanalysis data—NCEP Final (FNL) Operational Global Analysis and ECMWF Reanalysis v5.0 (ERA5)—and three horizontal resolutions of 36, 12, and 4 km. The results showed that PM2.5 concentration was generally under-predicted using both the FNL and ERA5 data. ERA5 yielded slightly higher PM2.5 predictions during the EXPLORE-YRD campaign. Both reanalysis data sets under-predicted the high PM2.5 pollution processes on 29–30 May 2018, indicating that reanalysis data is not essential for under-predicting extreme PM2.5 pollution processes. The performance of O3 was similar in both the reanalysis data sets, because O3 is mostly sensitive to temperature predictions and FNL and ERA5 yielded similar temperature results. Although the average performance of PM2.5 and O3 predictions yielded by FNL and ERA5 was similar, large differences were observed in certain locations on specific days (e.g. in Hangzhou between 29 May and June 6, 2018 and in Hefei on 1–3 June 2018). Therefore, the choice of reanalysis data could be an important factor affecting the predictions of PM2.5 and O3, depending on locations and episodes. Comparable results were obtained using predictions with different horizontal resolutions, indicating that grid resolution was not crucial for determining the model performance of both PM2.5 and O3 during the campaign. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","EXPLORE-YRD; Grid resolution; Model performance; O3; PM2.5; Reanalysis data","Air quality; Emission control; River pollution; Weather forecasting; Air quality modeling; Atmospheric oxidation capacity; Horizontal resolution; Meteorological input; Model performance evaluations; Multiscale air quality; Temperature prediction; Weather research and forecasting; Quality control; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; meteorology; modeling; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; air quality; article; forecasting; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; weather; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097737103

The alpine forest ecotone is expected to be affected first, due to the climatic limitations on tree growth, and is thus considered as an indicator of the forest succession to climate change. However, current studies involving tree radial growth and their responses to climate change at alpine forest ecotone remain scarce, posing challenges for predictions of forest dynamics and management strategies under different climate scenarios. Here, we studied 94 Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis; Pinaceae) and 86 Qinghai Spruce (Picea crassifolia; Pinaceae) trees along the alpine forest ecotone [2100–2400 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] to assess tree growth differences and corresponding responses to climate change in the Helan Mountains, northwestern China. The results revealed that growth rates of Chinese Pine at lowest altitudes and Qinghai Spruce at highest altitudes are strongly affected by water shortage and intraspecific competition, respectively, leading to the tree growth in these regions are inferior to those of other trees in the ecotone (the tree age at maximum width is about 20 years later than in the ecotone), especially for seedling and sapling stages. The responses of tree radial growth to dryness were broadly similar in each sample site, but wetness was more positive in trees at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Climate warming has inhibited the radial growth of Qinghai Spruce at lower distribution limits since 2005, while for Chinese Pine in the same area was not significantly affected by rising temperature, and even the upper limits of the Chinese Pine might migrate to higher altitudes as the calorific limit becomes higher. If climate warming continues, the above process may erode the Qinghai Spruce habitat, resulting in the transitional zone between Chinese Pine and Qinghai Spruce also moving to higher elevations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese Pine; Climate change; Dendrochronology; Forest ecotone; Northwestern China; Qinghai Spruce","Forestry; Geographical distribution; Geographical regions; Sea level; Climatic limitations; Coniferous forests; Global climate changes; Intraspecific competition; Management strategies; Northwestern China; Pinus tabulaeformis; Rising temperatures; Climate change; alpine environment; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; geographical distribution; global change; growth response; high temperature; mountain region; sapling; seedling; succession; China; Helan Mountains; Picea crassifolia; Pinaceae; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092693946

The study found that whether China's environmental regulatory policies can influence the intensity of carbon emissions through mediation effects is closely related to the type of policy. China's ordered environmental regulation policy can force technological innovation to indirectly curb carbon emissions, but a high carbon industry structure indirectly promotes carbon emissions. Carbon trading pilots have a negative intermediary effect on carbon emissions through industrial structure and technological innovation.

Consequently, problems of traffic congestion and air pollution have also appeared in these cities. Roadside parking traffic has also become an important part of the transportation system in cities. However, there is no specific measurement model for carbon emissions caused by roadside parking in the proposed traffic carbon emission model. Therefore, we aim to establish a carbon emission measurement model for roadside parking. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of the deceleration and maneuvering of parking vehicles and the blocking impact on running vehicles in a typical roadside parking scenario. We then establish and fit models of the direct and indirect carbon emissions during roadside parking. Based on the carbon emission model, we propose a calculation method for roadside parking carbon emissions, including accounting and estimation methods. These models can be used to calculate the carbon emissions from roadside parking in a traffic carbon emissions system. We also hope that these models will help future research on the optimization of roadside parking facilities for energy saving and emission reduction. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there are scarce reports about the effect of film mulching on ammonia oxidizers, and the biological nitrification process of N2O emission is unclear. This study was based on potato field experiments under different mulching films, including polyethylene mulching film (PM), transparent degradable mulching film (TDM), black degradable mulching film (BDM), and bare land (CK). AOB and AOA abundances were estimated using real-time PCR, and their diversity and community structure were measured using high-throughput sequencing. Result revealed that the total N2O emission from CK was 12.32%–41.03% higher than that from film mulching soil. Under film mulching, according to total N2O emission from soil and N2O concentration in soil treatments were ordered as PM &gt; BDM &gt; TDM, and N2O production was closely correlated with copy numbers of the amoA gene. BDM significantly increased the number of amoA-AOB gene copies (P &lt; 0.01), and PM significantly increased the those of amoA-AOA (P &lt; 0.01). BDM and TDM increased AOB operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon indices, while PM increased the AOA OTUs and Chao1 index. Variations in AOA abundance and diversity were closely related to soil mineral N and temperature changes induced by polyethylene film mulching (P &lt; 0.05), whereas AOB showed no significant association with soil properties. Meanwhile, we did not find a distinct treatment effect on AOB community structure. Our findings indicate that (i) degradable film mulching increased AOB abundance and diversity and N2O concentration, but obviously reduced N2O emissions, and (ii) AOA were more sensitive than AOB to polyethylene mulching film. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms; amoA gene; Degradable mulching film; Nitrous oxide; Soil nitrogen","Aliphatic compounds; Ammonia; Bacteria; Entertainment industry; Genes; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Polyethylenes; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA); Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Biological nitrification; Community structures; High-throughput sequencing; Operational taxonomic units; Plastic film mulching; Temperature changes; Soil pollution; ammonia; nitrogen; plastic; polyethylene; plastic; agricultural soil; ammonia; concentration (composition); drip irrigation; emission; gene; microorganism; mulching; nitrogen oxides; plastic; potato; soil nitrogen; taxonomy; ammonia oxidizing archaeon; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; amoA gene; Article; China; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; field experiment; gene; gene dosage; high throughput sequencing; microbial diversity; mulch; nitrous oxide emission; physical chemistry; potato; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; seasonal variation; soil acidity; soil property; soil temperature; archaeon; bacterium; genetics; microbiology; nitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; potato; soil; China; Nitrosomonadales; Otus; Solanum tuberosum; Ammonia; Archaea; Bacteria; China; Nitrification; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Plastics; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090405362

These measures prohibit a series of human activities and lead to a great reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Starting on February 20, all companies resumed work and production, and emissions gradually recovered. To investigate the response of air pollutants in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to the emission reduction and recovery related to COVID-19 lockdown, we used the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate the changes in air pollutants, including three periods: Period I (January 10 to January 22, 2020), Period II (January 23 to February 19, 2020), Period III (February 20 to March 9, 2020). During Period II, under the concurrent influence of emissions and meteorology, air quality improved significantly with PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 decreased by 52%, 67%, and 25%, respectively. O3 had no obvious changes in most cities, which mainly due to the synergetic effects of emissions and meteorology. In Period III, with the recovery of emissions and the changes in meteorology, the increase of secondary components was faster than that of primary PM2.5 (PPM), which indicated that changes in PPM concentration were more sensitive to emissions reduction. O3 concentration increased as emission and temperature rising. Our findings elucidate that more effective emission control strategies should be implemented in PRD to alleviate the increasingly serious pollution situation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; Emission recovery; Emission reductions; Meteorology conditions","Air quality; Emission control; Meteorology; Recovery; Secondary recovery; Sulfur dioxide; Anthropogenic emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Control strategies; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Secondary components; Synergetic effect; Temperature rising; River pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; meteorology; pollution control; respiratory disease; viral disease; air analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; Community Multiscale Air Quality model; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental protection; environmental temperature; forecasting; geographic distribution; lockdown; mathematical model; meteorology; oxidation; particulate matter; priority journal; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; river; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Rivers; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097890934

In the current study the anammox process accounted for 29.8 ~ 57.3% of nitrogen loss in ex situ activity batch tests of microcosms established from anoxic sediments of different tropical wetlands, with the highest activity being 17.95±0.51 nmol-N/g dry sediment/h. This activity was most likely driven by sulfide oxidation with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (sulfide-driven DNRA). Microbial community analyses revealed a variety of anammox bacteria related to several known lineages, including Candidatus Anammoximicrobium, Candidatus Brocadia and Candidatus Kuenenia, at different wetlands. Metagenome predictions, batch tests, and isotope-tracing suggested that the high level of anammox activity was due to sulfide-driven DNRA. This was corroborated by a strong correlation (through Pearson's analysis) between the abundance of anammox bacteria and the nrfA (a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium gene) and dsrA (a sulfate reductase gene) genes, as well as sulfate, ammonium and nitrate concentrations. These correlations suggest syntrophic interactions among sulfate-reducing, sulfide-driven DNRA, and anammox bacterial populations. A better understanding of the role of sulfur in nitrogen loss via the anammox reaction in natural systems could inform development of a viable wastewater treatment strategy that utilizes sulfate to minimize the activity of denitrifying bacteria and thus to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from wastewater treatment plants. © 2020","Anammox; DNRA; Nitrogen removal; Sulfate reduction; Tropical wetlands","Anoxic sediments; Anoxic water; Bacteria; Denitrification; Genes; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Sewage treatment plants; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Tropics; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Denitrifying bacteria; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Microbial community analysis; Nitrate concentration; Nitrous oxide emissions; Syntrophic interactions; Wastewater treatment plants; Nitrogen removal; ammonia; bacterial DNA; bacterial RNA; genomic DNA; nitrate; nitrogen; RNA 16S; sulfate; sulfide; sulfur; ammonium derivative; nitrogen; sulfur; ammonium; bacterium; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; oxidation; reduction; sulfide; sulfur cycle; wastewater treatment; amplicon; anammox bacterium; Article; Candidatus anammoximicrobium; Candidatus brocadia; Candidatus kuenenia; clone; concentration (parameter); controlled study; denitrification; isotope tracing; maximum likelihood method; metagenome; microbial community; microcosm; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); tropics; waste component removal; wetland; anaerobic growth; oxidation reduction reaction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfur; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096713535

The energy-saving and emission reduction in the industrial sector directly bear on the sustainable development of the whole country. This paper sets up an evaluation index system for industrial carbon emissions performance (ICEP), and then evaluates the ICEPs in 30 Chinese provinces from 2003 to 2017, using the stochastic block model (SBM). Based on the regional difference of the ICEP, a Tobit model was established to identify the driving factors of the ICEP. The main results are as follows: (1) There are obvious provincial differences in the ICEP: coastal provinces (e.g. Zhejiang, Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong) had relatively high ICEPs, while inland provinces (e.g. Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Shanxi and Qinghai) had undesirable ICEPs. (2) The three regions of China can be ranked as eastern region, central region, and western region in descending order of the ICEP. The central and western regions should be focused to promote energy-saving and emission reduction in the industrial sector. (3) The ICEP clustering shows that the ICEPs were medium and low in most provinces, and high in very few provinces. (4) Regression results of the Tobit model demonstrate that different driving factors have varied effects on the ICEP: economic development, technical progress, and foreign trade have significant positive effects on the ICEP, while energy structure and environmental regulation have significant negative effects on the ICEP. © 2020","Driving factors; Industrial carbon emissions performance (ICEP); Regional difference; Tobit model","Carbon; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental regulations; International trade; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Energy saving and emission reductions; Energy structures; Evaluation index system; Industrial sector; National economy; Regional differences; Stochastic block models; Technical progress; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090125944

However, the variability of atmospheric CO2 caused by the complex emission sources and topography within city remains a challenge in evaluating urban CO2 emissions. Specifically, the mechanism of spatial and temporal patterns is still unclear at city scale. In this work, we explored the spatial and seasonal patterns of atmospheric CO2 at the city scale in Xi'an and attempted to illustrate the mechanisms of these patterns based on the analysis of CO2 sources and sinks. Using the observed radiocarbon (14C) in atmospheric CO2 as a tracer, we determined the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (CO2ff) and the biosphere (CO2bio) in different seasons and city areas. The results showed that CO2ff in urban areas is significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than that in suburban areas, and explained 82% and 74% of the spatial differences in winter and summer, respectively. Based on the analysis of δ13C of CO2 in the local sources, the depleted δ13C of urban site indicated greater influences from traffic or natural gas in the urban area than that in the suburban area. These findings suggest that the spatial differences of atmospheric CO2 are dominated by different emission intensities of fossil fuels between urban and suburban areas. In contrast, the contributions of CO2ff to the seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 were different between urban and suburban areas, that is CO2ff contributed as much as CO2bio to the seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 in suburban area, but the contribution increased with the increasing of human activities from suburban to urban area, and accounted for 57% of seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 in the urban area. In addition, we also found that under the influence of the special topography of Xi'an city, the frequent fluctuations of atmospheric CO2 concentration in winter largely depend on the different wind conditions. © 2020","City atmospheric CO2; Mechanisms; Radiocarbon; Variability","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Topography; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Complex emissions; Emission intensity; Seasonal variation; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatial differences; Spatiotemporal variability; Urban and suburban areas; Urban growth; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; topography; tracer; urban atmosphere; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096208754

However, the simulation efficiency and validation of DGVMs are limited to varying temporal and spatial resolutions. Additionally, the uncertainties caused by different interpolation methods used in DGVMs are still not clear. In this study, we employ Socio-Economic and natural Vegetation ExpeRimental (SEVER) DGVM to simulate Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) flux with large scale National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) daily climate data as inputs for the years 1997–2000 at 14 Euroflux sites. It is shown that daily local NEE flux on chosen sites can be reasonably simulated, and daily temperature and shortwave radiation are the most essential inputs for daily NEE simulation compared with precipitation and the ratio of sunshine hours. Different running means (1 to 30 days) methods are analysed for each Euroflux site, and the best results of both averaged regression coefficient and averaged slope of regression are discovered by using 5 days running mean method. SEVER DGVM, driven by linearly interpolated daily climate data is compared at the monthly time step with Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) DGVM, which combines the linear interpolation of daily temperature with stochastic generation of daily precipitation. The comparison demonstrates that the stochastic generation of daily precipitation provides an acceptable fit to local observed NEE, but with a slight decrease in accuracy. Simulation experiments with SEVER DGVM demonstrate that daily local NEE flux inside a grid cell for a region as large as Europe can be modelled by DGVMs, using only large scale climate data as inputs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM); Euroflux; Large scale climate data; Net ecosystem exchange (NEE)","Carbon; Interpolation; Stochastic systems; Vegetation; Biogeochemical process; Interpolation method; National centers for environmental predictions; Net ecosystem exchange; Regression coefficient; Simulation efficiency; Stochastic generation; Temporal and spatial; Climate models; carbon; carbon cycle; carbon flux; climate modeling; data set; net ecosystem exchange; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation dynamics; Article; climate; climate change; controlled study; dynamic global vegetation model; ecosystem; Europe; experimental study; geography; Lund Potsdam Jena model; mathematical model; National Centers for Environmental Prediction; Net Ecosystem Exchange; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; radiation; regression analysis; shortwave radiation; simulation; socioeconomics; stochastic model; sunlight; temperature; vegetation; weather; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097331537

Herein, a sewage sludge was chosen for the synthesis of the sewage sludge activated carbon (SSC) supported Bi3+-doped TiO2 and Bi0 (SSCTB) photocatalysts. Through the pyrolytic carbonization, the sewage sludge was simultaneously displayed as the carbon precursor and reduction agent for the formation of SSC and Bi0, respectively. The results showed that the monodispersed Bi3+-doped TiO2 nanoparticles embedded with Bi0 were in-situ formed on the porous SSC. The synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Bi0, Bi3+ doping in TiO2, and the carbon of SSC greatly improved the light response ability and charge separation efficiency of the SSCTB samples. Under UV–Vis-NIR light irradiation for 60 min, the SSCTB sample with 5% of Bi (SSCTB5) possessed higher degradation rate of 47% for methyl orange compared with those of other samples.

However, limited effort has been made to enable direct energy recovery from NO through production of nitrous oxide (N2O) as a potential renewable energy rather than greenhouse gas. In this work, the enhanced energy recovery in the form of N2O via biological NO reduction was investigated by conducting short-term and long-term experiments at different Fe(II)EDTA-NO and organic carbon levels. The results showed both NO reductase and N2O reductase were inhibited at Fe(II)EDTA-NO concentration up to 20 mM, with the latter being inhibited more significantly, thus facilitating N2O accumulation. Furthermore, N2O accumulation was enhanced under carbon-limiting conditions because of electron competition during short-term experiments. Up to 47.5% of NO-N could be converted to gaseous N2O-N, representing efficient N2O recovery. Fe(II)EDTA-NO reduced microbial diversity and altered the community structure toward Fe(II)EDTA-NO-reducing bacteria-dominated culture during long-term experiments. The most abundant bacterial genus Pseudomonas, which was able to resist the toxicity of Fe(II)EDTA-NO, was significantly enriched, with its relative abundance increased from 1.0 to 70.3%, suggesting Pseudomonas could be the typical microbe for the energy recovery technology in NO-based denitrification. ©",,"Bacteria; Greenhouse gases; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Recovery; Reduction; Biological reductions; Chemical absorption; Community structures; Long-term experiments; Microbial diversity; Organic carbon level; Relative abundance; Renewable energies; Iron compounds; bacterial DNA; genomic DNA; nitric oxide; nitric oxide reductase; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; carbon; absorption; alternative energy; community structure; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; reduction; relative abundance; activated sludge; Article; bacterium culture; Bacteroidetes; biomass; chemical composition; community; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Desulfuromonas; electron; energy recovery; energy resource; enzyme activity; Firmicutes; greenhouse gas; high throughput sequencing; hydraulic retention time; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial growth; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; reduction (chemistry); renewable energy; Rhizobium; room temperature; solids retention time; suspended particulate matter; thermal conductivity; waste water treatment plant; denitrification; gas; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Carbon; Denitrification; Gases; Nitric Oxide; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100033527

Little is known about community succession within the belowground seagrass microbiome after disturbance and its potential role in the plant's recovery after transplantation. We transplanted Zostera marina shoots with and without an intact rhizosphere and cultivated plants for 4 weeks while characterizing microbiome recovery and effects on plant traits. Rhizosphere and root microbiomes were compositionally distinct, likely representing discrete microbial niches. Furthermore, microbiomes of washed transplants were initially different from those of sod transplants and recovered to resemble an undisturbed state within 14 days. Conspicuously, changes in the microbial communities of washed transplants corresponded with changes in the rhizosphere sediment mass and root biomass, highlighting the strength and responsive nature of the relationship between plants, their microbiome, and the environment. Potential mutualistic microbes that were enriched over time include those that function in the cycling and turnover of sulfur, nitrogen, and plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere environment.

Based on the theoretical mechanism analysis, this study empirically investigated the relationship between government intervention, market development, and China's provincial pollution emission efficiency by using the static panel OLS, system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM), and panel threshold effect model during the period 2000–2017. The results show that the impact of government intervention on China's provincial pollution emission efficiency shows a non-linear U-shaped curve relationship, and there is a positive correlation between market development and provincial pollution emission efficiency in China. Government intervention and market development are complementary, rather than a substitute for each other, in promoting China's provincial pollution emission efficiency. When government intervention is set as the threshold variable, the impact of government intervention on China's provincial pollution emission efficiency shows the feature of “promotes first, then inhibits.” However, when market development is set as the threshold variable, government intervention is only conducive to the improvement of China's provincial pollution emission efficiency at a moderate marketization level.

Despite recent breakthroughs, it remains a significant challenge to design a catalytic system with high product selectivity. Here we demonstrate that a high selectivity of ethylene (55%) and C2+ products (77%) could be achieved by a highly modular tricomponent copolymer modified Cu electrode, rivaling the best performance using other modified polycrystalline Cu foil catalysts. Such a copolymer can be conveniently prepared by a ring-opening metathesis polymerization, thereby offering a new degree of freedom for tuning the selectivity. Control experiments indicate all three components are essential for the selectivity enhancement. A surface characterization showed that the incorporation of a phenylpyridinium component increased the film robustness against delamination. It was also shown that its superior performance is not due to a morphology change of the Cu underneath. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that a combination of increased local CO2 concentration, increased porosity for gas diffusion, and the local electric field effect together contribute to the increased ethylene and C2+ product selectivity. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Aliphatic compounds; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric field effects; Ethylene; Metal cladding; Molecular dynamics; Morphology; Product design; Reduction; Ring opening polymerization; Control experiments; Degree of freedom; Local electric field; Molecular dynamics simulations; Morphology changes; Product selectivities; Selectivity enhancement; Surface characterization; Copper; carbon dioxide; copolymer; copper; ethylene; phenol derivative; phenylpyridinium; pyridinium derivative; unclassified drug; Article; catalyst; chemical modification; chemical structure; chronoamperometry; controlled study; crystal structure; electric field; electrochemical analysis; experimental study; gas diffusion; molecular dynamics; performance; porosity; ring opening metathesis polymerization; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101327220

The experiments are conducted by altering the incident laser intensity and polarization using a home-built scanning confocal optical microscope. The results show that AMPL originates from the recombination of avalanche hot carriers that are seeded by multiphoton ionization. Notably, at the excitation stage, multiphoton ionization is shown to be assisted by the local electromagnetic field enhancement produced by coupled plasmonic modes. At the emission step, the giant AMPL intensity can be evaluated as a function of the local field environment and the thermal factor for hot carriers, in accordance with a linear relationship between the power law exponent coefficient and the emitted photon energy. The dramatic change in the spectral profile is explained by spectral linewidth broadening mechanisms.

Understanding how extreme hot temperature—heat wave events (HWEs)—are likely to alter individual heat exposure and sensitivity is crucial for developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Despite the importance, little is known about the real-time impacts of HWEs on individual daily life in developing nations, like China. To fill this gap, we adopt over 1544 thousand Weibo (Chinese Twitter) social media data, coupled with meteorological conditions people face when posting, to assess the heat exposure and people's sensitivity to HWEs across 31 mega-cities in China. The results show the hotspot of Weibo heat is coincident with the extremely hot temperature, with a correlation of 0.7 (p < 0.05). The intensities, frequencies, and durations of HWEs in both geographical and social media space have high spatial heterogeneity. Its spatial variation can be explained by the type of climate zone and the unique geographical environment. The cities with extreme hot weather are more likely to adapt to the heatwave and less sensitivity to HWEs. The proposed framework, which integrates the real-time social media semantic analysis, statistical method, and spatial techniques, provides a new paradigm to assess the HWEs exposure and sensitivity analysis in China. © 2020 The Author(s)","China; Exposure; Heat wave events; Sensitivity; Weibo social media","Climate change; Semantics; Social networking (online); Adaptation strategies; Climate change mitigation; Geographical environment; Meteorological condition; Rising temperatures; Social media datum; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial variations; Sensitivity analysis; adaptive management; environmental risk; health risk; heat wave; megacity; numerical model; public health; sensitivity analysis; social media; strategic approach; temperature profile; Article; China; climate; controlled study; environmental exposure; geography; heat wave; high temperature; meteorology; priority journal; social media; thermal exposure; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094170899

However, field-based researches on residential coal combustion emissions are still limited at this stage. In this study, based on carbon balance method, emission factors (EFs) of CO2 and a series of pollutants, including gaseous pollutants (CO, NOX, CH4, and SO2), particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from residential honeycomb briquette (HB) and coal chunk (CC) combustions were measured in real-world cooking stoves. As a result, apart from SO2, the burning of HB produced much less pollutants than CC. The median of emission reduction ratios estimated from Monte Carlo simulation ranged from 2.4% (SO2) to 98.8% (EC) by replacing CC with HB in residential combustion in Shanxi province in 2012. EFs of CO, PM2.5 and PAHs derived from the present field measurement were around 1–50 times higher than those from laboratory tests; furthermore, larger variations were found in our field measurement compared to that in the laboratory studies. This result called for more field measurements to reduce uncertainties of emission inventory estimations. As for the PAH emissions, particle phase PAHs dominated in both HB and CC burning and PAH emissions from HB burning had lower toxicity than CC combustion. Hence, HB is an ideal substituted fuel compared with CC. Previous studies suggested that PAH isomer ratios of FLA/(FLA+PYR) and IcdP/(IcdP+BghiP) above 0.5 represented source of coal combustion, which did not fit with our study well, indicating PAH isomer ratios might not be valid enough for source apportionment. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Emission factors; Particulate matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Residential coal combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098621963

However, the contributions of bacterial and fungal communities to the multiple soil functions of alpine meadow ecosystems have not been widely examined. Here, we surveyed the soil in Qinghai-Tibetan alpine meadows and classified the extent of degradation as undegraded, lightly degraded, moderately degraded, and severely degraded to clarify the associations between microbial diversity (including bacteria and fungi) and potential soil multifunctionality. Bacterial and fungal compositions were detected by sequencing of the 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicons, respectively. Functions associated with nutrient cycling (dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon, available phosphorus, NO3–, NH4+, C, N, P-cycle enzymes) and climate regulation (CO2 and N2O emissions) were also examined. Bacterial, rather than fungal, richness was negatively associated with potential soil multifunctionality, which decreased along the degradation gradient. Structural equation modeling explained 79.6% of the variation in potential soil multifunctionality and confirmed that, in addition to bacterial community richness and composition, organic carbon and moisture were important drivers of potential soil multifunctionality. These results suggest that higher bacterial richness is associated with lower potential soil multifunctionality in alpine meadow ecosystems. Among the bacterial taxa, only ~ 12% of bacterial genera were identified as predictors of multifunctionality, suggesting functional redundancy of the bacterial community in the meadow ecosystem. Rhodanobacter, Mucilaginibacter, Rhodococcus, and Bosea, belonging to the Proteobacteria and the Actinobacteria phyla were identified as critical for maintaining potential soil multifunctionality. Our results suggest that bacterial richness is negatively related to potential soil multifunctionality in alpine meadow ecosystems and there is no correlation between potential multifunctionality and fungal richness. © 2020","Alpine meadow; Bacterial diversity; Degradation; Potential soil multifunctionality","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Ecosystems; Fungi; Organic carbon; Available phosphorus; Bacterial community; Community composition; Dissolved organic nitrogen; Functional redundancy; Internal transcribed spacers; Microbial diversity; Structural equation modeling; Soils; alpine environment; bacterium; community structure; fungus; meadow; microbial community; nutrient cycling; species diversity; species richness; China; Qinghai; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bosea (bacteria); Fungi; Proteobacteria; Rhodanobacter; Rhodococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091800813

In order to obtain a superior performance for a diesel engine running at high altitude, in this research, multi-objective optimization was conducted in an entire operating region for a light-duty diesel engine operating at an altitude of 1960 m. A support vector machine (SVM) was employed to set up a surrogate model between the calibration parameters and the engine performance parameters. The multi-objective optimization of the fuel consumption and the emissions was carried out using a genetic algorithm with the premise of keeping the same power performance of the original engine within durability constraints and with a minimum smoke limit. The results showed that the SVM regression model had excellent predictive performance and generalization abilities, and that the model could accurately predict the various performance parameters of the diesel engine. The diesel engine running in the plateau region could achieve a good comprehensive performance with the proposed multi-objective optimization method. In comparison with the base engine in the plateau region, a simultaneous reduction of 52.92% for the brake specific NOx emission and 0.67% for the brake specific fuel consumption was achieved, with an acceptable increase of smoke emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel engine; Engine modeling; Engine optimization; GA (genetic algorithm); High altitude; SVM (support vector machine)","Brakes; Diesel engines; Genetic algorithms; Light weight vehicles; Regression analysis; Smoke; Support vector machines; Brake specific fuel consumption; Calibration parameters; Comprehensive performance; Diesel engine running-in; Light-duty diesel engines; Modeling and optimization; Performance parameters; Simultaneous reduction; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091028505

Economic and life cycle environmental performance metrics are estimated to compare integrated and stand-alone systems using the resulting biogas and digestate. Using biogas for heating outperforms purifying it for distribution as renewable natural gas (RNG). However, current policy and energy prices in BC perversely support RNG, making biogas-fired heating systems economically unattractive. The performance of biogas-fired heating system can be improved and their dependence on subsidies reduced by integration with local agricultural activities, exploiting CO2 and digestate as by-products. Biogenic CO2, from combustion of the biogas and from mushroom cultivation, can displace natural gas use in producing CO2-enriched atmospheres to enhance growth rates in greenhouse production. Using digestate as growing media in greenhouses and mushroom cultivation can generate significant revenues but the environmental benefits are nugatory. Co-digestion of food waste can further improve performance by increasing biogas yield. With all extra benefits combined, integrated AD systems can increase both GHG mitigation and revenues by at least 80%. The analysis illustrates the general point that, to avoid perverse outcomes, policy measures must support options based on their actual GHG mitigation benefits, rather than targetting any specific technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Economic viability; Environmental policy; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Integrated agricultural systems","Agricultural robots; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Economics; Environmental management; Fertilizers; Food waste; Greenhouses; Heating equipment; Natural gas; Waste incineration; Agricultural activities; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Greenhouse production; Improve performance; Material consumption; Mushroom cultivation; Standalone systems; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; carbon dioxide; natural gas; renewable natural gas; unclassified drug; biofuel; anaerobic digestion; economic analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; farming system; greenhouse gas; policy analysis; pollution control; acidification; acidification potential; agricultural procedures; anaerobic digestion; Article; case study; cattle manure; Colombia; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental policy; eutrophication; eutrophication potential; food waste; greenhouse; heating; mushroom; physical parameters; poultry manure; respiratory inorganics; soil fertility; anaerobic growth; animal; British Columbia; food; management; waste disposal; British Columbia; Canada; Columbia; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Biofuels; British Columbia; Food; Policy Making; Refuse Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098538756

Compared to those before CNY, PM2.5, BC, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), other ions, elements, and NO2 and CO mass concentrations decreased by 9.9%–64.0% during CNY. The lockdown policy had strong (weak) effects on the diurnal variations in aerosol chemical compositions (gas pollutants). Compared to those before CNY, source concentrations and contributions of vehicle exhaust during CNY decreased by 72.9% and 21.7%, respectively. In contrast, increased contributions from coal combustion and industry were observed during CNY, which were recorded to be 2.9 and 1.7 times higher than those before CNY, respectively. This study highlights that the lockdown policy that was imposed in Suzhou during CNY not only reduced the mass concentrations of air pollutants but also modified their diurnal variations and the source contributions of PM2.5, which revealed the complex responses of PM2.5 sources to the rare, low emissions of anthropogenic pollutants that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-2019; Elements; PM2.5; PMF model; Water-soluble ions","Aerosols; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Sulfur compounds; Water pollution; Aerodynamic diameters; Aerosol chemical composition; Anthropogenic pollutants; High-time resolution; Mass concentration; Pollutant emission; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Air pollution; ammonia; black carbon; carbon monoxide; element; ion; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; sulfate; unclassified drug; water soluble ion; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; ion exchange; particulate matter; solubility; source apportionment; viral disease; aerosol; air analysis; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; chemical composition; China; circadian rhythm; coal combustion; combustion; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental parameters; exhaust gas; gas; human; human impact (environment); infection control; leisure; lockdown; particulate matter 2.5; source apportionment; aerosol; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; Jiangsu; Suzhou; Coronavirus; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098197711

To manage residual risk for water supply systems, utilities often apply water shortage mitigation plans to navigate through rare but extreme water shortage conditions before investing in an expensive new supply infrastructure. Some supply source augmentation strategies can be enabled through temporary reduction of regulatory constraints, e.g., groundwater production permits, that are protective of natural systems. Understanding the potential impact of pumping excursions on the groundwater level is important before implementing such management strategy. This study examines the resilience of water levels in the surficial aquifer system to temporarily increased groundwater pumping above a permit limit in the Tampa Bay region, located in west central Florida. Two major modeling tools were used, including the calibrated Integrated Northern Tampa Bay (INTB) model that dynamically couples hydrologic simulation of uplands and water bodies with groundwater and Unit Response Matrix (URM), which estimates groundwater level changes at monitoring wells due to pumpage changes at production wells. Both recovery time and maximum groundwater level changes are investigated. Results reveal that the median recovery time to preexcursion conditions for surficial aquifer in the study area is within 1 year for nearly all investigated scenarios. This indicates groundwater production excursions can serve as an attractive measure to mitigate severe water shortage conditions with no long-term adverse impacts to natural systems. Implication of this is a potential deferment of significant investment in infrastructure in the study area with the use of an effective water shortage mitigation plan to manage residual risk of the water supply system. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Groundwater production; Integrated hydrologic modeling; Resilience of groundwater level; Unit response matrix; Water shortage mitigation","Aquifers; Investments; Water levels; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Attractive measures; Conflicting objectives; Groundwater pumping; Hydrologic simulations; Management strategies; Potential impacts; Water shortage mitigations; Water supply management; Groundwater resources; aquifer; groundwater; hydrological modeling; water demand; water level; water management; water supply; Florida [United States]; Tampa Bay; United States; Florida; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096761813

The SWAT model was used to quantitatively analyze the regional soil and water loss affected by different climate changes. In addition, the evaluation and prediction model of agricultural sustainable planting was constructed with EPIC software, in order to achieve the agricultural sustainable planting by selecting appropriate crops. Based on the analysis of Yulin City in Shaanxi Province, the results showed that: with fixed precipitation, the increase and decrease of 5°C temperature would lead to a change rate of soil loss of -27.78 % and 9.52 % respectively; with fixed temperature, the increase and decrease of +20 % precipitation would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 21.43 % and - 38.10 % respectively. The situation of soil erosion under the slope environment was more serious, and the yield of grain and farming income decreased. It is necessary to choose reasonable planting methods and environmental control policies to reduce the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting.

However, the O3 concentration increased significantly as PM2.5 levels sharply decreased when these measures were implemented. Therefore, the policy-driven positive/negative health effects of PM2.5/O3 need to be comprehensively estimated. The health impact function (HIF) is applied to evaluate the health burden attributable to long- and short-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results show that the PM2.5 concentration decreased by 42.95% in 74 cities, whereas O3 pollution is increased by 17.56% from 2013 to 2018. Compared with 2013, the number of premature deaths attributable to long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure decreased by almost 5.31 × 104 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87 × 104–4.71 × 104) (10.13%) and 3.00 × 104 (95% CI: 1.66 × 104–4.39 × 104) (72.49%), respectively, in 2018. In contrast, O3-attributable deaths, increased by 1.98 × 104 (95% CI: 0.31 × 104–3.59 × 104) (130.57%) and 0.91 × 104 (95% CI: 0.50 × 104–1.33 × 104) (76.16%) for long- and short-term exposure, respectively. The number of avoidable deaths attributed to PM2.5 reduction is larger than the level of premature deaths related to increasing O3. Although annual mean PM2.5 concentrations have fallen rapidly, the benefits of reducing long-term exposure are limited, whereas the deaths associated with acute exposure decrease more significantly due to the reduction of heavy-pollution days by implementing emergency measures. The results show appreciable effectiveness in protecting human health and illustrate that synchronous control of PM2.5 and O3 pollution should be emphasized. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Health burden; O3; PM2.5","Health; Health risks; Air pollution prevention; Confidence interval; Emergency measures; Long term exposure; PM2.5 concentration; Positive/negative; Short-term exposure; Synchronous control; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; mortality; ozone; particulate matter; policy analysis; policy approach; pollution control; article; China; city; controlled study; health hazard; human; long term exposure; PM2.5 exposure; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental exposure; epidemiology; particulate matter; policy; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Particulate Matter; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098590076

The phenomenon is more prominent in two emerging economies, China and India, and they are facing the brain drain caused by air pollution. This paper establishes a partial equilibrium model about the relationship of air pollution and the flow of technological innovative professionals (TIP), and for the first time, examines the effect of air pollution on the accumulation of technological innovative human capital based on cross-country data from China and India. We find that air pollution will reduce the stock of TIP in some regions. The estimation results show that a 1% increase in the PM2.5 concentration of China's cities leads to an approximate 146 people decrease in the stock of TIP, while a 1% increase in the PM10 concentration of Indian states leads to a 0.127% decrease in the stock of TIP. Further analysis of regional differences indicates that air pollution has a significant negative effect on the stock of TIP in economically developed areas of China, but has little effect on that in underdeveloped areas of China. Moreover, the results of robustness tests prove the stability of the findings in this study. This paper concludes with suggestions on how the country, local governments, enterprises, and research institutions could better deal with air pollution, attract and retain TIP, and effectively reduce brain drain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Brain drain; China and India; Human capital accumulation; Technological innovative professionals","Air pollution; Personnel; Emerging economies; Estimation results; Partial equilibrium model; PM10 concentration; PM2.5 concentration; Regional differences; Research institutions; Robustness tests; Atmospheric movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094831850

Accurate quantification of Asia's CH4 budgets is critical for conducting global stocktake and achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. In this study, we present top-down estimates of CH4 emissions from 2009 to 2018 deduced from atmospheric observations from surface network and GOSAT satellite with the high-resolution global inverse model NIES-TM-FLEXPART-VAR. The optimized average CH4 budgets are 63.40 ± 10.52 Tg y-1 from East Asia (EA), 45.20 ± 6.22 Tg y-1 from Southeast Asia (SEA), and 64.35 ± 9.28 Tg y-1 from South Asia (SA) within the 10 years. We analyzed two 5 years CH4 emission budgets for three subregions and 13 top-emitting countries with an emission budget larger than 1 Tg y-1, and interannual variabilities for these subregions. Statistically significant increasing trends in emissions are found in EA with a lower emission growth rate during 2014-2018 compared to that during 2009-2013, while trends in SEA are not significant. In contrast to the prior emission, the posterior emission shows a significant decreasing trend in SA. The flux decrease is associated with the transition from strong La Ninña (2010-2011) to strong El Ninño (2015-2016) events, which modulate the surface air temperature and rainfall patterns. The interannual variability in CH4 flux anomalies was larger in SA compared to EA and SEA. The Southern Oscillation Index correlates strongly with interannual CH4 flux anomalies for SA. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability in the total CH4 flux is dominated by climate variability in SA. The contribution of climate variability driving interannual variability in natural and anthropogenic CH4 emissions should be further quantified, especially for tropical countries. Accounting for climate variability may be necessary to improve anthropogenic emission inventories. © 2021 The Author(s).","GOSAT; High-resolution inverse model; Methane budgets; Monsoon asia; Southern oscillation index (SOI)","Atmospheric pressure; Budget control; Climatology; Forestry; Methane; Accurate quantifications; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric observations; Climate variability; Interannual variability; Southern oscillation index; Surface air temperatures; Surface observation; Growth rate; annual variation; climate variation; concentration (composition); El Nino-Southern Oscillation; GOSAT; international agreement; La Nina; methane; monsoon; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100802497

However, shortage of irrigation and drought induced by climate change adversely affect plant growth and turf quality. Cuticular wax covers plant aerial parts and plays important roles in decreasing plant water loss under drought-stressed conditions. Previous research proposed two candidate genes that were involved in wax very-long-chain alkane biosynthesis based on the transcriptome of Poa pratensis leaf. Here, one of the candidate genes, PpCER1-2 was further characterized. A subcellular localization study revealed that PpCER1-2 was localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. The expression of PpCER1-2 could be induced by drought and salt stresses. Overexpression of PpCER1-2 in Brachypodium distachyon increased the alkane amount, whereas decreased the amounts of primary alcohols and total wax. The relative abundance of C25 and C27 alkane and C26 aldehyde increased significantly, but the relative abundance of C29 and C31 alkane and C28 aldehyde decreased. Meanwhile, PpCER1-2 overexpression lines exhibited reduced cuticle permeability and enhanced drought tolerance. These results suggested that PpCER1-2 relatively promoted alkane biosynthesis by converting more very long chain fatty acids precursors into the decarbonylation pathway from the acyl-reduction pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that PpCER1-2 is involved in wax alkane biosynthesis in P. pratensis and plays important roles in improving plant drought tolerance. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cuticle permeability; Cuticular wax; Kentucky bluegrass; Very long chain fatty acids; Water deficit","alkane; plant protein; wax; drought; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiological stress; plant leaf; Poa; Alkanes; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Poa; Stress, Physiological; Waxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098846748

However, the sparse distribution of PM2.5 measuring stations limits its application to public utility and scientific research, which can be remedied by satellite observations. Therefore, we developed a Geo-intelligent long short-term network (Geoi-LSTM) to estimate hourly ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in 2017 in Wuhan Urban Agglomeration (WUA). We conducted contrast experiments to verify the effectiveness of our model and explored the optimal modeling strategy. It turned out that Geoi-LSTM with TOA reflectance, meteorological conditions, and NDVI as inputs performs best. The station-based cross-validation R2, root mean squared error and mean absolute error are 0.82, 15.44 μg/m3, 10.63 μg/m3, respectively. Based on model results, we revealed spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 in WUA. Generally speaking, during the day, PM2.5 concentration remained stable at a relatively high level in the morning and decreased continuously in the afternoon. While during the year, PM2.5 concentrations were highest in winter, lowest in summer, and in-between in spring and autumn. Combined with meteorological conditions, we further analyzed the whole process of a PM2.5 pollution event. Finally, we discussed the loss in removing clouds-covered pixels and compared our model with several popular models. Overall, our results can reflect hourly PM2.5 concentrations seamlessly and accurately with a spatial resolution of 5 km, which benefits PM2.5 exposure evaluations and policy regulations. © 2020 Elsevier LtdWe developed a Geoi-LSTM model to estimate seamless PM2.5 concentrations in WUA, summarize the PM2.5 pattern, and reveal the whole process of a pollution event there. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Geospatial autocorrelation; Himawari-8; LSTM; PM2.5 estimation; Pollution event; TOA reflectance","Mean square error; Pollution; Public utilities; Reflection; Time of arrival; Exposure evaluations; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological condition; Root mean squared errors; Satellite observations; Scientific researches; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Wuhan urban agglomerations; Long short-term memory; atmospheric pollution; autocorrelation; concentration (composition); ground-based measurement; model validation; NDVI; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; regulatory framework; satellite data; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; top of atmosphere; urban atmosphere; article; autocorrelation; autumn; cross validation; human; human experiment; long short term memory network; meteorology; PM2.5 exposure; speech; spring; summer; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; short term memory; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Memory, Short-Term; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098214807

Nonetheless, over 90% of the produced methane is oxidized via sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (S-AOM) in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) by consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Coastal systems account for the majority of total marine methane emissions and typically have lower sulfate concentrations, hence S-AOM is less significant. However, alternative electron acceptors such as metal oxides or nitrate could be used for AOM instead of sulfate. The availability of electron acceptors is determined by the redox zonation in the sediment, which may vary due to changes in oxygen availability and the type and rate of organic matter inputs. Additionally, eutrophication and climate change can affect the microbiome, biogeochemical zonation, and methane cycling in coastal sediments. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the processes and microorganisms involved in methane cycling in coastal sediments and the factors influencing methane emissions from these systems. In eutrophic coastal areas, organic matter inputs are a key driver of bottom water hypoxia. Global warming can reduce the solubility of oxygen in surface waters, enhancing water column stratification, increasing primary production, and favoring methanogenesis. ANME are notoriously slow growers and may not be able to effectively oxidize methane upon rapid sedimentation and shoaling of the SMTZ. In such settings, ANME-2d (Methanoperedenaceae) and ANME-2a may couple iron- and/or manganese reduction to AOM, while ANME-2d and NC10 bacteria (Methylomirabilota) could couple AOM to nitrate or nitrite reduction. Ultimately, methane may be oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs in the upper millimeters of the sediment or in the water column. The role of these processes in mitigating methane emissions from eutrophic coastal sediments, including the exact pathways and microorganisms involved, are still underexplored, and factors controlling these processes are unclear. Further studies are needed in order to understand the factors driving methane-cycling pathways and to identify the responsible microorganisms. Integration of the knowledge on microbial pathways and geochemical processes is expected to lead to more accurate predictions of methane emissions from coastal zones in the future. © Copyright © 2021 Wallenius, Dalcin Martins, Slomp and Jetten.","climate change; eutrophication; greenhouse gases; marine microbiology; methane oxidation; methanogenesis; sediment","metal oxide; organic matter; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic oxidation of methane; biogeochemical cycle; climate change; denitrification; Desulfobulbaceae; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; metagenomics; methane cycle; methanogenesis; Methanoperedenaceae; methanotrophic archaeon; Methylococcales; Methylomirabilota; Methylosinus; microbial community; microbial consortium; microbial degradation; mineralization; nonhuman; Review; seashore; sedimentation; sulfate reducing bacterium; Verrucomicrobia; water depth; water hypoxia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102125676

Wetland plants can influence which carbon compounds are available for microbial processing by exuding freshly fixed carbon from their roots. Exudation of carbon from plant roots can trigger microbial priming: the process of new carbon stimulating the microbial community into processing more soil carbon than they otherwise would have. This study utilized high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis to probe the composition of soil organic compounds from the rhizosphere of Carex aquatillis, a common wetland sedge, which is known to have stimulated microbial priming within peat soil. The goal was to identify what types of molecules were created or lost during microbial priming in the wetland rhizosphere and thus advance mechanistic understanding of the process. FT-ICR-MS analysis demonstrated that more microbial transformations of carbon occurred among water-soluble compounds than among hydrophobic compounds, but that some hydrophobic compounds were processed. Crucially for understanding microbial priming, the root exudates triggered increased processing of high molecular weight molecules regardless of nutrient content but processed low molecular weight compounds only if they contained nitrogen or sulfur, essential nutrients for plant growth. The importance of sulfur in determining molecular utilization is noteworthy because priming literature typically focuses on nitrogen-mining.

However, there is a need for incentives that motivate these restoration efforts and disincentives aimed at restricting activities that result in further land degradation. We provide insights and understanding of the incentives and disincentives measures applied within the forest restoration systems through a case study in the Shinyanga region of Tanzania. Incentives that have promoted forest landscape restoration in Shinyanga include; conservation benefits, education and information, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), well-defined property rights & increasing land prices and awards while disincentives include; penalties, quotas and permits. Intrinsic incentives that are derived from self-desire within an individual such as conservation benefits and education & information were more preferred within Shinyanga region compared to extrinsic incentives which relied more on external factors such as REDD+ and awards. Nonetheless, a combination of both incentives and disincentives has led to the success of restoration in Shinyanga; positive incentives worked better for privately owned lands while regulatory disincentives worked better for communally owned restoration lands. High levels of social equity and trust have enabled the functioning of these incentives while a robust governance structure at the local level has been instrumental in enforcing the disincentives. There is need for government and all stakeholders to maintain and enhance the gains from restoration, especially empowering communities further, for these incentives to work. © 2020 The Author(s)","Disincentives; Ecosystem services; Forest landscape restoration; Incentives; Local knowledge and institutions","emission control; environmental degradation; environmental restoration; global change; governance approach; government; incentive; land degradation; land management; land market; prioritization; property rights; article; awards and prizes; consensus; deforestation; education; forest; government; human; human experiment; landscape; New York; punishment; Tanzania; trust; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; motivation; Tanzania; Shinyanga; Tanzania; Trachinotus falcatus; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Motivation; New York; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097882088

Methods: Five plant species (Oryza sativa, Zizania latifolia, Phragmites australis, Sesbania cannabina, and Bidens tripartita) were separately cultivated under the flooded soil conditions. The direct CH4 scavenging potential of B. tripartita roots was also measured in conjunction with in vitro CH4 scavenging experiments using H2O2 and several transition metal ions. Results: CH4 emissions from the soil-cultivated plants did not depend on the maximum CH4 emission potential for each plant species but on the soil CH4 concentrations, which were positively correlated with the CH4 production potential of the soil and negatively correlated with soil Eh values. Bidens tripartita roots possessed the highest increasing soil Eh potential and a direct, immediate, and continuous CH4 scavenging potential via the Fenton reaction using a considerably high concentration of root apoplastic H2O2 and rhizosphere Fe2+. Conclusions: Bidens tripartita presented the highest soil Eh ascending potential. The in vitro experiments suggested the involvement of・OH/FeIVO2+ via the newly termed rhizosphere Fenton reaction as a strong destructive power for CH4. To our knowledge, this is the first report on direct CH4 scavenging by high H2O2-exuding plant roots. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bidens tripartita; Fenton reaction; Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); Methane (CH4)","carbon emission; flooded soil; herb; hydrogen peroxide; methane; plant community; rhizosphere; root system; scavenging (feeding); soil-vegetation interaction; Bidens tripartita; Oryza sativa; Phragmites australis; Sesbania cannabina; Zizania latifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096131508

However, no studies have accurately estimated the impact of a reduction in animal food consumption on mortality due to the direct effects on metabolic health (i.e. animal protein and saturated fat intake as modulators of pathways leading to cardiovascular disease, cancer and accelerated ageing), and indirect effects on health due to excessive exposure to pollutants (i.e. PM10 concentrations originated by livestock ammonia emissions). The proposed modelling approach is innovative since it integrates social acceptability, environmental and health impacts. It is adopted to investigate different scenarios at a regional scale presenting the Lombardy region case study. The work focuses on the impact on the human and environmental health of diets characterized by three different animal protein intake levels. Our integrated assessment modelling approach faces the issue from two points of view. On one side, it estimates the mortality due to the population exposure to PM10 concentrations including the inorganic fraction originated by livestock ammonia emissions, on the other, it evaluates the mortality (i.e. total, cardiovascular and cancer) due to high dietary animal protein and/or saturated fat intake. The impacts of the mentioned animal protein intake levels of diets are also estimated through the people willingness to change their eating behaviour. The importance of putting in place end-of-pipe and energy measures in order to reduce ammonia and methane emissions from the breeding activities, going further the current EU legislation on air quality and climate, is emphasized. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality; Climate; Discrete choice modelling; Health impact; Integrated assessment modelling; Metabolic impact","Air pollution control; Air quality; Ammonia; Diseases; Food supply; Forestry; Proteins; Saturated fatty acids; Accelerated ageing; Breeding activities; Cardio-vascular disease; Environmental health; Inorganic fractions; Integrated assessment modelling; Population exposure; Social acceptability; Animals; ammonia; animal protein; methane; saturated fatty acid; air quality; climate; diet; discrete choice analysis; environmental impact; health impact; metabolism; mortality; numerical model; public attitude; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cardiovascular mortality; cohort analysis; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; fat intake; feeding behavior; female; health impact assessment; human; livestock; male; mortality; particulate matter 10; PM10 exposure; population exposure; priority journal; protein intake; social acceptance; air pollutant; air pollution; diet; pollutant; theoretical model; Italy; Lombardy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Diet; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097524822

In particular, changes to local and global climate parameters influence vector and water-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and tick-borne encephalitis. The Republic of Sakha in northern Russia is no exception. Long-term trends of increasing annual temperatures and thawing permafrost have corresponded with the northward range expansion of tick-species in the Republic. Indigenous communities living in these remote areas may be severely affected by human and livestock diseases introduced by disease vectors like ticks. To better understand the risk of vector-borne diseases in Sakha, we aimed to describe the increase and spatial spread of tick-bite cases in the Republic. Between 2000 and 2018, the frequency of tick bite cases increased 40-fold. At the start of the period, only isolated cases were reported in southern districts, but by 2018, tick bites had been reported in 21 districts in the Republic. This trend coincides with a noticeable increase in the average annual temperature in the region since the 2000s by an average of 1 °C. Maps illustrate the northward spread of tick-bite cases. A negative binomial regression model was used to correlate the increase in cases with a number of climate parameters. Tick bite case frequency per district was significantly explained by average annual temperature, average temperature in the coldest month of the year, the observation year, as well as Selyaninov’s hydrothermal coefficient. These findings contribute to the growing literature that describe the relationship between tick abundance and spread in Northern Latitudes and changes in temperatures and moisture. Future studies might use these and similar results to map and identify areas at risk of infestation by ticks, as climates continue to change in Sakha. © 2021 by the authors.

This information ranges from climate scenarios, geographical site information, socio-economic data and several possible adaptation measures. Thus, there is an urgent need to have a framework that is capable of organizing adaptation strategies and measures in the agriculture and forestry sectors in Mediterranean climatic regions. Additionally, this framework should provide a cause effect relation with climate vulnerability to adequately support the development of adaptation planning at municipal and local (farm) level. In this context, we propose to test and evaluate a framework for climate adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sectors, based on the local causal-effect relation between adaptation strategies and measures and the level of vulnerability reduction achieved for Mediterranean areas. The framework was developed based on the combination of the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) and Vulnerability frameworks and reviewed 162 practical adaptation measures, further organized into strategies, complemented by a set of efficacy indicators. The framework was tested with 70 stakeholders in six stakeholder workshops for the planning of two farms and one municipal climate adaptation study, that are now in actual implementation and monitoring. The framework is composed by a set of eight adaptation strategies in which adaptation measures are clustered and assessed using efficacy indicators. In the evaluation of the adaptation framework, 96% of stakeholders considered its content as good or very good and 89% considered the final outcomes as good or very good. Finally, the framework was also used to assess and compare the adaptation strategies and measures presented in the climate adaptation plans of the three case studies. On average, 52.2% of the adaptation measures selected by the three case studies are dedicated to Ecosystem Resilience, 30.9% to Adaptive Capacity, 9.1% to Microclimates, 7.4% to Protection, and 0.3% to Mitigation strategies. This framework was considered effective in supporting adaptation planning at farm and municipal levels and useful to assess and compare adaptation plans in the frame of vulnerability reduction. Future studies can further contribute to support adaptation planning in these sectors by using, developing and streamlining this framework to additional and different socio-ecological contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we use a chemistry transport model to assess the impact on ambient air quality of the measures considered for 2030 in the for the scenarios with existing (WEM2030) and additional measures (WAM2030). The study estimates a general improvement of air quality for the WAM2030 scenario, with no non-compliant air quality zones for NO2, SO2, and PM indicators. Despite an improvement for O3, the model still estimates non-compliant areas. For this pollutant, the WAM2030 scenario leads to different impacts depending on the indicator considered. Although the model estimates a reduction in maximum hourly O3 concentrations, small increases in O3 concentrations in winter and nighttime in the summer lead to increases in the annual mean in some areas and increases in other indicators (SOMO35 for health impacts and AOT40 for impacts on vegetation) in some urban areas. The results suggest that the lower NOx emissions in the WEM and WAM scenarios lead to less removal of O3 by NO titration, especially background ozone in winter and both background and locally produced ozone in summer, in areas with high NOx emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

Viticulture is generally conducted in areas that are prone to seasonal water deficit, and irrigation is the common way to counter this. In addition, soil conservation measures, such as cover cropping and no-tillage, are increasingly used. However, the effect of these management practices, in particular in viticulture, on soil bacterial communities remains unclear. Therefore, the objective was to examine the effect of irrigation and tillage on shaping soil bacterial communities associated with different grapevine cultivars, at different plant phenological stages. We conducted an experiment whereby we examined the soil bacterial community of three Vitis vinifera L. (grapevine) cultivars (two indigenous and one international, grown at different locations in the same vineyard) under different management practices (irrigated and non-irrigated, tillage and no-tillage). Since there is evidence that plant phenology can also affect soil microbial communities, we sampled soil at three different plant developmental stages (flowering, veraison and harvest). Soil bacterial communities primarily correlated with cultivar and location. At harvest we observed a link between bacterial communities and grape quality and yield measures and at all stages with soil physicochemical properties. A number of taxa were enriched in one or two cultivars, but these were generally in low abundance in our dataset. We also found an effect of plant phenology and management practices within each cultivar. For the two indigenous cultivars, soil bacterial communities at the flowering stage were most distinct, while for the international cultivar it was at the veraison stage. However, for all three cultivars, this effect differed by tillage treatment: bacterial communities in the tillage treatment varied by plant phenology, but in the no-tillage treatment less difference was observed, suggesting a buffering effect. While irrigation did lead to changes in bacterial communities, the effect was not as strong as that of the other factors. Our results show that soil bacterial communities in grapevines are shaped by both plant-associated effects (i.e. cultivar and plant phenological stage) and environmental variables (i.e. soil management and soil physicochemical properties), and importantly, that these factors have an interactive effect. Future research on soil bacterial communities in grapevines should take this variability into account, as well as focusing on its functional implications. © 2020 The Authors","Bacterial turnover; Cultivar; Irrigation; Microbial community; Tillage; Viticulture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094844728

Among remediation strategies, biostimulation significantly improves the efficiency of hydrocarbons (HCs) removal. A 1-year-long field trial was performed in mesocosms filled with soil chronically contaminated with HCs. Three nutrient sources were evaluated as biostimulation agents: inorganic salts (with and without aeration by mixing), a slow-release granular fertilizer (Nitrofoska®) and a commercial bioremediation product (OSEII®). Their performance was assessed considering the number of culturable bacteria, the changes induced in the structure of bacterial communities, the HCs removal efficiencies and the estimation of the abiotic and biodegradative losses of HCs. The soil indigenous microbiota reduced the concentration of hydrocarbons by up to 50% in 50 days and 87% in 365 days depending on the biostimulation agent used. OSEII® (a mixture of surfactants, nutrients, and enzymes) performed better in the medium term, promoting bacterial growth and rapidly inducing changes in the structure of bacterial community, and Nitrofoska® proved to be more efficient for long-term processes, less affecting the size and structure of the microbiota. A mixed strategy combining the fastest action of commercial products acting during summer with slow-release fertilizers acting throughout the year is proposed as a long-term bioremediation treatment for Antarctic areas where the temperature rises above the freezing point and the ground is free of snow shortly during summer. This study highlights the importance of conducting research to develop remediation processes compatible with the Antarctic Treaty, exploiting the metabolic potential of the indigenous microbiota. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Antarctica; Bacterial communities; Bioremediation; DGGE; Hydrocarbons; Pollution","bioremediation; biostimulation; community structure; concentration (composition); contaminated land; growth; hydrocarbon; microbial activity; microbial community; pollutant removal; pollutant source; Antarctica; Bacteria (microorganisms); Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100346025

These mountain regions experience rapid changes, which influence social-ecological systems in the lower-mountain and floodplain regions of Europe. There is scattered evidence across different strands of academic literature on the ways in which the impacts of changing climate in mountain regions are addressed and adaptive capacity is enhanced. Using a systematic mapping review, we mapped English-language scientific journal articles that analyzed the climate change adaptation options that are planned or implemented in European mountain regions. Our understanding of how academic literature has investigated climate change adaptation is critical to identifying key knowledge gaps and research foci. Following the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research protocol, 72 scientific articles published between January 2011 and August 2019 were identified from a total of 702 scientific articles. Our findings show that existing academic literature has a strong focus on the western and southern European mountains: the European Alps (n = 24), Pyrenees (n = 11), and Sierra Nevada (n = 4). Key climate impacts reported for the biophysical systems include reduction in forest carbon, soil erosion, changes in vegetation patterns, and changes in plant population and tree heights; in human systems, these include water availability, agricultural production, changes in viticulture, and impacts on tourism. Key adaptation options reported in this article are wetland conservation options, changing cropping and cultivation cycles, tree species management strategies, and snow-making technology. We found very few articles analyzing governance responses to planning and implementing adaptation; these had a strong bias toward techno-managerial responses. We conclude that, while climate impacts are substantial in European mountain regions, there are knowledge gaps in academic literature that need to be addressed. © 2021 International Mountain Society.

This is perhaps because humankind has always travelled beyond frontiers to explore faraway places, and also because technology enables the application of science and skills, and the extraction or collection of resources from new regions. Some technologies can change the current view and future expectations of our societies, and the way that people interact within their immediate environment. Remote communities offer the opportunity to research the next step in the evolution of technologies. Through the study of narratives, this paper investigates the remote, informal, and ephemeral communities of practices (RIE-CoP) that undertake the brief use of some technologies. The use of additive manufacturing technologies for improvised repairs, rapid tooling, the study of potential efficiency energetic measures, and previous tests in the Spanish Antarctic Base provide short-term benefits such as reducing emissions and logistics costs, and making life more sustainable on the frozen continent. Furthermore, these technology tests offer action-based research about the management and future of RIE-CoP under extreme conditions across four Antarctic missions (from December 2015 to March 2019). The experiences provide narrative foresight for the future RIE-CoP, and the results are valuable in sectors such as military and humanitarian assistance, construction, and space missions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Community of practices; Efficiency energetic; Future narratives; Testing technologies","action research; future prospect; manufacturing; technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098210102

Composite fuels based on a combination of widespread industrial and municipal waste were considered. The scientific and practical novelty of this study comes from the fact that for the first time, a group of integral parameters was researched. They describe the ignition and combustion of mixtures in different forms: pressed dry fuel (pellets), a wet slurry, and granules of different moisture content. The most efficient method in terms of increasing the rate and reducing the temperature threshold of the oxidation reaction is firing a low-moisture mixture based on municipal solid waste (with a predominance of wood components). Pelleted coal sludge combustion was characterized by a rather long delay in heterogeneous ignition and underburning. It was shown that in order to reduce emissions and increase the degree of burnout, coal processing waste should be burned as wet granules or slurry droplets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion; Emissions; Pellet; Slurry; Thermal power station; Waste","Fuels; Granulation; Ignition; Mixtures; Moisture; Municipal solid waste; Pelletizing; Waste incineration; Coal processing; Different moisture contents; Emission behavior; Industrial and municipal waste; Integral parameters; Oxidation reactions; Temperature thresholds; Waste derived fuels; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090211712

Frequently burning savannas, mostly in Africa, Australia, and South America are responsible for over 60 % of total BB carbon emissions. Compared to many other sources of emissions, fires have a strong seasonality. Previous research has identified the mitigation potential of prescribed fires in savanna ecosystems; by burning cured fuels early in the dry season when landscape conditions still provide moist buffers against fire spread, fires are in general smaller, patchier, and less intense. While it is widely accepted that burned area (BA) and the total carbon consumed are lower when fires are ignited early in the dry season, little is known about the intraseasonal variability of emission factors (EFs). This is important because potentially, higher EFs in the early dry season (EDS) could offset some of the carbon benefits of EDS burning. Also, a better understanding of EF intraseasonal variability may improve large-scale BB assessments, which to date rely on temporally static EFs. We used a sampling system mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to sample BB smoke in the Estac ao Ecologica Serra Geral do Tocantins in the Brazilian states of Tocantins and Bahia. The protected area contains all major Cerrado vegetation types found in Brazil, and EDS burning has been implemented since 2014. Over 800 smoke samples were collected and analysed during the EDS of 2018 and late dry season (LDS) of 2017 and 2018. The samples were analysed using cavity ring-down spectroscopy, and the carbon balance method was used to estimate CO span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 , CO, CH span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 4 , and N span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 O EFs. Observed EF averages and standard deviations were 1651 ( span classCombining double low lineinline-formula ±50 ) g kg span classCombining double low lineinline-formula -1 for CO span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 , 57.9 ( span classCombining double low lineinline-formula ±28.2 ) g kg span classCombining double low lineinline-formula -1 for CO, 0.97 ( span classCombining double low lineinline-formula ±0.82 ) g kg span classCombining double low lineinline-formula -1 for CH span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 4 , and 0.096 ( span classCombining double low lineinline-formula ±0.174 ) g kg span classCombining double low lineinline-formula -1 for N span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 O. Averaged over all measured fire prone Cerrado types, the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) was slightly higher in the LDS (0.961 versus 0.956), and the CO and CH span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 4 were 10 % and 2.3 % lower in the LDS compared to the EDS. However, these differences were not statistically significant using a two-tailed span classCombining double low lineinline-formula i t /i test with unequal variance at a 90 % significance level. The seasonal effect was larger in more wood-dominated vegetation types. N span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 O EFs showed a more complex seasonal dependency, with opposite intraseasonal trends for savannas that were dominated by grasses versus those with abundant shrubs. We found that the N span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 O EF for the open Cerrado was less than half the EF suggested by literature compilations for savannas. This may indicate a substantial overestimation of the contribution of fires in the N span classCombining double low lineinline-formula 2 O budget. Overall, our data imply that in this region, seasonal variability in greenhouse gas emission factors may offset only a small fraction of the carbon mitigation gains in fire abatement programmes. /p . © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Survey respondents (277) ranged from 18 to 25 years of age, with an average age of 20.7 years. The survey responses provided an opportunity to assess the relationship between pro-environmental behavior and specific awareness and knowledge of characteristics related to the environment. The survey outcomes also provided insight into the relationship between recycling action and climate change perceptions, which is the focus of this article. Survey respondents generally had a strong inclination toward recycling but lacked an understanding of the efficiency of recycling. Given the respondents' sensitivity toward climate change relative to their recycling bias, the results highlight a potential opportunity to promote lasting behavioral change through an educational marketing plan and related convenient access to climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","climate change; marketing; pro-environmental behavior; recycling","climate change; economic system; marketing; mitigation; perception; questionnaire survey; recycling; sustainability; Boston; Massachusetts; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108794188

This study aims to improve understanding of the effects of car sharing on transport-related emissions at an individual and city level. This is done by quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the travel habits of individuals before and after engaging with car sharing. The analysis uses a well-to-wheel (WTW) approach, including both business-to-consumer (B2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) car-sharing fleets. Changes in GHG emissions after engaging in car sharing vary among individuals. Transport-related GHG emissions caused by car-free individuals tend to increase after they engage in car sharing, while emissions caused by previous car owners tend to fall. At the city level, GHG emissions savings can be achieved by using more efficient cars in sharing systems and by implementing greener mobility policies. Changes in travel habits might help to reduce GHG emissions, providing individuals migrate to low-carbon transport modes. The findings can be used to support the development and implementation of transport policies that deter car ownership and support shared mobility solutions that are integrated in city transport systems. © 2021 by the authors.

In the Netherlands, the most stringent lockdown measures were in effect from March to May 2020. These measures coincided with a period of unusual meteorological conditions with wind from the north-east and clear-sky conditions, which complicates the quantification of the effect of the lockdown measures on the air quality. Here we quantify the lockdown effects on the concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx and NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in the Netherlands, by analyzing observations and simulations with the atmospheric chemistry-transport model EMEP/MSC-W in its EMEP4NL configuration, after eliminating the effects of meteorological conditions during the lockdown. Based on statistical analyses with a Random Forest method, we estimate that the lockdown reduced observed NO2 concentrations by 30% (95% confidence interval 25–35%), 26% (21–32%), and 18% (10–25%) for traffic, urban, and rural background locations, respectively. Slightly smaller reductions of 8–28% are found with the EMEP4NL simulations for urban and regional background locations based on estimates in reductions in economic activity and emissions of traffic and industry in the Netherlands and other European countries. Reductions in observed PM2.5 concentrations of about 20% (10–25%) are found for all locations, which is somewhat larger than the estimates of 5–16% based on the model simulations. A comparison of the calculated NO2 traffic contributions with observations shows a substantial drop of about 35% in traffic contributions during the lockdown period, which is similar to the estimated reductions in mobility data as reported by Apple and Google. Since the largest health effects related to air pollution in the Netherlands are associated with exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, the lockdown measures in spring of 2020 have temporarily improved the air quality in the Netherlands.

Highest PHT levels were obtained at sites characterized by high levels of urban and traffic activity. The PHT profile was mainly dominated by bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), whose median air concentration across the examined sites was MDEHP = 1200 pg/m3. It was discovered that PHT levels had a strong correlation with the ambient temperature. Warmer months appeared to contribute to greater emission of PHTs at most sites. Clausius Clapeyron (CC) plots were used to investigate the presence of temperature dependent processes governing PHT emissions, such as secondary volatilization from environmental surfaces. Enthalpies of surface-air exchange calculated from CC plots were compared to respective enthalpies of vaporization for each PHT. Those values were used to examine importance of localized water-air and land-air exchanges on atmospheric levels of PHTs. The data suggested that secondary volatilizations are relevant PHT contributors and appear to depend on sampling site and PHT type. Enthalpies associated with Henry's law constant were also evaluated, providing evidence of secondary volatilization from water bodies. This work is part of an on-going study which already evaluated levels of organophosphate esters (OPEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) at the same sites. Ultimately, the variability in ambient concentrations of PHTs in the GTA are believed to be due to a combination of both primary and secondary sources. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Canada; Outdoor air; Passive sampling; Phthalates; Secondary emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096405821

The predominant mechanisms of removal of contaminants in CWs are microbial degradation, phytodegradation, phytoextraction, filtration, sedimentation, and adsorption, etc. Vertical flow subsurface CWs and hybrid CWs demonstrated promising results in terms of TN, BOD, and COD removal, while horizontal flow subsurface CWs were proficient in removal of TP. The performance of the CWs depends upon a various factors, such as hydraulic loading rate, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, etc. Among these, low temperature had the most antagonistic effect on the performance of the CWs because freezing ambient temperature lead to ice formation, hydraulic imperfections, malfunctioning of biotic and abiotic components, etc. Over the past three decades, thousands of studies have been conducted involving treatment of wastewater using CWs, among which only few have addressed the issues and concerns of cold climate representing a significant research gap in this field. Furthermore, the performance of CWs in terms of TN, TP, and COD removal was significantly lower in cold climates than that in tropical and sub-tropical climates. In order to find suitable remedies to overcome the challenges faced in cold climate various modifications, such as incorporating greenhouse structure, providing insulating materials, bio-augmentation, identification of suitable macrophytes, etc., in around 20 different scenarios have been studied. Greenhouse construction led to 20% increase in removal of TN and COD, while plant collocation accounted for up to 18% increase in the removal of COD.

While the fungal partner is dependent on the plant host for its carbon (C) needs, the amount of nutrients that the fungus allocates to hosts can vary with context. Because fungal allocation patterns to hosts can change over time, they have historically been difficult to quantify accurately. We developed a technique to tag rock phosphorus (P) apatite with fluorescent quantum-dot (QD) nanoparticles of three different colors, allowing us to study nutrient transfer in an in vitro fungal network formed between two host roots of different ages and different P demands over a 3-week period. Using confocal microscopy and raster image correlation spectroscopy, we could distinguish between P transfer from the hyphae to the roots and P retention in the hyphae. By tracking QD-apatite from its point of origin, we found that the P demands of the younger root influenced both: (1) how the fungus distributed nutrients among different root hosts and (2) the storage patterns in the fungus itself. Our work highlights that fungal trade strategies are highly dynamic over time to local conditions, and stresses the need for precise measurements of symbiotic nutrient transfer across both space and time. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"accuracy assessment; apatite; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biomass allocation; correlation; fungus; phosphorus; quantitative analysis; temporal analysis; tracking; apatite; phosphorus; mycorrhiza; plant root; symbiosis; Apatites; Mycorrhizae; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plant Roots; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091614022

The purpose of this work is to propose an innovative solution to enhance the plant flexibility, integrating a combined heat and power CCGT with a flue gas condensing heat pump. The paper firstly evaluates the thermodynamic performances of two possible plant layouts coupled with a District Heating Network, illustrating the respective advantages and disadvantages under different operating conditions. Then, in order to assess the viability of the investment the best solution is selected and a thermoeconomic analysis is performed using as benchmark the same CCGT integrated with a natural gas fed Heat Only Boiler in, a cheaper state of art solution but with a higher carbon footprint. Different energy market scenarios are assessed, considering the effect of different parameters on the integrated CCGT's final profitability. On the environmental side, the heat pump allows reaching an higher global efficiency (average annual efficiency increase up to 5 percentage points), and reducing the annual CO2 emission (−13.9% in the best case). On the economic side, the higher heat pump capital expenditure, with respect to the heat only boiler limits the field of viability of the investment to high gas to electricity price ratios.

In order to reduce the emissions of harmful greenhouse gasses, the search is on for alternative fuels for the maritime shipping industry. In this work the usefulness of hydrogen and hydrogen carriers is being investigated as a fuel for sea going ships. Due to the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen under standard conditions, the need for efficient storage of this fuel is high. Key processes in the use of hydrogen are discussed, starting with the production of hydrogen from fossil and renewable sources. The focus of this review is different storage methods, and in this work we discuss the storage of hydrogen at high pressure, in liquefied form at cryogenic temperatures and bound to liquid or solid-state carriers. In this work a theoretical introduction to different hydrogen storage methods precedes an analysis of the energy-efficiency and practical storage density of the carriers. In the final section the major challenges and hurdles for the development of hydrogen storage for the maritime industry are discussed. The most likely challenges will be the development of a new bunkering infrastructure and suitable monitoring of the safety to ensure safe operation of these hydrogen carriers on board the ship. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alternative fuels; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Ships; Cryogenic temperatures; Hydrogen carriers; Hydrogen storage methods; Production of hydrogen; Standard conditions; Storage densities; Storage of hydrogen; Volumetric energy densities; Hydrogen storage; emission control; energy efficiency; energy storage; fossil fuel; high pressure; hydrogen; renewable resource; safety; ship design; shipping",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101902982

In tropical regions there is a wide variety of forage species that have the capacity to improve cattle diets and reduce enteric CH4 emissions. A screening trial was conducted to investigate the nutrient and phytochemical composition, total gas and CH4 production of fifteen tropical multipurpose forage species from Southern Mexico. The content of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and gross energy fluctuated among species, from 99.07 to 264.4, from 275.19 to 614.35 g kg−1 dry matter (DM) and from 15.65 to 20.92 MJ kg−1 DM. In vitro digestibility of DM (IVDDM) was lower for the species containing condensed tannins (CT) and fluctuated between 447.44 and 709.94 g kg−1 DM. Bursera simaruba showed the lowest CH4 production (9.077 mg g−1 degraded organic matter) with a CT content of 200 g kg−1 DM. Results suggest that several plant species widely available in Southern Mexico present high potential for mitigating enteric CH4 production and have a high nutritional quality. These species are suitable as additive or supplementary feed to improve diet quality and reduce CH4 emissions in cattle raised under grazing conditions in the tropical regions of the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Cattle; Lacandon rainforests; Livestock agroforestry; Multipurpose forages; Tropics","additive; detergent; digestibility; dry matter; fermentation; forage; grazing; livestock; methane; mitigation; phytochemistry; reaction kinetics; Mexico [North America]; Bursera simaruba; Ruminantia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098693196

Fundamental understanding of the major processes driving climate change is the key problem which is to be solved not only on a global but also on a regional scale. The accuracy of regional climate modelling depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is the adequate and comprehensive information on the anthropogenic impact which is highest in industrial regions and areas with dense population - modern megacities. Megacities are not only heat islands, but also significant sources of emissions of various substances into the atmosphere, including greenhouse and reactive gases. In 2019, the mobile experiment EMME (Emission Monitoring Mobile Experiment) was conducted within the St. Petersburg agglomeration (Russia) aiming to estimate the emission intensity of greenhouse (CO2, CH4) and reactive (CO, NOx) gases for St. Petersburg, which is the largest northern megacity. St. Petersburg State University (Russia), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany) and the University of Bremen (Germany) jointly ran this experiment. The core instruments of the campaign were two portable Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers which were used for ground-based remote sensing measurements of the total column amount of CO2, CH4 and CO at upwind and downwind locations on opposite sides of the city. The NO2 tropospheric column amount was observed along a circular highway around the city by continuous mobile measurements of scattered solar visible radiation with an OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. Simultaneously, air samples were collected in air bags for subsequent laboratory analysis. The air samples were taken at the locations of FTIR observations at the ground level and also at altitudes of about 100m when air bags were lifted by a kite (in case of suitable landscape and favourable wind conditions). The entire campaign consisted of 11 mostly cloudless days of measurements in March-April 2019. Planning of measurements for each day included the determination of optimal location for FTIR spectrometers based on weather forecasts, combined with the numerical modelling of the pollution transport in the megacity area. The real-time corrections of the FTIR operation sites were performed depending on the actual evolution of the megacity NOx plume as detected by the mobile DOAS observations. The estimates of the St. Petersburg emission intensities for the considered greenhouse and reactive gases were obtained by coupling a box model and the results of the EMME observational campaign using the mass balance approach. The CO2 emission flux for St. Petersburg as an area source was estimated to be 8928 ktkm2 yr1, which is 2 times higher than the corresponding value in the EDGAR database. The experiment revealed the CH4 emission flux of 13568 tkm2 yr1, which is about 1 order of magnitude greater than the value reported by the official inventories of St. Petersburg emissions (25 tkm2 yr1 for 2017). At the same time, for the urban territory of St. Petersburg, both the EMME experiment and the official inventories for 2017 give similar results for the CO anthropogenic flux (251104 tkm2 yr1 vs. 410 tkm2 yr1) and for the NOx anthropogenic flux (6628 tkm2 yr1 vs. 69 tkm2 yr1). © Author(s) 2021.

To utilize electric fields for a reverse water gas shift reaction, it is critical to elucidate the role of an electric field on a catalyst surface toward activating a CO2 molecule. We conduct a first-principles study to gain an atomic and elec-tronic description of adsorbed CO2 on YSZ (111) surfaces when external electric fields of +1 V/Å, 0 V/Å, and −1 V/Å are applied. We find that the application of an external electric field generally destabilizes oxide bonds, where the direction of the field affects the location of the most favorable oxygen vacancy. The direction of the field also drastically impacts how CO2 adsorbs on the surface. CO2 is bound by physisorption when a +1 V/Å field is applied, a similar interaction as to how it is adsorbed in the absence of a field. This interaction changes to chemisorption when the surface is exposed to a −1 V/Å field value, resulting in the formation of a CO3− complex. The strong interaction is reflected through a direct charge transfer and an orbital splitting within the Olattice p-states. While CO2 remains physisorbed when a +1 V/Å field value is applied, our total density of states analysis indicates that a positive field pulls the charge away from the adsorbate, resulting in a shift of its bonding and antibonding peaks to higher energies, allowing a stronger interaction with YSZ (111). Ultimately, the effect of an electric field toward CO2 adsorption is not negligible, and there is potential in utilizing electric fields to favor the thermodynamics of CO2 reduction on heterogeneous cat-alysts. © 2021 by the authors.

However, different climate modeling approaches can result in different future precipitation projections. The corresponding ''method uncertainty'' is rarely explicitly calculated in climate impact studies and major reports but can substantially change estimated precipitation changes. A comparison across five commonly used modeling activities shows that, for changes in mean precipitation, less than half of the regions analyzed had significant changes between the present climate and 1.58C global warming for the majority of modeling activities. This increases to just over half of the regions for changes between present climate and 28C global warming. There is much higher confidence in changes in maximum 1-day precipitation than in mean precipitation, indicating the robust influence of thermodynamics in the climate change effect on extremes. We also find that none of the modeling activities captures the full range of estimates from the other methods in all regions. Our results serve as an uncertainty map to help interpret which regions require a multimethod approach. Our analysis highlights the risk of overreliance on any single modeling activity and the need for confidence statements in major synthesis reports to reflect this method uncertainty. Considering multiple sources of climate projections should reduce the risks of policymakers being unprepared for impacts of warmer climates relative to using single-method projections to make decisions. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

It can reduce the local waste through recycling which will conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and build economic resilience in the face of an uncertain future for energy production and waste disposal. The productive use of local waste through recycling conserves resources by reducing landfill space, the whole of life impacts of landfilling, and post-closure maintenance of landfills. Turning waste into a renewable energy source will assist the decarbonisation of the economy by reducing harmful emissions and pollutants. Therefore, this mini-review aims to summarise key factors and present valuable evidence for an efficient AD process. It also presents the pros and cons of different AD process to convert organic waste along with the reactor technologies. Besides, this paper highlights the challenges and the future perspective of the AD process. However, it is highlighted that for an effective and efficient AD process, appropriate temperature, pH, a strong inoculum to substrate ratio, good mixing and small particle sizes are important factors. The selection of suitable AD process and reactor is important because not all types of processes and reactors are not effective for processing organic waste. This study is of great importance for ongoing work on renewable energy generation from waste and provides important knowledge of innovative waste processing. Finally, it is recommended that the government should increase their support towards the AD technology and consider the unutilized significant potential of gaseous biofuel production. © Copyright © 2021 Uddin, Siddiki, Mofijur, Djavanroodi, Hazrat, Show, Ahmed and Chu.","anaerobic digestion; biogas; biomethane potential; organic waste; reactor technologies; waste to energy","Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Petroleum prospecting; Recycling; Renewable energy resources; Wastes; Anaerobic digestion technology; Bioenergy productions; Conserve resources; Future perspectives; Inoculum to substrate ratios; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Small particle size; Anaerobic digestion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102465505

With the increasing demand for bioenergy and bio-products, biorefineries are essential industrial platforms that provide needed demand while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A biorefinery consists of various conversion technologies where particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted. The released PM and VOCs pose detrimental health and environmental risks for society. Moreover, the projected rise of global bioenergy demand may lead to an increase in PM and VOCs from biorefineries. With the use of cleaner technologies and approaches, PM and VOCs can be avoided in biorefineries. The study presents the landscape of the research field through a bibliometric review of emissions from a biorefinery. A comprehensive review of works on the reduction of PM and VOCs in a biorefinery is outlined. The study includes a perspective of cleaner technologies and approaches utilized in biorefineries to mitigate these hazardous materials. The results reveal that the employment of life cycle assessment, safety assessment, and green chemistry processes can significantly reduce PM and VOC emissions as well as the consumption of hazardous substances in the biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric analysis; Biorefinery and biofuel; Cleaner technologies; Hazardous materials; Life cycle assessment; Particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)","Bioconversion; Biomass; Bioproducts; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Particles (particulate matter); Refining; Volatile organic compounds; Cleaner technologies; Conversion technology; Environmental risks; Hazardous substances; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Particulate Matter; Safety assessments; State-of-the art reviews; Biohazards; biofuel; volatile organic compound; volatile organic compound; bioenergy; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; reduction; volatile organic compound; anaerobic digestion; Article; bibliometrics; bioenergy; boiler; carbon footprint; combustion; dangerous goods; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; gasification; green chemistry; greenhouse gas; health hazard; life cycle assessment; particulate matter; risk assessment; air pollutant; biomass; environmental monitoring; industry; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Particulate Matter; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091223877

The latter includes the expansion of private, civil and military activity and infrastructure and the erosion of land rights. We used Saami reindeer husbandry in Norway as a model in which to examine trends in, and to compare the influence of, both effects on a pastoral grazing system. Downscaled projections of mean annual temperature over the principal winter pasture area (Finnmarksvidda) closely matched empirical observations across 34 years to 2018. The area, therefore, is not only warming but seems likely to continue to do so. Warming notwithstanding, 50-year (1969–2018) records of local weather (temperature, precipitation and characteristics of the snowpack) demonstrate considerable annual and decadal variation which also seems likely to continue and alternately to amplify and to counter net warming. Warming, moreover, has both positive and negative effects on ecosystem services that influence reindeer. The effects of climate change on reindeer pastoralism are evidently neither temporally nor spatially uniform, nor indeed is the role of climate change as a driver of change in pastoralism even clear. The effects of human intervention on the system, by contrast, are clear and largely negative. Gradual liberalization of grazing rights from the 18th Century has been countered by extensive loss of reindeer pasture. Access to ~50% of traditional winter pasture was lost in the 19th Century owing to the closure of international borders to the passage of herders and their reindeer. Subsequent to this the area of undisturbed pasture within Norway has decreased by 71%. Loss of pasture due to piecemeal development of infrastructure and to administrative encroachment that erodes herders' freedom of action on the land that remains to them, are the principal threats to reindeer husbandry in Norway today. These tangible effects far exceed the putative effects of current climate change on the system. The situation confronting Saami reindeer pastoralism is not unique: loss of pasture and administrative, economic, legal and social constraints bedevil extensive pastoral grazing systems across the globe. © Copyright © 2021 Tyler, Hanssen-Bauer, Førland and Nellemann.","Arctic; climate change; encroachment; grazing rights; infrastructure; pastoralism; reindeer; Saami",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102243850

Mitigating climate change has become necessary because of the effects it has on social, economic and environmental outcomes. The minutest action taken against climate change can reduce its devastating impacts. Hence, this study assesses the strategies used by manufacturing companies in mitigating climate change. The study location is Ota, Nigeria. In this paper, a quantitative research approach was adopted with questionnaires distributed to participants at a climate change workshop, which is analysed using statistical techniques. The results show, among others, that all the respondents are aware of climate change and the most common source of climate change knowledge is the mass media. Moreover, most of the respondents describe climate change as a rise in global temperatures. Waste reduction, waste recycling, and waste reuse are the most common climate change mitigation strategies adopted by the manufacturing companies. Other mitigation strategies include: use of energy-saving bulbs in offices and factories and switching off electrical appliances when not in use. Although the findings indicate that the manufacturing companies are taking some steps to mitigate climate change, a lot still has to be done in reducing carbon emission levels, particularly during the manufacturing process. It is also essential that manufacturers use renewable energy sources as alternative power instead of diesel generators so that the volume of atmospheric carbon in the region can be reduced considerably. The role of government in driving emission reduction is also emphasised. The study provides baseline data that can be used in the development and implementation of policies on regional climate change mitigation strategies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","global warming; renewable energy; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable manufacturing","Carbon; Emission control; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Sustainable development; Atmospheric greenhouse; Climate change mitigation; Environmental outcome; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing process; Regional climate changes; Renewable energy source; Statistical techniques; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102391046

Parsons Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA  02139, United States","The severe wintertime precipitation decline projected by global climate models (GCMs) over the Southwestern Mediterranean makes this region a major climate change hotspot. Here, we evaluate the performance of the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM) in simulating seasonal and inter-annual regional climatic features over Northwestern Africa and the Iberian Peninsula (NWAIP), and develop and interpret regional climate change projections over the same region under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, at a resolution of 12 km, driven by three carefully selected GCMs. MRCM succeeds in correctly capturing the spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation when forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis data. In addition to substantial year-round warming, the MRCM ensemble projects a significant decline in precipitation during winter and spring under continued anthropogenic forcing. Even with significant climate change mitigation, the drying is relatively large, with an average of − 34% in precipitation over Morocco’s three main watersheds during spring, and − 22% during winter. Projections for the Iberian Peninsula are less severe, though drying trends are still robust. The consistency of the precipitation projections is discussed in the light of physical mechanisms acting at the regional scale. Being located downwind of a large desert, the region is particularly vulnerable to the changes in circulation projected by global models. The latter will advect dry air from the Sahara, which will suppress precipitation. The local topography also contributes to these trends. Overall, our results elucidate the physical processes responsible for winter and spring drying in the southwestern Mediterranean. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; image resolution; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial resolution; winter; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094852079

This study aims to develop an analytic model to assess the key criteria and sub-criteria influencing four cruise port's development in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, four criteria and 13 sub-criteria are developed and analysed by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Four cruise ports include Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taichung and Hualien ports. The 26 relevant field experts (including cruise operators, governmental officials and academics) were invited to provide information for assessing the sub-criteria in the model. Findings: The results indicate that port infrastructure and facilities are the most important criterion, followed by port-city development plans, port geography and climate and port regulations and services. In addition, the three most important sub-criteria overall are the onshore tourism programme, the city’s historical and cultural features and the green port hinterland transport system. Also, Keelung port is ranked as the best port, followed by Kaohsiung, Taichung and Hualien. Originality/value: As Asia is an important cruise market in the world (ranked as third) and passenger number in Taiwan has achieved the top two in Asia, denoting Taiwan is a good market to develop an evaluation model of cruise ports. The findings present a holistic picture of the relative importance of the various criteria associated with cruise port development and raise issues related to cruise port marketing and the economic and environmental sustainability of ports and their hinterlands. © 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.","Cruise competition; Cruise port development; Expert knowledge; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Tourism policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101041787

Despite these expected changes, assessing climate change effects on habitat and fish over large regions has proven challenging. The goal of this study is to describe an approach to assess and identify stream reaches within a large region that are susceptible to climate changes based on responses of multiple fish species to changes in thermal and hydrological habitats occurring with changes in climate. We present a six-step approach to connect climate, habitat, and fish responses, demonstrated through an example to assess effects of climate change on fishes for all stream reaches in a large U.S. ecoregion (955,029 km2). Step 1 identified measures of air temperature and precipitation expected to change substantially in the future. Step 2 identified the climatic measures strongly associated with stream thermal and hydrologic metrics calculated from measured data from a subset of streams. Step 3 linked thermal and hydrologic metrics identified in Step 2 with abundances of fish species from the same stream reaches, and these fishes were combined into groups based on similar associations with specific thermal or hydrologic metrics. Step 4 used the linkages between fish groups and climatic measures and their associated thermal and hydrologic metrics to classify stream reaches. Step 5 assigned all stream reaches into classes based on the established classification under current climate measures and then re-assigned all stream reaches using projected climatic measures for three future time windows. Step 6 assessed changes in classes of stream reaches between current and future climate conditions. Stream reaches projected to change in stream classes were considered “vulnerable” to future climate change, as they would no longer support the same fish composition. The projected vulnerable streams for the years 2040, 2060, and 2090 were mapped and summarized to identify temporal patterns and identify their spatial distribution, along with underlying mechanisms leading to changes. Our results showed that 45.7% of the 320,000 reaches and 49.3% of the overall 650,000 km stream length in the study region were expected to change stream class by the year 2090, with spatially-explicit changes including streams' responding to changing air temperature or precipitation. This study provides critical guidance for integrating climate projections, landscape factors, stream habitat data, and fish data into a meaningful approach for understanding linkage. Outcomes greatly improve our ability to describe habitat changes at a stream reach scale throughout large regions, and they can aid in prioritizing management strategies to adapt to climate change at local and regional scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biological responses; Climate change; Flow regime; Freshwater fish; Landscape ecology; Thermal regime","Air navigation; Atmospheric temperature; Data streams; Ecosystems; Fish; Changing climate; Climate projection; Freshwater systems; Hydrologic metrics; Hydrological regime; Management strategies; Spatially explicit; Temporal pattern; Climate change; abundance; climate change; climate effect; environmental disturbance; freshwater ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; strategic approach; vulnerability; air temperature; article; biogeographic region; climate change; freshwater fish; habitat; landscape ecology; nonhuman; precipitation; stream (river); animal; climate change; ecosystem; fish; hydrology; river; Pisces; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fishes; Hydrology; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092259035

Many people every day are the victims of this poor management of tremendous traffic. Since many years, there had been some automation in managing the traffic namely Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), Electronic parking payment, normal traffic information etc. However, there are little efforts for making the system more advanced. Recently, several kinds of research are being launched by many countries to develop Intelligent Transport System (ITS), with the objectives to minimize congestion, ensure better safety, reduce air pollution etc. ITS are planned to establish robust communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to pedestrian (V2P), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to network (V2N). Initially, for communication links ITS, deploys Wi-Fi network, but because of limited capacity and huge requirement, some links use 5.8 GHz radio frequency for such purposes. IEEE, International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and other advanced research organisations are studying 700 MHz band and mm frequency bands for advanced ITS. ITS is poised to use Information & Communication Technology (ICT) networks for such purposes. ITU has established Study Groups/study questions for addressing ITS issues. The World Radio Conference (WRC-2019) has made a Recommendation 208 regarding harmonization of frequency bands for ITS applications.

Extreme weather events and warmer global temperatures are likely to be more frequent with an adverse overall effect on agricultural production unless there is an urgent reduction in GHG emissions. There is thus an immediate need for increasing adaptive capacity in agriculture to long-term climatic trends and increasing variability in weather patterns. Climate change also poses significant challenges to global food safety due to the emergence of new pathogens, insect pests, and toxicants. Food safety threats cause an enormous burden on economies due to disruptions or restrictions in global and regional agrifood trade, food loss, and associated income. Food safety thus plays a critical role across the four pillars of food security—availability, access, utilization, and stability. Climate change is likely to create new safety issues entailing reassessing our tolerance to risk and safety limits presently established for the human food chain.The present review focuses on the factors affecting food security and safety as a consequence of climate change and the pre- and postharvest strategies that need to be adopted to mitigate these effects for enhancing food safety and global food sufficiency in future. © CAB International 2021","Agriculture; Climate change; Food safety; Food security; Nonthermal preservation techniques; Radio-isotopes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102695153

It spares normal tissue more effectively than conventional radiation therapy at equal tumor control. The radiation field consists of peak regions with doses of several hundred gray, whereas doses between the peaks (valleys) are below the tissue tolerance level. Widths and distances of the beams are in the submillimeter range for microbeam radiation therapy. A similar alternative concept with beam widths and distances in the millimeter range is presented by minibeam radiation therapy. Although both methods were developed at large synchrotron facilities, compact alternative sources have been proposed recently. Methods and Materials: A small-animal irradiator was fitted with a special 3-layered collimator that is used for preclinical research and produces microbeams of flexible width of up to 100 μm. Film dosimetry provided measurements of the dose distributions and was compared with Monte Carlo dose predictions. Moreover, the micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster CHO-K1 cells was used as a biological dosimeter. The focal spot size and beam emission angle of the x-ray tube were modified to optimize peak dose rate, peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), beam shape, and field homogeneity. An equivalent collimator with slit widths of up to 500 μm produced minibeams and allowed for comparison of microbeam and minibeam field characteristics. Results: The setup achieved peak entrance dose rates of 8 Gy/min and PVDRs >30 for microbeams. Agreement between Monte Carlo simulations and film dosimetry is generally better for larger beam widths; qualitative measurements validated Monte Carlo predicted results. A smaller focal spot enhances PVDRs and reduces beam penumbras but substantially reduces the dose rate. A reduction of the beam emission angle improves the PVDR, beam penumbras, and dose rate without impairing field homogeneity. Minibeams showed similar field characteristics compared with microbeams at the same ratio of beam width and distance but had better agreement with simulations. Conclusion: The developed setup is already in use for in vitro experiments and soon for in vivo irradiations. Deviations between Monte Carlo simulations and film dosimetry are attributed to scattering at the collimator surface and manufacturing inaccuracies and are a matter of ongoing research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"Animals; Dosimetry; Entertainment industry; Industrial research; Oncology; Radiation; Radiotherapy; Tissue; X ray tubes; Alternative concepts; Conventional radiation therapy; Methods and materials; Microbeam Radiation Therapy; Peak-to-valley dose ratios; Qualitative measurements; Radiation oncology; Submillimeter range; Monte Carlo methods; beryllium; copper; DNA; Article; bystander effect; Chinese hamster; CHO-K1 cell line; chromosome damage; comparative study; controlled study; cytokinesis; DNA damage; dose ratio; dosimetry; female; film dosimetry; filtration; genotoxicity; microbeam radiation therapy; micronucleus test; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; preclinical study; priority journal; radiation attenuation; radiation dose distribution; radiation field; radiation response; radiotherapy; synchrotron radiation; animal; CHO cell line; Cricetulus; devices; procedures; radiation oncology; radiotherapy dosage; time factor; Animals; CHO Cells; Cricetulus; Film Dosimetry; Monte Carlo Method; Radiation Oncology; Radiotherapy Dosage; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095728298

Effective use of solar energy can contribute to both targets. In this study, it is investigated an integrated process in which concentrated solar power is used to perform carbon dioxide capture from a combustion power plant through the calcium looping cycle in a dual interconnected fluidized bed system. Carbon dioxide is then reacted with hydrogen obtained from water electrolysis to produce methane (power-to-gas). Electrolytic cells may be powered by photovoltaics or excess renewable energies, thus reducing their curtailment. The integrated process was studied by means of model computations. Steady state operation of the different units was considered. Intrinsic variability of the solar energy was managed with implementation of a seasonal and/or daily thermochemical energy storage strategy. Design and operational conditions assumed as a reference were those of a combustion plant of municipal solid waste located in Manfredonia (Italy). Parameters were chosen so as to reproduce realistic conditions. Model results suggest that carbon dioxide capture can range from 30% to 85%. Input thermal power of the concentrated solar power must range between 50 and 175 MWth, for 12 h of operation. A share of this energy can be integrated in the power cycle for electricity generation, upgrading the potentiality of the original combustion plant. Size of cubic storage vessels required for continuous operation of the system ranges from 10 to 70 m according to the implemented strategy. Methane yield ranges within 3–12 × 104 tons per year, and production of H2 needs a photovoltaic field of 4–5 km2 if built in Manfredonia. Altogether, the integrated plant has an overall efficiency of 20–22% and allows, simultaneously, for carbon dioxide capture, continuous integration of solar energy in the energy production cycle and carbon dioxide utilization for methane production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fluidized bed; Power to gas; Sabatier reaction; Solar energy; Solar fuels; Thermochemical seasonal energy storage","Calcium; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electric energy storage; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Waste incineration; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide utilization; Concentrated solar power; Continuous integrations; Interconnected fluidized bed; Intrinsic variabilities; Steady-state operation; Thermochemical energy storage; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099174847

We investigated the mitigation of indoor human exposure to PM2.5 of outdoor origin under diverse exposure scenarios with and without filtration of PM2.5 during both hazy and non-hazy days. The key objective of our study was to make a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of portable air cleaners (PACs) and air conditioning (AC) systems equipped with particle filters in improving IAQ and to assess related long-term carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks. We conducted real-time measurements of PM2.5, black carbon mass concentrations and particle number concentrations in both indoor and outdoor areas, quantified the relative concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of toxic trace elements in PM2.5 for health risk assessment, and estimated the levels of thermal comfort. In addition, we calculated the total estimated cost of indoor air pollution control. Our findings suggest that indoor air cleaners are more effective at mitigating human exposure to airborne particles and reducing health risk with less consumption of electricity and better cost-effectiveness compared to AC.

Results show a mean annual temperature of 11.4 ± 2.1 °C. The coldest mean monthly temperature was 1.8 ± 3.4 °C while the warmest was 21.6 ± 2.5 °C. Growing season was 6.8 ± 1.1 months in duration. Precipitation during this period was 1082 ± 317 mm, reaching 661 ± 38 mm in the three wettest consecutive months, while in the three driest months it was 194 ± 229 mm. These results indicate a permanently humid temperate climate, with warm and wet summers. Compared with published palaeoclimatic results obtained using the Coexistence Approach method, our CLAMP analysis indicates lower temperatures and higher rainfall during the driest month. The climatic parameters are consistent with the occurrence of a temperate mixed evergreen and broadleaf deciduous fossil assemblage in the late Miocene of the La Cerdanya Basin. The assemblage contains more taxa in common with coeval localities from northern and central Europe than with Mediterranean sites; its closest modern analogue is with the montane flora from Honshu Island (Japan). Palaeoaltitudinal estimation using the terrestrial lapse rate method suggests that the La Cerdanya Basin was positioned at 1100–1550 m during early Tortonian times.

In this study, we present a methodology for estimating spatially varying productivity in a planted forest and changes in productivity with a changing climate in Japan, with a focus on Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) as a representative tree species of this region. The process-based model Biome-BGC was parameterized using a plant trait database for Japanese cedar and a Bayesian optimization scheme. To compare productivity under historical (1996–2000) and future (2096–2100) climatic conditions, the climate scenarios of two representative concentration pathways (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) were used in five global climate models (GCMs) with approximately 1-km resolution. The seasonality of modeled fluxes, namely gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and soil respiration, improved after two steps of parameterization. The estimated net primary production (NPP) of stands aged 36–40 years under the historical climatic conditions of the five GCMs was 0.77 ± 0.10 kgC m-2 year-1 (mean ± standard deviation), in accordance with the geographical distribution of forest NPP estimated in previous studies. Under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the mean NPP of the five GCMs increased by 0.04 ± 0.07 and 0.14 ± 0.11 kgC m-2 year-1, respectively. The increases in annual NPP were small in the southwestern region because of the decreases in summer NPP and the small increases in winter NPP under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, Japanese cedar was at risk in the southwestern region, in accordance with previous studies, and monitoring and silvicultural practices should be modified accordingly. © 2021 Toriyama et al.

This paper investigates the role that Urban Planning plays in the long term towards a safer and climate friendlier mobility, highlighting the need for integrated approaches gathering spatial planning and mobility management. After a review of several urban policies and planning strategies, initiatives, and approaches, mainly based on the urban scale, the paper presents an urban regeneration case study leading to an increase of pedestrian accessibility at the neighborhood level. This can be seen as a support tool to foster sustainable, safe, and climate friendly mobility in cities.

Environmental factors have been gradually considered in the competitiveness of international trade. However, the green assessment system of international trade competitiveness is not perfect. Building a model based on the trade economy is complex. This study combines environmental pollution data based on the forest processing industry with trade flows. Environmental trade competitiveness, pollution treatment, and trade scale were selected as the three criterion levels to construct an assessment system. The weight and score of each index were calculated by the overall entropy method. The overall entropy method is more comprehensive than the traditional entropy weight method due to introduce longitudinal comparisons of time and category. This method is a dynamic evaluation model with analysis of three-dimensional sequential data tables. The use of this method enables the assessment model to analyze more comprehensively the green level of a country’s trade in wooden forest products in terms of time and product category. The green level of chemical wood pulp and sawn timber trade in China is at a high level. The pollution treatment and trade scale of chemical wood pulp and sawn timber attained a medium level of matching. The trades in particle board, hardboard, newsprint, carton board, and wrapping paper are at medium levels of green. The trades in medium density fiberboard and plywood have poor levels of green and need to improve their green production capacity. It is suggested that China should increase investment in scientific research, as well as establish policies to restrict and treat pollution in the industry of wooden forest products, while increasing the export volumes of products with high added value. China should attach importance to the pollution resulting from the manufacture of wooden forest products.

While N2O emissions from CAS have been extensively studied, there is little knowledge of N2O emissions from aerobic granular sludge (AGS) which is now an increasingly popular secondary treatment alternative. The N2O emissions performance of AGS needs to be investigated to ensure that the positive benefits of AGS, such as increased capacity and stable nutrient removal, are not offset by higher emissions. This study quantified N2O emissions from a pilot-scale AGS reactor operated under a range of organic loading rates. A second CAS pilot plant was operated in parallel and under identical loading rates to allow for side-by-side comparison of N2O emissions from floc-based activated sludge. Under low loadings of &lt;0.6 kg COD/m3/d the N2O emission factor from AGS and CAS were similar, at around 1.46 ± 0.1% g N2Oemitted/g ammonium loaded. A step increase in the organic loading rate increased N2O emissions from AGS more so than CAS which appeared to be attributed to the reactor feeding strategy that was required for AGS formation. The use of a separate anaerobic feeding phase which was followed by the aeration phase, resulted in extended periods of low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations combined with an initial high biomass ammonium loading rate, which favours N2O production and was exacerbated at higher organic loads. Conversely, the combined feeding plus aeration operation (aerobic feed) employed by the CAS system enabled a more even biomass ammonium loading rate and DO supply. This work has shown that while AGS has many operational benefits, the impacts that aeration profile, loading rate and feeding strategy have on N2O emissions must be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic granular sludge; Conventional activated sludge; High-saline municipal wastewater treatment; Microbial ecology; Nitrous oxide emission","Activated sludge process; Carbon footprint; Dissolved oxygen; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Feeding; Granular materials; Nitrogen oxides; Pilot plants; Wastewater treatment; Aerobic granular sludges; Conventional activated sludges; Emissions performance; Environmental performance; Municipal wastewaters; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrous oxide emissions; Wastewater treatment process; Loading; nitrous oxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; activated sludge; emission; granular medium; microbial ecology; nitrous oxide; oxic conditions; quantitative analysis; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; aerobic granular sludge; Article; bacterium; controlled study; ecology; municipal wastewater; nitrous oxide emission; pilot study; priority journal; salinity; waste water management; bioreactor; denitrification; nitrification; sewage; waste water; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097346128

Meandroid scleractinian coral species are among the most severely affected. To gain insight into this affliction we conducted a broad study in the brain coral Pseudodiploria strigosa at a rear reef site in the NE Mexican Caribbean. We describe macro and microscopical signals of the disease, characterize the outbreak dynamics, the tissue histopathology, explore immunological responses in the individuals, and compare microbial assemblages associated with the surface mucus layer of healthy and unhealthy colonies. At the study site, the white syndrome outbreak on P. strigosa showed a high incidence rate in summer-fall and a low one in winter, as well as low survival expectation of diseased colonies at the end of the study. After 306 days of observation, out of 96 tracked colonies, eight remained apparently healthy and seven were diseased. No effective resistance to colony disease progression was observed once white syndrome signs developed. Tissue loss rate during the study varied among colonies (mean D 10.8 cm2, s.d. D 7.8 cm2) suggesting a complex relation between causal agents and colony resistance. The deterioration of tissues was evidenced from the basal to the surface body wall of polyps (up to 66% hypertrophy and liquefactive necrosis in unhealthy colonies), implying that microscopic alterations begin before macroscopic signals develop, suggesting this may be a systemic disease. We measured high levels of phenoloxidase (two orders of magnitude higher PO activity than P. strigosa affected by BBD) and antibacterial activity without significant reduction in unhealthy samples from the mucus layer, indicative of an enhanced immunological response. Results showed that opportunistic bacteria dominated damaged colonies, where six genera of the Bacteroidia class were found with significant changes in unhealthy colonies after DeSeq2 analysis. Nevertheless, histological observations did not support infection of the tissues. The opportunistic overload seems to be contained within the mucus layer but may be associated with the mortality of tissues in a yet unclear way. Future research should focus on experimental infections, the tracking of natural infections, and the immunocompetence of corals in the face of environmental pressures due to local, regional, and global impacts. If environmental deterioration is the primary cause of the continuing emergence and re-emergence of lethal coral diseases, as has been proposed by many authors, the only true option to effectively help preserve the coral reef biodiversity and services, is to restore the environmental quality of reef waters at the local scale and reduce greenhouse gases at the global scale. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

The bio inspired optimization model namely reinforced cuckoo search optimization algorithm is imposed on the estimation of methane emission source positions and their emission rates. Two different case studies are carried out to prove the significance of the proposed model.

Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the biggest city in Vietnam but lacks an updated spatial emission inventory (EI). In this study, we propose a new approach to update and improve a comprehensive spatial EI for major short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) (SO2, NOx , CO, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), PM10, PM2:5, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), NH3, CH4, N2O and CO2). Our originality is the use of satellite-derived urban land use morphological maps which allow spatial disaggregation of emissions. We investigated the possibility of using freely available coarseresolution satellite-derived digital surface models (DSMs) to estimate building height. Building height is combined with urban built-up area classified from Landsat images and nighttime light data to generate annual urban morphological maps. With outstanding advantages of these remote sensing data, our novel method is expected to make a major improvement in comparison with conventional allocation methodologies such as those based on population data. A comparable and consistent local emission inventory (EI) for HCMC has been prepared, including three key sectors, as a successor of previous EIs. It provides annual emissions of transportation, manufacturing industries, and construction and residential sectors at 1 km resolution. The target years are from 2009 to 2016. We consider both Scope 1, all direct emissions from the activities occurring within the city, and Scope 2, that is indirect emissions from electricity purchased. The transportation sector was found to be the most dominant emission sector in HCMC followed by manufacturing industries and residential area, responsible for over 682 Gg CO, 84.8 GgNOx , 20.4 GgPM10 and 22 000 GgCO2 emitted in 2016. Due to a sharp rise in vehicle population, CO, NOx , SO2 and CO2 traffic emissions show increases of 80 %, 160 %, 150% and 103% respectively between 2009 and 2016. Among five vehicle types, motorcycles contributed around 95% to total CO emission, 14% to total NOx emission and 50 %-60% to CO2 emission. Heavy-duty vehicles are the biggest emission source of NOx , SO2 and particulate matter (PM) while personal cars are the largest contributors to NMVOCs and CO2. Electricity consumption accounts for the majority of emissions from manufacturing industries and residential sectors. We also found that Scope 2 emissions from manufacturing industries and residential areas in 2016 increased by 87% and 45 %, respectively, in comparison with 2009. Spatial emission disaggregation reveals that emission hotspots are found in central business districts like Quan 1, Quan 4 and Quan 7, where emissions can be over 1900 times those estimated for suburban HCMC. Our estimates show relative agreement with several local inherent EIs, in terms of total amount of emission and sharing ratio among elements of EI. However, the big gap was observed when comparing with REASv2.1, a regional EI, which mainly applied national statistical data. This publication provides not only an approach for updating and improving the local EI but also a novel method of spatial allocation of emissions on the city scale using available data sources. © Author(s) 2021.

Air concentrations spanned four orders of magnitude, and were highest near industrial emitters and lowest in the Arctic. Declines in unsubstituted PAHs were observed at locations close to industrial facilities that had reduced emissions, but trends elsewhere were modest or negligible. Retene concentrations are increasing at several locations. Ambient concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene exceeded Ontario's health-based guideline in many urban/industrial areas. The estimated toxicity of the ambient PAC mixture increased by up to a factor of six when including compounds beyond the US EPA PAHs. Knowledge of PAC deposition is limited to the Laurentian Great Lakes and Athabasca Oil Sands regions. The atmosphere remained a net source of PAHs to the Great Lakes, though atmospheric inputs were decreasing with halving times of 26–30 years. Chemical transport modelling substantially overestimated wet deposition, but model performance is unknown for dry deposition. Sources from Asia, Europe and North America contributed to Arctic and Sub-Arctic concentrations, whereas transboundary or long-range transport have not been assessed outside Canada's north. Climate-related impacts from re-emission and forest fires were implicated in maintaining air concentrations in the high Arctic that were not consistent with global emissions reductions. Industrial emission decreases were substantial at the national scale, but their influence on the environment was limited to areas near relevant facilities. When examined through the lens of ambient levels at the local scale, evidence suggested that contributions from residential wood combustion and motor vehicles were smaller and larger, respectively, than those reported in national inventories. Future work aimed at characterizing PACs beyond the EPA PAHs, improving measurement coverage, elucidating deposition phenomena, and refining estimates of source contributions would assist in reducing remaining knowledge gaps about PACs in Canada. © 2020Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in Canadian air and deposition were examined at the national scale for the first time in over twenty-five years.

This study explores connections between local government’s efforts to uphold and maintain the public trust and their considerations about climate change adaptation associated with water management. Document analysis and 24 interviews with local public officials are used to shed light on these considerations in three small municipalities in central Pennsylvania: Chambersburg, Carlisle, and Gettysburg. The analysis provides indications that a paradox of public trust leads to public officials pursuing actions and considerations that are consistent with climate change adaptation, but not recognizing that they are doing so. The implications of this governing mindset for climate change outreach and policy are explored. Suggestions for countering the logic of inaction expressed by public officials that justified a lack of adaptation are identified, and the potential for state and federal interventions to stimulate climate adaptation in contexts like these local governments is explored. © 2021 by the authors.

In response, the National Health Service (NHS) in England has been working since 2008 to quantify and reduce its carbon footprint. This Article presents the latest update to its greenhouse gas accounting, identifying interventions for mitigation efforts and describing an approach applicable to other health systems across the world. Methods: A hybrid model was used to quantify emissions within Scopes 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as well as patient and visitor travel emissions, from 1990 to 2019. This approach complements the broad coverage of top-down economic modelling with the high accuracy of bottom-up data wherever available. Available data were backcasted or forecasted to cover all years. To enable the identification of measures to reduce carbon emissions, results were disaggregated by organisation type. Findings: In 2019, the health service's emissions totalled 25 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a reduction of 26% since 1990, and a decrease of 64% in the emissions per inpatient finished admission episode. Of the 2019 footprint, 62% came from the supply chain, 24% from the direct delivery of care, 10% from staff commute and patient and visitor travel, and 4% from private health and care services commissioned by the NHS.

This has led to both the cement producers and the scientific community to develop new cementitious materials with a reduced carbon footprint. Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements are special hydraulic binders from non-Portland clinkers; they represent an important alternative to OPC due to their peculiar composition and significantly lower impact on the environment. CSA cements contain less limestone and require lower synthesis temperatures, which means a reduced kiln thermal energy demand and lower CO2 emissions. CSA cements can also be mixed with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) which further reduce the carbon footprint. This article was aimed at evaluating the possibility of using different amounts (20 and 35% by mass) of water potabilization sludges (WPSs) as SCM in CSA-blended cements. WPSs were treated thermally (TT) at 700° in order to obtain an industrial pozzolanic material. The hydration properties and the technical behavior of two different CSA-blended cements were investigated using differential thermal-thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses, mercury intrusion porosimetry, shrinkage/expansion and compressive strength measurements. The results showed that CSA binders containing 20% by mass of TTWPSs exhibited technological properties similar to those relating to plain CSA cement and were characterized by more pronounced ecofriendly features. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper details a model that can estimate the United States (US) major depressive disorder burden attributable to indoor PM2.5 exposure, locally modifiable through input parameter calibrations. By utilizing concentration values in an exposure-response function, along with relative risk values derived from epidemiological studies, the model estimated the prevalence of expected cases of major depressive disorder in multiple scenarios. Model results show that exposure to indoor PM2.5 might contribute to 476,000 cases of major depressive disorder in the US (95% confidence interval 11,000–1,100,000), approximately 2.7% of the total number of cases reported annually. Increasing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filter efficiency in a residential dwelling results in minor reductions in depressive disorders in rural or urban locations in the US. Nevertheless, a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 13 filter does have a benefit/cost ratio at or near one when smoking occurs indoors; during wildfires; or in locations with elevated outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The approach undertaken herein could provide a transparent strategy for investment into the built environment to improve the mental health of the occupants. © 2020","Built environment; Depression; Epidemiology; Indoor air; Mental health; Particulate matter","Efficiency; Housing; Particles (particulate matter); Risk perception; Benefit/cost ratios; Concentration values; Confidence interval; Epidemiological studies; Exploratory studies; Fine particulate matter; PM2.5 concentration; Residential dwelling; Air conditioning; air conditioning; concentration (composition); epidemiology; indoor air; mental disorder; particulate matter; pollution exposure; air conditioning; ambient air; Article; confidence interval; disease burden; economic evaluation; heating; human; major depression; mental health; PM2.5 exposure; priority journal; rural area; smoking; United States; urban area; wildfire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097467898

In 2013, a provincial study in Nova Scotia identified areas with elevated groundwater CH4. However, due to limited data, the specific sources and local distribution of CH4 in those areas remain unknown. In this study, we examined the Stellarton Basin in central Nova Scotia, Canada, a region with an abundance of coal formations, numerous abandoned coal mines, and an active open pit coal mine. Methane was detected in 94% of water samples that were sampled from 45 private water wells. Six water wells exceeded the 28 mg/L hazard mitigation threshold with CH4 levels of up to 72.7 mg/L. The δ13CCH4 (−85.5 to −48.5‰) and the δ2HCH4 (−280 to −88‰) indicated that &gt;95% of samples had CH4 of microbial origin. However, the detection of ethane (C2H6) up to 2.97 mg/L and propane (C3H8) up to 0.008 mg/L, as well as the δ13CC2H6 values (−30.1 to −15.6‰) suggested a mixture of microbial CH4 with trace thermogenic gas, likely migrated from Stellarton coals (δ13CC2H6 of −27.6 to −15.35‰). A mobile greenhouse gas analyzer survey was conducted within the perimeter of residences and off-gassing from taps had atmospheric CH4 measurements as high as 66 ppmv. This study integrates multiple sampling and monitoring methods to investigate groundwater CH4 in a coal-bearing region. The findings advance the understanding of the origin and occurrence of CH4 in complex groundwater systems. The data acquired in this study may be used as a pre-drill baseline for groundwater CH4 concentrations and origins should coal-bed methane operations in Nova Scotia proceed in the future. © 2020","Coalbed methane; Gas migration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Groundwater methane; Isotope tracing","Abandoned mines; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal mines; Economic geology; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Hazards; Open pit mining; Water quality; Water wells; Explosive hazards; Groundwater system; Hazard mitigations; Local distributions; Microbial origins; Monitoring methods; Multiple sampling; Open pit coal mine; Methane; coal; ethane; fossil fuel; ground water; methane; propane; coalbed methane; concentration (composition); emission; greenhouse gas; groundwater; isotopic analysis; water quality; Article; Canada; coal mining; concentration (parameter); gas analysis; greenhouse gas; priority journal; water analysis; water quality; water sampling; Canada; Nova Scotia; Stellarton Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090328328

This phenotype is supported by increased activity of pH regulators like ATPases, carbonic anhydrases (CAs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and sodium–proton exchangers (NHEs) that induce an acidic tumor microenvironment, responsible for the cancer acid-resistant phenotype. In this work, we analyzed the expression of these pH regulators and explored their inhibition in breast cancer cells as a strategy to enhance the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Expression of the different pH regulators was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot in two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and by immunohistochemistry in human breast cancer tissues. Cell viability, migration and invasion were evaluated upon exposure to the pH regulator inhibitors (PRIs) concanamycin-A, cariporide, acetazolamide and cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. Additionally, PRIs were combined with doxorubicin to analyze the effect of cell pH dynamic disruption on doxorubicin sensitivity. Both cancer cell lines expressed all pH regulators, except for MCT1 and CAXII, only expressed in MCF-7 cells. There was higher plasma membrane expression of the pH regulators in human breast cancer tissues than in normal breast epithelium. Additionally, pH regulator expression was significantly associated with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. pH regulator inhibition decreased cancer cell aggressiveness, with a higher effect in MDA-MB-231. A synergistic inhibitory effect was observed when PRIs were combined with doxorubicin in the breast cancer cell line viability. Our results support proton dynamic disruption as a breast cancer antitumor strategy and the use of PRIs to boost the activity of conventional therapy. © 2021 by the authors.

Publicly available geognostic drilling data from the Italian Seismic Microzonation studies have been exploited together with hydrogeological and thermophysical properties of the main geological formations of the area. These data have been averaged over the firsts 100 m of subsoil to define the thermal conductivity, the specific heat extraction rates of the ground and to establish the geothermal potential of the area (expressed in MWh y−1). The investigation revealed that the heat-exchange potential is mainly controlled by the bedrock lithotypes and the saturated conditions of the sedimentary infill. A general increase in thermal conductivity, specific heat extraction and geothermal potential have been mapped moving from the coast, where higher sedimentary infill thicknesses have been found, towards the inland where the carbonate bedrock approaches the surface. The geothermal potential of the investigated lower Metauro Valley is mostly between ~9.0 and ~10 MWh y−1 and the average depth to be drilled to supply a standard domestic power demand of 4.0 kW is ~96 m (ranging from 82 to 125 m all over the valley). This investigation emphasizes that the Seismic Microzonation studies represent a huge database to be exploited for the best assessment of the shallow geothermal potential throughout the Italian regions, which can be addressed by the implementation of heating and cooling through vertical closed-loop borehole heat exchanger systems coupled with geothermal heat pumps. © 2021 by the authors.

However, intensified management of grasslands and forests may reduce the CH4 sink capacity of soils. We investigated the influence of grassland land-use intensity (150 sites) and forest management type (149 sites) on potential atmospheric CH4 oxidation rates (PMORs) and the abundance and diversity of MOB (with qPCR) in topsoils of three temperate regions in Germany. PMORs measurements in microcosms under defined conditions yielded approximately twice as much CH4 oxidation in forest than in grassland soils. High land-use intensity of grasslands had a negative effect on PMORs (−40%) in almost all regions and fertilization was the predominant factor of grassland land-use intensity leading to PMOR reduction by 20%. In contrast, forest management did not affect PMORs in forest soils. Upland soil cluster (USC)-α was the dominant group of MOBs in the forests. In contrast, USC-γ was absent in more than half of the forest soils but present in almost all grassland soils. USC-α abundance had a direct positive effect on PMOR in forest, while in grasslands USC-α and USC-γ abundance affected PMOR positively with a more pronounced contribution of USC-γ than USC-α. Soil bulk density negatively influenced PMOR in both forests and grasslands. We further found that the response of the PMORs to pH, soil texture, soil water holding capacity and organic carbon and nitrogen content differ between temperate forest and grassland soils. pH had no direct effects on PMOR, but indirect ones via the MOB abundances, showing a negative effect on USC-α, and a positive on USC-γ abundance.

High IVOC emission factors (EFs) and distinct volatility distribution were recognized. The IVOC EFs for the China V vehicle ranged from 12.1 to 226.3 mg per kilogram fuel, with a median value of 83.7 mg per kilogram fuel, which was higher than that from US vehicles. Besides, a large discrepancy in volatility distribution and chemical composition of IVOCs from Chinese gasoline vehicle exhaust was discovered, with larger contributions of B14-B16 compounds (retention time bins corresponding to C14-C16 n-alkanes) and a higher percentage of n-alkanes. Further we investigated the possible reasons that influence the IVOC EFs and volatility distribution and found that fuel type, starting mode, operating cycles and acceleration rates did have an impact on the IVOC EF. When using E10 (ethanol volume ratio of 10 %, v=v) as fuel, the IVOC EF of the tested vehicle was lower than that using commercial China standard V fuel. The average IVOC-to-THC (total hydrocarbon) ratios for gasoline-fueled and E10-fueled gasoline vehicles were 0:07 ± 0:01 and 0:11 ± 0:02, respectively. Cold-start operation had higher IVOC EFs than hot-start operation. The China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) produced 70 % higher IVOCs than those from the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). We found that the tested vehicle emitted more IVOCs at lower acceleration rates, which leads to high EFs under CLTC. The only factor that may influence the volatility distribution and compound composition is the engine aftertreatment system, which has compound and volatility selectivity in exhaust purification. These distinct characteristics in EFs and volatility may result in higher SOA formation potential in China. Using published yield data and a surrogate equivalent method, we estimated SOA formation under different OA (organic aerosol) loading and NOx conditions. Results showed that under low-and high-NOx conditions at different OA loadings, IVOCs contributed more than 80 % of the predicted SOA. Furthermore, we built up a parameterization method to simply estimate the vehicular SOA based on our bottomup measurement of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and IVOCs, which would provide another dimension of information when considering the vehicular contribution to the ambient OA. Our results indicate that vehicular IVOCs contribute significantly to SOA, implying the importance of reducing IVOCs when making air pollution controlling policies in urban areas of China. © 2021 Author(s).",,"aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; measurement method; nitrogen oxides; organic compound; pollution control; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101207756

However, few have empirically analyzed the impact of market-based instruments such as emission trading system on urban carbon emissions in developing economies. This paper examines the effect of China’s pilot carbon trading markets, the first emission trading system in developing economies, on cities’ carbon intensity. We also explore the mechanism by which the emission trading system achieves its influence. The PSM-DID method is used to analyze the panel data including China’s 273 prefecture-level cities from 2010 to 2016. The results illustrate that the emission trading system significantly decreased pilot cities’ carbon intensity and this effect endured; as time progressed, the reduction effect was increasing. Through mediating effect analysis, we find that the emission trading system reduced the carbon intensity via increasing the proportion of tertiary industry output value in GDP and decreasing the energy intensity. Overall, the empirical results suggest that the Chinese government should drive the establishment and improvement of a national carbon market, proactively adjust industry structure, and consider the possible influence caused by the potential energy rebound effect. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Emission trading system; Mediating effect; Pilot carbon trading markets; PSM-DID; Urban carbon intensity","carbon emission; economic development; emissions trading; empirical analysis; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; potential energy; urban planning; China; carbon; China; city; greenhouse gas; industry; Carbon; China; Cities; Greenhouse Gases; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091283324

This study assessed CO2 emissions from passenger transport in traffic analysis zones (TAZs) at the community level, based on a combination of the mixed-use development model and the vehicle emission calculation model. Based on mixed land use and transport accessibility, the mixed-use development model was adopted to estimate travel demand, including travel modes and distances. As a leading low-carbon city project of international cooperation in China, Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Core Area was chosen as a case study. The results clearly illustrate travel demand and CO2 emissions of different travel modes between communities and show that car trips account for the vast majority of emissions in all types of travel modes in each community. Spatial emission differences are prominently associated with in-adequately mixed land use layouts and unbalanced transport accessibility. The findings demonstrate the significance of the mixed land use and associated job-housing balance in reducing passenger CO2 emissions from passenger transport, especially in per capita emissions. Policy implications are given based on the results to facilitate sophisticated transport emission control at a finer spatial scale. This new framework can be used for assessing the impacts of urban planning on transport emissions to promote sustainable urbanization in developing countries. © 2021 by the authors.

Tubular solid-state fuel cells filled with Fe-loaded carbon materials (Fe-loaded activated carbon, Fe-AC, and Fe-loaded carbon black, Fe-BC) were fabricated for electrochemical reduction in the configuration of LSM as the cathode, NiO-YSZ mixed powder as the anode, and YSZ as the electrolyte. A moderate NO removal efficiency of 60% and maximum peak power density of 0.035 W cm−2 were achieved for Fe-AC in the presence of 1% O2, whereas no such performances were detected in the case of AC. Following TGA-MS and in-situ analyses of exit gases from the anodes, it can be concluded that Fe-loaded carbon materials promote CO formation in Boudouard reactions by utilizing excess oxygen transported from the cathode, which is capable of alleviating the impact of oxygen on NO removal while also enhancing electrical performance.

We find that the actual consumptions of energy in the secondary industry of all provinces are more than that if there were no distortions, while the case for the tertiary industry is on the contrary. Removing the distortion and reallocating the energy could increase the output of tertiary industries and reduce the CO2 emissions in whole China.

Herein, we synthesize a series of monolayer Ni3X-layered double hydroxide (LDH) (m-Ni3X-LDH, X = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co). When applied for CO2PR, the selectivity of CH4 exhibits a volcano-like trend with the highest point at m-Ni3Mn-LDH using Ru-complex as the photosensitizer. After further optimization, nearly 99% selectivity of CH4 is achieved under irradiation with λ = 600 nm. Accordingly, structural characterizations prove the presence of metal and hydroxyl defect sites, in which the surface valence states of Ni and O exhibit a volcano-like trend with the lowest point at m-Ni3Mn-LDH. Thus, the high selectivity of CH4 could be attributed to the efficient electron-hole migration and separation in m-Ni3Mn-LDH. Moreover, the electron-rich Ni-O bond in m-Ni3Mn-LDH may act as the adsorption site for CO∗, promoting the further hydrogenation of CO to CH4 and improving the selectivity of CH4.

Development and implementation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging. To guide future strategy, an overview of current global COPD guidelines is required. Research Question: We systematically reviewed national COPD guidelines, focusing on worldwide availability and identification of potential development, content, context, and quality gaps that may hamper effective implementation. Study Design and Methods: Scoping review of national COPD management guidelines. We assessed: (1) global guideline coverage; (2) guideline information (authors, target audience, dissemination plans); (3) content (prevention, diagnosis, treatments); (4) ethical, legal, and socio-economic aspects; and (5) compliance with the eight Institute of Medicine (IOM) guideline standards. LMICs guidelines were compared with those from high-income countries (HICs). Results: Of the 61 national COPD guidelines identified, 30 were from LMICs. Guidelines did not cover 1.93 billion (30.2%) people living in LMICs, whereas only 0.02 billion (1.9%) in HICs were without national guidelines. Compared with HICs, LMIC guidelines targeted fewer health-care professional groups and less often addressed case finding and co-morbidities. More than 90% of all guidelines included smoking cessation advice. Air pollution reduction strategies were less frequently mentioned in both LMICs (47%) and HICs (42%). LMIC guidelines fulfilled on average 3.37 (42%) of IOM standards, compared with 5.29 (66%) in HICs (P < .05). LMICs scored significantly lower compared with HICs regarding conflicts of interest management, updates, articulation of recommendations, and funding transparency (all, P < .05). Interpretation: Several development, content, context, and quality gaps exist in COPD guidelines from LMICs that may hamper effective implementation. Overall, COPD guidelines in LMICs should be more widely available and should be transparently developed and updated. Guidelines may be further enhanced by better inclusion of local risk factors, case findings, and co-morbidity management, preferably tailored to available financial and staff resources. © 2020 The Authors","chronic obstructive; consensus; developing countries; pulmonary disease; reference standards","air pollution; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; human; legal aspect; low income country; middle income country; priority journal; risk factor; smoking cessation; socioeconomics; chronic obstructive lung disease; developing country; practice guideline; Developing Countries; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099686104

We have a responsibility to future generations. One way to shape the future is the appropriate design of education systems. In this article we argue that climate education requires a holistic approach which goes beyond classroom pedagogies. We argue that climate education should not be limited to interventions within the field of school curricula alone. We review the main elements of the system of education qualitatively, both at macro- and micro-levels, and attempt to form a point of view. Our main argument is that climate education efforts should be coordinated and institutionalised. Based on our qualitative research in Poland, we developed a conceptual model and linked it to an assessment tool. Our model includes the elements necessary for a climate-oriented education program. We propose certain indicators which can be applied at school and higher levels of education system management. Our suggestions should not be limited to children’s education but should be incorporated into continuing education for professionals such as lawyers and accountants as well as other adult education programs. The science and research results are now rich and reliable enough that they can be applied to systemic social change (not only at the individual level). For this reason our model presents a conceptual framework for implementing systemic change in education systems that supports the efforts of local and national authorities to address climate change. The model is general and independent of national cultures. Our research offers both policymakers and scientists the opportunity to modify our concept and adapt it to local contexts and the national legal system. Our model should provoke decisionmakers to introduce necessary changes in the legal system. The development of climate awareness should take a formalised role within a national education system. In this paper we demonstrate a logical process of reasoning ensuing from the literature review through empirical research down to the implementation stage. © 2021 by the authors.","Air pollution; Climate change; Climate education; Policy planning; School management","adult education; climate change; conceptual framework; design method; environmental education; holistic approach; literature review; social change; sustainable development; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100233304

So far, a number of studies have analyzed the agricultural vulnerability of a region for a particular year, and thereby, the results obtained were biased towards the climatic and agro-ecological factors of that particular year resulting in an imprecise understanding about the contributing factors of vulnerability. Specific reasons of agricultural vulnerability of a region can be clearly identified by analyzing its contributing factors for long-term. In line of this, our study performs the 50-year analysis from the year 1966–2015 to identify the key drivers of agricultural vulnerability at district level for Maharashtra state in India. We used indicator based approach to assess the dynamics of three dimensions of vulnerability i.e., exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity followed by formulating the composite vulnerability index for each district of Maharashtra. Exposure includes monsoon and temperature variability parameters, sensitivity includes land sensitivity parameters i.e., barren land, fragmented land-holdings etc., and adaptive capacity includes parameters of human capital, physical capital, total assets and land productivity. Formulation of vulnerability index is done via i) first, identifying the underlying factors of vulnerability, ii) normalizing the indicators, iii) identifying functional relationship of each indicator with vulnerability, and iv) aggregating the indicators using equal weightage method. We analyzed the reasons for increasing/decreasing trend of vulnerability for each district of Maharashtra. As an example, vulnerability of Ahmednagar district in Nashik region increased by 0.065 units due to decrease in adaptive capacity by 0.06 units and increase in land sensitivity by 0.018 units over past 50 years. Similarly, vulnerability of Chandarpur district in Vidarbha region reduced by 0.025 units by decrease in exposure by 0.017 and sensitivity by 0.007 units along with increase in adaptive capacity by 0.008 units from the year 1966–2015. Findings show that a few districts are vulnerable despite being least exposed to climate variability signifying the contribution of sensitivity and adaptive capacity parameters towards their vulnerability. The results also highlight the intra-regional district level variability in resource distribution, exposure and sensitivity parameters indicating the significance of having a district-wise policy for Maharashtra, India. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agriculture vulnerability; Climate policy; Climate variability; Decentralization; District-wise planning; Sensitivity and adaptation","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Agricultural system; Climate variability; Contributing factor; Functional relationship; Resource distribution; Sensitivity parameters; Temperature variability; Vulnerability index; Agriculture; agroecology; agrometeorology; climate change; farming system; sensitivity analysis; vulnerability; India; Maharashtra; Nashik; Vidarbha; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097578333

This work disassociates the molecular orientation of different components in cellulose–lignin composite fibers using rotor-synchronized solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray scattering.

This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogenesis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socio-economic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socio-economic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; COVID-19; Socio-economic aspects; Solid waste management; Wastewater surveillance","detection method; disease transmission; epidemiology; mortality; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome; socioeconomic conditions; urban pollution; virus; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; hazardous waste; health care policy; hospital waste; human; mortality; municipal solid waste; particulate matter 2.5; pathogenesis; Review; socioeconomics; solid waste management; virus strain; virus transmission; waste water recycling; air pollution; city; pandemic; socioeconomics; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097165857

The closed chamber method with the unit consisted of a cubic chamber (50 × 50 × 100 cm) and a frame base (50 × 50 × 15 cm), and gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 fluxes. The results showed that the DSR increased yield components and reduced CH4 emissions. The DSR could significantly increase grain yield than TPR at D. Waru and K. Banteng approximately 26 and 49%, respectively. The DSR could be an option for reducing global warming potential (GWP) and maintaining rice yield.

This paper studies the reactivity of non-traditional waste SCMs: Wheat straw ash (WSA), mixture of wheat and soybean straw ash (WSSA) and soybean straw ash (SSA), which are abundant as agricultural by-products in Serbia. The chemical evaluation using XRF technique, thermal analysis (TGA/DSC), XRD and FTIR methods were performed along with physical properties tests to investigate the feasibility of uti-lizing biomass ashes as cement substitutes. The obtained results demonstrate a high pozzolanic activity of WSA, which is attributed to a high reactive silica content of the ash and its satisfactory level of fineness. A wider hump in XRD pattern of WSA compared to WSSA and SSA confirmed that it abounds in amorphous (reactive) phase. The insufficient activity index of soybean-based biomass ashes, characterized with a low silica content, was improved by additional grinding and/or blending with amorphous silica-rich material. This points out the mechanical activation, i.e., grinding procedure, and chemical activation, i.e., modification of the chemical composition, as techniques efficient at producing pozzolanic materials from biomass wastes. Tested biomass ashes are characterized with negligible leaching values of heavy metals, thereby satisfying eco-friendly principles of SCM utilization.

Herein, Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles co-loaded zeolite TS-1 (Ag–TiO2/TS-1) were synthesized by the ion-exchange and subsequently in-situ photodeposition method. The obtained Ag–TiO2/TS-1 sample has a high surface area and rich Ti3+-Vo defects and as well as highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles. As expected, the sample Ag–TiO2/TS-1 not only shows high CO2 adsorption capacity, but also improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. As a result, only CO and CH4 can be detected on the sample Ag–TiO2/TS-1 in the photocatalytic CO2 conversion, and the competing H2 evolution can be completely suppressed, suggestive of its high selectivity. The super photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction can be ascribed to the synergistic effect among highly dispersed Ag nanoparticle, the support zeolite TS-1 and TiO2 with highly exposed {101} planes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ag; CO2 reduction; Defective TS-1; Photocatalysis; TiO2","Carbon dioxide; Ion exchange; Metal nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Photocatalytic activity; Silver nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Zeolites; Ag nanoparticle; High selectivity; High surface area; Photo-deposition; Photogenerated electrons; Research topics; Separation efficiency; Synergistic effect; TiO2 nanoparticles; carbon dioxide; silver nanoparticle; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; zeolite; adsorption; carbon dioxide; catalysis; nanoparticle; oxide; photodegradation; reduction; separation; silver; titanium; zeolite; adsorption; Article; chemical modification; chemical reaction; desorption; hydrogen evolution; ion exchange; optics; oxidation reduction state; photocatalysis; photoluminescence; pore size distribution; reduction (chemistry); surface area; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091678383

Our research aims to reveal the effects of permafrost thawing on CH4 and N2O emissions from peatlands in Xiaoxing’an Mountains, Northeast China. During four growing seasons (2011-2014), in situ CH4 and N2O emissions were monitored from peatland under permafrost no-thawing, mild-thawing, and severethawing conditions in the middle of the Xiaoxing’an Mountains by a static-chamber method. Average CH4 emissions in the severe-thawing site were 55-fold higher than those in the no-thawing site. The seasonal variation of CH4 emission became more aggravated with the intensification of permafrost thawing, in which the emission peaks became larger and the absorption decreased to zero. The increased CH4 emissions were caused by the expansion of the thawing layer and the subsequent increases in soil temperature, water table, and shifts of plant communities. However, N2O emissions did not change with thawing. Permafrost thawing increased CH4 emissions but did not impact N2O emissions in peatlands in the Xiaoxing’an Mountains. Increased CH4 emissions from peatlands in this region may amplify global warming. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the regulation of its catabolism is unclear. Here the small RNA (sRNA) Spot 42, an essential regulator of carbon catabolite repression (CCR), was confirmed to participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of putrescine catabolism in Escherichia coli. Its encoding gene spf exclusively exists in the γ-proteobacteria and contains specific binding sites to the 5′-untranslated regions of the puuE gene, which encodes transaminase in the glutamylated putrescine pathway of putrescine catabolism converting γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) into succinate semialdehyde (SSA). The transcription of the spf gene was induced by glucose, inhibited by putrescine, and unaffected by PuuR, the repressor of puu genes. Excess Spot 42 repressed the expression of PuuE significantly in an antisense mechanism through the direct and specific base-pairing between the 51`-57 nt of Spot 42 and the 5′-UTR of puuE. Interestingly, Spot 42 mainly influenced the stability of the puuCBE transcript. This work revealed the regulatory role of Spot 42 in putrescine catabolism, in the switch between favorable and non-favorable carbon source utilization, and in the balance of metabolism of carbon and nitrogen sources. © 2021, The Microbiological Society of Korea.","carbon catabolite repression; putrescine; puuE; Small RNA; Spot 42","bacterial RNA; putrescine; animal; binding site; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; Animals; Binding Sites; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Putrescine; RNA, Bacterial; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100245959

Beijing has been making significant efforts to reduce transportation sector energy consumption and pollution. However, owing to the existence of a large number of private cars, the implementation of effective energy consumption and emission reduction measures has been difficult to achieve. This paper reviews the policies and regulations that have so far been developed to tackle Beijing's transportation sector issues. Perspective and analysis are given on the specific policies and regulations that have been employed, focusing on the overarching regulation mechanism, public transportation infrastructure, vehicle technology-related measures, vehicle activity-related measures and eco-driving -related measures, relevant experiences and lessons are summarised. A key finding concludes that the implementation of driving restriction policy can restrain pollutants emissions significantly, it shows energy consumption and emission reduction should not only be applied to public transportation, but the effective control of emissions from private cars should also attract more attention. To better control energy consumption of urban transport, various measures and solutions are proposed and discussed, including the further popularizing of eco-driving and the widespread application of e-mobility.

This study aims to analyze the CO2 emission characteristics and spatial distribution in megacities among different countries, which is important for climate change mitigation. In this study, 12 megacities from China, Japan, and South Korea were selected as typical case studies for analysis. Results show that Chinese cities’ CO2 emissions are among the top four cities studies and are much higher when compared to the other sample cities in Japan and South Korea. Chongqing, Incheon, Tianjin, and Shanghai were the top four cities with the highest carbon intensity. The spatial distribution of urban carbon emissions varies widely. In Seoul, Tokyo Metropolis, and Beijing, 90% of carbon emissions are concentrated on 74.17%, 55.95% and 8.93% of the land area, respectively. The results of the driving forces and emission reduction targets analysis indicate that the three countries face different challenges and there are different action plans in each city accordingly. This study proposed the carbon emissions reduction targets and countermeasures in different industrial sectors, including an increased rate of the standardization of city CO2 emission accounting systems and the decarbonization of the power industry, among others. These countermeasures will not only contribute to the analysis of CO2 emissions but will also promote to the low-carbon city development and encourage the realization of urban sustainable development goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Driving forces; Paris Agreement; Spatial distribution","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Environmental management; Spatial distribution; Urban growth; Accounting system; Asian mega-cities; Carbon emissions reductions; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction targets; Low-carbon cities; Structural characteristics; Urban sustainable development; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; identification method; mitigation; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; standardization; urban development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099480697

Herein, a tetraphenylethene-substituted Schiff base (TPENOCN) was synthesized, which exhibited expectedly water-induced fluorescent switch from Kasha's rule emission to anti-Kasha's rule emission accompanied by dynamic emission color changes from yellow to blue with an enhanced fluorescent quantum yield. Theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that the dynamic fluorescent switch is induced by the gradually formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond between TPENOCN and water. Furthermore, an eco-friendly rewritable paper for security writing/printing, multilevel anti-counterfeiting and data storage were developed by employing TPENOCN as imaging layer and water as ink.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout among entry-level dental hygiene program directors.Methods: The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) survey was used to determine prevalence of burnout in 325 dental hygiene program directors from across the United States. The survey was disseminated electronically. The CBI contains 19 questions that measure overall, personal, work-related, and client/student-related burnout on a five-point Likert type scale. The survey also included nine demographic and three open-ended questions related to burnout. Descriptive statistics, one sample t-tests, and one-way ANOVA tests were used to analyze the data.Results: One hundred twenty-seven dental hygiene program directors completed the survey for a 39.1% response rate. Most participants (62.2%, n=79) indicated moderate to high burnout on the personal burnout subscale, approximately one half (51.2%, n=65) on the work-related burnout subscale, and one third (33.1%, n=42) on the client/student-related burnout subscale. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing mean scores between directors of two-year and four-year program or between participants under age 50 and those 50 years of age and older (p-values>0.05). Program directors with teaching workloads of 51-60% had significantly lower burnout on the work-related burnout subscale when compared to participants with teaching workloads of 31-40% (p=0.045). Participants with the lowest workload allocations for administrative duties had higher overall mean burnout scores.Conclusion: Results from this study suggest one out of two dental hygiene program directors have symptoms of some type of burnout with the highest prevalence rate in the personal burnout subscale. Findings underscore the need for further research to identify stressors that lead to burnout as well as identify prevention strategies that promote a healthier work climate for dental hygiene program administrators.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and a high-resolution local emission inventory were applied to evaluate the control measures. Reductions of ~35–60% of primary PM (PPM), 45–65% of VOCs, ~5% of NH3, 35–45% of NOx, and 30–70% of SO2 emissions in the central area (i.e., ZZ) and collaborative cities (i.e., the six neighboring cities) lead to significant reductions of daily PM2.5 by 25–45% in ZZ. Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 are reduced by as much as 100 μg m−3. Most of the reduction in PM2.5 is due to primary PM, and NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ ion concentrations only decrease by 5–6%. Emission reductions in the collaborative cities contribute to 10–30% of the decrease in PM2.5 and PM10 in ZZ. Concentrations of daily maximum 8-hr (DM8H) O3 increase by 2–5% on high O3 days. Isopleth analysis suggests that the local molar reductions ratio of NOx to VOC needs to be &lt; 0.5 to avoid the increases. More stable meteorology conditions make emission controls in ZZ more effective for PM2.5 and PM10 but lead to higher increases in DM8H O3. These results suggest that control of PPM emissions in ZZ is the most effective in reducing PM2.5 and PM10. However, reductions of precursor gaseous in ZZ and the six neighboring cities alone are not effective in reducing the secondary PM components and most likely lead to increases in DM8H O3. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality model; Emission reduction; O3 isopleth; PM2.5; WRF-CMAQ","Air quality; Ammonia; Emission control; Molar ratio; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur dioxide; Community multi-scale air qualities; Control measures; Emission reduction; Ethnic minorities; High resolution; Ion concentrations; Local emissions; Particulate Matter; Quality control; ammonia; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; megacity; ozone; particulate matter; pollution incidence; air pollution control; Article; China; city; concentration (parameter); controlled study; meteorology; molecular stability; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; reduction (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097131306

Coupled with the increasingly serious hazards of pollutants emitted by transportation, an important strategic goal for the development of China's transportation industry has been set for energy conservation and emission reduction. Vehicle-road collaboration technology is a cutting-edge technology in the field of intelligent transportation, which can guide drivers in ecological driving strictly in accordance with the actual traffic environment in which the vehicle is located. Therefore, researchers are paying more and more attention to how to reduce vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. Signalized intersection as an important node in urban roads needs to be studied. However, the focus of its research so far is on bicycles, and most researchers are indifferent to the situation in which vehicles are likely to run together within the intersection. In addition, when establishing an eco-driving model, most researchers will still focus on how to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction only from the perspective of reducing the number of parking times, and do not care about the essential attributes of fuel consumption. As a result, it is difficult for us to better control and quantify the overall implementation effect of the model. Based on this, it is very important to actively establish a corresponding fleet ecological driving model based on the fleet within the signalized intersection in the vehicle-road collaborative environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Emission control; Energy conservation; Fleet operations; Fuels; Roads and streets; Collaboration technology; Collaborative environments; Cooperative environment; Cutting edge technology; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Intelligent transportation; Signalized intersection; Transportation industry; Road vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101715740

Biogas plants should also contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. However, developments in numbers of biogas plants and management varied in individual countries and regions. In order to illustrate these different developments, the legal framework conditions for three countries (Switzerland, Germany and Austria) are discussed and linked to the findings gathered by biogas working groups active in the regions. The working groups collected data in order to create benchmarks for the biogas plant operators. Based on these, plant operators can obtain important information for the further development of their business. Comparison of the selected regions shows that the legal framework conditions influenced the structure of the biogas sector as well as the plants’ technical performance indicators. At the same time, the biogas plants’ operation mode also reflects regional structures and historical developments. Further evolvement of the biogas sector does not only concern operators. If further development is stalled due to the legal framework conditions in place, green power production from biogas plants is expected to decline in the mid-term. Subsequently, this means a decreasing share of renewable energy sources, which in turn counteracts climate protection targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Biogas production; Regional comparison","Renewable energy resources; Biogas production; Climate protection; Historical development; Legal frameworks; Regional structure; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Technical performance; Biogas; alternative energy; biogas; carbon emission; comparative study; emission control; energy resource; legislation; parameter estimation; power plant; Austria; Germany; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091572078

Days before the atmospheric waves developed in the United States, three western Pacific tropical cyclones (typhoons) underwent an extratropical transition over Korea within an unprecedentedly short span of 12 days. Using a climate diagnostic approach and historical forecast data, it was found that the amplitude of the atmospheric waves accompanying the western U.S. fire weather would not have been so profound if not for the influence of these typhoons. Together, the recurving typhoons provided a significant source of wave activity flux directed toward North America – amplifying the ridge over the U.S. west coast while deepening the trough in central Canada. This anomalous circulation produced the severe frontal system that caused extreme winds in western Oregon, Washington and California – rapidly spreading fire. © 2020.

In addition to mitigating climate change, the Gujarat Solar Park boasts female empowerment through social development schemes. This manuscript is inspired by the following research question: To what extent are ‘gender positive’ processes and projects associated with solar development in India realized on the ground? Utilizing mixed methods fieldwork and drawing on literature from feminist political ecology, this paper demonstrates how the modalities of solar park development represent an antinomy of a nature-society relation. New configurations of labor under the political economy of solar have produced a gendered surplus population of landless peasants who are not absorbed into wage-labor employment in the solar park. Further, associated social development schemes actually disempower women, despite mandates of ‘gender positive’ outcomes by UN-based climate treaties to which this project is beholden. The opportunity to participate in one such scheme for female empowerment was reserved for only women of middle-to-high class status and those of dominant castes, thereby reproducing class and caste-based social power asymmetries. Female (dis)empowerment eclipses ‘gender positive’ guarantees of the solar park. This study highlights some unintended consequences of sustainable energy transitions in the Global South at the local scale.

Climate change adaptation in India and Bangladesh evolves using powering and puzzling approaches by policy actors. We seek to answer the question: how do powering and puzzling approaches influence the climate change adaptation policy design and implementation processes in Bangladesh and India? We adopted two strategies to collect and analyze data: semi-structured interviews and discourse analysis. We found that adaptation policymaking is largely top-down, amenable to techno-managerial solutions, and not inclusive of marginalized actors. In Bangladesh, power interplays among ministerial agencies impair the policy implementation process and undermine the success of puzzling. Local-scale agencies do not have enough authority or power to influence the overall implementation processes occurring at higher scales of governance. The powering of different actors in Bangladesh is visible through a duality of mandates and a lack of integration of climate adaptation strategies in different government ministries. The powering aspect of India’s various adaptation policies is the lack of collective puzzling around the question of differentiated vulnerability by axes of social difference. Paradoxically, India has a puzzling approach of hiding behind the poor in international negotiations. Moving forward, both countries should strive to have more inclusive and equitable adaptation policymaking processes that enable the participation of marginalized populations and represent their anxieties and aspirations. Identifying policy-relevant insights from South Asia using the powering and puzzling approaches can foster adaptation policy processes that facilitate empowerment, the missing piece of the adaptation policymaking puzzle. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bangladesh; Climate change adaptation; India; Powering; Puzzling; South Asia","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; environmental policy; governance approach; marginalization; participatory approach; policy implementation; policy making; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; vulnerability; Bangladesh; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082680582

Bioarchaeological investigation of the Namu burial ground (circa 750–300 BP) on the island of Taumako (southeast Solomon Islands) provides a direct means of understanding prehistoric life on a Polynesian Outlier in the south western Pacific. We investigate infant and childhood (0–10 years) feeding behavior in prehistoric Taumako by creating δ13Ccollagen, δ15Ncollagen, and δ13Ccarbonate profiles from 20 individuals using horizontal dentin sections of permanent first molars. The high-resolution data created using novel sample preparation offers insight into childhood diet in the absence of documentary evidence, incrementally sampling δ13Ccollagen and δ15Ncollagen but also expanding on the method to provide carbonate data from the same sequential dentin samples. The individuals who died in adolescence have significantly lower δ15Ncollagen values in early life than those who died in adulthood, which may suggest a link between diet, nutritional health, and morbidity. There were no significant differences in isotope values between social status groups, suggesting shared childhood experiences regarding types of foods consumed. Longitudinal assessment of δ13Ccollagen and δ15Ncollagen shows a strong relationship between the two values, likely a result of the typical tropical Pacific diet consisting largely of high protein marine foods that overshadows low protein terrestrial foods. This highlights the utility of δ13Ccarbonate in order to more effectively investigate consumption of low protein foodtypes in this region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Nitrogen; Polynesia; Tropical Pacific","archaeological evidence; archaeology; carbon isotope; child; dentition; feeding behavior; human evolution; human settlement; morbidity; mortality; nitrogen isotope; nutrition; nutritional status; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097896656

Chronic and subchronic inhalation exposure studies were retrieved during the hazard identification phase of the study. These studies were then used to obtain a guidance value (BMCh, expressed as a lognormal distribution with geometric mean ± geometric standard deviation = 10.0 ± 4.2 µg/m3 ) for occupational inhalation exposure to CNTs. An exposure scenario was selected from the scientific literature: three different work events (WEs) related to the production of conductive films were considered: (WE1) manufacturing of single walled carbon nanotubes films during normal operation using local exhaust ventilation (LEV); (WE2) manufacturing of SWCNT film without LEV; and (WE3) cleaning of one of the reactors. For each WE, a probability distribution function was applied, considering exposure expressed as mass concentration, as derived from three different measurement techniques. The ratio of the exposure and the BMCh distributions (i.e., the risk characterization ratio—RCR) was used to calculate the probability of occurrence of a relevant occupational risk. All the considered WEs indicated the presence of a risk (i.e., RCR distributions ≥ 1); however, only WE2 resulted in a statistically significant level of risk. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, this study aimed to assess how various background variables and values associate with farmers’ views in order to have novel and comprehensive on farmers’ perspectives on climate change. Short-term changes in views were studied with a longitudinal framework. In total, 4401 farmers in Finland answered a standardized e-mail survey in spring 2018. A total of 2000 of them responded again in spring 2020. The respondents differed in gender, age, education, farming system, farm type, farm organization, farm size, revenue and region. The farmers were not a uniform group of citizens, and their views on climate change varied widely. For a Nordic, boreal zone country like Finland, climate change will bring not only challenges but also opportunities that may even strengthen the agricultural production. Such a “two-sided coin” causes confusion for farmers as indicated by this study. Climate change–induced risks often dominate the public dialogue with farmers. This study emphasizes the need for better balance between risks and opportunities not only in the dialogue with farmers but also with policy makers and all public discussion. Acknowledging farmers’ views in planning the future climate policies for agricultural sector is elemental to ensure success in farm-scale implementation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climate change; Farmer; Finland; Longitudinal survey; View","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Public risks; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Farming system; Future climate; Longitudinal study; Mail surveys; Policy makers; Policy measures; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural production; agroindustry; climate change; longitudinal gradient; perception; policy implementation; policy making; spatiotemporal analysis; Finland; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101420054

A computationally effective longitudinal model is first developed, starting from an available energetic macroscopic representation modeling tool. The resulting simplified railcar model was first integrated with a battery state of charge simulator and then embedded within a fast constrained optimization algorithm. The optimization outcomes, reachable within reasonable timeframe and considering cost-effective hybridization scenarios, are highly informative for train manufacturers and operators interested in substantial hybridization of railcars. Particularly, fuel savings as high as 18% can be achieved with respect to the current diesel-powered trains. As a consequence, useful design and control guidelines are made available, considering both retrofitting or replacing the existing railway systems (particularly focusing on regional trains), while coping with capital and operating costs, safety, and traffic constraints. © IMechE 2020.","degree of hybridization; dynamic programming; energetic macroscopic representation; energy management; railcar hybridization; Train transportation","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Constrained optimization; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Operating costs; Rail motor cars; Railroad transportation; Secondary batteries; Battery state of charge; Capital and operating costs; Design and control; Energetic macroscopic representations; Energy saving potential; Grid-independent; Longitudinal models; Optimization analysis; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084202935

The mechanisms by which a microbial community maintain its overall function, for example, the cycling of carbon, when exposed to a stressor, can be explored by considering three concepts: biotic interactions, functional adaptations, and community structure. Interactions between species are traditionally considered as, e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or neutral but are here broadly defined as either coexistence or competition, while functions relate to their metabolism (e.g., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and roles in ecosystem functioning (e.g., oxygen production, organic matter degradation). The term structure here align with species richness and diversity, where a more diverse community is though to exhibit a broader functional capacity than a less diverse community. These concepts have here been combined with ecological theories commonly used in resilience studies, i.e., adaptive cycles, panarchy, and cross-scale resilience, that describe how the status and behavior at one trophic level impact that of surrounding levels. This allows us to explore the resilience of a marine microbial community, cultivated in an outdoor photobioreactor, when exposed to a naturally occurring seasonal stress. The culture was monitored for 6weeks during which it was exposed to two different temperature regimes (21 ± 2 and 11 ± 1°C). Samples were taken for metatranscriptomic analysis, in order to assess the regulation of carbon uptake and utilization, and for amplicon (18S and 16S rRNA gene) sequencing, to characterize the community structure of both autotrophs (dominated by the green microalgae Mychonastes) and heterotrophs (associated bacterioplankton). Differential gene expression analyses suggested that community function at warm temperatures was based on concomitant utilization of inorganic and organic carbon assigned to autotrophs and heterotrophs, while at colder temperatures, the uptake of organic carbon was performed primarily by autotrophs. Upon the shift from high to low temperature, community interactions shifted from coexistence to competition for organic carbon. Network analysis indicated that the community structure showed opposite trends for autotrophs and heterotrophs in having either high or low diversity. Despite an abrupt change of temperature, the microbial community as a whole responded in a way that maintained the overall level of diversity and function within and across autotrophic and heterotrophic levels. This is in line with cross-scale resilience theory describing how ecosystems may balance functional overlaps within and functional redundancy between levels in order to be resilient to environmental change (such as temperature). © Copyright © 2021 Sörenson, Capo, Farnelid, Lindehoff and Legrand.","adaptive cycles; bacteria; coexistence; community; competition; interactions; microalgae; resilience","glutathione; ketone body; organic carbon; RNA 16S; Article; Betaproteobacteria; biomass; climate change; cycling; environmental factor; gene expression; glycolysis; low temperature; microalga; microbial community; mixotroph; network analysis; nonhuman; photosynthesis; protein protein interaction; Proteobacteria; Rhizobiales; solar radiation; taxonomy; temperature stress; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101699588

The Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA), which has undergone a fast increase in vehicle population and has an advantageous geographical location, was selected as the study area. Vehicle emissions estimated based on the COPERT IV model in this area changed greatly between 1999 and 2015, during which time the emissions of NOx, CO2, and NH3 increased markedly. Passenger cars and light‐duty vehicles were the main contributors to pollutants CO and non‐methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emissions. Heavy‐duty trucks and buses were the important contributors to pollutants NOx, PM2.5, and PM10. Passenger cars were the major contributors to CO2, CH4, N2O, NH3, and SO2. The city with the most emissions is Zhengzhou, followed by Luoyang, Shangqiu, and Zhoukou. The spatial distribution of vehicle emissions has formed around or tended to concentrate in urban centers. Then, this study also predicts the vehicle emissions from 2015 to 2025 and designs ten policy scenarios for the prevention and control of emissions to evaluate the emission reduction effect. The radical integrated scenario was most effective for controlling CO, NMVOC, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, CO2, N2O, and NH3 emissions than any one scenario by itself. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, it is critical to quantify the elasticities of altering built environment configurations. To address this issue, we have built nationwide spatial autoregressive models to differentiate between localized and spillover effects across 325 Chinese cities in the years of 2005 and 2015. Our results indicate that a 1% increase in built-up areas’ size, compactness, and isolation is associated with increases of 0.35%, −0.14%, and 0.13%, respectively, in adjacent traffic CO2 emissions. The underlying reason is that the spatial configurations of built environment do not only systemically affect the probability, frequency, speed, and distance of intracity motorised travels, but also have impacts on the intercity transboundary mobility of motor vehicles. In addition, the built-up areas’ compactness effect has an antagonistic relation with the per capita GDP effect. Thus, our findings provide evidence that the built environment configuration-related measures can benefit traffic CO2 emission reductions in adjacent cities. It is therefore necessary for policymakers to make a traffic CO2 mitigation strategy at the city agglomeration level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment configurations; Spatial autoregressive model; Traffic CO2 emission","Elasticity; Emission control; Auto regressive models; Built environment; Built-up areas; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 mitigation; Mainland chinas; Spatial configuration; Spillover effects; Carbon dioxide; agglomeration; carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental economics; environmental planning; Gross Domestic Product; regulatory approach; spillover effect; traffic emission; traffic management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097090037

It argues that the latest dominant governance discourse tying mangroves to blue carbon signifies a departure from catering to coastal people's interests and rights in mangroves. We describe the evolving discourses that have shaped mangrove use and conservation in the Philippines since the 1970s. While the mid-century preoccupation with mangrove conversion to fish farms gradually gave way to the pursuit of community-based mangrove conservation in the late 1980s and 1990s, recent experiences suggest a comparably weakened focus towards recognizing local access and use patterns. We contend that the present blue carbon framing of mangroves, which harbours technocratic and financialized ideals of sustainability, poses a fundamental disadvantage to local users of mangroves. We conclude by reflecting on ways to redress this trend via a new framing of mangroves. © 2021 The Authors","Aquaculture; Blue economy; Climage change; Coastal governance; Framing; Small-scale fisheries","artisanal fishery; climate change; climate effect; governance approach; local government; mangrove; rural economy; rural policy; sustainability; Philippines; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100110148

In spite of its numerous benefits, commuters are still skeptic about adopting it as a routine choice for transportation. This study attempts to map commuters’ attitude towards carpooling services. The study has focused on a few motivational constructs that can have an influence on commuters’ behavior. The study has looked at the role of cognitive complexity and empowerment perceptions of commuters to check if these constructs significantly intervene in the behavioral outcomes. The methodology used is a scenario-based 2 × 2 survey design where the sample is an individual who has experience with carpooling. The survey has used two levels (high, low) each of cognitive complexity and psychological empowerment to give rise to four scenarios. The final sample consisted of 400 carpoolers selected from an IT park having more than 5000 employees. MANOVA analysis showed that cognitive complexity and psychological empowerment had significant influence on the motivational constructs used in the study. Value beliefs, safety and platform quality perceptions were found to have a direct impact on attitude formation and intention to engage in carpooling behavior. The findings offer many implications for managers in the sense that that they can focus on creating suitable communication that creates favorable perceptions towards carpooling to bring about better adoption intentions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Behaviour; Carpooling; Cognitive complexity; Collaborative consumption; Psychological empowerment; Sustainability","Surveys; Traffic congestion; Adoption intention; Attitude formation; Behavioral outcomes; Cognitive complexity; Empirical investigation; Environmental-friendly; Psychological empowerments; Quality perceptions; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100035171

ADRs are anticipated by routinely screening drugs against secondary pharmacology protein panels. However, there is still a lack of quantitative information on the links between these off-target proteins and the reporting of ADRs in humans. Here, we present a systematic analysis of associations between measured and predicted in vitro bioactivities of drugs and adverse events (AEs) in humans from two sources of data: the Side Effect Resource, derived from clinical trials, and the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, derived from postmarketing surveillance. The ratio of a drug's therapeutic unbound plasma concentration over the drug's in vitro potency against a given protein was used to select proteins most likely to be relevant to in vivo effects. In examining individual target bioactivities as predictors of AEs, we found a trade-off between the positive predictive value and the fraction of drugs with AEs that can be detected. However, considering sets of multiple targets for the same AE can help identify a greater fraction of AE-associated drugs.

The environmental impact that can be calculated by LCA is very diverse, approximately 18 impacts, which called midpoint impact. The most commonly calculated impact is GWP, which is derived from GHG emissions. In Indonesia LCA began to develop and be used by govermnet or industry to calculate impact from their activities especially production of product. One of the industry that use LCA is palm oil industry. Indonesia palm oil is criticsm from both domestic and international level because of the environmental impact and unsustainable. However, production of biodiesel from CPO in Indonesia can reduced emission is 47 % if we compare to diesel fuel. Even though the source of the energy is considered as carbon neutral, the production path can emit various environmentally hazardous gasses. Scientific approach through Life Cycle Assessment can be used as a tool to assess this issue. Number of LCA study on Indonesian biodiesel production come up with different result. This difference could be due to data inconsistency and did not present the actual condition found in the field. According to those aforementioned situations, an effort to address this issue should be conducted by identifying and presenting actual condition of Indonesian palm oil estate.

In this paper, we utilize a spatially explicit costing model to evaluate how regional biophysical factors and geography affect BECCS viability. We find that the cost of biomass provision and CO2 transport and storage are an average of $20/t-CO2 and $16/t-CO2 for aquatic and terrestrial BECCS, respectively. Assuming rapid technological development in the CO2 capture domain, this corresponds to 40–72% of land area in the conterminous United States exhibiting systems integration costs compatible with 2030 carbon prices (median $90/t-CO2). Results are strongly influenced by the cost of geologic sequestration, in particular storage quality (as driven by depth, permeability, etc.) and available capacity, rather than simply proximity to nearby CO2 sources. For this reason, the Southeast presents appealing BECCS readiness owing to high biomass productivity (several counties with yield &gt;100 000 dry ton of biomass per year) interspersed with well-explored sinks with large sequestration potential and optimal reservoir quality with permeability &gt;500 mD. We also find that geologic storage capacity is unlikely to be a major biophysical constraint, as sink utilization in most states would likely remain below 10% at the projected rates of BECCS deployment to achieve the 2 °C target and as low as 1% in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. The analysis also reveals subtle secondary outcomes; for example, to what extent different regions may be well poised to adopt different, complementary negative emissions technologies based on specific confluences of circumstances. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Available capacity; Biomass productivity; Biophysical factors; Geologic sequestrations; Spatially explicit; Storage infrastructure; Systems integration; Technological development; Costs; bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; cost analysis; infrastructure; technological development; United States; Alabama",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096857158

The phosphor samples are prepared via solid state reaction method in a programmable furnace at 1523 K. The phosphor samples are structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The EDS analyses show the presence of the desired elements used in the synthesis. The vibrational structures of the phosphor samples are studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique. The diffuse reflectance spectra show a number of bands in the UV–vis–NIR regions due to Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions. The optical band gap (Eg) is calculated using Wood and Tauc relation and its values are found to be 3.61, 3.20 and 3.32 eV for the Ho3+-Yb3+ co-doped ATiO3 (A = Ca, Ba &amp; Sr) perovskite phosphor samples, respectively. The upconversion emission spectra are monitored by exciting these phosphor samples at 980 nm. The phosphor samples give intense green emission in all the cases. However, the UC emission intensity is higher for the Ho3+-Yb3+ co-doped CaTiO3 perovskite phosphor. These phosphor samples also give intense green downshifting emission upon 419 and 452 nm excitations. The Ho3+-Yb3+ co-doped BaTiO3 perovskite produces relatively larger emission intensity among these phosphors. The lifetime of green emitting level (5F4) of Ho3+ ion shows temporal behavior of these perovskite phosphors. Furthermore, the temperature versus UC emission intensities of the green thermally coupled levels of Ho3+-Yb3+ co-doped BaTiO3 phosphor gives the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) and FIR-based relative (SR) and absolute (SA) temperature sensor sensitivities are obtained as 0.0034 K-1 and 0.0050 K-1, respectively at 305 K.

The research undertakes the microeconomic approach to estimate the technical availability and operational costs of woody biomass production with a higher level of precision than other models present in the literature, as it considers the entire supply chain of the sustainable management of natural forests. This study introduces a tool, which is applied to estimate supply curves and costs of wood biomass extraction from natural forests in the 7th Region of Chile. The simulation indicates that 531,015 tons/year of wood biomass is available in natural forests of the Region under study, with extraction costs ranging from 24.51 to 56.68 US$/ton, or an average total cost of 40.97 US$/ton. The parametric analysis revealed that the maximum admissible distance to the nearest transport route and the transportation costs are the two most influential variables in the estimation of wood biomass supply and cost. Reducing the admissible distance from 5 km to 1 km reduced the availability of biomass by 80%, while a variation of ±50% of transportation costs translated into ±18.3% variation of total extraction costs. The proposed method can be used to identify the technical-economic potential of wood biomass from natural forests in any commune, province, region, or country; as it has the flexibility to allow tests with multiple scenarios and parameters depending on the specific characteristics of the area to be analysed. Essentially, the purpose of this tool is to serve the assessment processes of the identification of new wood biomass resources, allowing decision makers to increase the potential of sustainable and cost-effective woody biomass for heat and electricity generation, and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the dependence on fossil fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chile; Heat and power generation; Renewable energy; Supply curve; Sustainability; Wood biomass","Biomass; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Decision making; Extraction; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Wood; Wood fuels; Assessment process; Economic potentials; Heat and electricity; Modelling and simulations; Parametric -analysis; Sustainable management; Transport routes; Transportation cost; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092778160

Central issues are the divisions of powers, responsibilities and the fiscal capacity and independence of local authorities within the respective countries’ multi-level policy and governance frameworks. In India, various functions have been constitutionally devolved to city governments to enable them to govern themselves, while more strategic ones lie at state level.

Weather-related disasters, such as wildfires exacerbated by a rise in global temperatures, need to be better studied in terms of their mental health impacts. This study focuses on the mental health sequelae of the deadliest wildfire in California to date, the Camp Fire of 2018. Methods. We investigated a sample of 725 California residents with different degrees of disaster exposure and measured mental health using clinically validated scales for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Data were collected at a chronic time-point, six months post-wildfire. We used multiple regression analyses to predict the mental health outcomes based on self-reported fire exposure. Additionally, we included vulnerability and resilience factors in hierarchical regression analyses. Results. Our pri-mary finding is that direct exposure to large scale fires significantly increased the risk for mental health disorders, particularly for PTSD and depression. Additionally, the inclusion of vulnerability and resilience factors in the hierarchical regression analyses led to the significantly improved pre-diction of all mental health outcomes. Childhood trauma and sleep disturbances exacerbated mental health symptoms. Notably, self-reported resilience had a positive effect on mental health, and mindfulness was associated with significantly lower depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion. Overall, our study demonstrated that climate-related extreme events, such as wildfires, can have severe mental illness sequelae. Moreover, we found that pre-existing stressful life events, resilient personality traits and lifestyle factors can play an important role in the prevalence of psychopathol-ogy after such disasters.

Several techniques are being developed, namely the use of regenerative desiccant (e.g., MOFs) to water capture through adsorption processes. MIL-160(Al) belongs to the fumarate-based MOFs family, and it is one of the most promising MOFs for water harvesting and heat transformation applications. In this study, the potential of MIL-160(Al) as an adsorbent for water sorption based applications was evaluated. For this purpose, adsorption equilibrium isotherms, dynamic adsorption experiments, and MIL-160(Al) granules characterization were performed. H2O vapor adsorption equilibrium isotherm was studied at 303, 323, and 343 K presenting a type V shape and was fitted using the Cooperative Multimolecular Sorption model and Polanyi’s theory model. Additionally, CO2, N2, and O2 adsorption equilibrium isotherms were also measured but at 283, 303, and 323 K, presenting the following order of adsorption affinity: CO2 &gt; O2 &gt; N2. Water vapor adsorption breakthrough experiments corroborate the shape of the water adsorption equilibrium isotherms on MIL-160(Al). Water co-adsorption history proved that the presence of the other air components (CO2, O2, and N2) does not affect water adsorption behavior on MIL-160(Al). DRIFTS measurements proved the MIL-160(Al) structure remains stable during the water vapor exposure. The optimization of the TSA process allowed us to achieve maximum H2O productivity of 305 L·day−1·ton−1 for a regeneration temperature of 353 K and flow rate equal to 0.50 m3·s−1. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Air; MIL-160(Al); Optimization; TSA; Water","Adsorption isotherms; Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide; Driers (materials); Potable water; Runoff; Water conservation; Water vapor; Adsorption affinity; Adsorption equilibrium isotherms; Adsorption process; Dynamic adsorption; Heat transformations; Regeneration temperature; Safe drinking water; Water vapor adsorption; Gas adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098870102

Researchers have drawn their attention to microalgae, photosynthetic microorganisms known for their environmental applications, such as wastewater remediation and lipids accumulation, to produce third-generation biofuels to solve some of these major issues. Considering this dual role, this study evaluated the potential of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris on nutrient removal from a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. Firstly, experiments were performed to assess the potential of this microalga to: (i) successfully grow in different concentrations of a paper industry effluent (20% to 100%); and (ii) treat the industrial effluent, reducing phosphorus concentrations to values below the accepted legal limits. Then, a techno-economic assessment was performed to study the viability of a C. vulgaris biorefinery targeting the remediation of a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. The results have shown that C. vulgaris was able to successfully grow and treat the paper industry effluent. Under these conditions, average biomass productivities determined for this microalga ranged between 15.5 ± 0.5 and 26 ± 1 mg dry weight (DW) L−1 d−1, with maximum biomass concentrations reaching values between 337 ± 9 and 495 ± 25 mg DW L−1 d−1. Moreover, final phosphorus concentrations ranged between 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.5 ± 0.3 mg P L−1, values below the legal limits imposed by the Portuguese Environment Agency on the paper industry. Regarding the proposal of a microalgal biorefinery for the bioremediation of paper industry effluents with bioenergy production, the techno-economic study demonstrated that six of the seven studied scenarios resulted in an economically-viable infrastructure. The highest net present value (15.4 million euros) and lowest discounted payback period (13 years) were determined for Scenario 3, which assumed a photosynthetic efficiency of 3%, a lipids extraction efficiency of 75%, and an anaerobic digestion efficiency of 45%. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that besides being economically viable, the proposed biorefinery presents several environmental benefits: (i) the remediation of an industrial effluent; (ii) CO2 uptake for microalgal growth, which contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions; (iii) production of clean and renewable energy; (iv) soil regeneration; and (v) promotion of a circular economy. © 2021 by the authors.

While some evidence also suggests potential synergies between regulating and material contributions of regenerating forests to people, the ecological mechanisms of multiple synergies remain poorly understood. We assess tradeoffs and synergies by testing for cascading effects of tropical dry forest age and vegetation drivers on key ecosystem properties that underpin multiple regulating, material and non-material contributions to people. To do so we first compiled published evidence to propose a conceptual framework of the causal dependence among variables. Then, we tested which direct or indirect effects of this a priori conceptual model are supported by structural equation models of measured data from a chronosequence of secondary tropical dry forest plots. We tested whether individual density, taxonomic or functional diversity, community-weighted mean in wood specific gravity, or composition of the woody vegetation best explained synergies or tradeoffs among multiple key ecosystem properties. We show a synergistic, positive effect of observed woody species richness on all four key ecosystem properties, including total basal area, litter layer carbon stocks, soil penetration resistance and availability and versatility of socioeconomically useful plants. A similar synergistic effect of linear age-dependent changes in species composition suggests that the simultaneous recovery of multiple functions is not only driven by absolute woody species accrual, but also by temporal woody species turnover as secondary succession proceeds. However, local farmers reported uses of only a small fraction of available plant biodiversity that has previously been documented in the literature to be socioeconomically useful. In synthesis, we found that observed woody species richness and successional turnover along tropical dry forest regeneration are synergistic drivers of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the availability and versatility of currently underutilized plant products in Western Mexico. Such observed synergy between a range of key regulating, material and non-material contributions to people highlights untapped socioecological potential for multifunctional tropical forest restoration through sustainable use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity – Ecosystem Functioning relationship (BEF); Conservation by sustainable use; Ecosystem Services bundles; Improved fallow management; Multipurpose Tree and Shrub (MPTS) species; Nature's Contributions to People (NCP); Passive tropical forest restoration; Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)","Agricultural robots; Behavioral research; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Density (specific gravity); Digital storage; Ecosystems; Secondary recovery; Tropics; Vegetation; Water resources; Conceptual frameworks; Ecological mechanisms; Ecosystem functioning; Functional diversity; Secondary tropical forests; Soil penetration resistance; Structural equation models; Wood specific gravities; Reforestation; biodiversity; chronosequence; conceptual framework; dry forest; secondary succession; species richness; trade-off; tropical forest; woody plant; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Ecosystems; Plants; Tropics; Mexico [North America]; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099222489

Due to the ongoing development and expansion of Bangkok, urbanization has continued to expand into adjacent provinces, creating the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). Continuous monitoring of human mobility in BMR aids in public transport planning and design, and efficient performance assessment. The purpose of this study is to design and develop a process to derive human mobility patterns from the real movement of people who use both fixed-route and non-fixed-route public transport modes, including taxis, vans, and electric rail. Taxi GPS open data were collected by the Intelligent Traffic Information Center Foundation (iTIC) from all GPS-equipped taxis of one opera-tor in BMR. GPS probe data of all operating GPS-equipped vans were collected by the Ministry of Transport’s Department of Land Transport for daily speed and driving behavior monitoring. Fi-nally, the ridership data of all electric rail lines were collected from smartcards by the Automated Fare Collection (AFC). None of the previous works on human mobility extraction from multi-sourced big data have used van data; therefore, it is a challenge to use this data with other sources in the study of human mobility. Each public transport mode has traveling characteristics unique to its passengers and, therefore, specific analytical tools. Firstly, the taxi trip extraction process was developed using Hadoop Hive to process a large quantity of data spanning a one-month period to derive the origin and destination (OD) of each trip. Secondly, for van data, a Java program was used to construct the ODs of van trips. Thirdly, another Java program was used to create the ODs of the electric rail lines. All OD locations of these three modes were aggregated into transportation analysis zones (TAZ). The major taxi trip destinations were found to be international airports and provincial bus terminals. The significant trip destinations of vans were provincial bus terminals in Bangkok, electric rail stations, and the industrial estates in other provinces of BMR. In contrast, electric rail destinations were electric rail line interchange stations, the central business district (CBD), and commercial office areas. Therefore, these significant destinations of taxis and vans should be considered in electric rail planning to reduce the air pollution from gasoline vehicles (taxis and vans). Using the designed procedures, the up-to-date dataset of public transport can be pro-cessed to derive a time series of human mobility as an input into continuous and sustainable public transport planning and performance assessment. Based on the results of the study, the procedures can benefit other cities in Thailand and other countries. © 2021 by the authors.

This study compared the change of elemental concentrations during the autumn and winter of 2016 and 2017, and analyzed the environmental and health benefits of the coal banning policy. Result showed that compared to 2016, the reduction rate of atmospheric particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in 2017 was as high as 63.5% (p &lt; 0.01), and that of the total elements in PM2.5 was up to 43% (p &lt; 0.01). Coal consumption, transportation, industry, soil dust, and fuel consumption were the main sources of these elements in BTH. Coal consumption and industry accounted for 5.8–26.2% and 6.5–31.3%, respectively, of the total elements. After the coal banning area was established, the elements from coal consumption were reduced by 13.5–60.3% (the background station was reduced by 19.6%, p &lt; 0.05), and those from industrial sources were reduced by 11–80.1%.

Because of the energy-intensive extraction processes, in situ oil sands operations also play a critical role in meeting the global carbon budget. The steam oil ratio (SOR) is an indicator used to measure energy efficiency and assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the in situ oil sands industry. A low SOR indicates an extraction process that is more energy efficient and less carbon intensive. In this study, we applied machine learning methods for data-driven discovery to a public database⁠, Petrinex⁠, containing operating data from 2015 to 2019 extracted from over 35 million records for 20 in situ oil sands extraction operations. Two unsupervised machine learning methods, including clustering and association rules, showed that the cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) recovery method was less efficient than the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) recovery method. Chi-square tests showed a statistically significant association between the CSS recovery method and high SOR (p <0.005). Two association rules suggested that the occurrence of non-condensable gas (NCG) co-injection pro-duced a low SOR. Chi-square tests on the two rules identified a statistically significant relationship between gas co-injection and low SOR (p < 0.005). Association rules also indicated that there was no association between the production regions and SORs. For future in situ oil sands development, decision-makers should consider SAGD as the preferred method because it is less carbon intensive. Existing in situ oil sands projects and future development should explore the possibility of NCG co-injection with steam to reduce steam consumption and consequently reduce GHG emissions from the extraction processes. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to sluggish kinetics and adsorption linear scaling relations, GERs showcase unfavorable activity, selectivity, and stability, impeding their scale-up application. Over the past few years, tremendous efforts have been made to boost electrocatalyst performance via imposing strain engineering on the linear scaling relations breakup and introducing strain engineered interface to accelerate kinetics. In this review, we summarize the fundamentals and applications of strain engineering-based strategies for boosting electrocatalytic performance in typical GERs. In detailed, the fundamentals of GERs, strain engineering, and linear scaling relations are firstly provided. Furthermore, the impacts of strain engineering on the breaks of linear scaling relations and the corresponding process control mechanism are presented. Moreover, the strain strategies and its application for the individual GERs are highlighted. Additionally, apart from polishing the performance of intrinsic active sites, the progress of gas mass diffusion and charge transfer enhanced by constructing superhydrophobiciltiy/superaerophilicity solid/liquid/gas interfaces, is also needed to be presented. Finally, we discuss guidelines for future opportunities and challenges of strain engineering for boosting electrocatalytic performance. Collectively, we hope that this review will offer a fine control strategy for electrocatalytic performance and clearly illustrate the in-depth mechanism for the catalytic process under the role of strain engineering. Furthermore, many anticipations of such inspirations could extend to synchronized control of multistep elementary competitive reaction in the sustainable production of emerging clean energy and environmental remediation communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097797059

The overall exposure of the population also depends, however, on indoor air quality and human mobility and activities. Here, by integrating real-time mobility data and a questionnaire survey on time-activity patterns during the pandemic, we show that despite a decrease in ambient PM2.5 during the quarantine, the total population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 considering both indoor and outdoor environments increased by 5.7 μg m−3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2–11.0 μg m−3). The increase in population-weighted exposure was mainly driven by a nationwide urban-to-rural population migration before the Spring Festival coupled with the freezing of the migration backward due to the quarantine, which increased household energy consumption and the fraction of people exposed to rural household air pollution indoors. Our analysis reveals an increased inequality of air pollution exposure during the quarantine and highlights the importance of household air pollution for population health in China. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"air pollution; China; environmental exposure; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; quarantine; time factor; travel; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; China; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Particulate Matter; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Time Factors; Travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098798799

The network runs on natural gas boilers and geothermal exchange. However, the City plans to transition to low-carbon energy sources and envisions the DEN as a key development in reaching its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction targets in the building sector. Harvesting and utilizing waste heat from industrial sites using a mobile thermal energy storage (M-TES) is one of the attractive alternative energy sources that Surrey is considering. In this study, a techno-economic analysis (TEA) was conducted to determine the energy storage density (ESD) of the proposed M-TES technology, costs, and the emission reduction potential of integrating waste heat into Surrey’s DEN. Three transportation methods were considered to determine the most cost-effective and low-carbon option(s) to transfer heat from industrial waste heat locations at various distances (15 km, 30 km, 45 km) to district energy networks, including: (i) a diesel truck; (ii) a renewable natural gas-powered (RNG) truck, and (iii) an electric truck. To evaluate the effectiveness of M-TES, the cost of emission reduction ($/tCO2e avoided) is compared with business as usual (BAU), which is using a natural gas boiler only. Another comparison was made with other low carbon energy sources that the city is considering, such as RNG/biomass boiler, sewer heat recovery, electric boiler, and solar thermal. The minimum system-level ESD required to makes M-TES competitive when compared to other low carbon energy sources was 0.4 MJ/kg. © 2021 by the authors.

The simulator uses a hybrid finite element–finite volume (FEFVM) simulation framework, integrating an asynchronous local time stepping method for multi-phase multi-component transport and a novel non-iterative flash calculation approach for the phase equilibrium. The benchmark investigates four standard CO2 storage test cases that are widely used to assess the performance of simulation tools for carbon geo-sequestration: (A) radial flow from a CO2 injection well; (B) CO2 discharge along a fault zone; (C) CO2 injection into a layered brine formation; and (D) leakage through an abandoned well. For these applications, ACGSS gives results similar to well-established compositional simulators. Minor discrepancies can be rationalised in terms of the alternative, spatially adaptive discretisation and the treatment of NaCl solubility. While these benchmarks cover issues related to compositional simulation, they do not address the accurate representation of geologically challenging features of CO2 storage sites. An additional 3D application scenario of a complexly faulted storage site demonstrates the advantages of the FEFVM discretisation used in the ACGSS for resolving the geometric complexity of geologic storage sites. This example also highlights the significant computational benefits gained from the use of the asynchronous time marching scheme. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ACGSS; Asynchronous time marching; Benchmark; CO2 geo-sequestration; Unstructured grid","benchmarking; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; complexity; computer simulation; finite element method; finite volume method; fluid injection; prediction; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093867932

The aggregate production function framework is estimated by employing first/second generational panel co-integration-based models for the panel data covering the years 1980–2014. The empirical findings demonstrate a statistically significant panel error correction mechanism among real gross domestic product, capital, labor, and energy use in both export-added and export-excluded models. The findings of panel causality test depict a significant causal relationship running from export and energy use towards gross domestic product in the long run. Furthermore, a significant feedback relationship between energy use and gross domestic product and between exports and gross domestic product has been found in the short run. These findings of vector error correction model-based panel causality test imply that reducing/cutting the extant aggregate energy use (fossil fuel dominant) via conservation policies are somewhat wanting and could be implemented at the cost of lower gross domestic product and export growths, ceteris paribus. Therefore, for reducing the level of carbon emissions arising from fossil fuel-based energy use and for a sustainable aggregate energy use to the production sector per se, there is an immense need of developing environment friendly/green sources of energy in the region. These consolidated and concerted strides of developing and substituting environment friendly energy options into the extant aggregate energy use will, inter alia, ensure the sustainability of environment-gross domestic product growth in South Asia. © The Author(s) 2020.","energy conservation; Energy use; exports; gross domestic product growth; panel co-integration; vector error correction model-based panel causality","Aggregates; Economics; Energy conservation; Error correction; Fossil fuels; Integration; Energy use; exports; Gross domestic product growths; Panel causality; Panel co integrations; Sustainable development; carbon emission; cointegration analysis; economic growth; energy conservation; energy use; environmental economics; error correction; Gross Domestic Product; policy implementation; sustainability; sustainable development; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078225067

This study examines material use and CO2 emission patterns and intensities from 1971 to 2015 in a typical developing country, Pakistan, and investigates national-level and multi-country-level efficiency improvements using data envelopment analysis. The results are used to derive key policy insights for a sustainable economic transition with higher resource and carbon efficiencies. Results show that material intensity has reduced by 39.1% while CO2 intensity has risen by 21.5% in the country. Pakistan, when compared with its top 10 export countries, was relatively more material and CO2 intensive. National-level efficiency was found to be low in most of the periods due to material/energy intensive agriculture and industries, low value-added exports, etc. Insights from the national-level efficiency analysis indicate that surging CO2 intensities have started to decline since 2010 and the economy has greatly stabilized. Multi-country analysis revealed that the efficiency gap between Pakistan and its developed export countries (such as the United Kingdom and France) has widened during the study period. Insights from the multi-country analysis suggest that the economic growth and industrialization improves material and environmental efficiencies to some extent, yet these improvements are not equally distributed among all countries. As a way forward, integrated policies on sustainable resource consumption, carbon mitigation, and economic growth are necessary for accruing higher benefits from rising global trade and resource connectedness. © 2020 by Yale University","data envelopment analysis; developing countries; industrial ecology; material flow accounting; regional ecosystems; resource metabolism","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Developing countries; Efficiency; Sustainable development; Carbon efficiency; Carbon mitigation; Country analysis; Economic growths; Environmental efficiency; Level efficiencies; Sustainable economics; Sustainable resources; Industrial economics; carbon emission; developing world; economic growth; export; global trade; industrialization; metabolism; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; trade-environment relations; France; Pakistan; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089454622

The interface wettability, microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites were compared and investigated. Compared with the uncoated fiber-reinforced aluminum matrix composite, the microstructure analysis indicated that the coatings significantly improved the wettability and effectively inhibited the interface reaction between carbon fiber and aluminum matrix during the process. Under the same processing condition, aluminum melt was easy to infiltrate into the copper-coated fiber bundles. Furthermore, the inhibited interface reaction was more conducive to maintain the original strength of fiber and improve the fiber–matrix interface bonding performance. The mechanical properties were evaluated by uniaxial tensile test. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus of the copper-coated carbon fiber-reinforced aluminum matrix composite were about 124 MPa, 140 MPa and 82 GPa, respectively. In the case of nickel-coated carbon fiber-reinforced aluminum matrix composite, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus were about 60 MPa, 70 MPa and 79 GPa, respectively. The excellent mechanical properties for copper-coated fiber-reinforced composites are attributed to better compactness of the matrix and better fiber–matrix interface bonding, which favor the load transfer ability from aluminam matrix to carbon fiber under the loading state, giving full play to the bearing role of carbon fiber. © 2021 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China","Cf/Al composite; carbon fiber; coating; mechanical properties; metal matrix composite; wettability","Aluminum metallurgy; Bonding; Composite coatings; Elastic moduli; Fiber bonding; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Interface states; Metallic matrix composites; Microstructure; Nickel coatings; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wetting; Yield stress; Carbon fiber reinforced; Fiber reinforced aluminum; Interface wettabilities; Microstructure analysis; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Nickel-coated carbon fiber; Ultimate tensile strength; Uniaxial tensile test; Aluminum coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100813876

This study highlights the importance of characterizing the total deposition rates of airborne particles (bulk atmospheric deposition) in the surroundings of an industrial area along the north cost of the Lazio Region in Italy, to deepen knowledge about the potential impact of emissions from the coal-fired thermoelectric (CTE) power plant and other possible sources existing in the surrounding area. Four sampling sites were identified, and the monitoring plan was performed a yearlong with monthly collecting observation. The deposition samples were collected monthly and processed for determining organic (polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins, PCDDs; polychlorinated dibenzofurans, PCDFs; dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, DL-PCBs; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) and inorganic (metals) substances. The samples were collected monthly and sent for chemical characterization. In Europe and Italy, no reference values have been given for the deposition rates of chemicals, while some European countries have determined reference/guide values to which the authors will refer in this study. Therefore, the analytical results show that the deposition rates for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs are lower with respects guide values defined by Germany and Belgium; PAHs values are in line with those measured in other rural-type sites, while for metals the analytical results show a situation between rural and urban area. The approach used in this study can help to identify reference values for Italy in deposition rates, with the aim both to characterize the dynamic of pollution in area with multiple risk factors and to describe and protect human health from environmental exposures caused by the contamination of the food chain. © 2021 by the authors.

Banana, oranges, shallot, chilies, and potatoes are among the main horticulture commodities for Indonesian. This study employed a multimarket model of partial equilibrium analysis to investigate the impact of global and environmental climate change on those Indonesia's five horticulture commodities 2019-2030. The study appraised the impact of climate change by looking at changes in the production and consumption in the national and household level, and net trade at national level. The study revealed that all scenarios show negative impact on national aggregate level of productions and consumptions, however those scenarios can be lower or higher at regional and household levels under climate change compared to a no-climate change scenario in the short and medium term. Import will increase, and all commodities will be as net imported. As an implication, types and characteristics of commodity and regions and households should be strongly considered in research, extension, and development program with improving adaptation and mitigation to climate change. With its unique characteristics, more comprehensive studies for these commodities are recommended.

To improve the plant productivity, a fraction of OFMSW digestate can be converted into a carbonaceous material, called hydrocar (HC), through Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC), and then composted together with the OFMSWdigestate itself, to produce “hydrochar co-compost”. The aim of this paper is to present the design and assembly of batch bioreactors, built in-house to investigate the co-composting process of OFMSWdigestate and its HC, and to provide some preliminary results. The OFMSWdigestate from an industrial plant was carbonized at 200 °C for 3 h in a 2 L HTC reactor, to produce wet HC after filtration. The ratio of OFMSWdigestate and green waste (1:1) used as bulking medium was reproduced in four bioreactors with an increasing percentage of HC substituting the OFMSW digestate (0, 25, 50, 75%). The bioreactors managed to effectively compost the solid wet biomasses in a wet environment with temperature and oxygen control, whilemeasuring online the oxygen consumption and thus the dynamic respirometric index (DRI). The DRI24,max measured with AIR-nl solid respirometer (standardized offline measurement) started from values above 800 mg O2 kgVS -1 h-1 before composting and dropped at the end of the process to values in the range 124-340 mg O2 kgVS -1 h-1 for the four mixes, well below the recommended limit of 500 mg O2 kgVS -1 h-1 for high-quality compost stability. These offline DRI values were confirmed by the online DRI measurements.

Recent studies have investigated the average transpiration fraction (T/ET) across sites and biomes, but the temporal variability of the partitioning and its controls are less understood. Here, we examine how water availability may regulate the seasonal to interannual variability of ET partitioning. To do this, we leveraged four partitioning techniques and long-term (14 years) eddy-flux records from a semiarid grassland and riparian woodland site in southeastern Arizona USA that share the same climate but differ in water table depth. T/ET was sensitive to changes in water availability over space and time as evidenced by consistently lower and more variable T/ET at the grassland, where the vegetation does not access groundwater. Seasonally, a pronounced dry foresummer T/ET depression at the rainfall-dependent grassland resulted in a bimodal T/ET distribution. In contrast, T/ET was unimodally distributed at the groundwater-dependent woodland, where high T/ET levels were maintained throughout both the dry and wet summer periods. Annual transpiration at both sites closely tracked water availability as quantified by ET, whereas abiotic evaporation was nearly constant. All ET partitioning methods yielded similar patterns of seasonal and interannual T/ET, although they differed by approximately 5 to 10% in magnitude. At both sites, transpiration was most closely correlated to plant metrics (photosynthesis, leaf area index) and ET, whereas evaporation was most correlated to surface moisture variables (soil moisture, precipitation).

In terms of political incentives, the European legislative is currently under revision. Most industrial recycling processes target valuable battery components, such as nickel and cobalt, but do not focus on lithium recovery. Especially in the context of reduced cobalt shares in the battery cathodes, it is important to investigate environmentally friendly and economic and robust recycling processes to ensure lithium mobilization. In this study, the method early-stage lithium recovery (“ESLR”) is studied in detail. Its concept comprises the shifting of lithium recovery to the beginning of the chemo-metallurgical part of the recycling process chain in comparison to the state-of-the-art. In detail, full NCM (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide)-based electric vehicle cells are thermally treated to recover heat-treated black mass. Then, the heat-treated black mass is subjected to an H2O-leaching step to examine the share of water-soluble lithium phases. This is compared to a carbonation treatment with supercritical CO2, where a higher extent of lithium from the heat-treated black mass can be transferred to an aqueous solution than just by H2O-leaching. Key influencing factors on the lithium yield are the filter cake purification, the lithium separation method, the solid/liquid ratio, the pyrolysis temperature and atmosphere, and the setup of autoclave carbonation, which can be performed in an H2Oenvironment or in a dry autoclave environment. The carbonation treatments in this study are reached by an autoclave reactor working with CO2 in a supercritical state. This enables selective leaching of lithium in H2O followed by a subsequent thermally induced precipitation as lithium carbonate. In this approach, treatment with supercritical CO2 in an autoclave reactor leads to lithium yields of up to 79%. © 2021 by the authors.

This was obtained by determining the environmental performance of 10 selected recycling technologies with varying TRL levels, using the chemical properties of the top 25 produced polymers in Europe. The results were collected in a life cycle assessment (LCA) ‘matrix’ model. To simulate realistic plastic recycling challenges, case studies of PE/PP foils from municipal waste and ABS plastic with brominated flame retardants were developed, to be used as an addition to the LCA matrix model results. Potential emission reduction was assessed by combining LCA matrix outcomes with European polymer demand data. The LCA matrix model illustrates that potential environmental performance of recycling technologies varied strongly per polymer type and did not always follow the state-of-the-art recycling hierarchy. Commodity plastics performed well with tertiary recycling technologies, such as gasification and pyrolysis to monomers; secondary mechanical recycling was outperformed. A focus on primary recycling is environmentally beneficial for most engineering and high performance plastics. To enhance the performance of primary recycling technologies, a higher purity and improved sorting is required. As demonstrated in the case studies, low sorting efficiencies due to impurities reduces positive environmental impacts. Hence, optimal environmental performance of recycling is obtained where pre-treatment (sorting, cleaning) is adapted to the recycling technology. According to the model, recycling the 15 most demanded polymers in Europe reduces CO2 emissions from plastics by 73% or 200 Mtonne CO2 eq. © 2020 The Author(s)","Circular economy; Environmental impact; Life Cycle Assessment; Plastics; Recycling; Waste hierarchy","ABS resins; Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Elastomers; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Flame retardants; Life cycle; Plastics; Plastics industry; Sorting; Brominated flame retardants; Commodity plastics; Environmental performance; High-performance plastics; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mechanical recycling; Recycling technology; Tertiary recycling; Plastic recycling; brominated flame retardant; carbon dioxide; flame retardant; plastic; polymer; unclassified drug; flame retardant; economic system; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; polymer; recycling; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; engineering; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; municipal waste; physical chemistry; plastic waste; priority journal; recycling; simulation; solid waste management; waste minimization; Europe; recycling; Europe; Europe; Flame Retardants; Plastics; Polymers; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098988677

Integrating them comprehensively into the energy system requires smart control strategies for the charging processes. In this paper we concentrate on charging processes at the end users home. From the perspective of an end user, optimizing of charging electric vehicles might strive for different targets: cost minimization of power purchase for the individual household or—as proposed more often recently—minimization of GHG emissions. These targets are sometimes competing and cannot generally be achieved at the same time as the results show. In this paper, we present approaches of considering these targets by controlling charging processes at the end users home. We investigate the influence of differently designed optimizing charging strategies for this purpose, considering the electrical purchase cost as well as the GHG emissions and compare them with the conventional uncontrolled charging strategy using the example of a representative household of a single family. Therefore, we assumed a detailed trip profile of such a household equipped with a local generation and storage system at the same time. We implemented the mentioned strategies and compare the results concerning effects on annual GHG emissions and annual energy purchase costs of the household. Regarding GHG emissions we apply a recently proposed approach by other authors based on hourly emission factors. We discuss the effectivity of this approach and derive, that there is hardly no real impact on actual GHG emissions in the overall system. As incorporating this GHG target into the objective function increases cost, we appraise such theoretical GHG target therefore counterproductive. In conclusion, we would thus like to appeal for dynamic electricity prices for decentralised energy systems, leading at the same time to cost efficient charging of electric vehicles unfolding clear incentives for end users, which is GHG friendly at the end. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper focuses on the simulation of the processes of timber harvesting by forest enterprises and the competition of heating plants for the limited resource of wood chips. In particular, the work identifies different stakeholders having an adaptive behavior—with respect to the overall market conditions and timber prices. The agent-based model developed here—called SimFoMa—uses three types of agents—forest enterprises, heating plants, and traders. The agents are interacting in an environment that has rich information on the forests and road network. The SimFoMa model is applied to a test area, the province of Carinthia, Austria. We defined six different simulation scenarios that cover different market situations—from increasing timber prices, volatile market conditions, or decreasing market conditions—and evaluated the harvest patterns, transport distances and the forest itself. The paper utilizes the agent-based modeling methodology to model the agent's adaptive behavior of the forest fuel supply chain and to model the competition of heating plants for forest fuels. To evaluate this phenomena we mainly analyze transport distances of the simulation runs. For the test area of Carinthia, the experiments show that the behavior of small forest owners influences the supply of forest fuels. Timber prices not meeting the expectations of small forest owners might not motivate them to produce timber and forest fuels. On the long run the overall forest fuel supply does not meet the demand in the test area Carinthia—hence it relies on biomass imports. Furthermore, we witnessed increasing transport distances from harvest site to heating plant. Recommendations for Resource Managers The results of the spatial Agent-based simulation of the forest fuel market with agents competing for the limited resource forest biomass show that transport distances for forest fuels can vary and may increase over time. Hence, the planning of the forest fuels supply and the respective transport distances is crucial to reduce the carbon footprint of the timber for heating purposes. As small forest owners produce timber on a more irregular basis (based on the price in the market), the motivation of small forest owners is crucial for the steady supply of biomass for heating purposes—for the case of Carinthia. In the long run it is not possible to fulfill the demand of biomass for heating purposes for Carinthia, without imports of timber. Again, crucial is the motivation of small forest owners to produce timber. © 2020 The Authors.

This first part focuses on the steam injecting and recovering aero engine (SIRA) concept. Exhaust heat generated steam is injected into the combustion chamber. By use of a condenser, installed behind the steam generator, the water is recovered from the exhaust gas-steam mixture. Both lead to a noticeable increase in specific power compared to a conventional gas turbine and, foremost, to a significant increase in thermodynamic efficiency. The proposed concept is expected to reduce fuel burn and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 15% and nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation can be almost completely avoided compared to state-of-The-Art engines of the same technology level. Moreover, the described concept has the potential to drastically reduce or even avoid the formation of condensation trails. Thus, the SIRA concept operated with sustainable aviation fuels offers the potential for climate-neutral aviation. Based on consistent thermodynamic descriptions, preliminary designs and initial performance studies, the potentials of the concepts are analyzed. Complementarily, a detailed discussion on concrete engineering solutions considers the implementation into aircraft.

However, disagreement persists on unresolved problems in terms of attracting FDI, border issues, the near-environment, and contradictions regarding security policies. Coming to the regional Asian setting, the global alignment and foreign policy convergence appears to be partly replaced by a more competitive relation in strategic terms and the two entities act more as rivals for regional dominance than as potential allies.

A simplified eco-design Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was then performed to compare each solution with its fossil-based counterpart. Differences and similarities between the various cellulosic solutions have been identified. Furthermore, the assessment confirms that cellulosic fiber-based materials have reduced environmental impacts as compared to fossil-based counterparts, if a similar packaging weight is obtained.

The University of British Columbia (UBC) set ambitious campus sustainability goals, including a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions to 33% below the 2007 level by 2015, and 100% by 2050 (UBC, 2006). The University pursued these goals through a number of specific projects (such as major district energy upgrade and a bioenergy facility) and, more generally, through a “Campus as a Living Lab” (CLL) initiative to marry industry, campus operations, and research to drive innovative solutions. The CLL program has achieved significant successes while also demonstrating many opportunities for improvements and lessons learned. The aim of this study was to examine the UBC CLL program, to identify and formalize its operations, to extract key transferable characteristics, and to propose replicable processes that other universities and municipalities can follow to expand their sustainable practices in similar ways. There was a learning curve with implementing a CLL program at UBC; thus, the goal of this study was to potentially shorten this learning curve for others. The research involved an ethnographic approach in which researchers participated in the CLL process, conducted qualitative analysis, and captured the processes through a series of business process models. The research findings are shared in two parts: 1. generalized lessons learned through key transferrable characteristics; 2. a series of generic organizational charts and business process models (BPMs) culminated with learned strategies through defined processes that illustrate what was required to create a CLL program at UBC. A generalized future improvement plan for UBC CLL programs is defined, generic BPMs about CLL projects are evaluated, and the level of engagement of multiple stakeholders through phases of project life cycle given in the conclusion for future use of other Living Lab organizations. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is unclear that the Global South's particularities are being integrated. This study has a three-fold goal: (a) identify the different approaches to climate governance found in the mainstream literature, (b) explore the degree of integration of the Global South in those approaches, and (c) contribute to the ongoing discussion on this issue from a southern perspective. A systematic literature review on “climate governance” was conducted, distinguishing different approaches and their significance for the Global South. Results clustered in six groups use the characterizations: multi-level, global, adaptive, transnational, polycentric, and experimental/transformative. These terms account for different levels of decision-making, emerging values, and the importance of non-State and sub-national actors. Approaches vary, in relation to change and participation, from an incremental improvement focus to a more transformative perspective and from the promotion of community influence to processes based on traditional institutions. In the Global South, multi-level, multi-actor climate governance occurs in a context of deep inequality and asymmetric power relations, rising environmental conflicts, and a lack of adequate mechanisms for community participation. Addressing climate change here will require, acknowledging the State alone cannot solve the issue, that different views must be considered and that contextualized perspectives from the Global South must be integrated. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; climate governance; Global South; interdisciplinary; literature review","climate change; climate modeling; decision making; governance approach; literature review; participatory approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091214106

Nitrification, the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrate, plays multiple roles in the biogeochemistry of these regions, including production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We present here the results of two oceanographic cruises investigating nitrification, nitrifying microorganisms, and N2O production and distribution from the offshore waters of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific. On each cruise, high-resolution measurements of ammonium ([NH4+]), nitrite ([NO2−]), and N2O were combined with 15N tracer-based determination of ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidation, nitrate reduction, and N2O production rates. Depth-integrated inventories of NH4+ and NO2− were positively correlated with one another and with depth-integrated primary production. Depth-integrated ammonia oxidation rates were correlated with sinking particulate organic nitrogen flux but not with primary production; ammonia oxidation rates were undetectable in trap-collected sinking particulate material. Nitrite oxidation rates exceeded ammonia oxidation rates at most mesopelagic depths. We found positive correlations between archaeal amoA genes and ammonia oxidation rates and between Nitrospina-like 16S rRNA genes and nitrite oxidation rates. N2O concentrations in the upper oxycline reached values of &gt;140 nM, even at the western extent of the cruise track, supporting air-sea fluxes of up to 1.71 μmol m−2 day−1. Our results suggest that a source of NO2− other than ammonia oxidation may fuel high rates of nitrite oxidation in the offshore Eastern Tropical South Pacific and that air-sea fluxes of N2O from this region may be higher than previously estimated. ©2021.

The CoM has launched a new season on energy planning in Europe based on Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs), defining actions for selected intervention sectors. The aim of the work was to evaluate the state of the Italian CoM signatories, assessing the results achieved in terms of the Municipalities involved (CoM signatories), the SEAPs developed and the Monitoring Reports submitted. Specifically, the analysis of the Monitoring Reports data represents a relevant step needed in order to formulate some critical appraisals concerning the performance level of CoM adoption at a national scale, in terms of the commitment levels, goals achieved and actions completed or in progress. The paper also compares national figures with a regional detailed survey developed for the Basilicata Region.

This study aims at evaluating their effect on NO2 concentrations in an urban environment under real atmospheric conditions through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. A comprehensive study is performed to determine the potential of photocatalytic materials to remove NO2 at pedestrian level taking into account the variability of wind speed, traffic emissions and the photoactive area in an urban environment. The deposition velocity used to model the sink effect of a photoactive surface is derived from laboratory data and its applicability to outdoor conditions is proved through microscale simulations. The CFD simulation performed to assess the impact of a photocatalytic material on ambient pollutants in a real urban scenario is evaluated against the measurements presented in Part I (Fernández-Pampillón et al., 2020). Results show that the application of photocatalytic materials in an urban environment yield a minimal reduction in NO2 concentrations below 1% under the studied atmospheric conditions. In a hypothetical scenario, in which the photoactive area is extended to an entire neighbourhood, small decrease of NO2 concentrations below 2% is obtained under the daytime prevailing atmospheric conditions of the area of interest. Finally, the reduction of NO2 under several atmospheric conditions results to be mainly dominated by wind flow and NOx emissions in the study street. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD model NO2 Mitigation strategies NO−xO3 chemistry Photocatalytic materials urban air quality","Air pollution; Deposition; Nitrogen oxides; Urban planning; Wind; Atmospheric conditions; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Deposition features; Deposition velocities; Microscale simulation; Mitigation strategy; Photocatalytic materials; Urban air pollution; Computational fluid dynamics; nitrogen oxide; air temperature; Article; atmospheric deposition; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (parameter); controlled study; photocatalysis; priority journal; simulation; surface property; urban area; wind speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099199758

The aim of this work was to compare the profitability of different climate control strategies in greenhouses located in subtropical areas of southeast Spain. To do so, we compared papayas growing in a greenhouse equipped with active climate control (ACC), achieved by cooling and heating systems, versus plants growing in another greenhouse equipped with passive climate control (PCC), consisting of only natural ventilation through zenithal and lateral windows. The results showed that ACC favored papaya plant growth; flowering; fruit set; and, consequently, yields, producing more and heavier fruits at an affordable cost. Climate control strategies did not significantly improve fruit quality, specifically fruit skin color, acidity, and total soluble solids content. In conclusion, in the current context of prices, an active control of temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse could be a more profitable strategy in subtropical regions where open-air cultivation is not feasible. © 2021 by the authors.

However, new evidence suggests that current adaptation policies are failing to fully incorporate risk-related information and knowledge. Understanding how policies account for current and future risks becomes crucial to assess whether they will effectively contribute to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. Exploiting the synergies between the well-established discipline of disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation may be an interesting option. In this paper we develop an Adaptation-Risk Policy Alignment (ARPA) framework to assess whether (and how) climate change adaptation policies integrate risk knowledge and information. ARPA displays a set of risk-based metrics that we test in four early adapters cities: Copenhagen, Durban, Quito and Vancouver. These cities are considered pioneer cities in the design and implementation of adaptation plans and have the potential to show the full applicability of ARPA. The framework is easy to apply and allows to systematically assess whether and how policies appropriately account for major risks and properly integrate risk management into the policy-making process. We propose that the framework can be used for self-evaluation and learning as well as in large-scale adaptation tracking exercises. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptation policy; Climate change adaptation; Climate policy; Climate risk; Disaster risk reduction; Local adaptation planning","climate change; conceptual framework; disaster management; environmental policy; environmental risk; local planning; risk assessment; British Columbia; Canada; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Durban; Ecuador; Hovedstaden; KwaZulu-Natal; Pichincha; Quito; South Africa; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097043600

No longer in operation, many wells are now classified as abandoned, and, due to their age, their locations are either unknown or inaccurately recorded. These historic well sites present environmental, safety, and economic concerns in the form of possible methane leaks and physical hazards. Methods: Airborne magnetic and LiDAR surveys were conducted in the Pioneer Run watershed in Oil Creek State Park to find abandoned wells in a historically significant but physically challenging location. Wells were drilled in this area prior to modern geolocation and legal documentation. Although a large number of old wells were abandoned summarily without remediation of the site, much of the land area within Oil Creek State Park is now covered in trees and dense underbrush, which can obscure wellheads. The thick vegetation and steep terrain limited the possibility of ground-based surveys to easily find well sites for methane emissions studies. The data from remote sensing surveys were used to corroborate potential well locations from historic maps and photographs. Potential well sites were verified in a ground-based field survey and monitored for methane emissions. Results: Two historic photographs documenting oil activity in the late 1800s were georeferenced using a combination of magnetic and LiDAR data. LiDAR data, which were more useful in georeferencing and in field verification, identified 290 field locations in the Pioneer Run watershed, 86% of which were possible well sites. Sixty-two percent of the ground-verified wells remained unplugged and comprised the majority of leaking wells. The mean methane emissions factor for unplugged wells was 0.027 ± 0.099 kg/day, lower than other Appalachian Basin methane emissions estimates. Conclusions: LiDAR was used for the first time, in combination with an airborne magnetic survey, to reveal underground oil industry features and inform well identification and remediation efforts in difficult-to-navigate regions. In the oldest oil fields, where well casing has been removed or wood conductor casing was installed, historic photographs provide additional lines of evidence for oil wells where ground disturbances have concealed surface features. Identification of well sites is necessary for mitigation efforts, as unplugged wells emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abandoned wells; Greenhouse gases; Historical photos; LiDAR; Magnetometry; Methane; Oil and natural gas","methane; oil; well water; abandoned land; field survey; historical record; hydrocarbon reservoir; lidar; magnetic field; mitigation; oil industry; oil well; satellite data; airborne particle; Article; documentation; exhaust gas; geographic mapping; history; Pennsylvania; photography; remote sensing; vegetation; oil and gas field; United States; Appalachian Basin; Pennsylvania; United States; Appalachian Region; Methane; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098715008

The manure of the livestock farms is not used efficiently and the energy supply of the farms depends primarily on centrally produced gas and electricity. Some areas are not yet connected to the gas grid. Agriculture causes huge environmental damages in its current form. The benefit of biogas production would therefore be fivefold: (1) local energy source, (2) mitigation of environmental impacts, (3) reducing CH4-emis-sions, (4) producing organic fertilizer as a side product and (5) additional earnings for farmers. © 2021 by the authors.

Harnessing the available infinite solar renewable energy source and integrating it with the existing power infrastructure is necessary. In this context, a comprehensive technical, economic, and environmental assessment of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system for the domestic sector is presented considering U.A.E case study. The central and off-grid photovoltaic systems’ configurations are modeled to evaluate its comparative viability for six selected latitude positions of U.A.E. Further, three different photovoltaic technologies (i.e., mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline, and thin-film) are analyzed to conclude the optimum selection. Climatic conditions like incident solar radiations, humidity, air temperature, and cooling degree-days are used to conduct the feasibility assessment using the RETScreen software, where the capacity factor, the number of PV units required, base case fuel savings, net present value, payback period, and benefit-cost ratio are evaluated. Effect of reducing the battery bank size from 24 hrs to 12 hrs backup is also elaborated. The central-grid photovoltaic system configuration is concluded comparatively more viable than off-grid PV system supported by all techno-economic aspects and more environment friendly reducing 229–237 tCO2 greenhouse gas emissions during the project life. © 2020","Battery backup; Central-grid system; Off-grid system; Solar photovoltaic; Techno-economics; United Arab Emirates","Cost benefit analysis; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incident solar radiation; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Cooling (heating) degree day; Environmental assessment; Feasibility assessment; Photovoltaic technology; Power infrastructures; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaic system; United Arab Emirates; Thin film solar cells; alternative energy; climate conditions; comparative study; environmental assessment; environmental economics; environmental technology; feasibility study; photovoltaic system; solar power; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097709962

Atmospheric pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, and CO were substantially reduced during the lockdown and unlock phases with the greatest reduction in cities having larger traffic volumes. Compared with the immediate pre-lockdown period (PL3), the averaged PM2.5 and PM10 reduced by up to 51% and 47% respectively during the lockdown periods, which resulted in ‘satisfactory’ level of air quality index (AQI) as a result of reduced vehicular traffic and industrial closing. These parameters continued to reduce as much as 80% during the unlock periods due to the additive impact of weather (rainfall and temperature) combined with the lockdown conditions. Kendall’s correlation matrix showed a significant negative correlation between temperature and air pollutants (r= − 0.35 to − 057). Conversely, SO2 and O3 did not improve, and in some cases, they increased during the lockdown and unlocking. COVID-19 spreading incidences were strongly and positively correlated with temperature (r &lt; 0.62) and dew point (r &lt; 0.73). Thus, this indicates that the increase in temperature and dew point cannot weaken the transmission of this virus. The number of COVID-19 cases relative to air pollutants was negatively correlated (r = − 0.33 to − 0.74), which may be a mere coincidence as a result of lockdown. However, based on pre-lockdown air quality data and demographic factors, it was found that particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and population density are closely linked with higher morbidity and mortality although a more in-depth research is required in this direction to validate this finding. The onset of COVID-19 has allowed us to determine that ‘immediate’ changes in air quality within densely populated/industrialized areas can improve livelihood based on pollution mitigation. These findings could be used by policymakers to set new benchmarks for air pollution that would improve the quality of life for major sectors of the World’s population. COVID-19 has shown us that we can make changes when necessary, and findings may pave the way for future research to inform policy on the tough choices we will have to make between quality of life and survival. Also, our results will enrich the ongoing discussion on the role of environmental factors on the transmission of COVID-19 and will help to take necessary steps for its control. © 2020, ISB.","Air pollutants; COVID-19 pandemic; Maharashtra; Meterological factors; Population density","air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; India; pandemic; particulate matter; quality of life; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092380017

In addition to the intended development of residual compressive stresses due to the finishing process, disturbances in the grinding process can lead to negative effects such as tensile residual stresses, tempering and even rehardening zones and significantly reduce the component lifetime. In industrial applications, the analysis of Barkhausen noise is becoming increasingly important for the detection of this unwanted thermo-mechanically influenced surface integrity. The non-destructive method reacts sensitively to changes in, for example, the residual stress state as well as the hardness. In addition, other material-, process- and metrology-related influences are described in literature. The investigations presented in this paper deal with the influence of different material states (case-hardening depth, surface carbon content and alloy composition) on the signals of the Barkhausen noise as a function of the surface integrity. It is shown that the signal level is significantly influenced by the material condition and thus individual limit values must be used for evaluation of the surface integrity. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany.","AISI 4820 (18CrNiMo7-6); Barkhausen noise; Grinding; Grinding burn; Surface integrity","Case hardening; Grinding (machining); Nondestructive examination; Alloy compositions; Case hardened steel; Manufacturing process; Material conditions; Nondestructive methods; Residual compressive stress; Residual stress state; Tensile residual stress; Residual stresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101522001

Therefore, there have been significant efforts to reduce the freeze-drying time and decrease its energy consumption. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF), ultrasound (US), and hybrid treatment (PEF-US) and compare them with the effect of blanching (BL) on the freeze-drying kinetics, energy consumption, greenhouse gasses emission, and physical quality of the product. The freeze-drying process was applied to red bell peppers after pretreatment operations. Results showed that application of BL, PEF, US, or PEF-US reduces freezedrying time and decreases energy consumption. Among the tested methods, the combination of PEF performed at 1 kJ/kg and US was the most effective in reduction of greenhouse gas emission. BL samples exhibited the highest porosity, but from a statistical point of view, most of the PEF-US treated materials did not differ from it. The smallest color changes were noted for US pre-treated bell peppers (ΔE = 9.4), whereas BL, PEF, and PEF-US material was characterized by ΔE of 15.2- 28.5. Performed research indicates the application of pre-treatment may improve the sustainability of freeze-drying process and quality of freeze-dried bell pepper. © 2021 by the authors.

From this perspective, extracting marine renewable energy represents one of the most important technological challenges of the 21st century. In this context, the objective of the present work is to provide a new and comprehensive understanding concerning the global wave energy resources based on the most recent results coming from two different databases, ERA5 and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea State. In this study, an analysis was first made based only on the ERA5 data and concerns the 30-year period of 1989-2018. The mean wave power, defined as the energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, was evaluated at this step. Besides the spatial distribution of this parameter, its seasonal, inter, and mean annual variability was also assessed on a global scale. As a second step, the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area was analyzed for a 27-year period (1992-2018) with both ERA5 and the satellite data from the European Space Agency being considered. The comparison indicates a relatively good concordance between the results provided by the two databases in terms of mean wave energy density, although the satellite data indicate ightly higher energy values. © 2021 MDPI AG.

Improved photosynthetic efficiency in cassava has the potential to increase yields, but cassava roots must have sufficient sink strength to prevent carbohydrates from accumulating in leaf tissue and suppressing photosynthesis. Here, we grew eight farmer-preferred African cassava cultivars under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) to evaluate the sink strength of cassava roots when photosynthesis increases due to elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). Relative to the ambient treatments, elevated [CO2] treatments increased fresh (+27%) and dry (+37%) root biomass, which was driven by an increase in photosynthesis (+31%) and the absence of photosynthetic down-regulation over the growing season. Moreover, intrinsic water use efficiency improved under elevated [CO2] conditions, while leaf protein content and leaf and root cyanide concentrations were not affected. Overall, these results suggest that higher cassava yields can be expected as atmospheric [CO2] increases over the coming decades. However, there were cultivar differences in the partitioning of resources to roots versus above-grown biomass; thus, the particular responses of each cultivar must be considered when selecting candidates for improvement. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The changes in the traditional cropping systems, with increasing shares of maize, raised concerns about the sustainability of agricultural feedstock production regarding threats to soil health. However, spatially explicit data about silage maize cultivation are missing; thus, implications for soil cannot be estimated in a precise way. With this study, we firstly aimed to track the fields cultivated with maize based on remote sensing data. Secondly, available soil data were target-specifically processed to determine the site-specific vulnerability of the soils for erosion and compaction. The generated, spatially-explicit data served as basis for a differentiated analysis of the development of the agricultural biogas sector, associated maize cultivation and its implications for soil health. In the study area, located in a low mountain range region in Western Germany, the number and capacity of biogas producing units increased by 25 installations and 10,163 kW from 2009 to 2016. The remote sensing-based classification approach showed that the maize cultivation area was expanded by 16% from 7305 to 8447 hectares. Thus, maize cultivation accounted for about 20% of the arable land use; however, with distinct local differences. Significant shares of about 30% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that show at least high potentials for soil erosion exceeding 25 t soil ha−1 a−1. Furthermore, about 10% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that pedogenetically show an elevated risk for soil compaction. In order to reach more sustainable cultivation systems of feedstock for anaerobic digestion, changes in cultivated crops and management strategies are urgently required, particularly against first signs of climate change.

Local activity data, emission factors, and pollution control efficiencies were applied to estimate the annual emissions of individual power plants. As the EIs consider all emission control activities with relevant unit upgrades, the estimated SO2, NOx and PM species were found to be lower than most of the reported EIs by 20–70%. An overestimation (i.e., 3.8 times) of SO2 has been observed in Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) EI, which can possibly be attributed to the assumption of no air pollution controls in their inventory. Overall, the newly developed EIs indicate that the annual emissions of coal-fired TPPs were highest among the various types of TPPs, and the largest uncertainty occurred in NOx with ranges between −23% and +31%. In terms of regional distribution, the most significant emission sources of CO2, N2O, SO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, BC, and OC were from the Red River Delta region resulted from coal-fired TPPs, while the Southeast region had the largest sources of CO, NMVOC, and CH4 caused by gas-fired TPPs. The study reveals that from 2010 to 2015, the growths of NOx, CO, NMVOC, PM10, PM2.5, BC, OC, CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were 51%, 39%, 41%, 109%, 88%, 9%, 107%, 58%, 33%, and 119%, respectively, while ~19% reduction in SO2 was found resulted from the decommission of oil-fired TPPs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Electricity generation; Emission inventory; Power plants; Vietnam","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Thermoelectric power plants; Atmospheric research; Bottom up approach; Control activities; Control efficiency; Emission inventories; Power generation units; Regional distribution; Thermal power plants; Sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; coal; methane; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; coal-fired power plant; emission control; emission inventory; estimation method; nitrate; power generation; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution control; concentration (parameter); electric power plant; exhaust gas; gas; geothermal energy; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; priority journal; river; Viet Nam; Red River Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099546627

Here, we report a molecular cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst bearing four phosphonic acid anchoring groups (CoPcP) that can be immobilized on metal oxide electrodes. A hybrid electrode with CoPcP on mesoporous TiO2 (mesoTiO2) converts CO2 to CO in aqueous electrolyte solution at a near-neutral pH (7.3) with high selectivity and a turnover number for CO (TONCO) of 1949 ± 5 after 2 h of controlled-potential electrolysis at -1.09 V against the standard hydrogen electrode (∼550 mV overpotential). In situ UV-visible spectroelectrochemical investigations alluded to a catalytic mechanism that involves non-rate-limiting CO2 binding to the doubly reduced catalyst. Finally, the integration of the mesoTiO2|CoPcP assembly with a p-type silicon (Si) photoelectrode allowed the construction of a benchmark precious-metal-free molecular photocathode that achieves a TONCO of 939 ± 132 with 66% selectivity for CO (CO/H2 = 1.9) under fully aqueous conditions. The electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities of CoPcP were compared to those of state of the art synthetic and enzymatic CO2 reduction catalysts, demonstrating the excellent performance of CoPcP and its suitability for integration in tandem PEC devices. ©","artificial photosynthesis; CO2reduction; cobalt phthalocyanine; electrochemistry; hybrid materials; molecular catalysts","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cobalt compounds; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Metals; Oxide minerals; Photoelectrochemical cells; Spectroelectrochemistry; Titanium dioxide; Aqueous electrolyte solutions; Catalytic mechanisms; Cobalt phthalocyanine; Controlled potential electrolysis; Metal oxide electrodes; Photoelectrochemicals; Spectroelectrochemical investigations; Standard hydrogen electrodes; Hybrid materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100715458

Young people aged 13–15 from two schools in Wales participated in three workshops, which culminated in students producing IDNs about climate change using Twine storytelling software. An inductive, grounded-theory approach informed by Bourdieusien principles of habitus and value was used to explore students’ responses to the Programme. Stage 1 coding identified ‘Core Themes’ and located student responses along tri-axial continua showing engagement, agency, and power. Stage 2 coding combined ‘Core Themes’ to build upon Cantell et al.’s 2019 Bicycle Model of Climate Change Education to create a new ‘holistic Agentic Climate-Change Engagement’ model (h-ACE), where learners’ journeys towards full engagement with and understanding of CCE and action could be traced. Barriers to students’ engagement with and understanding of CCE were identified through Bourdieusien analysis of responses. Results show that engagement was related to children’s views on their capacity to effect change on individual, local and governmental levels. The h-ACE provides a model for adjusting CCE curricula to accommodate young people’s varying cultures and views. © 2021 by the authors.

This affects the amount of petroleum generated with the increase in thermal maturation. However, the evolution of HI with Tmax upon thermal maturation is not described quantitatively (or semi-quantitatively) for Type II-S kerogen. Here we explore the natural thermal maturation of the Ein Zeitim/Ghareb Formation (Late Cretaceous) type II-S source rock in the Golan Basin, north Israel. This is done by comparing geochemical data on cuttings from the section in the Golan Basin with an artificial maturation experiment conducted on an immature analog core taken from the Shfela Basin, central Israel. Using bulk Rock-Eval analyses of unextracted and extracted samples, the natural and artificial maturation paths are found to be comparable and show sub-parallel trends for the relative decrease in hydrogen index (HI) and the increase in the normalized bitumen content (mgBitumen/gTOC) with increasing thermal maturation (measured as Tmax). This comparison suggests that maturation in the Golan Basin increases with depth across the ~350 m thick section from an early maturation state to the peak of bitumen generation. While the original HI (HIo) is estimated from the field data, the original S2 prior to maturation (S2o) is estimated based on the empirical relationship derived from the artificial maturation data trend in order to estimate hydrocarbon generation. Second-order differences between the artificial and natural maturation trends may be due to small differences in the sulfur content of the immature kerogens from the two basins (0.5–1 wt% from the kerogen), leading to an offset in the Tmax maturation scale. Thus, a lower-case scenario is considered to estimate lower values for S2o and the hydrocarbons generated across the source rock section. As sulfur in the immature kerogen has a substantial effect on the onset of maturation, we postulate that the maturation path presented here is more representative for sulfur-rich kerogens then that of the sulfur-lean Type II kerogens. However, variability in the sulfur content within sulfur-rich kerogens, will probably change the specific maturation path of a given kerogen. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ghareb; Pyrolysis; Rock-eval; Source rock; Sulfur; Thermal maturation; Type II-S kerogen","Hydrocarbons; Oil shale; Petroleum geology; Rocks; Sulfur; Artificial maturation; Empirical relationships; Geochemical data; Hydrocarbon generation; Hydrogen indices; Late cretaceous; Marine source rocks; Thermal maturation; Kerogen; artificial neural network; Cretaceous; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon resource; kerogen; pyrolysis; source rock; sulfur; thermal maturity; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097079527

Together, they create the land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC), which comprises itself largely of areas with little to no data with regards to understanding the global carbon system. Reasons for this include remote and inaccessible sample locations, often tedious methods that require collection of water samples and subsequent analysis in the lab, and the complex interplay of biological, physical and chemical processes. This has led to large inconsistencies, increasing errors and has inevitably lead to potentially false upscaling. A set-up of multiple pre-existing oceanographic sensors allowing for highly detailed and accurate measurements was successfully deployed in oceanic to remote inland regions over extreme concentration ranges.

Manure was sampled three times over a 235 day feeding trial conducted in southern Alberta, Canada. Results showed that BC2 increased total C and the C/N ratio by 5.7 and 6.6% relative to BC0, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), while total N exhibited a quadratic response from BC0 to BC2 (P = 0.005). Manure 15δN signatures, ranging from +3.83 to +7.34‰, were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by BC treatment. DPMAS 13C NMR revealed similar structural features among BC0 and BC2; indigestible BC had a minor impact on the bulk-C speciation of manure organic matter (OM). Compositional changes were limited to the aromatic-C region of the 13C NMR spectra. Fused-ring domains, mainly pyrogenic-C, were increased by 1.56-fold at BC2 relative to BC0. Overall, results demonstrated that BC stabilizes recalcitrant-C in manure OM, potentially sequestering soil-C when applied to croplands. This approach provides an added value to its use in ruminant diets, mainly from a nutrient cycling perspective.

The data on respective emissions sources have been acquired from the Central Statistics Authority (GUS) of 2019 (Local Data Bank). The emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 particulates were estimated from the structure of the emissions sources covered in the “EEA/EMEP Emission Inventory Guidebook” following the Tier 1 method. The research shows that, in Poland, the biggest share in particulate emission is found for poultry and cattle farming, which are the emissions of 5.5 and 3 m kg of particulates annually all across Poland, respectively. The highest pollution with PM2.5 resulting from animal farming was recorded for the Podlaskie (0.19 kg/ha), Wielkopolskie (0.16 kg/ha), and Mazowieckie (0.14 kg/ha) provinces, whereas the highest pollution with PM10 was recorded for the Wielkopolskie province (0.83 kg/ha). The key sources of particulate emission indicated in the study facilitate adapting the adequate method to reduce the particulate emissions in respective provinces. It is essential, especially due to the negative effect of particulates on human health. © 2021 by the authors.

The Sharing Cities program has the ambition of contributing to climate change mitigation by improving urban mobility, energy efficiency in buildings and reducing carbon emissions by successfully engaging citizens and fostering local-level innovation. A Digital Social Market (DSM), named Sharing Lisboa, was developed in Lisbon, Portugal, supported by an application (APP), enabling the exchange of goods and services bringing citizens together to support a common cause: three schools competing during one academic year (2018/2019) to win a final prize with the engagement of school community and surrounding community. Sharing Lisboa aimed to promote behaviour change and the adoption of energy-saving behaviours such as cycling and walking with the support of local businesses. Participants earned points that reverted to the cause (school) they supported. A total of 1260 users was registered in the APP, collecting more than 850,000 points through approximately 17,000 transactions. This paper explores how the DSM has the potential to become a new city service promoting its sustainable development. Furthermore, it is crucial for this concept to reach economic viability through a business model that is both profitable and useful for the city, businesses and citizens, since investment will be required for infrastructure and management of such a market. © 2021 by the authors.

The issue of IAM transparency has been an ongoing concern for approximately two decades regarding the cloaking of value-laden assumptions and output uncertainties. Due to the opaque nature of IAMs, the credibility of modeling results and the associated policy recommendations are patently limited, with policymakers inevitably having reservations as to the robustness of modeling outcomes given the deficit of information regarding the underlying assumptions. In an attempt to address the issue of a lack of transparency concerning IAM usage by the IPCC, a database containing the climate mitigation scenario ensemble which underpinned the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was made publicly available, the IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer database. Despite this database, the omission of critical model input data and accompanying supporting documentation from its content fails to fulfill its raison d'être, that is to say, to ensure reproducibility and transparency. If the issue of IAM transparency is not fully addressed in the upcoming AR6 with respect to the provision of IAM input data, accompanied by supporting documentation, then the IPCC will have failed to meet its own declared commitment for this assessment cycle.

However, many state and local plans are built around targets based on outdated climate science such as 80% emissions reductions by 2050. The IPCC 2018 report suggests that wealthy countries must go substantially further in order to reduce the worst effects of anthropogenic climate change. This study involved a team consisting of university researchers and the research institute that originally developed modeling in a consulting role for the state of Rhode Island, to assess the viability of more rapid decarbonization pathways for Northeastern U.S. states. The goal was to provide new insights on possibilities and challenges for major economic sectors like housing, transportation, and industrial emissions. The findings suggest that by adopting existing technologies, 70–80 percent reductions can be reached by 2030, 2040 or 2050. Methane leakage from natural gas transmission and landfills remains a major obstacle to complete decarbonization, as are do industrial emissions and air travel. The work provides first-estimates of sectoral and overall costs of these transitions, compared to maintaining existing infrastructure. A final analysis provides an initial examination of what impact modest behavioral changes would make on the speed and cost of decarbonization at the state level. We describe the context and generalizability of the study, its methods and findings, and suggest directions for future work. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-estimates; Decarbonization pathways; Energy modelling; Production based accounting; State-level, clean energy, Rhode Island, New England",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100655333

In order to solve those problems, the components parameters of a series hybrid electric vehicle are selected and tested with the ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) simulation tool, which is a software-based on Matlab_simulink. Then, an optimisation was done to minimise simultaneous fuel consumption and emissions (HC, CO, and NOx) of the vehicle engine. In addition, the driving performance requirements are also examined during the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) to fix their optimal control parameters. Finally, the results show that those steps help reduce fuel consumption and emissions while guaranteeing vehicle performance.

Spectroscopic surveys of massive galaxy clusters reveal the properties of faint background galaxies thanks to the magnification provided by strong gravitational lensing. Aims. We present a systematic analysis of integral-field-spectroscopy observations of 12 massive clusters, conducted with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). All data were taken under very good seeing conditions (~0"".6) in effective exposure times between two and 15 h per pointing, for a total of 125 h. Our observations cover a total solid angle of ~23 arcmin2 in the direction of clusters, many of which were previously studied by the MAssive Clusters Survey, Frontier Fields (FFs), Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space and Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble programmes. The achieved emission line detection limit at 5? for a point source varies between (0.77-1.5) × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 at 7000 Å. Methods. We present our developed strategy to reduce these observational data, detect continuum sources and line emitters in the datacubes, and determine their redshifts. We constructed robust mass models for each cluster to further confirm our redshift measurements using strong-lensing constraints, and identified a total of 312 strongly lensed sources producing 939 multiple images. Results. The final redshift catalogues contain more than 3300 robust redshifts, of which 40% are for cluster members and ?30% are for lensed Lyman-? emitters. Fourteen percent of all sources are line emitters that are not seen in the available HST images, even at the depth of the FFs (?29 AB). We find that the magnification distribution of the lensed sources in the high-magnification regime (?a =a 2-25) follows the theoretical expectation of N(z) a ?-2. The quality of this dataset, number of lensed sources, and number of strong-lensing constraints enables detailed studies of the physical properties of both the lensing cluster and the background galaxies. The full data products from this work, including the datacubes, catalogues, extracted spectra, ancillary images, and mass models, are made available to the community. © J.

We show that sample collection by community science programs is a viable strategy for expanding estuarine carbonate system monitoring and prioritizing regions for more targeted assessment. ‘Shell Day’ was a single-day regional water monitoring event coordinating coastal carbonate chemistry observations by 59 community science programs and seven research institutions in the northeastern United States, in which 410 total alkalinity (TA) samples from 86 stations were collected. Field replicates collected at both low and high tides had a mean standard deviation between replicates of 3.6 ± 0.3 µmol kg−1 (σmean ± SE, n = 145) or 0.20 ± 0.02%. This level of precision demonstrates that with adequate protocols for sample collection, handling, storage, and analysis, community science programs are able to collect TA samples leading to high-quality analyses and data. Despite correlations between salinity, temperature, and TA observed at multiple spatial scales, empirical predictions of TA had relatively high root mean square error &gt;48 µmol kg−1. Additionally, ten stations displayed tidal variability in TA that was not likely driven by low TA freshwater inputs. As such, TA cannot be predicted accurately from salinity using a single relationship across the northeastern US region, though predictions may be viable at more localized scales where consistent freshwater and seawater endmembers can be defined. There was a high degree of geographic heterogeneity in both mean and tidal variability in TA, and this single-day snapshot sampling identified three patterns driving variation in TA, with certain locations exhibiting increased risk of acidification. The success of Shell Day implies that similar community science based events could be conducted in other regions to not only expand understanding of the coastal carbonate system, but also provide a way to inventory monitoring assets, build partnerships with stakeholders, and expand education and outreach to a broader constituency. © 2021 The Author(s).

Alpine areas in Mediterranean-type climate regions are characterized by precipitation increases and temperature decreases with elevation. Thus, alpine plants with wide elevational ranges in Mediterranean regions may be good models to examine these alternative hypotheses. We evaluated storage and growth during experimental darkness and re-illumination in individuals of the alpine plant Phacelia secunda from three elevations in the Andes of central Chile. We hypothesized that storage is prioritized regarding growth in plants of both low- and high elevations where drought and cold stress are greatest, respectively. We expected that decreases in NSC concentrations during darkness should be minimal and, more importantly, increases in NSC after re-illumination should be higher than increases in biomass. We found that darkness caused a significant decrease in NSC concentrations of both low- and high-elevation plants, but the magnitude of the decrease was lower in the latter. Re-illumination caused higher increase in NSC concentration than in biomass in both low- and high-elevation plants (1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively). Our study shows that C allocation in Phacelia secunda reflects ecotypic differences among elevation provenances and suggests that low temperature, but not drought, favours C allocation to storage over growth after severe C limitation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Carbon limitation; Drought; Ecotypes; High-mountain plants; Low-temperature stress","alpine environment; carbohydrate; concentration (composition); drought resistance; drought stress; elevation; photosynthesis; prioritization; provenance; sensitivity analysis; temperature profile; Andes; Chile; Phacelia secunda; carbon; Chile; climate; drought; human; plant; Carbon; Chile; Climate; Droughts; Humans; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100167530

We apply the fixed-effects dynamic spatial Durbin error model to empirically gauge the magnitude of the spatial impacts and dynamic impacts for a sample of 26 EU countries throughout 1990–2015. By analyzing the empirical results, we conclude that: (1) Compared with dynamic spatial Durbin error model, the traditional dynamic panel model over-estimates the parameters because traditional regression methods only capture the direct impacts, and neglect the indirect impacts. (2) A significant positive spatial spillover of CO2 emissions from neighboring countries to the local country is recognized, justifying the use of our spatial model. (3) Economic growth has positive impacts on CO2 emissions, while the spatial effects of economic growth exert negative impacts. Moreover, the total effects of economic growth are positive in both short-term and long-term. (4) Although the spatial effects of renewable energy are not significant, renewable energy has negative influences on CO2 emissions. (5) The impacts and spatial effects of natural gas are positive; therefore, its total effects are positive in both short-run and long-run. Based on our finding, we provide several policy recommendations, such as the emphasize of cooperation with CO2 reduction policies, the promotion of green economy and renewable energy, and the substitution of natural gas in the future. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CO2 emission; dynamic spatial panel model; economic growth; energy transition; natural gas; renewable energy","alternative energy; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; European Union; natural gas; panel data; spatial analysis; spillover effect; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096664935

We used Landsat and HJ-1 satellite remote sensing images covering the Yellow River delta from 1989 to 2018 to quantitatively evaluate and understand the ecological effects of S. alterniflora invasion in the estuary delta. The remote sensing spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI); the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model; and the effective intertidal zone sedimentation width (EISW) analysis model were applied to these images. The effects on coastal protection, the impact on local vegetation ecosystems and the contribution to the greenhouse effect of S. alterniflora were studied. The main results showed that: (1) S. alterniflora invasion slows coastal erosion but, to achieve coastal stabilization, its distribution width needs to be greater than 700 m; (2) S. alterniflora invasion has caused serious degradation of local ecosystems. Among these, the area of Phragmites communis and Suaeda salsa decreased by more than 50%, and the seagrass bed ecosystem was seriously degraded; and (3) S. alterniflora invasion weakens the carbon storage capacity of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River delta, and intensifies the release of methane, reducing the ability of coastal vegetation wetlands to resist global warming. © 2020","Coastal wetlands; Invasive plant; Remote sensing; Spartina alterniflora; Yellow river delta","carbon storage; coastal erosion; coastal zone; environmental degradation; estuary; greenhouse effect; intertidal environment; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sedimentation; China; Yellow River; Phragmites australis; Spartina alterniflora; Suaeda salsa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097106319

An anomalous decrease in barrier height and an increase in the ideality factor with a decrease in the temperature were observed. The anomalous barrier height and ideality factor are ascribed to a role of barrier inhomogeneities at the interface of MIS junction assuming a double Gaussian distribution of barrier heights in the temperature ranges of 150–225 K and 225–400 K. Double Gaussian distribution giving mean barrier heights of 0.84 eV and 1.23 eV and standard deviations of 0.0085 V and 0.0187 V for the two temperature regions.

The recent COVID-19 lockdowns may impact the transition towards clean cooking fuels. The nationwide lockdown is likely to affect key factors such as energy access, income, transportation, etc., that play a role in decisions influencing household fuel use. The rural population already bears the burden of poverty and may not be able to afford and access clean cooking fuels during the lockdown. They are thus vulnerable to reversion to their traditional cooking methods using solid biomass fuels. The household air pollution caused due to the use of polluting fuels increases their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases, and thus may intensify the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is an urgent need to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide. The present study applies the DPSIR modeling framework to establish a set of comprehensive indicators for addressing the transition towards clean cooking fuels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bangladesh's low-lying landmass, dense population and long coastline has raised the risk of climate change-induced destabilization due to sea-level rise. There is increased risk of long-term, cross-border movement of climate refugees into India which previously experienced a short-term, intense exodus of ten million East Pakistani refugees from the 1971 Bangladesh War. This study understands India's state, NGO, and societal responses to the 1971 crisis using the concept of framing and developing a “perception-capability-policy output” approach to garner policy lessons for potential future climate change-induced migration. Limitations of the “conflict versus climate migration” comparison are acknowledged, even as its utility is highlighted. The article ends by noting the crucial role of NGOs and social capital in filling capability voids of the state, constrained by a polarizing political environment.

Academic analysis of these public works projects is dominated by technocratic and engineering-driven frameworks. However, social conflict, laws, political incentives, governance structures, and other political factors have played pivotal roles in determining the fate of government-led coastal flood risk reduction efforts. Here, we review the ways in which politics has enabled or hindered the conception, design, and implementation of coastal risk reduction projects in the U.S. We draw from the literature in natural hazards, infrastructure, political science, and climate adaptation and give supporting examples. Overall, we find that (1) multiple floods are often needed to elicit earnest planning; (2) strong and continuous leadership from elected officials is necessary to advance projects; (3) stakeholder participation during the design stage has improved outcomes; (4) legal challenges to procedural and substantive shortcomings under environmental protection statutes present an enduring obstacle to implementing megastructure proposals. © 2020.

If these environments are close to their pristine state, they can be considered a nature-based solution promoting the integration of both green and blue elements in the cities, while providing a wide range of services (e.g. better aesthetics, air quality, leisure areas, and mitigation of climatic changes). In view of this, the current study aimed to develop a holistic assessment tool for urban streams that can be used to highlight their importance and support decision makers in the elaboration of measures to recover urban streams. The tool called Urban stream Assessment system (UsAs) includes the assessment of (1) biodiversity, (2) ecological functions and habitat that are inherent components of the ecosystems, and (3) provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, following The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). The tool includes 89 indicators belonging to 17 divisions (services and functions) selected from studies on urban areas and fluvial ecosystems. In addition, the tool introduces a method for the measurement of an indicator, rationale for the used indicator, positive and negative scope of the indicator, and reference to the proposed method. The tool incorporates also a step-by-step scoring system, which results in a global quality classification of streams. The UsAs tool was tested with a case study stream located in the city of Coimbra, Central Portugal. The final classification attributed to this stream was moderate, which is slightly higher than the ecological status, highlighting its potential ecosystem services (ES). However, the UsAs clearly showed a poor biodiversity (namely of aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, fish, aquatic mammals, and terrestrial insects), habitat conditions and the most compromised services that could be improved: water supply, air quality, health and well-being. The use of this novel tool supports also new research and knowledge on aquatic ecosystems and particularly urban streams by generating relevant data to answer and test important ecological questions, such as the influence of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning and services. Further investigation should focus more on tests in different types of urban streams, regions, and climates. © 2020 The Authors","Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Cities; Cultural services; Ecosystem functions; Habitat; Provisioning; Regulating","Air quality; Biodiversity; Data streams; Decision making; Mammals; Water supply; Aquatic invertebrates; Ecological functions; Ecosystem functioning; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem services; Habitat conditions; Impervious surface; Millennium ecosystem assessments; Aquatic ecosystems; amphibian; aquatic ecosystem; biodiversity; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; mammal; stream; Coimbra [Portugal]; Portugal; Amphibia; Hexapoda; Indicator indicator; Invertebrata; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096193514

However, these environments are declining rapidly in developing countries, diminishing their carbon sequestration potential and may ultimately transforming them as carbon dioxide sources. This study investigated the carbon sequestration potential through sediment burial at three mangrove habitats of Cochin, South-West coast of India. High burial estimates were recorded at two mangrove stations (2.95 ± 0.79–10.41 ± 2.50 t C ha−1 yr−1), but consistent with other tropical mangrove areas. Lower burial rates were estimated at one station (0.57 ± 0.24 t C ha−1 yr−1). Eighty percent of the mangrove net primary productivity through litterfall (NPPL) was stored in the sediment at the station with the highest burial rate, which is demonstrative of a robust carbon sink. However, at a different site, which is subject to aquaculture, only 7.23 % of NPPL was buried in the sediment. A major portion of the fixed carbon at this site is presumably emitted back to the atmosphere or exported to adjacent water bodies. The median total regional mangrove carbon burial rate in this study was 2.95 t C ha−1 yr−1 and the organic carbon burial rate was 1.93 ± 0.75 t C ha−1 yr−1. Biological factors such as mangrove biomass, litterfall and crab density have played a major role in controlling the sediment carbon burial rate. Sediment texture and bulk sediment accumulation acted as secondary controlling factors. The carbon source characterisation in the sediment profile using stable isotope techniques revealed the organic carbon origin as mangrove litter. Gaining a better understanding of carbon sources, burial rates and their controlling factors in mangrove habitats aids in regional climate mitigation efforts and global efforts to increase the carbon sequestration potential of tropical mangrove systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon burial; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Crab density; Stable isotope","air-sea interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; litterfall; mangrove; net primary production; organic carbon; Cochin; India; Kerala; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093689564

Genes involved in the lignin pathway and immunity seem to play a potential role in contributing towards local adaptation to light. Abstract: The study of natural variation is an efficient method to elucidate how plants adapt to local climatic conditions, a key process for the evolution of a species. Norway spruce is a shade-tolerant conifer in which the requirement of far-red light for growth increases latitudinally northwards. The objective of the study is to characterize the genetic control of local adaptation to light enriched in far-red in Norway spruce, motivated by a latitudinal gradient for the Red:Far-red (R:FR) ratio to which Norway spruce has been proven to be genetically adapted. We have established the genomic signatures of local adaptation by conducting transcriptomic (total RNA-sequencing) and genomic analyses (exome capture), for the identification of genes differentially regulated along the cline. RNA-sequencing revealed 274 differentially expressed genes in response to SHADE (low R:FR light), between the southern and northern natural populations in Sweden. Exome capture included analysis of a uniquely large data set (1654 trees) that revealed missense variations in coding regions of nine differentially expressed candidate genes, which followed a latitudinal cline in allele and genotype frequencies. These genes included five transcription factors involved in vital processes like bud-set/bud-flush, lignin pathway, and cold acclimation and other genes that take part in cell-wall remodeling, secondary cell-wall thickening, response to starvation, and immunity. Based on these results, we suggest that the northern populations might not only be able to adjust their growing season in response to low R:FR light, but they may also be better adapted towards disease resistance by up-regulation of the lignin pathway that is linked to immunity. This forms a concrete basis for local adaptation to light quality in Norway spruce, one of the most economically important conifer tree species in Sweden. © 2021, The Author(s).","Conifers; Exome capture; Immunity; Latitudinal cline; Lignin; Local adaptation; Missense variation; Norway spruce; R:FR ratio; Response to shade; SNP","acclimatization; genetics; light; Norway; spruce; tree; Acclimatization; Light; Norway; Picea; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100231942

The applicability of the EC method was satisfied even though the measurements were taken at a limited height. The CO2 fluxes are representative of an area with public offices and schools, the university campus, green areas, and busy roads with intensive traffic during school and office times. The measurements were carried out in March-June, covering late winter, characterized by huge vehicle traffic and domestic heating, until late spring, characterized by reduced activities for schools and the university. The source area was determined as a function of atmospheric stability, for data with the ratio between measurement-height/buildings-height in the range of 1.3-1.5. The measured CO2 fluxes were compared to gas consumption values. The results show that the district is a strong source of CO2 during the winter. Emissions were drastically reduced (-82%) after the heating was switched off, and a further decrease in CO2 emissions (-50%) occurred with the reduction of school activities, partly due to the mitigating effect of green areas with large trees in the area. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, this paper proposes a canonical correlation analysis detection method based on fault-relevant variables selected by an elitist genetic algorithm to realize high-dimensional data-driven faults detection of diesel engines. The method proposed establishes a fault detection model by the actual operation data to overcome the limitations of the traditional methods, merely based on benchmark. Moreover, the canonical correlation analysis is used to extract the strong correlation between variables, which constructs the residual vector to realize the fault detection of the diesel engine air and after-treatment system. In particular, the elitist genetic algorithm is used to optimize the fault-relevant variables to reduce detection redundancy, eliminate additional noise interference, and improve the detection rate of the specific fault. The experiments are carried out by implementing the practical state data of a diesel engine, which show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2021 by the authors.

The total biogas potential from the expected 200 MLD wastewater with an average COD concentration of 1000±225 mg/L, was estimated to be 23105±5185Nm3/day which is equivalent to a total electricity potential of 3.35±0.76 megawatt (MW). Thus produced bioenergy can be utilized to supply the energy demand of the treatment plants, support the plants to be less dependent on the grid energy-thereby helping to achieve energy self-sufficiency, achieve cleaner urban rivers, and possibly also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the plants.

Unfortunately, a significant challenge to fisheries management is that sustainable fishing levels can decline, often synergistically, by co-occurring with climate-driven environmental stressors. Within one of the most impacted marine areas in the world, and encompassing a number of highly targeted commercial species, the small pelagic fish community of the western Mediterranean Sea has recently shown signs of collapse. In this study, we identify a worrying coincidence where fishing hotspots for the commercially valuable European sardine Sardina pilchardus and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus occur in marine areas mostly affected by climate change. To identify these areas, we overlayed detailed, spatially explicit measurements of fishing pressure with the finest-scale maps of cumulative climate change impacts onto these species. According to our results, doubly impacted marine areas largely occur in the north-western Mediterranean Sea, with climate and fisheries mostly affecting European sardine. Reducing local stressors (i.e., fishing pressure) in highly impacted areas may contribute to maintain these communities within a “safe operating space” (SOS), where they remain resilient to climate change. Accordingly, the redistribution and/or reduction of fishing intensity may alleviate pressure in those areas already affected by climate change. Sustainable fishing strategies may benefit, therefore, from the SOS concept and the spatial assessments provided in this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anchovy; Fisheries; Mediterranean Sea; Ocean warming; Sardine; Sustainability","Fish; Fisheries; Fishing (oil wells); Climate change impact; Engraulis encrasicolus; Environmental stressors; Fisheries management; North-western mediterranean seas; Sardina pilchardus; Spatially explicit; Western Mediterranean Sea; Climate change; environmental stress; fish; fishery management; fishery production; pelagic fish; sustainability; sustainable development; anchovy; article; climate change; fishery; fishing; human; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; pelagic fish; sardine; sea; warming; animal; ecosystem; fish; Mediterranean Sea; sea food; Mediterranean Sea; Engraulidae; Engraulis encrasicolus; Sardina pilchardus; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Humans; Mediterranean Sea; Seafood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097093237

Knowledge about these issues and preventive measures can affect the incidence and outbreak risk of dengue. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among urban and rural communities and government officials about climate change and dengue in Laos and Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional KAP survey about climate change and dengue were conducted in 360 households in Laos (180 urban and 180 rural), 359 households in Thailand (179 urban and 180 rural), and 20 government officials (10 in each country) using structured questionnaires. Data analysis was undertaken using descriptive methods, principal component analysis (PCA), Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (as appropriate), and logistic regression. Results: Significant differences among the selected communities in both countries were found in terms of household participant's age, level of education, socioeconomic status, attitude level of climate change and KAP level of dengue (P < 0.05; 95% CI). Overall, participants' KAP about climate change and dengue were low except the attitude level for dengue in both countries. The level of awareness among government officials regarding the climatic relationship with dengue was also low. In Lao households, participants’ knowledge about climate change and dengue was significantly associated with the level of education and socioeconomic status (SES) (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change and dengue were associated with educational level and internet use (P < 0.05). Householders' climate change related practices were associated with SES (P < 0.01) and dengue related practices were associated with educational level, SES, previous dengue experience and internet use (P < 0.01). In Thailand, participants' knowledge about climate change was associated with the level of education and SES (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change were associated with residence status (urban/rural) and internet use (P < 0.05); climate change related practices were associated with educational level and SES (P < 0.05). Dengue related knowledge of participants was associated with SES and previous dengue experience (P < 0.05); participants’ dengue related attitudes and practices were associated with educational level (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings call for urgently needed integrated awareness programs to increase KAP levels regarding climate change adaptation, mitigation and dengue prevention to improve the health and welfare of people in these two countries, and similar dengue-endemic countries. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Climate change; Control; Dengue; Prevention","climate change; dengue fever; disease prevalence; health risk; knowledge based system; public attitude; questionnaire survey; socioeconomic status; state role; adult; age; attitude; climate change; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis; dengue; education; female; government employee; household; human; incidence; internet use; Laos; major clinical study; male; priority journal; rural population; social status; structured questionnaire; Thailand; urban population; attitude to health; climate change; Laos; questionnaire; Thailand; Laos; Thailand; Martes; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dengue; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Laos; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097049172

Consequently, the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is also following an increasing trend. The collection and use of greenhouse gases emitted from solid waste management practices are still limited. A causality analysis examined the driving factors of the emissions from solid waste management. The methane (CH4) emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) increased with an increase in gross do-mestic product (GDP) per capita and urban population, and an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and literacy rate was likely to reduce CH4 emissions from municipal solid waste and vice versa. The CH4 emission generated from industrial solid wastes was found to be positively related to GDP per capita, urban population, and FDI inflows. However, a decrease in the unem-ployment rate was likely to increase CH4 emissions from industrial solid wastes. The future greenhouse gas emissions were projected under different possible socio-economic conditions. The sce-nario analysis based on different variations of population and GDP growth revealed that methane emission from total waste would increase at an average annual rate of 5.13% between 2020 and 2050, and is projected to reach about 4000 Gg by the end of the year 2050. Although the Kingdom has been taking some initiatives towards climate change mitigation, it has significant opportunities to adopt some of the best practices in solid waste management including reduction, recycling, composting and waste-to-energy, and carbon capture and utilization. This study also put emphasis on developing appropriate policy approaches for climate change mitigation based on the circular economy which is gaining momentum in the Kingdom. © 2021 by the authors.

Aspen Plus process simulator was employed to study the process. Two models were built to represent the non-sorbent and the sorbent-enabled MSW gasification. The model validation against available experimental data shows high accuracy of the simulation result. The effect of CO2 capture using CaO sorbent on the syngas composition and lower heating value (LHV) was observed by comparing the two models, and sensitivity analysis was performed on both models. Several process parameters affecting the syngas composition and LHV were investigated, including CaO/MSW ratio, temperature, equivalence ratio, and steam/MSW ratio. The addition of CaO sorbent for CO2 capture was found to successfully reduce the CO2 content in the syngas, increase the H2 composition, and improve the syngas LHV at the temperature below 750oC. The maximum H2 composition of 56.67% was obtained from the sorbentenabled gasification. It was found that increasing equivalence ratio leads to a higher H2 concentration and syngas LHV. Raising steam/MSW ratio also increases the H2 production, but also reduces the LHV of the syngas. Observation of the temperature effect found the highest H2 production at 650oC for both non-sorbent and sorbent-enabled gasification. © 2020. The Authors.

In many cases, the effects of air pollution on human health can be prevented by forecasting the air quality in the next day. In order to predict the 1 day in advance air quality index (AQI) of Orumiyeh city, the hybrid single decomposition (HSD) and hybrid two-phase decomposition (HTPD) models were used. In the first step, the AQI data were decomposed by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and was hybridized with general regression neural network (GRNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as HSD models. In the second step, using variational mode decomposition (VMD) technique the results of the first intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of CEEMDAN model were decomposed into nine VMs and were predicted by GRNN and ELM models to obtain IMF1. Finally, in the third step, GRNN and ELM were used again to predict the IMFS as HTPD models. Results showed that in predicting AQI series data by HSD models both CEEMDAN-ELM and CEEMDAN-GRNN models were similarly accurate. Among all the models used, the accuracy of CEEMDAN-VMD-GRNN as the HTPD model was the highest in the training phase (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 4.13 and MAE = 2.99) and in the testing phase (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 5.45 and MAE = 3.87). It can be concluded that HTPD models have more accurate results to predict AQI data compared with HSD models. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","CEEMDAN-GRNN; CEEMDAN-VMD-GRNN; Hybrid model; Intrinsic mode functions; Train","air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; decomposition analysis; estimation method; machine learning; public health; urban area; Iran; Orumiyeh; West Azerbaijan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090452166

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses Johansen Fisher type panel cointegration, fully modified ordinary least square and heterogeneous panel causality tests to examine long-run, long-run elasticities and short-run relationships. For conducting the tests, the study selected five emerging economies, i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and used balanced panel data for the period between 1998 and 2016. Findings: The empirical results confirm the presence of a long-run cointegration relationship among the variables. We find that financial development, technology and energy consumption have a considerable positive impact on economic output. Also, financial development, urban population and technology help reduce carbon (CO2) emissions and ensure an improved environmental quality in the long run in the five emerging economies. In the short run, a bidirectional causal relationship is noticed between financial development and CO2 emissions. Practical implications: Clean energy, technological development and investments by public–private partnerships are required in the public and private sectors to reduce carbon emissions. This not only ensures improved environmental quality but also increases energy efficiency, thereby reducing dependency on traditional energy consumption. Originality/value: As its contribution to the extant literature, the study examines the impact of financial development, energy consumption, technology, urbanization, economic output and carbon emissions in BRICS economies. The findings of the research suggest both the governments and policymakers of these five emerging economies to develop more effective policies toward bolstering the financial development and increasing the use of technology. These, in turn, ensure sustainable development with low CO2 emission in the future and, eventually, pushing those five emerging market economies toward sustainable economic growth. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emissions; Economic output; Energy consumption; Financial development","carbon emission; economic development; emission inventory; energy use; environmental economics; financial system; input-output analysis; technological development; technology adoption; urbanization; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa; Martes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094140335

However, the combination of direct and soil-mediated impacts of invasive plants via allelopathy remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed the allelopathic effects of an invasive plant species (Rhus typhina) on a cultivated plant (Tagetes erecta), soil properties and microbial communities. We grew T. erecta on soil samples at increasing concentrations of R. typhina root extracts and measured both plant growth and soil physiological profile with community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) using Biolog Eco-plates incubation. We found that R. typhina root extracts inhibit both plant growth and soil microbial activity. Plant height, Root length, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and AWCD were significantly decreased with increasing root extract concentration, and plant above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and total biomass (TB) were significantly decreased at 10 mg.mL-1 of root extracts. In particular, root extracts significantly reduced the carbon source utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers, but enhanced phenolic acid. Redundancy analysis shows that soil pH, TN, SOC and EC were the major driving factors of soil microbial activity.

In principle, this can be achieved by specifically controlling the intrinsic structural relaxation and vibronic coupling in the excited state. Here, a design strategy to realize narrowband emission of organic fluorescent emitters is proposed by significantly enhancing the low-frequency vibronic coupling strength (Λ) while simultaneously reducing the high-frequency Λ of the commonly involved stretching modes. The quinolino-[3,2,1-de]acridine-5,9-dione (QAO) species is found to be directly associated with this design principle.

Results revealed that: (i) households’ perceptions toward environmental benefits are more positive than their perceptions toward economic benefits and social benefits, and their perceptions toward economic benefits are more positive than their perceptions toward social benefits; (ii) households having a good relationship with village officials have higher odds of holding more positive perceptions toward social, economic, and environmental benefits of the projects; (iii) households which are members of local associations are more likely to have positive perceptions toward benefits of the projects; (iv) households whose members are more frequently involved in village-level public events are more likely to have more positive perceptions toward benefits of the projects; (v) households having more educated household heads have higher odds of holding better perceptions toward the benefits of FCS projects; and (vi) households of Yunnan Province are less likely to express positive perceptions toward benefits of the projects. Based on the research results, we concluded that social capital is significantly and positively associated with rural households’ perceptions toward benefits of forest carbon sequestration projects.

We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance in the Daxing’anling area, Northeastern China, from 1987 to 2016. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier and historical fire records were used to separate burned patches from disturbance patches obtained from VCT. Afterward, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), SVM, and random forest (RF) were applied to assess the statistical relationships between vegetation recovery characteristics and various influential factors. The results indicated that the forest disturbance events obtained from VCT had high spatial accuracy, ranging from 70% to 86% for most years. The overall accuracy of the annual fire patches extracted from the proposed VCT-SVM algorithm was over 92%. The modeling accuracy of post-fire vegetation recovery was excellent, and the validation results confirmed that the RF algorithm provided better prediction accuracy than SVM and SMLR. In conclusion, topographic variables (e.g., elevation) and meteorological variables (e.g., the post-fire annual precipitation in the second year, the post-fire average relative humidity in the fifth year, and the post-fire extreme maximum temperature in the third year) jointly affect vegetation recovery in this cold temperate continental monsoon climate region.

Experimental mechanistic studies are challenging because these reactions involve multiple highly reactive intermediates and perplexing reaction pathways, engendering competing, but unverified, proposals for substrate conversions. Here, we report a comprehensive mechanistic study of photoredox nickel-catalyzed C-S cross-coupling based on time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, Stern-Volmer quenching, and quantum yield measurements. We have (i) discovered a self-sustained productive Ni(I/III) cycle leading to a quantum yield φ > 1; (ii) found that pyridinium iodide, formed in situ, serves as the dominant quencher for the excited state photocatalyst and a critical redox mediator to facilitate the formation of the active Ni(I) catalyst; and (iii) observed critical intermediates and determined the rate constants associated with their reactivity. Not only do the findings reveal a complete reaction cycle for C-S cross-coupling, but the mechanistic insights have also allowed for the reaction efficiency to be optimized and the substrate scope to be expanded from aryl iodides to include aryl bromides, thus broadening the applicability of photoredox C-S cross-coupling chemistry. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Catalysis; Excited states; Mechanics; Nickel metallography; Quantum theory; Quantum yield; Rate constants; Reaction intermediates; Carbon-heteroatom bonds; Mechanistic studies; Reaction efficiency; Reaction pathways; Reactive intermediate; Substrate conversion; Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy; Yield measurement; Nickel compounds; aryl bromide; aryl iodide; bromide; carbon; iodide; nickel; pyridinium iodide; sulfur; thiol; thiolate; unclassified drug; absorption spectroscopy; Article; catalyst; chemical reaction kinetics; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; cyclic voltammetry; electron spin resonance; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalyst; photoredox; quantum yield; rate constant; reaction optimization; Stern-Volmer quenching constant; time resolved transient absorption spectroscopy; ultraviolet visible absorption spectroscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100271433

In this study, industrial urea was injected into a commercial MSW incinerator flue gas to evaluate the suppression performances of PCDD/Fs, and the possible inhibition mechanisms were proposed. The results show that the use of urea dramatically reduced the PCDD/Fs emission concentration from 8.87 to 0.63 ng/Nm3, along with a significant decrease in the I-TEQ value (0.26 → 0.047 ng I-TEQ/Nm3), below the Chinese national standard of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3.

In the present work, coal-based porous nitrogen-doped carbon (CPNC) electrocatalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at fuel cell cathodes have been easily prepared by the mechanochemistry-assisted strategy. Catalyst preparation combines the low-temperature pyrolysis with the high-temperature annealing, which guarantees nitrogen-containing substances sealed and confined in the carbon layers and skeletons and effectively converts them into nitrogen-relevant bonds, simultaneously regulating architectural features (e.g. specific surface areas, pore width distributions, defects and edges). The optimal metal-free CPNC electrocatalyst owns onset potentials of 0.97, 0.80 and 0.87 V, half-wave potentials of 0.84, 0.64 and 0.65 V, limiting current densities of 4.96, 4.60 and 4.90 mA cm−2, electron-transfer numbers of 3.93, 3.92 and 3.91, together with fine current stability and methanol tolerance, in 0.1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0), respectively. This is the first report on high-performance coal-based pH-universal oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, attributed to the effective trade-off between textural properties of catalysts (related to surface areas and pore structures) and the number of catalytic reaction sites (associated with nitrogen configuration distributions). Accordingly, this work has established the basis by which earth-abundant coals are readily converted into high-performance oxygen reduction carbonaceous electrocatalysts that are able to be integrated into various fuel cell test beds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clean utilization; Coal-based catalyst; Fuel cell; Oxygen reduction reaction; pH-universal","Carbon; Catalysis; Coal; Doping (additives); Economic and social effects; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrolytic reduction; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Pore structure; Potassium hydroxide; Temperature; Architectural features; High-temperature annealing; Limiting current density; Low-temperature pyrolysis; Nitrogen-containing substance; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Oxygen reduction catalysts; Phosphate buffer solutions; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090744885

Rice is a staple food of more than half of the world's population and the most important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Rice production accounted for 36% of total emissions from agriculture. The use of organic material management in paddy fields is a potential to support sustainable agriculture. Biochar is reported to enhance soil carbon sequestration and soil productivity. This study aimed to know the effect of combined compost with biochar application on rice yields and greenhouse gas emissions in rainfed rice fields. The research was conducted for 3 years at research station of Indonesian Agricultural Environment Research Institute, Pati-Central Java. CH4 and N2O emissions were measured using close chamber method. We used combined compost with rice husk biochar for organic fertilizer, namely Biocompost.

Specifically, it assesses the influence of two dimensions of community attachment (social and environmental) and environmental concern on civic engagement. Data were collected using a self-administered mail survey of 1000 residents in the two Lake Superior watersheds that constitute the majority of the North Shore region. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings indicate that residents’ social attachment to their communities is a significant predictor of their climate-related civic engagement. Further, their environmental attachment—while not by itself a predictor--is significantly related to heightened concern about the impacts of climate change on the local environment, which is a significant predictor of residents’ civic engagement. These findings reinforce a two-dimensional understanding of community attachment and they are pertinent for natural resource professionals and community leaders tasked with engaging residents in climate-mitigating or –adaptive actions. They suggest that programmatic outcomes may be enhanced by accentuating the local social and economic consequences of climate change, and the impacts to local natural resources. This may be especially valuable in nature tourism-based economies where altered climatic conditions could more drastically impact the economic well-being of communities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Civic engagement; Climate change; Community attachment; Great Lakes Basin; Lake Superior north shore","climate change; community resource management; environmental planning; local participation; local planning; tourism economics; tourism market; Great Lakes Basin; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Superior; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101020702

The CuZnZrO2 catalyst was highly selective towards methanol at low temperatures (up to 99% selectivity), offering the highest yield of 12.6 g CH3OH kg-catalyst-1 h-1. However, carbon monoxide was the product with higher selectivity at temperatures above > 210 °C. Physically mixing CuZnZrO2 with potassium-modified HZSM5 zeolite increased the CO2 conversion. The synergetic effect between potassium-modified HZSM5 zeolite improved the production of methanol which can be subsequently transformed into dimethyl ether. The bi-functional catalyst allowed the synthesis of valuable products at 50.3 g kg-catalyst-1 h-1 (CH3OH, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbon), while mixing pure HZSM5 with CuZnZrO2 was inherently selective towards hydrocarbons (up to 80%) and allowed the synthesis of valuable products at 14.6 g kg-catalyst-1 h-1. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Bi-functional catalyst; Dimethyl ether; Gibbs free energy minimization; Methanol; ZrO2supported copper catalysts","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst selectivity; Copper compounds; Ethers; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Mixing; Pollution control; Potassium; Zeolites; Zinc compounds; Zirconia; Bi-functional catalysts; Carbon dioxide reduction; CO2 hydrogenation; Copper-based catalysts; Dimethyl ether synthesis; Gibbs free energy minimization; Synergetic effect; Thermodynamic equilibria; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099729412

Some policies promote right-sizing and others promote revitalization. The relationship between land-use planning and mobility having been established, the present research issue is focused on whether a policy of revitalizing the centers of mid-sized cities is favorable to low-carbon mobility. Our study investigates commuting trips through two indicators: commuting trip distance and car modal share. The increase in total population, the increase in the number of jobs per resident, the decrease in the unemployment rate, the increase in the rate of executives, the increase in the rate of working people in the population and the decrease in the residential vacancy rate all come from the censuses of 2006 and 2016. Statistical models based on individuals in 113 mid-sized cities, in which sociodemographic variables are introduced, show that at the level of agglomerations, no indicator has a simultaneously positive effect in the center and in the urban periphery. No indicator is entirely positive or negative on GHG emissions from commuting trips. While the increase in GHG emissions from commuting trips between 2006 and 2016 is significant in mid-sized cities (18%), a shift toward shrinking city centers is insufficient to change this trajectory. © 2021 by the authors.

The focus is on Italian Churches seen as a particular case of study. Taking into consideration the characteristics of the managing risk strategy, we use a value-belief-norm approach and a decision tree analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the governance scheme adopted. In the case examined of the Italian Churches, the strategy is mainly based on a private insurance contract characterized by a double track, local and national, to reach the important goal of the full coverage of all churches.

There is increasing sectoral evidence on the implementation of successful adaptation actions. However, the success of these actions when we consider the interdependencies among sectors remains debatable. This paper aims to assess who benefits from implementing adaptation options in a multiuser river basin to both climate-induced and demographic stress on water use. Our analysis relies on a hydro-economic model that considers two sets of water users: agriculture and urban households. We innovate in our modelling approach by analyzing and explicitly integrating the household-level economic behavior through its water demand. We assess the cross-user consequences of autonomous and planned adaptation actions. We provide insights into the different trade-offs at the basin level, demonstrating the compatibilities and divergences between agriculture and household-level water demand. We found different consequences of implementing either autonomous or planned adaptation measures. For instance, a decentralized scheme would drive negative implications for the entire basin, although the less water-intensive sector will be better off. On the other hand, different policy interventions would drive positive consequences for the entire basin, with the most water-intensive sector benefiting the most. These results highlight the distributional consequences across users of different adaptation measures. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate change adaptation policies; Economic consequences; Multiuser; Trade-offs; Water management","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Watersheds; Climate condition; Climate stressors; Distributional consequences; Economic modeling; Household level; Policy intervention; River basins; Urban-household; Water resources; adaptive management; climate change; policy implementation; river basin; river management; trade-off; water demand; water management; water planning; water use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099531878

It is therefore key to evaluate ENSO simulations in state-of-the-art numerical models used to study past, present, and future climate. Recently, the Pacific Region Panel of the International Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) Project, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), led a community-wide effort to evaluate the simulation of ENSO variability, teleconnections, and processes in climate models. The new CLIVAR 2020 ENSO metrics package enables model diagnosis, comparison, and evaluation to 1) highlight aspects that need improvement; 2) monitor progress across model generations; 3) help in selecting models that are well suited for particular analyses; 4) reveal links between various model biases, illuminating the impacts of those biases on ENSO and its sensitivity to climate change; and to 5) advance ENSO literacy. By interfacing with existing model evaluation tools, the ENSO metrics package enables rapid analysis of multipetabyte databases of simulations, such as those generated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 (CMIP5) and 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 models are found to significantly outperform those from CMIP5 for 8 out of 24 ENSO-relevant metrics, with most CMIP6 models showing improved tropical Pacific seasonality and ENSO teleconnections. Only one ENSO metric is significantly degraded in CMIP6, namely, the coupling between the ocean surface and subsurface temperature anomalies, while the majority of metrics remain unchanged. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Climate research; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Interannual climate variability; Model evaluation; Model generation; Southern oscillation; State of the art; Subsurface temperature; Climate models",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097001965

Sediments frequently exposed to dry-wet cycles are potential biogeochemical hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during dry, wet and transitional phases. While the effects of drying and rewetting on carbon fluxes have been studied extensively in terrestrial and aquatic systems, less is known about the effects of dry-wet cycles on N2O emissions from aquatic systems. As a notable part of lotic systems are temporary, and small lentic systems can substantially contribute to GHG emissions, dry-wet cycles in these ecosystems can play a major role on N2O emissions. Methodology. This study compiles literature focusing on the effects of drying, rewetting, flooding, and water level fluctuations on N2O emissions and related biogeochemical processes in sediments of lentic and lotic ecosystems. Results. N2O pulses were observed following sediment drying and rewetting events. Moreover, exposed sediments during dry phases can be active spots for N2O emissions. The general mechanisms behind N2O emissions during dry-wet cycles are comparable to those of soils and are mainly related to physical mechanisms and enhanced microbial processing in lotic and lentic systems. Physical processes driving N2O emissions are mainly regulated by water fluctuations in the sediment. The period of enhanced microbial activity is driven by increased nutrient availability. Higher processing rates and N2O fluxes have been mainly observed when nitrification and denitrification are coupled, under conditions largely determined by O2 availability. Conclusions. The studies evidence the driving role of dry-wet cycles leading to temporarily high N2O emissions in sediments from a wide array of aquatic habitats. Peak fluxes appear to be of short duration, however, their relevance for global emission estimates as well as N2O emissions from dry inland waters has not been quantified. Future research should address the temporal development during drying-rewetting phases in more detail, capturing rapid flux changes at early stages, and further explore the functional impacts of the frequency and intensity of dry-wet cycles. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

Defining the optimum vegetation sample plots size is an important part of the process of obtaining information, since is crucial for its quality, and also for its financial costs and time required. In this context, we evaluated whether: (i) the optimum plot size selected in two approaches (basal area/carbon stock vs biodiversity) are different since they are associated with different ecological drivers; (ii) different tropical forests vegetation types present different optimum sample plot size due to their ecological specific attributes, such as species composition, structure and functioning. For this we evaluated the vegetation sample plots optimum size of different vegetation types of tropical savanna and forest of broad occurrence in the tropics (Atlantic Semideciduous Forest – ASF; Cerrado Woodland – CW; Cerrado Forest – CF; and Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest - SDTF), in two approaches: forest basal area and carbon stock, since they are related variables; and biodiversity variables by species composition similarity and heterogeneity in communities. We used 4 forest fragments in Brazil that were sampled in a way that allowed the arrange of subplots to form different plot sizes. In order to evaluate the optimum sample plot size in the basal area/carbon stock approach we used four methodologies, in which the obtained variability was compared to a reference size (1000 m2). For the biodiversity approach we used the floristic similarity and composition heterogeneity between units as metric, evaluating differences in the similarity patterns and possible reductions or increases in variability compared to the reference size. We found there are no significant differences for biodiversity variables between sample plot sizes for all vegetation types, thus the optimum size may be selected using just the basal area/carbon stock approach. In the basal area/carbon stock approach, most of the evaluated methods generally presented lower plot size values compared to the reference size (1000 m2) in all vegetation types, except for the ASF. There are differences between vegetation types that may be grouped in two groups related to the optimum size selected, that are related to their ecological restriction patterns: CW, CF and SDTF with optimum size between 600 and 1000 m2; and the second with ASF, with optimum sample plot size between 1000 m2 and 1400 m2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forest inventory; Sampling methods; Tree biomass; Tree diversity; Tropical forest","Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystems; Tropics; Vegetation; Conservation strategies; Ecological information; Floristic similarities; High quality information; Seasonally dry tropical forests; Similarity patterns; Species composition; Tropical vegetation; Forestry; basal area; biodiversity; cerrado; floristics; forest ecosystem; forest management; functional role; habitat quality; optimization; savanna; tropical forest; vegetation type; Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants; Tropics; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097333653

Although this unit has been previously described as lacustrine, a marine influence in the basin has been suggested. This study provides new geochemical and paleontological data supporting the marine influence during the interevaporitic episodes, allowing to refine the palaeogeography of the eastern Betic Seaway during the Late Tortonian.87Sr/86Sr ratios in gypsum (0.70797 to 0.70825) suggest recycling of Triassic evaporites. The sulphate isotopic values in gypsum (11.5 &lt; δ34SVCDT &lt; 21.9‰; 16.6 &lt; δ18OVSMOW &lt; 28.1‰) are indicative of microbial sulfate-reduction activity. Carbonates are mainly composed of dolomite formed by subspherical crystal aggregates related to bio-mediated processes. The 87Sr/86Sr values in the interevaporitic carbonates (0.70823 to 0.70851) are higher than those expected for Triassic marine authigenic carbonates but lower than expected for the Late Miocene ones, suggesting a mixing of continental and marine water contributions. The ‘non-marine’ isotopic values in gypsum and carbonates contrast with an abundant content of marine siliceous fossils (radiolarians, diatoms, porifera, etc.) in the marls and carbonates that reveals marine incursions into the basin between periods of gypsum precipitation. A tephra layer identified in Las Minas and in the nearby El Cenajo Basin, located in a more inland position, allows a precise correlation between both basins, showing marine fossils in Las Minas and lacustrine in El Cenajo. In El Cenajo Basin, marine microfossils have been found but only in some levels, while others show lacustrine diatoms. A new palaeogeographic model of evaporitic lakes with temporal marine connections is proposed for the latest Tortonian in this region, when the uplift of the Betic Cordillera was very active accelerating the palaeogeographic evolution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dolomite; El Cenajo Basin; Evaporitic lakes; Miocene; Palaeogeography; Strontium isotopes","dolomite; geochemistry; gypsum; Miocene; paleogeography; precipitation (chemistry); Tortonian; Triassic; Betic Cordillera; Canada; Minas Basin; Nova Scotia; Spain; Bacillariophyta; Porifera; Radiolaria (protozoans)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098222430

To improve air quality and reduce health impacts, the National Emission Ceilings Directive requires Member States of the European Union to provide National Air Pollution Control Programmes, including emission reduction measures aimed to achieve binding commitments for the years 2020 and 2030. Integrated assessment models are pivotal to assess the reduction of pollutants concentrations determined by measures implemented or foreseen for emission reduction. Here we discuss scenarios elaborated for year 2030 in the Italian National Air Pollution Control Programme, considering 2010 as reference year. The two scenarios, ""With Measures"" and ""With Additional Measures"", show a significant reduction of the pollutants concentration, namely PM2.5, NO2 and O3. The scenarios are here also used to provide an integrated approach for calculating the effect of the program on health impacts (mortality) and related costs. Avoidable attributable cases and associated costs are here reported at both the national and regional level and provide a significant framework to assess air-pollution reduction measures with an integrated approach. The procedure proposed may be therefore further developed and applied to assess the overall positive benefits (environmental, health and economic) determined by air-pollution control plans or other integrated policies targeting air quality, energy and climate goals. © 2021 by the authors.

Through an extensive literature review, this paper reports robust short-term O3 trends over the last three decades and provides insights on the effect of regional emission control policies on O3 levels. Since the 1990s, anthropogenic O3 precursor emissions have decreased in North America and Europe, while Eastern Asian emissions slightly decreased recently. A reduction in O3 mean concentrations was observed in rural areas (on average 0.23 ppb year−1) in North America and Europe since the 1990s, while slight decreases were recently reported in East Asia. Most studies have reported significant increases in urban areas worldwide (on average + 0.31 ppb year−1) and at regional background stations (on average + 0.15 ppb year−1) since the 1990s. The increase in urban O3 concentrations can be attributed to decreased local NOx emissions, due to, e.g., vehicle emission controls, resulting in lower O3 titration by NO. The global background O3 increase can be driven by the net impacts of climate change, such as an increase in stratospheric O3 inputs, higher CH4 emissions, changing lightning NOx emissions, and weakened NO titration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Control strategy; Monitoring stations; Ozone; Trends",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097660103

Symptoms of misuse have included the treatment of an unrealistic, extreme scenario as the world's most likely future in the absence of climate policy and the illogical comparison of climate projections across inconsistent global development trajectories. Reasons why such misuse arose include (a) competing demands for scenarios from users in diverse academic disciplines that ultimately conflated exploratory and policy relevant pathways, (b) the evolving role of the IPCC – which extended its mandate in a way that creates an inter-relationship between literature assessment and literature coordination, (c) unforeseen consequences of employing a temporary approach to scenario development, (d) maintaining research practices that normalize careless use of scenarios, and (e) the inherent complexity and technicality of scenarios in model-based research and in support of policy. Consequently, much of the climate research community is presently off-track from scientific coherence and policy-relevance. Attempts to address scenario misuse within the community have thus far not worked. The result has been the widespread production of myopic or misleading perspectives on future climate change and climate policy. Until reform is implemented, we can expect the production of such perspectives to continue, threatening the overall credibility of the IPCC and associated climate research. However, because many aspects of climate change discourse are contingent on scenarios, there is considerable momentum that will make such a course correction difficult and contested - even as efforts to improve scenarios have informed research that will be included in the IPCC 6th Assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate scenarios; Energy scenarios; IPCC; RCPs; SSPs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098774284

In a regional analysis, we highlight some of the political and biophysical dimensions that come along with forest transitions in the five Southeast Asian countries, interrogating these with respect to the spatial injustices they produce. We propose to read forest transitions as a combined process of separating and industrializing agriculture and forestry – at the expense of more integrated land use such as shifting cultivation.

However, the facile synthesis of Cu NPs with multiple high-index facets remains a great challenge in the research community. Herein, we have prepared numerous Cu catalysts with flat surfaces by electropolishing polycrystalline Cu foils before and after annealing at different temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 1000 °C under an argon atmosphere. The individual electrode crystal orientations were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) techniques. As confirmed by the EBSD technique, the formation of high-index facets increases with an increase in the annealing temperature and reaches a high quantity of high-index facets enclosed mainly by (211) and (431) facets with about 94% of those on the electrode annealed at 1000 °C. As a possible application, we have used the different electrodes for CO2RR at -1.0 V vs. RHE with special emphasis on the formation of H2 gas and C1 products. Thus, the electrodes prepared at higher temperatures enable the suppression of competing H2 evolution due to the increased amount of high-index facets. Moreover, the formation rates of C1 products were inhibited as well at the electrodes with increased number of high-index facets. The drops in the formation rates of both H2 and C1 products indicate that they are consumed in the chemical reaction to commence the formation of multi-carbon products. However, further study is still required with superior attention on CO2RR towards the C2+ product formation at a range of applied potentials.

In order to investigate the LCCCI of this resource, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of a WTE facility in Jamesville, NY, was performed utilizing system expansion to account for avoided landfilling emissions, additional metals recycling, and the loss of potential electricity generation from landfill gas. The LCCCI of electricity from this WTE facility ranges from 0.664 to 0.951 kg CO2eq/kWh before system expansion, which reduced the impact to-0.280 to 0.593 kg CO2eq/kWh when accounting for avoided waste management emissions. Combustion is the leading contributor of GHG emissions from cradle-to-gate, and sensitivity analysis indicates that the nonbiogenic fraction of the waste most significantly influences the LCCCI before including cobenefits. The fraction of methane from landfills that is not captured is the most influential variable under system expansion. Before system expansion, the LCCCI of this system is comparable to that of electricity from fossil fuels. With system expansion, the LCCCI ranges from below that of renewable energy to comparable to natural gas based electricity. These results disagree with claims in the reviewed literature that WTE can avoid GHG emissions overall, although avoided emissions reduce the magnitude of its impact. ©",,"Climate change; Electric power generation; Expansion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Waste incineration; Avoided emissions; Climate change impact; Electricity generation; Electricity generators; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Natural gas based; Renewable energies; Municipal solid waste; aluminum; fossil fuel; methane; natural gas; alternative energy; climate change; climate effect; combustion; electricity generation; energy planning; life cycle analysis; methane; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; electricity; energy conversion; exhaust gas; landfill; life cycle assessment; Monte Carlo method; municipal solid waste; recycling; renewable energy; sensitivity analysis; waste-to-energy; waste-to-energy plant; climate change; electricity; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Climate Change; Electricity; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100175193

A gas sweetening unit is taken as an example for the case study, with the effects of process parameters on the resultant emission being emphasized. Air and GHG calculators are developed based on up-to-date standards and national regulations concerning oil and gas processing facilities. The simulation's base case is designed to produce sweet gas with sales gas specifications using MDEA solvent, which reveals 1,527 tonnes CO2e/day (representing GHG emission) and 0.348 tonnes SO2e/day (representing air emission). Pressure decline in the sour gas stream leads to a slight increase in emission up to 1,554 tonnes CO2e/day and 0.368 tonnes SO2e/day because of the additional compression systems. Using DEA as a solvent does not significantly affect air and GHG emission for the same sweet gas specification. The simulation also revealed that the gas flow rate (capacity) is not directly proportional to the eventual emission. In this case, the driver for air and GHG emission is the reboiler's duty, dependent on the amine flow rate. As there is a critical (minimum) lean amine flow rate regarding the sour gas flow rate, the non-proportional relationship between gas flow rate and emission is expected. To produce sweet gas with LNG specification, the emission rises considerably to 2,652 tonnes CO2e/day and 0.747 tonnes SO2e/day because CO2 loading of rich amine is higher in this case, eventually increasing the reboiler duty significantly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Coal bed methane; Flow of gases; Flow rate; Hydrogen sulfide; Mathematical instruments; Smart city; Sour gas; Specifications; Air emissions; Compression system; Computational tools; Gas sweetenings; Process parameters; Process simulations; Process simulators; Proportional relationships; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102430269

It provided a unique opportunity to simulate a scenario in which the city-wide air quality improvement during the shutdown were sustained over the five-year period, 2021 through 2025, allowing us to estimate the potential public health benefits to children and adults and their associated economic benefits. We focused on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and modeled potential future health benefits to children and adults. The analysis considered outcomes in children that have not generally been accounted for in clean air benefits assessments, including preterm birth, term low birthweight, infant mortality, child asthma incidence, child asthma hospital admissions and emergency department visits, autism spectrum disorder, as well as adult mortality. We estimated a city-wide 23% improvement in PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 shutdown months compared to the average level for those months in 2015–2018 (the business as usual period). Based on the data for 2020, we extrapolated the ambient levels of PM2.5 for the following five-year period. The estimated cumulative benefits for 2021–2025 included thousands of avoided cases of illness and death, with associated economic benefits from $31.8 billion to $77 billion.

Direct funding, such as grants and subsidies, is a feasible financial instrument to enable local authorities to conduct climate mitigation projects. Current literature has largely focused on the cost-effectiveness of direct-funding instruments on carbon reduction, but little on how these instruments influence other aspects of the urban low-carbon transition. A comprehensive understanding of the role of direct funding in low-carbon transition is important, as this new understanding may potentially encourage more direct investments by cities into their low-carbon initiatives. Here we examine the direct and flow-on effects of a city-level direct-funding scheme on urban low-carbon initiatives, taking Shanghai as a case study. Our findings show that the direct results of Shanghai's fund scheme include carbon reduction outcomes and a variety of policy outputs, such as a range of subsidy policies, data reporting systems, and demonstration projects. More importantly, over the 11 years of its implementation, the fund has become a catalyst for a series of institutional changes – by enabling and enhancing cooperation across numerous government departments in Shanghai. In addition, the funding scheme created avenues for the engagement of business stakeholders and raising public awareness on low-carbon and sustainability issues, through subsidizing technology adoption and low-carbon-themed campaigns. Collectively, these processes have improved the city's capacity for achieving low-carbon transition. Our study shows that a well-designed, city-level direct-funding scheme can fill the “implementation” gap between the policy intentions (i.e., the low-carbon initiatives and implementation framework) and the policy outcomes (e.g., carbon reduction and the institutional formation in the transition). Such a scheme may also nurture and enable a pool of policy experiments and innovations for effective policy learning, identification of successful experiments, and upscaling. With these broader catalytic effects, a city-level direct fund could be a justifiable and attractive option in managing low-carbon transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Catalytic effects; Grant; Institutions for mitigation; Local capacity building; Subsidy; Urban sustainability experiment","Cost effectiveness; Investments; Climate mitigations; Data reporting system; Demonstration project; Government departments; Institutional change; Low-carbon initiatives; Low-carbon transitions; Sustainability issues; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092763420

The low-carbon city development is an important method to achieve sustainable development strategy, while it is also a new city development mode to promote natural ecology, low-carbon economy and social happiness. However, the evaluation process of the low-carbon city is a multiple objective and decision problem. A single indicator cannot comprehensively and objectively evaluate a city’s low-carbon development level, so a comprehensive evaluation index system should be established. So taking Guiyang as a case study, this article constructs 35 evaluating indicators that are based on the basic urban development level and low-carbon urban development level to analyse the economic development, social progress and environmental quality transmutation comprehensively by using the entropy method. The results show that in the whole process of sustainable development, the economic development, social progress and the environmental quality have been greatly improved, but the low-carbon level had been on the low side from 2003 to 2016 in Guiyang. Therefore, Guiyang still has a long way to go to become a low-carbon city, and concrete policies and countermeasures should be taken to promote the low-carbon level. In particular, Guiyang has to strengthen the dual constraint of carbon emission intensity and total carbon emissions, adhere to the development path characterized by low carbon and strive to achieve leapfrog development. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Guiyang; Indicator system; Low-carbon city; Low-carbon pilot cities; Sustainable development","carbon emission; development level; environmental assessment; environmental quality; greenhouse gas; sustainable development; urban development; China; Guiyang; Guizhou; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082656584

However, in certain conditions reduced tillage may increase soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, which may negate any climate gains from the potential storage of C in soil. To investigate how long-term applications of different manures interact with tillage effects on N2O fluxes during the crop rotation, we established a long-term trial in 2009 in eastern Canada, using two tillage (inversion tillage [IT]; and reduced tillage [RT],) and three fertilizer types (pig slurry, dairy slurry and a 0-N control) arranged in a split-plot design with 3 replications. The experiment was reproduced on two contrasting soil textures (silty clay and sandy loam) located approximately 900 m apart in a wheat-corn-soybean rotation. During 2016 (wheat), 2017 (corn), and 2018 (soybean) we estimated the N2O fluxes from each plot using manual static chambers for the growing season (April to November). Mean cumulative fluxes for the growing season ranged from 0.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 for the corn/control/IT to 7.6 kg N2O-N ha−1 for the wheat/dairy slurry/RT in the silty clay soils and from 0.4 kg N2O-N ha−1 for the corn/control/IT to 3.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 in the corn/pig slurry/RT in the sandy loam soils. The RT increased soil N2O fluxes for both slurry types and the control in the clay soil (mean flux for all fertilizer treatments over both seasons were 5.5 and 2.4 kg N2O-N ha−1 season−1 for the RT and IT, respectively), likely because the higher water content in the RT caused greater denitrification; while on the sandy loam the N2O flux was similar between the two tillage systems. Manure type had no measurable effect on the growing season N2O fluxes in either soil type as both provided sufficient labile N.

This has led to the recent explosion of future scenario analyses at multiple scales, further accelerated since the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) research community Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). While RCPs have been widely applied to climate models to produce climate scenarios at multiple scales for investigating climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities (CCIAV), SSPs are only recently being scaled for different geographical and sectoral applications. This is seen in the UK where significant investment has produced the RCP-based UK Climate Projections (UKCP18), but no equivalent UK version of the SSPs exists. We address this need by developing a set of multi-driver qualitative and quantitative UK-SSPs, following a state-of-the-art scenario methodology that integrates national stakeholder knowledge on locally-relevant drivers and indicators with higher level information from European and global SSPs. This was achieved through an intensive participatory process that facilitated the combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches to develop a set of UK-specific SSPs that are locally comprehensive, yet consistent with the global and European SSPs. The resulting scenarios balance the importance of consistency and legitimacy, demonstrating that divergence is not necessarily the result of inconsistency, nor comes as a choice to contextualise narratives at the appropriate scale. © 2020 The Author(s)","Environmental impact assessment; Global; Multiscale scenarios; National; Socioeconomic","Economics; Global warming; Bottom-up and top-down; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Climate projection; Higher-level information; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Participatory process; Research communities; Climate models; adaptive management; climate modeling; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; scenario analysis; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; article; climate; environmental impact assessment; human; investment; narrative; quantitative analysis; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097109512

One approach to renewable heating is leveraging improvements in PV with heat pumps (HPs). To determine the potential for PV+HP systems in northern areas of North America, this study performs numerical simulations and economic analysis using the same loads and climate, but with local electricity and natural gas rates for Sault Ste. Marie, in both Canada and U.S. Ground-mounted, fixed-tilt, grid-tied PV systems are sized to match 100% of electric loads considering cases both with and without air source HPs for residences with natural gas-based heating. For the first time the results show North American residents can profitably install residential PV+HP systems, earning up to 1.9% return in the U.S. and 2.7% in Canada, to provide for all of their electric and heating needs. Returns on PV-only systems are higher, up to 4.3%; however, the PV capacities are less than half. These results suggest northern homeowners have a clear and simple method to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by making an investment that offers a higher internal rate of return than savings accounts, CDs and GICs in both countries. Residential PV and solar-powered heat pumps can be considered 25-year investments in financial security and environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

The RACHP sector has been identified as being responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions through direct emission (leakage of high GWP refrigerants) and indirect emissions (energy use). The changes to EU's Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gas) regulation No 517/2014, which came to force since 1st January 2015, has enacted restrictions on the use of halocarbon refrigerants in certain applications with the intent of reducing the F-gas associated emissions in the EU region. There are currently inconsistent levels of knowledge and awareness of how alternative refrigerants can be sustainably procured and utilised. This paper provides an understanding of the needs for skills in some European countries, specifically covering the general overview of the “as installed“ RAC use, the current training provision, the potential use and status of alternative refrigerants and recommendations on procurement process.

Recent efforts to improve and systemise damage assessments have focused primarily on urban environments with few examples for primary industries such as dairy. This paper explores the adverse consequences of flooding on dairy farms in the Bay of Plenty region, New Zealand. Ex-tropical Cyclone Debbie in April 2017 caused prolonged riverine and surface water flooding on over 3500 hectares of dairy farmland. The event provided an opportunity to develop and apply a participatory approach for collecting information about on-farm flood damage, and both response and recovery actions implemented by dairy farmers. Semi-structured interviews and transect walks with farmers revealed a range of direct and indirect damages to production and capital assets, influenced by duration of inundation, silt deposition and seasonality. Results highlight the need to identify on-farm and off-farm asset interdependencies of dairy farm systems to estimate long-term socio-economic consequences at farm-level. Enhancing dairy farm flood resilience in a changing climate will rely on farm-level response and recovery plans, proactively supported by emergency management agencies, farm service suppliers and support agencies. © 2021 by the authors.

Changing precipitation and temperature patterns increase the frequency and severity of storms with significant impacts on watershed hydrologic processes that change the ecosystem characteristics at a landscape scale. Biota either adapts to the changes, shifts ranges, or becomes extinct or extirpated. Herpetofauna species are particularly vulnerable to these changes due to their physiology and natural history. Since reptiles and amphibians are vital components of ecosystems at large, there is a need to assess the impacts of climate change on their habitat. This study used a watershed-scale assessment of the Connecticut River watershed in the northeastern United States. The SWAT model with the Hydrologic and Water Quality System (HAWQS) interface is used to simulate watershed conditions under three scenarios: baseline, medium climate change (Representative Concentration Pathway - RCP 4.5), and high climate change (RCP 8.5). Species richness modeling from the Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is used as an indicator of herptile habitat suitability. Spatial overlay analysis is used to assess the impacts of precipitation, groundwater, and water quality on habitat suitability of herpetofauna. With the spatial assessment of vulnerable habitats under each scenario, mitigation policies are suggested through climate buffer areas and stream continuity to enable climate migration.

Recent evidence indicates that retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) astrocytes sense changes in tissue CO2/H+ to regulate respiratory activity; however, mechanism(s) by which they do so remain unclear. Alterations in inward K+ currents represent a potential mechanism by which CO2/H+ signals may be conveyed to neurons. Here, we use slice electrophysiology in rats of either sex to show that RTN astrocytes intrinsically respond to CO2/H+ by inhibition of an inward rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance and depolarization of the membrane, while cortical astrocytes do not exhibit such CO2/H+-sensitive properties. Application of Ba2+ mimics the effect of CO2/H+ on RTN astrocytes as measured by reductions in astrocyte Kir-like currents and increased RTN neuronal firing. These CO2/H+-sensitive currents increase developmentally, in parallel to an increased expression in Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in the brainstem. Finally, the involvement of Kir5.1 in the CO2/H+-sensitive current was verified using a Kir5.1 KO rat. These data suggest that Kir inhibition by CO2/H+ may govern the degree to which astrocytes mediate downstream chemoreceptive signaling events through cell-autonomous mechanisms. These results identify Kir channels as potentially important regional CO2/H+ sensors early in development, thus expanding our understanding of how astrocyte heterogeneity may uniquely support specific neural circuits and behaviors. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","astrocyte physiology; chemoreception; respiratory regulation; retrotrapezoid nucleus; slice electrophysiology","carbon dioxide; hydrogen; inward rectifying potassium 5.1; potassium channel; unclassified drug; animal experiment; Article; astrocyte; brain cortex; brain region; brain stem; cell nucleus; chemosensitivity; conductance; controlled study; depolarization; downstream processing; electrophysiology; male; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; refractory period; retrotrapezoid nucleus; signal transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089960908

The global and national limits for the climate change PB are set using the GDP-adjusted model that represents an innovative and fairer CO2 emissions distribution mechanism. It elaborates on the equity principle and distributes the remaining global emission budget to countries on the basis of their past, current, and future population; past emissions; and current state of economic development. The results point to insufficient global efforts to reduce the CO2 emissions to avoid a global temperature rise of more than 2◦C by 2100. When examining the data in accordance with this climate change scenario, we see that some countries have already spent their CO2 budget and most high-income countries will spend their remaining budget by the end of the decade. This is also the case for the Czech Republic, which exceeded the limit for the period from 2017 onwards in 2018. While the result clearly points to the urgency of the decarbonization process, it also shows that some high-income countries, including the Czech Republic, are currently emitting at the expense of other countries. On the policy level, the findings could contribute to the re-evaluation of the GHG reduction plans as well as setting more appropriate and fairer national targets. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, an unexpected increase in CFC-11 emissions beginning in 2013 has been reported, with much of the global rise attributed to emissions from eastern China3,4. Here we use high-frequency atmospheric mole fraction observations from Gosan, South Korea and Hateruma, Japan, together with atmospheric chemical transport-model simulations, to investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern China. We find that CFC-11 emissions returned to pre-2013 levels in 2019 (5.0 ± 1.0 gigagrams per year in 2019, compared to 7.2 ± 1.5 gigagrams per year for 2008–2012, ±1 standard deviation), decreasing by 10 ± 3 gigagrams per year since 2014–2017. Furthermore, we find that in this region, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) emissions—potentially associated with CFC-11 production—were higher than expected after 2013 and then declined one to two years before the CFC-11 emissions reduction. This suggests that CFC-11 production occurred in eastern China after the mandated global phase-out, and that there was a subsequent decline in production during 2017–2018. We estimate that the amount of the CFC-11 bank (the amount of CFC-11 produced, but not yet emitted) in eastern China is up to 112 gigagrams larger in 2019 compared to pre-2013 levels, probably as a result of recent production. Nevertheless, it seems that any substantial delay in ozone-layer recovery has been avoided, perhaps owing to timely reporting3,4 and subsequent action by industry and government in China5,6. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"dichlorodifluoromethane; ozone; trichlorofluoromethane; CFC; chemical pollutant; emission control; government; industrial development; Montreal Protocol; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; China; controlled study; government; industry; Japan; ozone depletion; ozone layer; simulation; South Korea; trichlorofluoromethane emission; Cheju [South Korea]; China; Gosan; Hateruma; Japan; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; Sakishima Islands; South Korea; Yaeyama Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100992295

We propose a simple analysis framework to examine critical intersections between land-management choices and the life-history conditions of selected species of concern, thereby facilitating the identification of mitigation practices that can reduce negative impacts on species at risk. We test the proposed framework through application to gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a keystone species that is the focus of conservation efforts across the southeastern region of United States of America, where wood pellets are being produced for bioenergy. Production of these wood pellets for export to Europe and Asia has drastically increased in the past decade, raising concerns about potential harm to biodiversity since many species in the forests sourcing pellet production were already at risk prior to the development of this new commodity. Identifying the mechanisms of potential impacts of wood pellet production on species of concern is essential to establishing meaningful management recommendations that can enhance conservation efforts while supporting sustainable bioenergy. By considering the intersections between life-history conditions of gopher tortoise and forest-management practices related to woody biomass extraction for pellet production, we identify several mechanisms by which the wood-pellet industry might affect this species of concern, both positively and negatively. We then identify mitigation practices that can help offset the potential impacts of logging, thinning, and dead wood removal on gopher tortoise. Our analysis framework may be transferable to other species of concern and land-management practices across diverse landscapes.

Fast ramping natural gas plants are often used for frequency regulation, but this creates emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Energy storage systems (ESSs), such as batteries and flywheels, provide an alternative frequency regulation service. However, the efficiency losses of charging and discharging a storage system cause additional electrical generation requirements and associated emissions. There is not a good understanding of these indirect emissions from charging and discharging ESSs in the literature, with most sources stating that ESSs for frequency regulation have lower emissions, without quantification of these emissions. We created a model to estimate three types of emissions (CO2, NOX, and SO2 ) from ESSs providing frequency regulation, and compare them to emissions from a natural gas plant providing the same service. When the natural gas plant is credited for the generated electricity, storage systems have 33% to 68% lower CO2 emissions than the gas turbine, depending on the US eGRID subregion, but higher NOX and SO2 emissions. However, different plausible assumptions about the framing of the analysis can make ESSs a worse choice so the true difference depends on the nature of the substitution between storage and natural gas generation. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, an accurate development of emission inventory from non-road equipment is imperative for air quality management, especially for equipment with a large population such as diesel-fueled forklifts. The objective of this paper is to characterize duty-cycle based emissions from diesel-fueled forklifts using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS). Three duty-cycles were defined in this study, including idling, moving, and working (active duty operation) and used to characterize in-use emissions for diesel-fueled forklifts. A total of twelve diesel-fueled forklifts were selected for real-world emission measurements. Results showed that fuel-based emission factors appear to have smaller variability compared to time-based ones. For example, the time-based emission factors for CO, HC, NO, and PM2.5 for forklifts were estimated to be 16.6–43.9, 5.3–15.1, 26.2–49.9, 5.5–11.1 g/hr with the fuel-based emission factors being 12.1–20.3, 4.1–8.3, 19.1–32.4, 3.5–6.5 g/kg-fuel, respectively. NO emissions appear to be the biggest concern for emissions control. Furthermore, most of the emissions factors estimated from this study are significantly different from those in both National Guideline for Emission Inventory Development for Non-Road Equipment in China and well-developed emission factor models such as NONROAD by US EPA. This implies that localized, preferably fuel-based emission factors should be adjusted based on real-world emission measurements in order to develop a representative emission inventory for non-road equipment. © 2020","Emission factors; Emission inventory; Forklifts; Non-road equipment; Portable emission measurement system (pems)","Air quality; Diesel engines; Fuels; Materials handling equipment; Quality management; Roads and streets; Emission factor model; Emission inventories; Emission measurement systems; Emissions control; Emissions factors; Real world operations; Real-world emission; Tailpipe emission; Air pollution control equipment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); diesel; emission control; emission inventory; source apportionment; traffic emission; China; gasoline; air pollutant; air pollution; China; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088315857

It is one of the economic sectors that impacts both directly and indirectly towards climate change which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. There has been a continuous trend of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions reduction technologies, but any step taken in this direction must not negatively affect farm productivity and economics. For the agriculture sector to achieve reduced GHG emission, climate-smart activities and improved food security will be needed for this sector to become a climate-smart landscape. Climate-smart technologies are effective at targeting inputs to the fields, helping to lower greenhouse gas emissions. This article explores the key sources of carbon emissions within the agriculture sector and reviews efficient ways to GHG emission via Smart Farming technology. Based on the public archive GHG datasets, we have found that livestock farming is the largest GHG emission sector among other agricultural sectors and responsible for 70% of the total emission. Besides, we also show that Queensland is the largest agricultural GHG contributor compared to other states and territories. The article also captures any possible sources within smart farming that may contribute to carbon emissions and suggest ways to reduce GHG emissions. Besides, an Australian-based best management practice approach is discussed to review the emissions reduction strategy based on climate-specific technology to help the farmers and other stakeholders take environmentally-friendly agricultural decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

This phenomenon could be explained by the overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on epithelial cell surfaces of the respiratory tract. Indeed, ACE-2 is a receptor for coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV), and ACE-2 is overexpressed under chronic exposure to air pollution such as NO2 and PM2.5. In this review, we explain that ACE-2 acts as the sole receptor for the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein. The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia. High ACE-2 expression in respiratory epithelial cells under air pollution explains the positive correlation between the severity in COVID-19 patients and elevated air pollution, notably high NO2 and PM2.5 levels. Specific areas in India, China, Italy, Russia, Chile and Qatar that experience heavy air pollution also show high rates of COVID-19 infection and severity. Overall, we demonstrate a link between NO2 emissions, PM2.5 levels, ACE-2 expression and COVID-19 infection severity. Therefore, air pollution should be reduced in places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 are unexpectedly high. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression; COVID-19 severity; environmental intervention; NO2 emissions; Particulate matters 2.5",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091187688

Urban green infrastructure, particularly trees, can mitigate this issue through cooling due to transpiration, and shading. Temperature regulation by trees depends on feedbacks among the climate, water supply, and plant physiology. However, in contrast to forest or general ecosystem models, most current urban tree models still lack basic processes, such as the consideration of soil water limitation, or have not been evaluated sufficiently. In this study, we present a new model that couples the soil water balance with energy calculations to assess the physiological responses and microclimate effects of a common urban street-tree species (Tilia cordata Mill.) on temperature regulation. We contrast two urban sites in Munich, Germany, with different degree of surface sealing at which microclimate and transpiration had been measured. Simulations indicate that differences in wind speed and soil water supply can be made responsible for the differences in transpiration. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall energy balance showed that the shading effect, which depends on the leaf area index and canopy cover, contributes the most to the temperature reduction at midday. Finally, we demonstrate that the consideration of soil water availability for stomatal conductance has realistic impacts on the calculation of gaseous pollutant uptake (e.g., ozone). In conclusion, the presented model has demonstrated its ability to quantify two major ecosystem services (temperature mitigation and air pollution removal) consistently in dependence on meteorological and site conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Microclimate model; Shading; Soil water availability; Stomatal conductance; Transpiration; Urban green spaces","water; city; ecosystem; evapotranspiration; forest; Germany; human; microclimate; Cities; Ecosystem; Forests; Germany; Humans; Microclimate; Plant Transpiration; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092716404

Then it builds a taxonomy on how science diplomacy is used in climate change mitigation and adaptation and attempts to make a synthesis of the cases.

Reactive transport model calculations indicate that sedimentation rates control the intensity of anaerobic carbon remineralization and select for the dominant anaerobic carbon remineralization pathways. Although sulfate reduction dominates the shelf station (65 m water depth), denitrification and microbial manganese reduction appear equally significant anaerobic respiration processes along the continental slope the closest to the Mississippi River, whereas microbial iron reduction does not represent an important process in these sediments. These findings suggest that the differential kinetics of manganese and iron redox transformations influence carbon remineralization processes on the continental slope. The fast kinetics of Fe2+ oxidation near the sediment-water interface and high sedimentation rates maintain Fe under the form of Fe(III) oxides and thermodynamically prevent sulfate reduction from dominating carbon remineralization processes on the slope, whereas the much slower Mn2+ oxygenation kinetics allows diffusion of Mn2+ across the sediment-water interface of the shelf station closest to the river mouth. Exposure to oxygenated bottom waters and entrainment within mobile muds typical of deltaic sediments during high riverine discharge likely promote the formation and downslope transport of Mn(III/IV) oxides within the nepheloid layer. This phenomenon appears to form a manganese ‘conveyor belt’ that selectively enriches Mn(III/IV) oxides relative to Fe(III) oxides in the deep sediment. In contrast, the intensity of anaerobic carbon remineralization processes along the eastern continental slope the farthest from the Mississippi River plume is much lower due to the low organic and lithogenic inputs, and denitrification dominates anaerobic respiration. Overall, these findings suggest that manganese cycling and its role in carbon remineralization processes in continental slope sediments exposed to large riverine inputs may be more important than previously considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Continental slope sediments; Diagenetic processes; Manganese and iron cycling; Mississippi delta; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Reduction; River-dominated margins; Sulfate","continental margin; continental slope; denitrification; entrainment; geochemistry; iron; manganese; marine sediment; oxidation; remineralization; river plume; sediment chemistry; sediment core; sediment-water interface; sedimentation rate; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098884436

We define the distribution and magnitude of periglacial rockwall slope erosion across 12 catchments in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir in the Himalaya of northern India using cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in sediment from medial moraines. Beryllium-10 concentrations range from 0.5 ± 0.04 × 104 to 260.0 ± 12.5 × 104 at/g SiO2, which yield erosion rates between 7.6 ± 1.0 and 0.02 ± 0.004 mm/a. Between ∼0.02 and ∼8 m of rockwall slope erosion would be possible in this setting across a single millennium, and &gt;2 km when extrapolated for the Quaternary period. This erosion affects catchment sediment flux and glacier dynamics, and helps to establish the pace of topographic change at the headwaters of catchments. We combine rockwall erosion records from the Himalaya of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttarakhand in India and Baltistan in Pakistan to create a regional erosion data set. Rockwall slope erosion rates progressively decrease with distance north from the Main Central Thrust and into the interior of the orogen. The distribution and magnitude of this erosion is most closely associated with records of Himalayan denudation and rock uplift, where the highest rates of change are recorded in the Greater Himalaya sequences. This suggests that tectonically driven uplift, rather than climate, is a first order control on patterns of rockwall slope erosion in the northwestern Himalaya. Precipitation and temperature would therefore come as secondary controls. © 2020.

Consequently, tremendous social responsibility lies with public health professionals and their associations. Therefore, this study addressed the following question: “How can the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) best support the goals of the European Green Deal through its network of public health schools and departments?” This study looked at the implementation of climate education in public health schools in the European region and climate action taken by these public health schools. An online survey among ASPHER members with a 51% overall response rate (excluding non-European members) shows that 64% of the responding schools provide climate-health educational offerings, while 63% consider these for the future. Additionally, most climate actions taken by the schools were ad hoc actions. These findings show that a systematic approach is missing, and there is a general lack of strategy in most schools. We consequently recommend that schools invest in climate and health education in their curricula and become exemplars for climate action to actively contribute to the achievement of Europe’s climate goals. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of primary energy is still fossil fuel, and it is urgent to reduce energy consumption in the household sector. The purpose of this paper was to identify ways to reduce household energy consumption without compromising the quality of life in residence. However, the reduction methods vary by region, building specifications, household type, equipment specifications, season, and weather. The value of this paper is based on a systematic analysis of home energy management systems (HEMS) data from about 50,000 households under various conditions. We are analyzing ways to reduce energy consumption. Few studies have analyzed this much back-up data, which is likely to lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions across the household sector. To explore ways to reduce energy consumption in this sector, the company has introduced and provided services for home energy management systems (HEMS) since 2011 and is currently collecting HEMS data for up to 50,000 households. In order to grasp the actual state of energy consumption in each household, HEMS data are systematically analyzed, necessary conditions for energy reduction and self-sufficiency rate (SSR) improvement are analyzed, and energy consumption under certain conditions is estimated using storage batteries (SB) and heat pump water heaters (HPWH). In addition, energy consumption was investigated by actual measurement and simulation for several hundred households. Since power generation and consumption vary greatly depending on the region, building specifications, household type, equipment specifications, season, weather, etc., it is necessary to analyze these factors systematically. As a conclusion, in order to improve SSR, it is necessary to (1) reduce surplus power consumption and energy consumption of heat pump water heaters (HPWHs), (2) increase solar power generation, and (3) increase the size of SB. This study contributes to the spread of advanced housing and the reduction of CO2 emissions in the household sector. © 2021 by the authors.

These measures include various schemes such as congestion charges, low emission zones (LEZs) and other traffic calming measures. In this paper, we are interested in the public acceptance of LEZs. Recent studies show high levels of public support for LEZs across Europe. However, specific research on public attitudes towards LEZs is limited. We conducted a self‐administered survey (online) among residents in Barcelona, Spain. Based on a previous analytical model, bivariate and path analysis modelling was used to examine the association between key independent variables and acceptance. The results showed that most surveyed residents had a positive attitude towards implementing the LEZ, perceiving this policy instrument as a fair and effective measure to reduce air pollution. Perceived process legitimacy, perceived global impacts and affect had a significant direct effect on acceptance. Prior attitudes and personal orientations and, to a lesser extent, personal characteristics, were indirectly associated with levels of acceptance. © 2021 by the authors.

In most cases, impacts related to the occurrence of such phenomena can be amplified due to the lack of planning and structure. In this context, the main objective of the study is to estimate the period and level of return of intense rainfall events in homogeneous subregions of the São Francisco hydrographic region, as well as to define which of these subregions are most vulnerable to the recurrence of these episodes. We used rainfall data from 105 rain gauges and streamflow data from 103 stream gauges comprising the years from 1988 to 2017. Through cluster analysis, four homogeneous rainfall subregions were defined and validated by the silhouette index, capable of identifying misallocated stations in the clustering process. A generalized Pareto distribution from the extreme value theory was used to calculate the period and level of return of intense rainfall events in each subregion. We then related the retrieved estimates with information about the drainage network, streamflow, land use and occupation, and socioeconomic and demographic factors in the watershed region. Results indicated the existence of subregions vulnerable to hydrological and geological processes intensified due to human activity and the recurrence of hydrometeorological phenomena. The scenarios found for the recurrence of intense rainfall events indicated the severity to which some subregions may be subjected, moreover, they reinforce the need for the development of public policies for the prevention and minimization of impacts. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","cluster analysis; extreme value theory; homogeneous regions; return period; São Francisco basin","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data streams; Earth (planet); Economics; Hydrographic surveys; Land use; Pareto principle; Rain gages; Stream flow; Clustering process; Demographic factors; Extreme value theory; Generalized Pareto Distributions; Geological process; Intense rainfalls; Silhouette indices; Stream-flow events; Rain; cluster analysis; extreme event; human activity; hydrography; rainfall; raingauge; return period; streamflow; Brazil; Sao Francisco Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096971506

Often, natural disturbances are compounded with anthropogenic disturbances, which may alter the trajectory of forest carbon stock recovery. Heterogeneous levels of disturbance severity in compound disturbance events add an additional layer of complexity. This paper examines the effect of a moderate-severity wind disturbance and subsequent salvage logging on forest biomass and carbon stock recovery over 19 years. We investigate the recovery of aboveground tree biomass following a wind disturbance and salvage logging and examine the role of wind disturbance severity on biomass accumulation rates. We use pre-disturbance, 3 years post-wind disturbance and 19 years post-wind disturbance measurements of tree biomass across two adjacent sites at Natchez Trace State Forest for Site A and Site B in east central Tennessee. We found no significant difference in the carbon storage at Site A (pre = 92 MgC/ha; 19 years post-disturbance = 83 MgC/ha) or Site B (pre = 66 MgC/ha; 19 years post-disturbance = 67) when comparing the pre-disturbance level of aboveground tree carbon storage with the 19-years post-disturbance levels. Furthermore, we found no evidence that salvage logging reduced the rate of live tree carbon accumulation. The corresponding rates of mean annual carbon accumulation (MgC/ha) are as follows: Site A Unsalvaged (1.07), Site A Salvaged (1.25) and Site B Salvaged (2.02). Contrary to our prediction, greater wind damage severity was weakly associated with higher rates of biomass accumulation (R2 = 0.17). While we found no negative effect of salvage logging on the aboveground tree carbon accumulation rate, salvage logging alters other carbon pools, including coarse woody debris. Salvage logging did not reduce the rate of carbon stock recovery, and a higher wind disturbance severity was associated with a greater rate of carbon stock recovery. © 2021 by the authors.

Unlike emission from the equatorial plane, the latter restrictions are crucial for photon escape when the initial polar angle of the emission point is arbitrary.

For that purpose, a novel but validated methodology is applied to CERES SYN1deg products for the period 2000–2019. Spatial distributions of AOT and PWV effects, both individually and combined, show a close link with the spatial distributions of AOT and PWV. The spatially averaged combined effect results in a −13.9% reduction in irradiance, while the average AOT effect is −2.3%, and the PWV effect is −12.1%. The temporal analysis focuses on detecting trends in the anomalies. The results show overall positive trends for AOT and PWV. Consequently, significant negative overall trends are found for the effects. However, significant positive trends for the individual AOT and the combined AOT-PWV effects are found in specific regions, such as the eastern United States, Europe or Asia, indicating successful emission control policies in these areas. This study contributes to a better understanding of the individual and combined effects of aerosols and water vapour on solar radiation at a global scale. © 2021 by the authors.

However, acquiring this knowledge can be useful for future predictions towards improved governance for sustainable development. In this study, we analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics of vegetation greenness, and identified the possible relationships with climatic factors and vulnerable plant species across Africa. Using a set of robust statistical metrics on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI3g) for precipitation and temperature over 34 years from 1982 to 2015, relevant results were obtained. The findings show that, for NDVI, the annual rate of increase (0.013 y-1) was less than that of decrease (-0.014 y-1). In contrast, climate data showed a sharper increase than a marked decrease. Temperature is increasing while rainfall is decreasing, both at a sharp rate in central Africa. In Africa, tree cover, broadleaved, deciduous, closed to open (&gt;15%) and shrubland plant species are critically endangered. The tropical vegetation devastated by the climate variability, causes different plant species to gradually perish; some were cleared out from the areas which experienced degradation, while others were from that of improvement. This study provides valuable information to African governments in order to improve environmental sustainability and development that will lead to the sustainability of natural resources. © 2021 by the authors.","Africa; Climate variability; Plant species; Vegetation dynamics","assessment method; environmental factor; environmental policy; global climate; greenspace; knowledge; NDVI; rainfall; shrubland; sustainability; vegetation dynamics; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100073211

The sources (soil and/or tree) and mechanisms driving the increase of CH4 in trees and degassing to the atmosphere are inadequately understood, particularly for coastal forests facing increased exposure to seawater. We investigated the eco-physiological relationship between tree stem wood density, soil and stem oxygen saturation (an indicator of redox state), soil and stem CH4 concentrations, soil and stem carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and soil salinity in five forests along the United States coastline. We aim to evaluate the mechanisms underlying greenhouse gas increase in trees and the influence of seawater exposure on stem CH4 accumulation. Seawater exposure corresponded with decreased tree survival and increased tree stem methane. Tree stem wood density was significantly correlated with increased stem CH4 in seawater exposed gymnosperms, indicating that dying gymnosperm trees may accumulate higher levels of CH4 in association with seawater flooding. Further, we found that significant differences in seawater exposed and unexposed gymnosperm tree populations are associated with increased soil and stem CH4 and CO2, indicating that seawater exposure significantly impacts soil and stem greenhouse gas abundance. Our results provide new insight into the potential mechanisms driving tree CH4 accumulation within gymnosperm coastal forests. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

However, if environmental conditions do not support microbial communities performing complete denitrification, other N transformation processes will occur, resulting in the export of nitrite (NO2−), nitrous oxide (N2O), or ammonium (NH4+). To identify the factors controlling the relative accumulation of NO2−, N2O, and/or NH4+ in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors, porewater samples were collected over two operational years from a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor designed for removing NO3− from mine water. Woodchip samples were collected at the end of the operational period. Changes in the abundances of functional genes involved in denitrification, N2O reduction, and dissimilatory NO3− reduction to NH4+ were correlated with porewater chemistry and temperature. Temporal changes in the abundance of the denitrification gene nirS were significantly correlated with increases in porewater N2O concentrations and indicated the preferential selection of incomplete denitrifying pathways ending with N2O. Temperature and the total organic carbon/NO3− ratio were strongly correlated with NH4+ concentrations and inversely correlated with the ratio between denitrification genes and the genes indicative of ammonification (Σnir/nrfA), suggesting an environmental control on NO3− transformations. Overall, our results for a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor operated at hydraulic residence times of 1.0–2.6 d demonstrate the temporal development in the microbial community and indicate an increased potential for N2O emissions with time from the denitrifying woodchip bioreactor. © 2020 The Authors.

To achieve this goal, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) are essential. VCMs are promoted by a spontaneous demand, not imposed by binding targets, as the regulated ones. In Italy, only in Veneto and Piedmont Regions (Northern Italy), VCMs through forestry activities were carried out. Valle Camonica District (Northern Italy, Lombardy Region) is ready for a local VCM, but carbon storage of its forests was never estimated. The aim of this work was to estimate the total carbon storage (TCS; t C ha−1) of forest biomass of Valle Camonica District, at the stand level, taking into account: (1) aboveground biomass, (2) belowground biomass, (3) deadwood, and (4) litter. We developed a user-friendly model, based on site-specific primary (measured) data, and we applied it to a dataset of 2019 stands extracted from 45 Forest Management Plans. Preliminary results showed that, in 2016, the TCS achieved 76.02 t C ha−1. The aboveground biomass was the most relevant carbon pool (48.86 t C ha−1; 64.27% of TCS). From 2017 to 2029, through multifunctional forest management, the TCS could increase of 2.48 t C ha−1 (+ 3.26%). In the same period, assuming to convert coppices stands to high forests, an additional TCS of 0.78 t C ha−1 (equal to 2.85 t CO2 ha−1) in the aboveground biomass could be achieved without increasing forest areas. The additional carbon could be certified and exchanged on a VCM, contributing to climate change mitigation at a local level. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon storage assessment; Climate change mitigation; Forest management plan; Site-specific primary data; Voluntary carbon market","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon storage; climate change; dead wood; forest management; forestry modeling; leaf litter; stand structure; Honduras; Italy; Lombardy; Piedmont [Italy]; Valle; Veneto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076888439

Despite Maasai of the Maasai Steppe being vulnerable to climate change, how communities understood and interpret climate change have received little attention. A cross-sectional study of community's perceptions of climate change and adaptation was conducted. A multinomial logistic regression in R 3.3.2 was used to analyze the determinants of adaptation decisions at a household level. Perceptions of climate change was based on experience of increasing temperature (94.4%, n = 136), insufficient rainfall with spatial-temporal variation (88.2%, n = 136) and frequent dry spell in recent years (91.2%, n = 136). Impacts of these changes were drop of livestock productivity (85.7%, n = 136), death of livestock (11.9%, n = 136) and conflicts (3.4%, n = 136). Although trekking livestock to ronjo and livestock based donation from relatives were commonly used to moderate adverse impacts of drought, at the 95% CI, at least primary education influenced household decision to move to ronjo (β = 2.5, SE = 1.2, p = 0.045) and donation (β = 3.1, SE = 1.4, p = 0.029) when compared to not adapting.

Reliable CO2 separation technology implementation with suitable CO2 handling methods is crucial to maximizing the field's potential. Dimethyl ether is one of the chemical products that can be synthesized from natural gas that can be used as a substitute fuel for LPG. In this study, we compare the techno-economic analysis of natural gas high CO2 content to dimethyl ether using two schemes of CO2 separation: controlled freeze zone (CFZ) and membrane technology with CO2 sequestration.

Herein, a dual chainmail-bearing nickel-based catalyst (Ni@NC@NCNT) was fabricated via a solvothermal-evaporation-calcination approach. In situ encapsulated N-doped carbon layers (NCs) and nanotubes (NCNTs) gave a dual protection to the metallic core. The confined space well maintained the local alkaline pH value and suppressed hydrogen evolution. Large surface area and abundant pyridinic N and Niδ+ sites ensured high CO2 adsorption capacity and strength. Benefitting from these, it delivered a CO faradaic efficiency of 94.1 % and current density of 48.0 mA cm−2 at −0.75 and −1.10 V, respectively.

Herein, biocathode MES was proposed to remove COD from high-ammonia wastewater with low carbon‑nitrogen ratio and regulate the nitrogen forms in effluent for ANAMMOX process. The biocathode was more sensitive to ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) than anode and determined the power generation of MES. With COD of 500–550 mg L−1 in influent, increasing NH4+-N from 50 to 150 mg L−1 improved maximum power output (Pmax) from 3.0 ± 0.2 to 3.4 ± 0.1 W m−3, which was then reduced with further increase of NH4+-N from 300 to 600 mg L−1. However, for the cathodic reductive current, the negative effects of ammonia only revealed with NH4+-N ≥ 450 mg L−1. The cathodic equilibrium potential drop determined the power degradation, because the increased reductive compounds (NH4+ and COD) in catholyte. The high NH4+-N reduced the abundance of denitrifiers, exoelectrogens and organic-degrading bacteria on electrodes, while that of nitrogen-fixing bacteria increased. External alkalinity addition achieved in-situ short-cut nitrification and nitrite accumulation. With comparable NH4+ and NO2−, limited NO3− and low COD, the biocathode MES effluent was then suitable for subsequence ANAMMOX process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia nitrogen loading; Bacteria community; Biocathode performance; Microbial electrochemical system; Short-cut nitrification","Alkalinity; Ammonia; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Carbon; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Electrodes; Nitration; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen removal; Chemical oxygen demand removals; Degrading bacteria; Equilibrium potentials; High ammonia wastewater; Maximum power output; Microbial electrochemical systems; Nitrite accumulation; Nitrogen fixing bacteria; Wastewater treatment; ammonia; carbon; nitrite; nitrogen; ammonia; carbon; nitrogen; ammonia; chemical oxygen demand; electrochemical method; in situ measurement; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen; sludge; wastewater treatment; alkalinity; Article; controlled study; degradation; electrochemical analysis; microbial community; microbial electrochemical system; nitrification; nitrogen-fixing bacterium; nonhuman; pH measurement; priority journal; process monitoring; sensitivity analysis; waste water management; bioreactor; denitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; waste water; water management; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092211903

The measurements were made on the island of Garpen in the Baltic Sea (56°230 N, 16°060 E) in September 2005. We found that wind speed is a major factor that is driving an exponential increase in sea spray sea salt emissions, comparable to previous studies over waters with higher salinity. We were able to show that the inclusion of a thermodenuder in the EC system allowed for the parallel measurements of the dry unheated aerosol flux (representing both organic and sea salt sea spray emissions) and the heated (300 °C) non-volatile sea salt emissions. This study’s experimental approach also included measurements of the artificial sea spray formed in a tank in locally sampled water at the same location as the EC fluxes. We attempted to use the EC aerosol flux measurements to scale the tank measurements to aerosol emissions in order to derive a complete size distribution for the sea spray emission fluxes below the size range (0.3–2 μm dry diameter) of the optical particle counters (OPCs) in the EC system, covering in total 0.01 μm to 2 μm diameter. In the wind directions with long fetches (corresponding to conditions similar to open sea), we were able to distinguish between the aerosol emission fluxes of dry aerosol and heated non-volatile (sea salt only) in the smallest size bins of the OPC, and could therefore indirectly estimate the organic sea spray fraction. In agreement with several previous ambient and tank experiments deriving the size resolved chemical mass concentration of sea salt and water-insoluble organic sea spray, our EC fluxes showed that sea sprays were dominated by sea salt at sizes -1 μm diameter, and by organics at the smallest OPC sizes. Since we used direct measures of the sea spray emission fluxes, we confirmed previous suggestions that this size distribution of sea salt and organics is a signature of sea spray aerosols. We were able to show that two sea salt source parameterizations (Mårtensson et al. (2003) and Salter et al. (2015)) agreed fairly well with our observed heated EC aerosol emission fluxes, as long as their predicted emissions were modified for the actual salinity by shifting the particle diameters proportionally to the cubic rote of the salinity. If, in addition, we added organics to the parameterized sea spray following the mono-layer model by Ellison et al. (1999), the combined sea spray parameterizations for sea salt and organics fell reasonably close to the observed fluxes for diameters > 0.15 μm, while one of them overpredicted the sea spray emissions below this size. The organic mono-layer model by Ellison et al. appeared to be able to explain most of the differences we observed between the aerosol emission fluxes with and without the thermodenuder. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we conducted a timely investigation on the changes of air quality, associated health burden and economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1 to May 2, 2020). We found an overall improvement of air quality by analyzing data from 31 provincial cities, due to varying degrees of NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO reductions outweighing the significant O3 increase. Such improvement corresponds to a total avoided premature mortality of 9410 (7273–11,144) in the 31 cities by comparing the health burdens between 2019 and 2020. NO2 reduction was the largest contributor (55%) to this health benefit, far exceeding PM2.5 (10.9%) and PM10 (23.9%). O3 instead was the only negative factor among six pollutants. The period with the largest daily avoided deaths was rather not the period with strict lockdown but that during February 25 to March 31, due to largest reduction of NO2 and smallest increase of O3. Southwest, Central and East China were regions with relatively high daily avoided deaths, while for some cities in Northeast China, the air pollution was even worse, therefore could cause more deaths than 2019. Correspondingly, the avoided health economic loss attributable to air quality improvement was 19.4 (15.0–23.0) billion. Its distribution was generally similar to results of health burden, except that due to regional differences in willingness to pay to reduce risks of premature deaths, East China became the region with largest daily avoided economic loss. Our results here quantitatively assess the effects of short-term control measures on changes of air quality as well as its associated health and economic burden, and such information is beneficial to future air pollution control. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Health economic loss; Premature mortality","Air quality; Disease control; Health risks; Losses; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Air quality improvement; Central and east chinas; Control measures; Health economics; Premature mortality; Prevention and controls; Regional differences; Willingness to pay; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; COVID-19; disease incidence; health risk; mortality; socioeconomic status; viral disease; China; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093962557

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have all-weather and all-day capability, and thus are well-suited for mapping land use land cover (LULC) in tropical regions, which are seasonally influenced by cloud cover. Understanding modified land uses and drivers of deforestation is fundamental for the development of policies and measures to reduce emissions and for developing forest reference levels. Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data present unprecedented potential since the observations are free and openly available, providing for the first regular and standardize SAR data. This study analyzes the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for LULC classification as an effort to differentiate modified land uses, which is a current need for early-warning deforestation systems. The study area covers a deforestation frontier in the Peruvian Amazon where the landscape is characterized by a mosaic of LULC types. Collect Earth Online is used for reference LULC data collection, and seven classes are defined for this study: forest, secondary vegetation, agriculture, pasture, urban, mining, water. Amplitude γo time-series spanning 2017–2019 are analyzed along with statistical metrics for each class, and a classification decision tree is developed in Google Earth Engine. Overall accuracy obtained is considered low (52%). Results show high user's accuracy for forest and water classification, a lot of confusion between agriculture, secondary vegetation, and forest, and the use of the polarization ratio VV/VH is suggested to be useful for pasture classification. The orientation of streets in a urban environment is confirmed to have high influence on backscattering response. This study provides information for future research on LULC and the identification of drivers in deforestation monitoring systems that could result in additional actionable information for decision-making. © 2020 The Authors","Amazon; Deforestation drivers; Land use; LULC; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094166696

In this article, we present an experimentally validated calendering Discrete Element Method model for LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2–based cathodes by considering explicitly both active material (AM) and carbon-binder domain (CBD). This model was coupled to a pre-existing Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics model describing the slurry equilibration and its drying and a 4D-resolved Finite Element Method model for predicting electrochemical performance. Our calendering model introduces important novelties versus the state of the art, such as the utilization of un-calendered electrode mesostructures resulting from validated simulations of the slurry and drying combined with the explicit consideration of the spatial distribution and interactions between AM and CBD particles, and its validation with both experimental micro-indentation and porosity vs. calendering pressure curves. The effect of calendering on the electrode mesostructure is analyzed in terms of pore size distribution, tortuosity factor and particles arrangement.

Polluted urban atmospheres are typically considered to be ""high-NO""environments, while remote regions such as rainforests, with minimal anthropogenic influences, are considered to be ""low NO"". However, our observations from central Beijing show that this simplistic separation of regimes is flawed. Despite being in one of the largest megacities in the world, we observe formation of gas- and aerosol-phase oxidation products usually associated with low-NO ""rainforest-like""atmospheric oxidation pathways during the afternoon, caused by extreme suppression of NO concentrations at this time. Box model calculations suggest that during the morning high-NO chemistry predominates (95 %) but in the afternoon low-NO chemistry plays a greater role (30 %). Current emissions inventories are applied in the GEOS-Chem model which shows that such models, when run at the regional scale, fail to accurately predict such an extreme diurnal cycle in the NO concentration. With increasing global emphasis on reducing air pollution, it is crucial for the modelling tools used to develop urban air quality policy to be able to accurately represent such extreme diurnal variations in NO to accurately predict the formation of pollutants such as SOA and ozone. © 2021 Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; EOS; megacity; nitric oxide; oxidation; urban pollution; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100819773

However, successful integration seems elusive, and the two goals continue to function in isolation and in parallel. This article provides empirical insights into the perceived effects of separating government institutions for DRR and CCA within the Southern African Development Community member states. A mixed method research design was applied to the study. A total of 40 respondents from Botswana, Eswatini (until April 2018 Swaziland), Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe participated in face-to-face interviews or an online survey. Five major effects of separating the organizations for DRR and CCA that impede efforts to reduce disaster risk coherently were identified: duplication of services, polarization of interventions, incoherent policies, competition for the same resources, and territorial contests. Given the continued fragmentation of institutions for DRR and CCA, highlighting these effects is important to emphasize the need for integrated approaches towards the reduction of disaster risk. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Southern African Development Community; Sustainable development","climate change; disaster management; government; integrated approach; international organization; perception; sustainable development; Africa; Namibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093978397

Most of soil functions have a microbial origin and recent findings suggest that various microbial community attributes (e.g. diversity, composition, abundance) are linked to the rate of soil functions in natural ecosystems. However, no such evidence is available from the agronomically managed systems. The types of agronomic practice and mechanisms (biotic vs. abiotic) that could impact microbial regulation of soil functions remain poorly understood. We collected soil samples from three long-term field trials across three geographically distinct regions with multiple management treatments (e.g. tillage, stubble management and fertiliser application) and measured the response of a number soil abiotic (e.g. soil aggregate stability, pH, nutrient status) and biotic (e.g. bacterial and fungal community structure, abundance of various microbial taxa) variables, and soil functions linked to nutrient cycling and nutrient availability. We used information theory and multi-model inference to identify key biotic and abiotic predictors of soil functions, and to model their response to land management through a multi-functionality index. Results indicated that no-till treatment generally impacted microbial community (42% decrease in the average gene copy number of all microbes compared to other management practices) and promoted soil structure (27% increase in the small aggregate fraction) but reduced some process rates, while stubble retention increased nutrient availability in the presence of fertilisation (59% on average). But these responses were site specific. The multi-functionality index associated with nutrient cycling declined under no-till system (47% on average) but increased when no-till was combined with stubble retention (49% on average) and fertiliser application (44%). Our modelling suggested that the best models that explained most of the variation in MF always included both abiotic and biotic variables. Amongst the latter, fungal community structure and beta(β)-Proteobacteria abundance were of importance as the model's R² dropped by 12% when biotic attributes were removed providing evidence that the link between microbial community and soil functions was maintained in agricultural soils. This study provides support for the inclusion of microbial data in decision support systems for sustainable farming practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","agricultural management practices; microbial abundance; microbial community structure; multi-functionality; soil; soil health; soil nutrients","agronomy; community ecology; fungus; microbial community; nutrient cycling; soil microorganism; zero tillage; Bacteria (microorganisms); Betaproteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096403909

Six urban canyons are selected in Ahvaz. To determine the outdoor thermal comfort range, micrometeorological measurements and questionnaire survey were conducted in July 2018. ENVI-met is used to investigate the role of urban geometry and urban shadings. To evaluate the outdoor thermal comfort, physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) is calculated using RayMan. Using the results of the field studies, the outdoor thermal comfort range in Ahvaz is obtained within 19.6 °C to 30.9 °C PET. Simulation results show that the closer the canyon orientation is to the north-south direction, the lower the air temperature (Ta) and mean radiant temperature (MRT) are. Also, by reducing the canyon aspect ratio, PET increases as well. Urban shadings decreased MRT and PET up to 34 °C and 17.6 °C, respectively. In contrast, shadings did not affect the air temperature, significantly. PET reduction caused by shadings is more notable in east-west canyons, as well as in wider canyons. MRT and PET in all cases are highly correlated to SVF. The observations showed no strong correlation between Ta, relative humidity, and wind speed, with SVF in all canyons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Outdoor thermal comfort; PET; Urban geometry; Urban shadings","Aspect ratio; Atmospheric temperature; Geometry; Surveys; Wind; Air temperature; Highly-correlated; Mean radiant temperature; Micrometeorological measurements; Outdoor thermal comfort; Physiologically equivalent temperatures; Questionnaire surveys; Strong correlation; Thermal comfort",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097582863

It is necessary for business leaders to understand the forthcoming changes that will affect their businesses in order to prepare themselves for any uncertainties and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper identifies changes that are expected to have an impact on Thailand’s energy system in the next 30 years and explores plausible scenarios for Thailand’s energy sector under such changes. The study starts with an examination of global and local circumstances. The examination pinpoints a focal issue as “to achieve sustainable development goals (SDG) by 2050”. Then, STEEP analysis is implemented to identify business drivers in social (S), technological (T), economical (E), ecological (E), and political (P) aspects. Subsequently, consultations with stakeholders are arranged to finalize the critical uncertainties. Policy and technology are found to be two of the most powerful factors affecting energy business and are, therefore, used as fundamental frameworks for scenario development. Accordingly, four plausible scenarios are derived providing different possible prospects for Thailand’s energy businesses. The findings can further be used in the analysis of national energy balance with detailed sector-by-sector projections. All of which will be beneficial in strategic energy planning at both the national and corporate level with a view to achieving the SDGs by 2050. © Copyright © 2021 Nakapreecha, Pongthanaisawan and Wangjiraniran.","carbon policies; energy business; energy challenges; energy disruption; plausible scenarios; STEEP analysis; sustainable development goal","Energy resources; Business drivers; Business leaders; Corporate level; Energy business; Energy sector; Energy systems; Scenario development; Strategic energy planning; Energy management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101517379

We investigated Quercus mongolica var. crispula trees transplanted from multiple provenances and their seedlings naturally regenerated in northeastern and southwestern test sites in Japan. The test sites and provenances were grouped into seven regions based on their geographic and climatic profiles. We defined the local population as trees from provenances in a region of either test site and the foreign population as trees from provenances in the other regions. Tree size was larger in the local population than in the foreign population in both test sites. We estimated foreign population ancestry from the allele frequencies in the local and foreign populations in each test site using microsatellite genotypes. We discriminated the local and foreign populations using foreign population ancestry although genetic differentiation between these populations were relatively low (0.022 ≤ FST ≤ 0.034). Different frequency distributions of foreign population ancestry between transplanted trees and regenerated seedlings indicated crossing between the local and foreign populations. Tree size decreased as foreign population ancestry increased in both test sites. Seedling mass increased in the northeastern test site but decreased in the southwestern test site as foreign population ancestry increased, indicating larger mass of seedlings with genetic properties of southwestern provenances.

To evaluate the role of climate change and related policies in degrading the environment and its socio-economic impacts in the PGR, we have used a variety of available global datasets and published data. The results show that the countries of the PGR pursue some types of socio-economic reforms to alleviate the impacts of climate change. However, it seems that these attempts are not compatible with the environment's capacity. The main problem stems from the fact that political differences between the PGR nations prevent them from managing the Persian Gulf environment as an integrated natural system and consequently they have to limit their efforts within their borders, regardless of what happens in other parts of the system. The shift to alternative revenue sources by the countries needs socioeconomic preparedness while there are environmental obstacles, political tensions and geopolitical rivalries. Unless there is a cooperative approach to mitigate the effects of climate change, accompanied by a reorientation of PGR economies, the situation is likely to worsen rather than improve. To address the challenges of climate change, integrated regional collaborations are needed.

Endemic plants are adapted to the Mediterranean climate in Italy and are considered in this study as markers of “ecological drought”. Endemic, endemic regionally exclusive, and total vascular plant species categories are investigated with eleven environmental variables consisting of climate, land use type, and human population. Using correlation analysis the present research analyzes associations between the three plant categories and eleven environmental variables including precipitation, temperature, soil anomaly, fAPAR, human population, and land use types. Though precipitation receives the greatest amount of attention when explaining drought, the findings of this work show that precipitation was not statistically associated with the three plant categories when considered as part of the ecological process of drought. Precipitation ranged from 551.09 to 1324.32 ​mm in 2005 and in 2018 from 579.36 to 1427.75 ​mm across the territory with some years and some regions substantially drier than others. Land conversion in square kilometers for agricultural to urbanized use changed from 259.43 to 17,423.99 ag2005 to 146.08–15,105.12 ag2018 and 45.18–2658.80 urb2005 to 158.53–5889.66 urb2018 over the study period. Results suggest ecological drought is determined through a combination of variables and the relationships between those conditions, not singly through changes in precipitation, temperature, or generalized vegetation cover. Results further suggest that land use change should be more seriously considered as a main contributor of drought conditions and as a factor of coupled biodiversity loss. © 2020 The Author(s)","Aridity; Ecological drought; Land conversion; Plant endemism; Precipitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100657910

In this paper, outdoor thermal comfort conditions and energy saving for space heating and cooling were investigated before and after the use of roof-integrated green technologies. Existing urban energy and climate models and tools were applied to an urban area located in a Turin (Italy). CitySim, ENVI-met and SOLWEIG tools and a GIS-based model were used to evaluate the mean radiant temperature and the thermal comfort of outdoor spaces before and after the use of vegetated roofs and green surfaces such as the predicted mean vote (PMV), the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) and the universal thermal climate index (UTCI). A GIS-based engineering model and CitySim tool were used to evaluate the energy saving and energy independence index for space heating and cooling after the use of green roofs and solar technologies. According to the shape and the suitability of rooftop elaborated with GIS tools, some roofs were identified as potential green roofs other as potential solar roofs for installing solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic panels. According to the results it is possible to confirm that the use of green roofs and urban greenery can decrease the mean radiant temperature until about 10°C; during summer season, improving outdoor thermal comfort conditions and energy savings with a reduction of 12% for space cooling energy consumption. © 2021 WITPress.

Despite the importance of this challenge, many developing countries do not have the required resources, specifically funding, expertise and facilities, for quantifying GHG emissions from dairy production and research. This paper aims to address this challenge by discussing the magnitude of the issue, potential mitigation approaches and benefits in quantifying GHG emissions in a developing country context. Further, the paper explores the opportunities for developing country dairy scientists to leverage resources from developed countries, such as using existing relevant GHG emission estimation models. It is clear that further research is required to support developing countries to quantify and understand GHG emissions from dairy production, as it brings significant benefits including helping to identify and implement appropriate mitigation strategies for local production systems, trading carbon credits and achieving the nationally determined contribution obligations of the Paris Agreement.

Mitigation approaches such as application of amendments, cultivation of tolerant genotypes, suitable irrigation, drainage and land use strategies, conservation agriculture, phytoremediation, and bioremediation techniques have successfully tackled the soil salinity issue, and offered associated benefits of soil carbon sequestration, and conservation and recycling of natural resources. These management practices further improve the socio-economic conditions of the rural farming community in salt-affected areas.

In this report, for the first time, we have identified potential candidate genes that might be regulated via SARS-CoV-2 induced DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 infection. At first, in silico transcriptomic data of COVID-19 lung autopsies were used to identify the top differentially expressed genes containing CpG Islands in their promoter region. Similar gene regulations were also observed in an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells (NHBE and A549). SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) in lung epithelial cells. Out of 14 candidate genes identified, the expression of 12 genes was upregulated suggesting promoter hypomethylation, while only two genes were downregulated suggesting promoter hypermethylation in COVID-19. Among those 12 upregulated genes, only HSPA1L and ULBP2 were found to be upregulated in AZA-treated lung epithelial cells and immune cells, suggesting their epigenetic regulation. To confirm the hypomethylation of these two genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection, their promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels were determined in the genomic DNA/RNA obtained from whole blood samples of asymptomatic, severe COVID-19 patients and equally matched healthy controls. The methylation level of HSPA1L was significantly decreased and the mRNA expression was increased in both asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 blood samples suggesting its epigenetic regulation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functionally, HSPA1L is known to facilitate host viral replication and has been proposed as a potential target for antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. © Copyright © 2021 Muhammad, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Cui, Hamad and Halwani.","bioinformatics; COVID-19; DNA methylation; epigenetic; HSPA1L; SARS-CoV-2","carbonyl reductase; desmocollin; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein A1L; nuclear receptor Nur77; synaptotagmin II; unclassified drug; A-549 cell line; Article; autopsy; CECR7 gene; cell specificity; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; CpG island; DERL3 gene; DNA extraction; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; down regulation; epigenetics; FOXJ1 gene; gene; gene control; gene expression; HBEC cell line (bronchial epithelium); high throughput sequencing; HS3ST2 gene; human; human cell; human tissue; KLRG2 gene; LRRC56 gene; lung epithelium; MME gene; mRNA expression level; NIPAL1 gene; pneumonia; PRADC1 gene; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SLC19A2 gene; ULBP2 gene; ULBP3 gene; upregulation; USP53 gene; virus replication; VMAC gene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102311777

Methods: A total of 7685 lung function tests were completed among 4697 urban adults in Wuhan, China. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured. Personal PM2.5 exposure levels were estimated using an estimation model from the actual measurements of individual PM2.5 levels in 191 participants. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate the association between personal PM2.5 exposure and lung function. Mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the roles of CRP, 8-iso-PGF2α and 8-OHdG in above associations. Results: After adjusting for confounders, each 10 μg/m3 increase in the previous-day personal PM2.5 exposure was associated with 2.94 mL, 2.02 mL and 16.14 mL/s decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiration volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow, respectively. The associations were more obvious among never smokers compared with current smokers. Cumulative 7-day exposure to PM2.5 led to the strongest adverse effects on lung function. Among never smokers with high PM2.5 exposure levels, a positive relationship was observed between personal PM2.5 level and urinary 8-iso-PGF2α, and 8-iso-PGF2α meditated 4.69% and 12.30% of the association between the 7-day moving PM2.5 concentration and FVC and FEV1, respectively. We did not observe a significant positive association between PM2.5 exposure and plasma CRP or urinary 8-OHdG. Conclusion: Short-term personal exposure to PM2.5 is associated with reduced pulmonary ventilation function. Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α partly mediates these associations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","C-reactive protein; Fine particulate matter; Lung function test; Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α; Urinary 8-OHdG","Biological organs; Pathology; Smoke; Actual measurements; C-reactive proteins; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Peak expiratory flows; PM2.5 concentration; Pulmonary ventilation; Short-term effects; Systematic inflammation; Function evaluation; 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; 8 isoprostaglandin F2 alpha; C reactive protein; adult; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution exposure; protein; urban area; adult; Article; China; cohort analysis; controlled study; current smoker; disease association; environmental exposure; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; inflammation; lung disease; lung function; lung function test; lung ventilation; major clinical study; male; never smoker; oxidative stress; peak expiratory flow; PM2.5 exposure; priority journal; prospective study; prostaglandin urine level; protein blood level; urban population; adverse event; air pollutant; environmental exposure; inflammation; lung; oxidative stress; particulate matter; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Adult; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Inflammation; Lung; Oxidative Stress; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091952617

This study assesses supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services in 48 Iranian soybean fields under conventional and conservation cropping systems. We hypothesize that the present agricultural soybean land use in Gorgan County is the reason for a reduced performance of ES. We updated the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) framework for mapping of ES and included new indicators like insect biodiversity, biodiversity indexes according to Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, Inverse Simpson and Margalef, soil microbial respiration, and quantification of soil conservation by using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). To quantify carbon sequestration and microbial respiration, soil samples were taken at depths of 0–30 cm before cultivation start in late May 2017 and after soybean harvest in early October 2017. Oxygen production was estimated based on net primary production. Various types of supporting services were evaluated in two general groups, including insect communities and plant biodiversity. The results show that conservation cropping systems in general provide better performing ES than conventional cropping systems. Soil microbial respiration was significantly higher in conservation fields. The average oxygen production on conventional fields was 79.9 ton per ha, compared to 59.9 ton per ha in conservation fields. The biodiversity assessment showed that species richness and all diversity indexes in conservation fields were higher than conventional agroecosystems. From a soil conservation point of view, the rates of soil erosion according to USLE were estimated at an average of 996.64 and 417.63 kg per ha under conventional and conservation fields, respectively. In a spatial distinction, the eastern part of the county exposes the highest soil erosion. Regulating services for carbon sequestration were high in the southern region and on fields close to forest ecosystems. Provisioning services of soybean yield, oil and protein contents were highest in the western and central parts and lowest in the northern part of the study area. As the first report of ecosystem services mapping in conservation and conventional cropping systems in Iran, we confirm that conservation cropping systems in general provide better performing ES than conventional cropping systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Carbon sequestration; Conservation agriculture; Conventional agriculture; GIS","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Carbon; Cultivation; Erosion; Forestry; Land use; Mapping; Oxygen; Sediment transport; Soil conservation; Soils; Soybean oil; Biodiversity indexes; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Microbial respiration; Millennium ecosystem assessments; Net primary production; Soil microbial respiration; Universal soil loss equation; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; land use change; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil respiration; soybean; species richness; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Golestan; Gorgan; Iran; Glycine max; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093668325

As an alternative to fossil fuels, the development of renewable energy technologies is one of the most important strategies. Thus, governments around the world have adopted policies to expand the share of clean energy with a view to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and many other policies. In this study, the economic evaluation and energy/exergy analysis of using renewable energy resources (wind, solar, and fuel cell) has been performed under three scenarios in Sirjan city, Iran. The studied scenarios are distinguished from each other due to the capacity to be installed, renewable energy sources type, and different work policies. Related to the photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy, different types of PV panels and wind turbines are studied, and the most favorable one is selected. Also, the best way is considered to install PV panels and fuel cells in this location based on different policies.

We find that in the 2°C scenario with EPPA's base-case technology cost and performance assumptions, CCS plays an important role in the second half of the century: by 2100 CCS is applied to almost 40% of world electricity production, with a third coming from coal with CCS and the other two-thirds from gas with CCS. Results on CCS deployment depend on the assumed fraction of carbon captured in CCS power plants, as emissions constraints get tighter and the carbon price rises. Adding options for higher capture fractions or offsetting uncaptured emissions leads to greater deployment of CCS than in the 2°C base case. We provide a sensitivity analysis by making favorable assumptions for CCS, nuclear and renewables. We also explore regional differences in the deployment of CCS. We find that US and Europe mostly rely on gas CCS, whereas China relies on coal CCS and India pursues both options. We also assess how these projections align with assessment of CO2 storage potential, and find that storage potential is larger than storage demand at both global and regional scales. Ultimately, we find that under stringent mitigation scenarios, the power sector relies on a mix of technological options, and the conditions that favor a particular mix of technologies differ by region. © 2021 The Author(s).","Carbon capture and storage; emission mitigation; energy-economic models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097197221

Carbon dioxide released by the soil during emission is of particular importance. Soil carbon dioxide emissions are closely associated with the microbiological activity of the soil and the intensity of the mineralization of organic matter, which depends on the technologies used in agriculture. One of the ways to reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is to increase its content in soils. Based on experimental studies, the paper provides a comparative assessment of methods of soil use influencing the intensity of soil CO2 emission under a moderately arid and forest-outlier steppe of the Altai Krai. The paper reveals that the traditional technology of soil use significantly enhances the intensity of CO2 emission. It negatively affects the humus state and soil fertility indicators and increases carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere.

One of the negative effects of industry is noise emissions into the surrounding environment. With the increasing concentration of the human population and the increase in industrial production, more and more people are exposed to the negative effects of noise. This article discusses a comprehensive approach to reducing noise emissions from industrial operations, and the subsequent impacts on surrounding villages and human health. The first step of the whole process is to understand the current state of the acoustic situation in industrial operation and in the nearby villages, an important part of which is the identification and localization of dominant noise sources. For this purpose, a unique noise visualization tool was used, namely, an acoustic camera. The next important step is to propose a technical solution and measures to reduce the noise of the individual source. Consequently, it is necessary to create a mathematical model, i.e., noise maps, in order to verify whether the proposed measures will be sufficient. Once the proposed measures have been implemented, verification of the effectiveness of these measures needs to be carried out through repeated noise measurements in nearby villages and also on the site of the industrial installation. The above procedure was applied to the operation of a wastewater treatment plant that was causing noise exceeding the permissible levels in the surrounding villages. The application of this approach, the implementation of the proposed measures, and the subsequent verification confirmed a significant reduction in the noise levels in the affected villages, and the measures implemented were assessed as highly effective. © 2021 by the authors.

Trend analysis, analysis of variance and binary logistic regression were used to compare emission levels and to estimate the probability of compliance to emission standards. The results showed that emission levels for carbon monoxide and oxygen increased by 2% and hydrocarbon levels doubled with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles also show a lean mixture in the air to fuel ratio calculation. Vehicles falling within a heavier weight class emit more CO2. Probability models showed that compliance to European and national standards decrease as much as 30% with age and use of the vehicles. Older commercial vehicles falling into a heavy weight class has the lowest probability of compliance with any of the emissions policies assessed. The empirical evidence of the study supports the prior evidence that age, weight and use is directly related to emissions. With the volume of end-of-life vehicles in Nigeria, more enforcement is needed to monitor maintenance and increase vehicle compliance to emission policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air-to-fuel ratio; End-of-life vehicles; European standards; Vehicular emissions","Carbon monoxide; Logistic regression; Probability; Regulatory compliance; Vehicle performance; Air to fuel ratios; Binary logistic regression; Emission standard; Emissions policies; End-of-Life Vehicles; Exhaust emission; National standard; Probability models; Commercial vehicles; automobile; combustion; compliance; developing world; exhaust emission; pollution policy; standard (regulation); Nigeria; Ogun; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099507690

However, the impacts of afforestation on local-to-regional climate is poorly understood. This study uses the Weather Research and Forecasting model to investigate the biogeophysical impacts of different forestry scenarios on the local-to-regional climate of Norway. The forestry scenarios considered are the conversion of open spaces to either evergreen forest by active afforestation or to mixed forest by natural succession. Results show both forestry scenarios lead to additional warming of surface temperatures in winter and spring (between 1.0°C and 1.5°C) and cooling in summer (between −1.6°C and −1.3°C). A temperature decomposition analysis shows that the warming in winter and spring is driven by surface albedo changes while summer cooling is driven by changes in sensible heat fluxes for afforestation and surface albedo for natural succession. Maximum 2 m air temperature increases considerably in spring in both forestry scenarios (∼0.8°C to 1.0°C). Analysis of precipitation, multiple climate indices and extremes, reveal little or no response to the different forestry scenarios. The largest societally relevant response to the forestry scenarios is the partial mitigation of the reduction in snow days expected from global warming by 10–20 days. This suggests that implementing current afforestation policies for climate mitigation in Norway may adversely exacerbate some effects of global warming locally while mitigating others. As such, the impacts of afforestation on the local-to-regional climate at high latitudes are complex and cannot support or dismiss afforestation as a climate mitigation policy. © 2020. The Authors.

Member States have a large margin of discretion when defining the requirements for nZEB. In this paper, the nZEB requirements for the renovation of residential buildings in Portugal and Spain are studied in detail (unlike the usual more general comparative studies) for a specific building typology with poor energy performance. This is done by checking whether an existing residential building, renovated with different combinations of improvements of the envelope and active systems in two comparable cities in each of these two countries, fulfills the requirements or not, and by comparing the results of CO2 emissions reductions. One of the improvements of the envelope considered are those necessary to fulfill the compulsory major renovation requirements in both countries to check how much we are already approaching to the decarbonization of the residential sector. The results show that nZEB standards applied to the renovation of typical multi-family buildings of 1961–1980 in both countries will significantly contribute to the descarbonization of the building stock for this type of building typology, with reductions of 80–96% of CO2 emissions for Portugal and 71–94% for Spain, if they are applied. However, some aspects of the regulations could possibly be improved such as more restrictive requirements for the current regulations for major renovations in Portugal or the way energy from renewable sources is ensured in Spain, among others. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building renovation; Multi-family housing; Nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB); Residential building stock; Southern Europe","Carbon dioxide; Housing; Building typologies; Comparative studies; Current regulations; Energy from renewable sources; Energy performance; Existing residential buildings; Residential building; Residential sectors; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096576035

However, little is known about the effect of Zn-N co-fertilization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or soil microbial processes involved in N2O fluxes under non-flooded irrigated conditions (during the dry season). Under these conditions, water-filled pore space continuously fluctuates following a periodic pattern and soil temperatures are in the optimum range for soil microorganisms. In this context, a field experiment was conducted using a maize (Zea mays L.) crop treated with two N levels (no N application and 120 kg N ha−1 as urea), and three Zn sources (no Zn application, Zn sulphate, and Zn applied with a mixture of chelating compounds, DTPA-HEDTA-EDTA). Nitrous oxide, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured using opaque chambers, as well as the total abundances of soil bacteria, archaea and nitrifier and denitrifier communities. Zn-N co-fertilization increased cumulative N2O emissions from 0.36 kg N-N2O ha−1 (for urea combined with Zn chelates) to 0.76 kg N-N2O ha−1 (for urea combined with Zn sulphate), with respect to urea without Zn application. The N2O emission factors were lower (0.34%–0.72%) than the IPCC default value of 1%. Total abundances of the nosZ denitrification gene, which is involved in the reduction in N2O to dinitrogen (N2), were reduced by 75% on average in the plots that received Zn fertilizers. This reduction may explain the higher N2O emissions in these treatments. In contrast with the case with non-irrigated crops, Zn-N co-fertilization cannot be recommended as a strategy to mitigate N2O emissions in irrigated maize under semi-arid conditions, despite of the enhancement of Zn availability in soil. © 2020 The Authors","Calcareous soil; Global warming potential; Microbial populations; Micronutrient chelate; Nitrogen cycling; Zn biofortification","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Chelation; Crops; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Chelating compound; Emission factors; Field experiment; Maize (Zea mays L.); Microbial communities; Semi-arid conditions; Soil micro-organisms; Water-filled pore space; Zinc compounds; carbon dioxide; chelation; environmental factor; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; maize; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pore space; semiarid region; soil temperature; zinc; Bacteria (microorganisms); Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091216720

The governing role of photo-induced electron transfer (PET) rates and active intramolecular motions of non-interacting PHQ monomers at lower water fraction comprising mixed solvent systems have been identified to be the prime reasons for non-radiative annihilation of photoexcited states. The transition from weakly emissive to highly emissive state has been substantiated through elaborate study using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), fluorescence quantum yield and variation of external control experiments. In the current study, the increased rotational relaxation time of aggregated hydrosol, responsible for AIEE, is investigated using time-resolved anisotropy measurement (TRAM) of different PHQ microenvironments, which is unprecedented to the best of our knowledge in AIEE research. Interestingly, the high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image shows one dimensionally grown molecular entity of a single nano-sheet like structure of PHQ, which is a unique observation. The average particle size of PHQ aggregates is also increased from 84.5 nm to 814 nm corresponding to 10% and 90% fw (water volume %) system respectively. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) has also been employed, for the first time in AIEE research, which reveals a gradual increase in the amount of carbon within the aggregated microstructure with addition of water.

The quality of what are commonly known as first and last mile connections (regardless of their length) can have an important impact on transit ridership. Transit agencies throughout the world are developing innovative approaches to improving first and last mile connections, for example, by partnering with ridehailing and other emerging mobility services. A small but growing number of transit agencies in the U.S. have adopted first and last mile (FLM) plans with the goal of increasing ridership. As this is a relatively new practice by transit agencies, a review of these plans can inform other transit agencies and assist them in preparing their own. Four FLM plans were selected from diverse geographic contexts for review: Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro), Riverside (CA) Transit Agency (RTA), and Denver Regional Transit District (RTD), and City of Richmond, CA. Based on the literature, we developed a framework with an emphasis on transportation equity to examine these plans. We identified five common approaches to addressing the FLM issue: spatial gap analysis with a focus on socio-demographics and locational characteristics, incorporation of emerging mobility services, innovative funding approaches for plan implementation, equity and transportation remedies for marginalized communities, and development of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructures surrounding transit stations. Strategies in three of the plans are aligned with regional goals for emissions reductions. LA Metro and Riverside Transit incorporate detailed design guidelines for the improvement of transit stations. As these plans are still relatively new, it will take time to evaluate their impact on ridership and their communities' overall transit experience. © 2021 by the author.

In semi-arid northern Ghana, where over 73% of the population is engaged in smallholder agriculture, climate-induced food insecurity is of major concern. Livelihood diversification is acknowledged to have the potential to improve climate resilience in smallholder farming systems through risk spreading. That notwithstanding, little is known about the links between livelihood diversification strategies and climate resilience in such vulnerable settings. Drawing data from a cross-sectional survey with 1100 smallholder households in semi-arid northern Ghana, this study contributes to the literature by examining the association between livelihood diversification and climate change resilience. Findings from logistic regression analysis revealed that smallholder farming households that practiced only farm diversification (OR = 4.66; p ≤ 0.001) and a combination of both farm and nonfarm diversification (OR = 6.28; p ≤ 0.001) had significantly higher odds of reporting stronger resilience to climate change compared to those who did not employ any diversification strategy. The study further revealed that land preparation techniques, source of climate information, and religion were significantly associated with smallholder farmers’ perceived climate change resilience. These findings point to the need for agricultural policy to promote both farm and nonfarm livelihoods as complementary risk-spreading strategies. Exploring the synergies between farm and nonfarm livelihoods may prove beneficial in semi-arid agrarian contexts. In doing so, critical contextual dynamics such as source of farm power and sources of climate information must not be overlooked. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Ghana; Livelihood diversification; Resilience; Semi-arid","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Logistic regression; Agricultural policies; Climate information; Cross-sectional surveys; Diversification strategies; Farming system; Food insecurity; Preparation technique; Smallholder farmers; Climate change; climate change; divergence; household energy; literature review; livelihood; perception; risk assessment; semiarid region; smallholder; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101542820

We examine the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria and explore interactions between climatic, agronomic, hydrological, and socio-economic conditions and processes to provide policy advice. The assessment is conducted with a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework to analyze impacts on land and irrigation water use, land management, and net benefits of agricultural production. The model results show that with imposed groundwater restrictions for irrigation, land use shifts from irrigated vineyards to mostly rainfed cropland with declining regional net benefits of agricultural production. The direction of change is similar for a DRY, SIMILAR, and WET climate scenario, while the magnitude differs. We estimate that an increase of the marginal value of groundwater extraction for irrigation by 0.1 €/m3 results in an average decrease in groundwater extraction volumes by 17.2 Mm3 in DRY, 6.3 Mm3 in SIMILAR, and 6.4 Mm3 in WET. Furthermore, regional net benefits of agricultural production decrease by 3.4 M€ in DRY and SIMILAR, and by 1.6 M€ in WET, on average.

However, selecting the best alternative of PV system remains a problem in developing countries, often involving both stakeholders’ interests and multiple objectives. This research proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) taking into account best-worst method (BWM) and VIKOR method for suitable PV alternatives. The combination provides high accuracy, faster data collection, and reliable performance compared to other methods. A case study in Tomia Island in Indonesia is used to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches. The result shows that the best scenario is a full PV installation by combining two villages into one system. It offers the highest power and can be used not only for daily access to electricity but also to support economic activities such as tourism and aquaculture. Despite offering some economic benefits, hybrid alternatives that incorporate non-renewable energy as the main source of energy are less preferred by decision-makers due to low power generation and insignificant carbon reduction. © 2021, Aalborg University press.

Having an accurate and timely estimation of the total energy demand of EVs defines the interaction between customers and the electrical power grid, considering the traffic flow, power demand, and available charging infrastructures around a city. The existing EV energy prediction methods mainly focus on a single electric vehicle energy demand; to the best of our knowledge, none of them address the total energy that all EVs consume in a city. This situation motivated us to develop a novel estimation model in the big data regime to calculate EVs’ total energy consumption for any desired time interval. The main contribution of this article is to learn the generic demand patterns in order to adjust the schedules of power generation and prevent any electrical disturbances. The proposed model successfully handled 100 million records of real-world taxi routes and weather condition datasets, demonstrating that energy consumptions are highly correlated to the weekdays’ traffic flow.

Data-driven retrofit scenarios have been simulated considering a condominium constituted by eighty-seven units, located in the North-West of Italy. Different technology mixes (including roof-top photovoltaic, air-source heat pump, battery energy storage, and electric vehicles chargers) supplying for the electric and head demands have been simulated. The techno-economic feasibility of each retrofit scenario has been evaluated along with its compliance with the EU climate target by a multi-criteria analysis. The retrofit with roof-top photovoltaic systems always leads to positive environmental and economic indicators. Besides, it also reaches the highest internal rate of return of 18.2%. The air-water heat pump helps in reducing the total primary energy demand of −26% and the CO2 emission of −30%. Nonetheless, it introduces electric load-volatility on the electric grid that appears to be even more challenging than the photovoltaic intermittency. This issue can be conditioned by installing a storage system smoothing the heat pump load-volatility. The charge of electric vehicles within the condominium also has a global positive effect as it increasing the self-consumption up to 9.5%. The multi-criteria analysis shows that the diffusion of condominium energy communities by itself does not guarantee the pursue of the European Union decarbonization roadmap. In fact, if the purpose of condominium energy communities is not well channeled to the citizen, by giving them other forms of incentives besides the economic ones, they might still opt for the economic benefit over the environmental one jeopardizing the potential benefit related to energy communities initiatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building; Data-driven; Electric vehicle; Energy community; Heat pump; Storage","Air; Air source heat pumps; Apartment houses; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Earnings; Electric loads; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Retrofitting; Roofs; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage; CO2 emission reduction; Electric vehicles chargers; Internal rate of return; Multi Criteria Analysis; Photovoltaic systems; Primary energy demand; Techno-economic feasibility; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092618181

Incorporating uncertainty associated with both climate change and the range of possible adaptation measures is essential for projecting the evolving exposure to coastal flooding and erosion, as well as associated community vulnerability through time. A spatially explicit agent-based modeling platform, that provides a scenario-based framework for examining interactions between human and natural systems across a landscape, was used in Tillamook County, OR (USA) to explore strategies that may reduce exposure to coastal hazards within the context of climate change. Probabilistic simulations of extreme water levels were used to assess the impacts of variable projections of sea-level rise and storminess both as individual climate drivers and under a range of integrated climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, policy drivers, modeled both as individual management decisions and as policies integrated within adaptation scenarios, captured variability in possible human response to increased hazards risk. The relative contribution of variability and uncertainty from both climate change and policy decisions was quantified using three stakeholder relevant landscape performance metrics related to flooding, erosion, and recreational beach accessibility. In general, policy decisions introduced greater variability and uncertainty to the impacts of coastal hazards than climate change uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty across a suite of coproduced performance metrics can help determine the relative impact of management decisions on the adaptive capacity of communities under future climate scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

This results in increased excess renewable electricity (ERE) at times when supply exceeds demand. ERE can be utilized as a low-emission energy source for sector coupling through hydrogen productionviaelectrolysis, which can be used directly or combined with a carbon source to produce electrofuels. Such fuels are crucial for the transport sector, where renewable alternatives are scarce. However, while ERE increases with raising VRE shares, carbon emissions decrease and may become a limited resource with several usage options, including carbon storage (CCS). Here we perform a model based analysis for the German case until 2050, with a general analysis for regions with a high VRE reliance. Results indicate that ERE-based electrofuels could achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement of 74 MtCO2eq yearly (46% of current German transport emissions) by displacing fossil fuels, at high fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) shares, at a cost of 250-320 € per tCO2eq. The capital expenditure of electrolysers was found not to be crucial for the cost, despite low capacity factors due to variable ERE patterns. Carbon will likely become a limiting factor when aiming for stringent climate targets and renewable electricity-based hydrocarbon electrofuels replacing fossil fuels achieve up to 70% more GHG abatement than CCS. Given (1) an unsaturated demand for renewable hydrocarbon fuels, (2) a saturated renewable hydrogen demand and (3) unused ERE capacities which would otherwise be curtailed, we find that carbon is better used for renewable fuel production than being stored in terms of overall GHG abatement. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Carbon capture; Costs; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Capital expenditures; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas abatements; Model-based analysis; Renewable electricity; Renewable hydrogens; Transport emissions; Fossil fuels; abatement cost; alternative energy; carbon emission; cost analysis; electric vehicle; electricity; electricity supply; fuel; greenhouse gas; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100719047

Improvement in public transportation services was needed to decrease the number of private vehicles, which was directly proportional to fuel consumption. Our previous study regarding public transport had been carried out by measuring the contribution of Trans Metro Bandung (TMB) to the emissions in Bandung City. Emissions from other modes of public transportation such as Angkot (fleet of minibus), which had a greater number of units and routes compared to other modes was also needed to be elucidated. This research seeks to identify the contributions of Angkot emissions based on fuel consumption (Tier 2). The results showed that Angkot had a higher contribution to the emissions in Bandung City compared to the contribution of TMB. Therefore, a comprehensive transportation policy scheme was required to create a more integrated management of public transportation and emission standard. Enforcement to the Angkot operators was needed to apply and improve their service management. Thus, in the future, Angkot will be more environmentally friendly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fleet operations; Greenhouse gases; Smart city; Transportation routes; Comprehensive transportation; Emission standard; Greenhouse gas production; Integrated management; Public transportation; Public transportation services; Service management; Transportation policies; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102476792

The integration of renewable energy sources, and particularly of photovoltaic (PV) panels, is becoming an increasingly widespread solution for reducing the carbon footprint of building energy systems (BES). However, the volatility of the energy generation and its mismatch with the typical demand patterns are cause for concern, particularly from the viewpoint of the management of the power grid. This paper aims to show the influence of the orientation of photovoltaic panels in designing new BES and to provide support to the decision making process of optimal PV placing. The subject is addressed with a mixed integer linear optimization problem, with costs as objectives and the installation, tilt, and azimuth of PV panels as the main decision variables. Compared with existing BES optimization approaches reported in literature, the contribution of PV panels is modeled in more detail, including a more accurate solar irradiation model and the shading effect among panels. Compared with existing studies in PV modeling, the interaction between the PV panels and the remaining units of the BES, including the effects of optimal, scheduling is considered. The study is based on data from a residential district with 40 buildings in western Switzerland. The results confirm the relevant influence of PV panels’ azimuth and tilt on the performance of BES. Whereas south-orientation remains the most preferred choice, west-orientationed panels better match the demand when compared with east-orientationed panels. Apart from the benefits for individual buildings, an appropriate choice of orientation was shown to benefit the grid: rotating the panels 20° westwards can, together with an appropriate scheduling of the BES, reduce the peak power of the exchange with the power grid by 50% while increasing total cost by only 8.3%. Including the more detailed modeling of the PV energy generation demonstrated that assuming horizontal surfaces can lead to inaccuracies of up to 20% when calculating operating expenses and electricity generated, particularly for high levels of PV penetration. © Copyright © 2021 Middelhauve, Baldi, Stadler and Maréchal.","building energy systems; global warming potential; mixed integer linear programming; multi objective optimization; photovoltaic systems; power network integration; renewable energies; roof orientation","Carbon footprint; Decision making; Housing; Integer programming; Intelligent buildings; Linear programming; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Building energy systems; Decision making process; Integration of renewable energies; Mixed-integer linear optimizations; Optimization approach; Orientation of photovoltaic panels; Residential building; Residential districts; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102143833

We hypothesised that specific PM2.5 components are responsible for the health effects, and investigated the association between PM2.5 components and mortality in 23 Tokyo wards. We obtained mortality data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the period from April 2013 to March 2017. At a monitoring site within the study area, we collected daily samples of PM2.5 on a filter, and determined the daily mean concentrations of total carbon (organic carbon and elemental carbon) and ions such as nitrate and sulphate. A case-crossover design was employed, and a conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the strength of the association. Over the study period, we identified 280,460 total non-accidental deaths, and the average daily mean concentration of total PM2.5 was 16.0 (standard deviation = 8.9) μg/m3. We observed a positive association of total PM2.5 with total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. After adjustment for total PM2.5 and its components associated with mortality in the single-component models, the percentage increase per interquartile range (2.3 μg/m3) increase in the average total carbon concentration of the case- and previous-day was 2.1% (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 3.1%) for total mortality. Carbon elements were associated with respiratory but not cardiovascular mortality.

However, variation in rainfall continentality can produce striking vegetation differences. We aim to disentangle summer water balance from winter rainfall continentality, to better understand how climate regulates the distributions of woody plants in the western USA. Location: Western USA. Time period: Actual. Major taxa studied: Angiosperms and conifers. Methods: We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to investigate correlations between rainfall continentality, summer water balance, minimum winter temperature and length of growing season on the distributions of 130 tree and shrub species in 467 plots. Rainfall continentality was calculated using the Gams index, modified for winter precipitation, and summer water balance with the ratio of summer precipitation to temperature. We estimated actual evapotranspiration (AET), deficit (DEF), mean annual temperature and rainfall from global gridded data sets and correlated them with RDA axes. Results: Rainfall continentality measured with the Gams index and minimum temperatures best explained the contrast between oceanic vegetation in the Pacific Coast Ranges and continental vegetation in the Intermountain Region and Rocky Mountains. Growing season length (GSL) was the second strongest factor correlated with vegetation distributions. Summer water balance, despite being the most widely used climatic factor to assess drought stress in biogeography, was the third strongest factor correlating with vegetation classes of the western US. AET was equally correlated with RDA axes 1 and 3, and, thus, could not discriminate between the contrasts in the RDA. Main conclusions: Rainfall continentality measured with the winter Gams index provides a more precise metric than summer water balance for understanding the biogeography of woody plants in the western USA. Broadly integrating the Gams index of continentality into plant distributions may improve our understanding of biogeographical distributions and predictions of responses to climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","drought; growing season length; minimum temperature; rain shadow effects; rainfall continentality; water balance; western USA; winter rainfall","climate change; correlation; drought; numerical model; rainfall-runoff modeling; temperature effect; temperature profile; water budget; winter; United States; Coniferophyta; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096829833

This paper applies Data Envelopment Analysis, namely the Bounded-adjusted Measure (BAM) relying on the additive structure, to measure the technical inefficiency and productivity change across TRTAs in China. The technical inefficiency and productivity change observed for TRTAs are 0.29 and 2.29% respectively. The decomposition results indicate that industrial energy consumption, industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2), and industrial soot &amp; dust emissions are the main variables causing TRTAs’ industrial operation inefficiency. Spatially, environmental inefficiency of the above-mentioned three variables in North China Urban Agglomeration (NA) is higher than those in Northwest, Yangtze and Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomerations (NWA, YRDA, and PRDA respectively). Decomposition of the Gini coefficient shows that the performance associated with the three variables varies among the regions with intra-regional differentiation of the PRDA being the highest. Given the regional patterns in productivity change, more efforts should be directed towards improving technical progress on industrial energy conservation in NWA. Furthermore, regulations on industrial air pollutant emissions, joint mitigation and monitoring of the key indicators in PRDA should also be emphasized. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bounded-adjusted measure; Industrial air pollutant emissions; Industrial energy consumption; Luenberger productivity indicator; Three Regions and Ten Urban Agglomerations","Agglomeration; Data envelopment analysis; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Productivity; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Air pollutant emission; Industrial energy conservation; Industrial energy consumption; Industrial operations; Productivity changes; Productivity growth; Technical progress; Urban agglomerations; Air pollution; agglomeration; data envelopment analysis; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy conservation; energy use; industrial emission; mitigation; pollutant removal; pollution control; pollution monitoring; sustainable development; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097387264

However, the actual energy-saving effect of Chinese households is under expectation. One reason for this is because household energy consumption is locked in at a certain level, which has become an obstacle to household carbon emission reduction. In order to reduce this obstacle, this study explored the cause of household carbon lock-in based on grounded theory, targeting newly furnished households. A theoretical model was developed to reveal the formation mechanism of carbon lock-in effect in the purchasing process of household energy-using appliances. NVivo 12 software was used to analyze the decoration diaries of 616 sample households, and the results showed that (1) the direct antecedent of the household carbon lock-in effect was the lock-in of purchasing behavior, and the household carbon lock-in effect was mainly exhibited in the consumption path dependence (of energy-using appliances) and the solidification of energy structure; (2) the willingness to purchase household appliances was the direct antecedent of purchasing behavioral lock-in, and the cost had a moderating effect on the transformation from purchase willingness to behavioral lock-in; and (3) in the process of purchasing household appliances, reference groups, value perception, and ecological awareness can promote purchasing behavioral lock-in by affecting willingness of purchase. Suggestions to promote unlocking of household carbon were also proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

In Namibia, community conservancies are being established since the 1990s mainly to reconcile wildlife conservation and rural development. As Namibia gears up for participation in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), land use and land cover change and related biomass carbon dynamics may become increasingly important additional outcome indicators for the country's approach to CBNRM. Based on a social-ecological conceptual framework, we identify spatially heterogeneous local context factors that may drive positive and negative effects of CBNRM on vegetation cover in Namibia's Zambezi region. We test our theoretical predictions using panel data in a spatially explicit, quasi-experimental evaluation design and find that, on average, CBNRM somewhat increased elephant presence, but had a negative effect on woodland cover. Heterogeneous treatment effect analysis indicates that CBNRM does work for woodland conservation when communities are located in and around wildlife corridors, which provide tourism income opportunities. Despite success in stabilizing wildlife populations in the region, our results suggest that complementary conservation incentives may be required to make Namibia's CBNRM model fit for REDD+. © 2020 The Authors",,"land cover; nature conservation; rural development; social participation; tourism; wild population; woodland; Namibia; Zambezi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093122031

However, HT-ATES causes temperature fluctuations in groundwater ecosystems potentially affecting important microbial-mediated ecosystem services. Hence, assessing the impact of increasing temperatures on the structure and functioning of aquifer microbiomes is crucial to evaluate potential environmental risks associated with HT-ATES. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature variations (12-80°C) on microbial communities and their capacity to mineralize acetate in aerobically incubated sediment sampled from a pristine aquifer. Compared to natural conditions (12°C), increased acetate mineralization rates were observed at 25°C, 37°C and 45°C, whereas mineralization was decelerated at 60°C and absent at 80°C. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the bacterial diversity in acetate-amended and non-acetate-amended sediments decreased with rising temperatures. Distinct communities dominated by bacterial groups affiliated with meso- and thermophilic bacteria established at 45°C and 60°C, respectively, while the number of archaeal phylotypes decreased. The changes in microbial diversity observed at 45°C and 60°C indicate a potential loss of ecosystem functioning, functional redundancy and resilience, while heat storage at 80°C bears the risk of ecological collapse. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, but the origin is still unclear. The detection of counterparts at higher energies with the next generation of Cherenkov telescopes will be determinant to constrain the underlying emission mechanisms. We aim at studying the capability of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to explore the physics behind the flares, by performing simulations of the Crab nebula spectral energy distribution, both in flaring and steady state, for different parameters related to the physical conditions in the nebula. In particular, we explore the data recorded by Fermi during two particular flares that occurred in 2011 and 2013. The expected GeV and TeV gamma-ray emission is derived using different radiation models. The resulting emission is convoluted with the CTA response and tested for detection, obtaining an exclusion region for the space of parameters that rule the different flare emission models. Our simulations show different scenarios that may be favourable for achieving the detection of the flares in Crab with CTA, in different regimes of energy. In particular, we find that observations with low sub-100 GeV energy threshold telescopes could provide the most model-constraining results. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","instrumentation: Detectors; stars: Flare; supernovae: Individual: Crab Nebula",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100334210

The methodology is based on the Pooled Mean Group (PMG), which is appropriate for a heterogeneous panel. Findings reveal that energy use negatively impacts CO2 emissions in Algeria, South Africa, Morocco, and the panel, in the short-run; however, it positively impacts CO2 pollution in Nigeria, Egypt, and the panel, in the long-run. Again, investment exerts a positive effect on CO2 in South Africa and Algeria, whereas it is negative in Nigeria, Egypt, and Morocco. Capital investment also expands short-run pollution in the panel, but it reduces long-run pollution. Lastly, the energy-investment interaction reduces the panel’s CO2 pollution in the short-run and long-run, as well as, in Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa, except in Algeria.

An often-overlooked variation where pressure falls to negative pressure or tension can operate whenever aquifer formations dry out, for instance, in deep storage (nuclear or industrial wastes, long-term CO2 mitigation, short-term energetic resources, etc.). This can generate capillary tension within the aquifers. This study investigates the mechanical effect of such in-pore tension in the surrounding crystal field, through laboratory experiments at the one-pore scale. Microthermometric procedures were carried out on synthetic fluid inclusions to generate large tensile stress and were combined with Raman microspectrometry to visualize the resulting stress fields in the host quartz. For comparison, we numerically modeled the stress field by linear elasticity theory. The experiments demonstrate that significant damage is produced in crystalline materials by the pore tension. Despite the induced stress measured by micro-Raman spectrometry to remain moderate, it is able to fracture the quartz. The volume of the cavity is a prominent controlling parameter for the stress amplitude. The crystalline heterogeneities of the solid are another major parameter for localizing the mean weak stress and accumulating overstress. Our results call for bringing pore-scale micromechanics into the safety assessment of the geological storage of various wastes inside depleted aquifers.

Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides a unique opportunity to characterize the long-term trends of ground-level PM2.5 at high spatial resolution. However, the missing rate of AOD in Northeastern China (NEC) is very high, especially in winter, and challenges the accuracy of long-term predictions of PM2.5 if left unresolved. Using random forest algorithms, this study developed a gap-filling approach combing satellite AOD, meteorological data, land use parameters, population and visibility in the NEC during 2005–2016. The model, including all predictors, combined with a model without AOD was able to fill the gap of PM2.5 predictions caused by missing AOD at 1-km resolution. The R2 (RMSE) of the full-coverage predictions was 0.81 (18.5 μg/m3) at the daily level. Gap-filled PM2.5 predictions on days with missing AOD reduced the relative prediction error from 28% to 2.5% in winter. The leave-one-year-out-cross-validation R2 (RMSE) of the full-coverage predictions was 0.65 (16.3 μg/m3) at the monthly level, indicating relatively high accuracy of predicted historical PM2.5 concentrations. Our results suggested that AOD helped increase the reliability of historical PM2.5 prediction when ground PM2.5 measurements were unavailable, even though predictions from the AOD model only accounted for approximate 37% of the whole dataset. Predicted PM2.5 level in NEC have increased since 2005, reached its peak during 2013–2015, then saw a major decline in 2016. Our high-resolution predictions also showed a south to north gradient and many pollution hot spots in the city clusters surrounding provincial capitals, as well as within large cities. Overall, by combining predictions from the AOD model with higher accuracy and predictions from the non-AOD model to achieve full coverage, our modeling approach could produce long-term, full-coverage historical PM2.5 levels in high-latitude areas in China, despite the widespread and persistent AOD missingness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","AOD; Gap-filling; Northeastern China; PM2.5; Random forest","Air pollution control; Decision trees; Land use; Meteorology; Population statistics; Aerosol optical depths; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High spatial resolution; High-resolution prediction; Long-term prediction; Random forest algorithm; Short-term exposure; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; land use change; optical depth; particulate matter; pollution control; prediction; satellite altimetry; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097163389

Field tests were conducted on artificial mounds and bare sandy land located in Ulan Buh Desert, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. Results showed that the MICP method could significantly enhance the bearing capacity and wind erosion resistance of the surficial soil through the formation of soil crusts. The optimal cementation solution (containing equimolar urea and calcium chloride) concentration and spraying volume, were 0.2 M and 4 L/m2, respectively. Under this condition, the soil crusts, with a thickness of 12.5 mm and a calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of 0.57%, remained intact on the surface of man-made mounds after being exposed to a 30 m/s wind for 2 min. For the sandy land, the soil bearing capacity could reach its maximum of 459.9 kPa (as measured with a 6 mm-diameter handheld penetrometer) within three days, and the depth of wind erosion was approximately zero after 30 days of exposure to the local weather conditions. Furthermore, the biocementation method showed its ecological compatibility at the optimal dosage. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) confirmed the bridge effect of CaCO3 crystals. Longer-term durability of MICP treatment was evaluated, and the results showed that soil bearing capacity and wind erosion resistance of the sandy land was significantly improved over 180 days. These findings suggest that MICP is a promising candidate to protect desert soils from wind erosion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biocementation; Calcium carbonate; Desert soil; Field tests; Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP); Wind erosion control","Bearing capacity; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Calcium chloride; Carbonation; Erosion; Landforms; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; Urea; Biocementation; Carbonate precipitation; Energy dispersive x-ray; Local weather conditions; Microbially induced carbonate precipitations (MICP); Optimal dosage; Soil bearing capacity; Surficial soils; Soil conservation; bearing capacity; calcium carbonate; desert soil; erosion control; field method; microbial activity; precipitation (chemistry); sandy soil; wind erosion; China; Nei Monggol; Ningxia Huizu; Ulan Buh Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091073159

In response, the U.S. Congress enacted Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA) in 1990 to reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants. This study reports trends in wet-precipitation chemistry in response to emissions reductions implemented as part of the CAA. Trends were calculated for sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) from 1985 to 2017 at 168 stations operated by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP); stations were divided into 9 regions across the United States. Trend analyses were conducted for three time periods: Period 1 (1985–1999), Period 2 (2000–2017), and the entire study period (1985–2017). Seasonal and regional Kendall trend analyses reveal significant decreasing trends in mean wet-precipitation SO4 concentrations in all 9 regions during the entire study period. The largest decreasing trends in monthly mean SO4 precipitation-weighted concentrations were measured in the Mid-Atlantic (−1.29 μeq/l/yr), Midwest (−1.15 μeq/l/yr), and Northeast regions (−1.10 μeq/l/yr). The trends in monthly mean NO3 concentrations were not as strong as those for SO4, but all of the regions had significant decreasing trends in NO3 and again the Mid-Atlantic (−0.53 μeq/l/yr), Midwest (−0.44 μeq/l/yr), and Northeast regions (−0.50 μeq/l/yr) had the strongest trends. Trends were steepest during Period 2 for SO4 and NO3, in fact for NO3 86% of the stations had significant decreasing trends during Period 2 while only 8% of the stations had significant decreasing trends during Period 1. The stations with the highest concentrations of SO4 and NO3 at the beginning of the study had the strongest decreasing trends and the relations were stronger during Period 2 than Period 1. For NH4, 22% of the stations had statistically significant increasing trends in concentration during Period 1. The largest increasing trends in wet-precipitation NH4 concentration occurred in the North-Central region during Period 1, Period 2 and throughout the entire study. By comparison, NH4 trends in the Rocky-North and Rocky-South regions were about half as steep and trends in the South-Central and Midwest regions were about one-third as steep. We compared trends in SO4 and NO3 concentrations from NADP stations to emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, respectively to determine whether there was a relation between emissions and wet-precipitation concentration trends within proximity to NADP stations. There was a statistically significant relation (r2 = 0.62–0.69, p &lt; 0.01) between the trend in SO4 concentrations at individual NADP stations and total and mean sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants within a range of 750 km and 1000 km from each station. There were also significant relations between NO3 concentration trends at NADP stations and power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides, but they were not nearly as strong (r2 = 0.18–0.36, p &lt; 0.01) as those for SO4 and were strongest for emissions within a range of 1000 km and 1500 km from each NADP station. Decreases in wet-precipitation SO4 concentrations were more consistent across regions and through time than decreases in NO3 and SO4 trends were more closely linked to stationary emissions sources than NO3 trends. There were statistically significant increases in NH4 wet-precipitation concentrations, as have been reported in previous studies, but this study found that those increases were strongest during Period 1 and were not consistent across the United States. During the first 3 years of the study period, wet-precipitation acidity was dominated by SO4 in 8 of the 9 regions; by 2017 NO3 dominated the acidity of wet-precipitation in 7 of the 9 regions. There has also been a downward shift in the NO3:NH4 ratio of wet-precipitation as the emissions of nitrogen oxides have declined while ammonia emissions have remained essentially constant. This shift has resulted in an increase in wet-precipitation total nitrogen concentrations in 7 of the 9 regions and indicate that efforts to control NH3 emissions will become increasingly important as emissions of nitrogen oxides continue to decline. © 2021","Ammonium; Atmospheric deposition; Nitrate; Sulfate","Acid rain; Air quality standards; Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric pollutants; Clean air act amendments; Concentration trends; Emissions reduction; National atmospheric deposition programs; Power-plant emissions; Precipitation chemistry; Stationary emissions; Air pollution control; ammonia; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; pollution policy; precipitation (climatology); precipitation quality; quantitative analysis; regulatory approach; temporal variation; trend analysis; acidity; act; air; Article; atmospheric deposition; calculation; controlled study; electric power plant; nitrogen concentration; precipitation; priority journal; trend study; United States; Europe; Mid-Atlantic States; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099665040

The study is based on a self-report social survey conducted in Adana which includes three different time frames for happiness, namely at present (short-term), in the last week and in the last 4 weeks (global). Over which, the effects of objective, subjective and social spatial variables through socio-economic and social capital variables are measured using logistic regression models. Based on cognitive neuroscience research findings, the expectations are that perceived aspects of life are more likely related to short-term happiness and objective aspects of life are more likely related to global happiness. The analyses reveal that urban-remote difference is more likely related to higher global happiness; vehicle dependent-others difference is more likely related to higher happiness; perceived spatial factors are more likely related to short-term happiness; lower relative income and higher neighborhood inequality are more likely to decrease global happiness; the unemployed and retired urban residents are more likely to feel less happy and related to global happiness; personal characteristics and socio-economic factors are more likely related to one-week happiness. The implications suggest that policies should be towards the city retirees and the unemployeds who feel less happy, and intensive public transportation areas and their residents who are the most unhappy and more disturbed by air pollution. For policy implementation, we recommend that the authorities discuss the public transport, distance to services, air pollution and unemployment issues, and adopt the retirement adjustment law to eliminate the grievances in the pensions of the retirees. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Happiness; Marginal effects; Social capital; Spatial analysis","adult; air pollution; article; cognitive neuroscience; expectation; female; happiness; human; human experiment; male; neighborhood; pension; pensioner; self report; social capital; socioeconomics; spatial analysis; unemployment; urban population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081907811

Typically, the most comparable commercial gen-sets are made up of Heavy-Duty (HD) Diesel engines, whose cost and complexity will probably increase to meet more stringent emissions standards. The conversion of a light-duty Diesel engine may permit to match the high efficiency of Diesels with the low emissions of DF combustion at an affordable cost. Moreover, the new thermal unit would be more compact and lighter. Running on Natural Gas (NG) is less expensive than using Diesel fuel, and it offers more opportunities to reduce the environmental impact (e.g., NG can be easily obtained from biomass, in the same site where the gen-set is installed). Last but not the least, in case of interruption of NG supply, the system can be easily switched to conventional Diesel operation, offering a higher fuel flexibility. Despite the large number of scientific publications concerning DF engines, very few of them consider high-speed units equipped with modern Common Rail injection systems. Even more limited are the investigations on the combustion process at medium-high loads (BMEP > 10 bar), carried out by measuring in-cylinder pressure and optimizing all the fundamental control parameters (injection strategy for both Diesel fuel and NG, boost pressure, EGR rates, etc.). It should be observed that the use of state-of-the-art injection systems and the accurate calibration of their parameters at each operating condition is the only way to maximize the benefits of NG in terms of reduction of soot emissions while addressing the well-known issues related to the increase of some pollutants (HC, CO, and NOx). This study reviews the results of a theoretical and experimental activity carried out on a four-cylinder, Common Rail, 2.8-liter turbocharged Diesel engine. A gas injection system is installed upstream of the intake plenum, and an open Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is used to calibrate all the most important engine parameters. Thanks to the deep insight into the combustion process provided by in-cylinder pressure analysis and measurement of pollutant emissions, the study presents some general guidelines for setting the control strategy in this type of DF engine. Considering the operating condition at maximum power (BMEP = 12 bar, 3000 rpm, brake power = 83 kW), the following advantages are observed with comparison to the standard Diesel engine: soot is more than halved, NOx emissions are reduced by 32% and CO2 by 31%, and Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) increases from 35.8% to 39%. The only drawback is the increase of one order of magnitude of both CO and HC, requiring a specific oxidation catalyst. Another outcome of the study is the limitation on the use of DF NG-Diesel combustion at low loads: the experimental activity demonstrates that it is very difficult to achieve complete combustion of an ultra-lean air-NG premixed charge so that BTE tends to drop. At these conditions, it appears to be more convenient to switch back to standard Diesel operations. © 2021 SAE International.","Dual fuel; Experimental activity; Light-duty Diesel engine; Natural gas; Power generator sets","Brakes; Control systems; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Experimental reactors; Ignition; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pressure control; Soot; Brake thermal efficiency; Common rail injection system; Compression ignition engine; Compression-ignition engines; Electronic control units; In-cylinder pressure analysis; Light-duty diesel engines; Turbocharged diesel engine; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105702855

Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the soils of traditional cactus pear production systems and to correlate it with the productivity and mineral and chemical composition of cladodes in agroecosystems in the semiarid region of Bahia. For that, five stratified agroecosystems were selected based on the distinction of the characteristics of soils, vegetation, relief, altimetry, typology of producers and production systems of cactus pear. The crop yield data were obtained based on the harvest of cladodes from all plants in each repetition, carried out between August and September 2017. Each of the three replications, in the 20 properties, had an average useful area of 14 m2 and an average quantity of 16 plants. For the evaluation of bromatological characteristics, at the time of collection, an average of 34 samples of cladodes were collected per repetition, with approximately 40 g each. Soils with better natural fertility, that is, with higher values of sum of exchangeable bases (SB), effective cation exchange capacity (t), cation exchange capacity at pH 7.0 (T) and base saturation index (V), do not necessarily determine better structural performance of plants compared to less fertile soils, but they influence higher productivity. Other factors associated with management and climate influenced plant structure, productivity and chemical quality of cactus pear cladodes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bromatology; Environement; Opuntia fícus-indica; Productivity","agricultural ecosystem; cactus; cation exchange capacity; chemical composition; forage; fruit production; saturation; semiarid region; soil quality; typology; Bahia; Brazil; Cactaceae; Opuntia; Pyrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092529146

From an astrobiological point of view subsurface environments are of interest for their potential habitability as they are local environments that are partially or fully shielded from the high levels of space and solar radiation. Furthermore, in the case of Mars, there is an increasing interest in searching for the presence of past or extant life in its subsurface. These applications make it mandatory to investigate equipment and instrumentation that allow for the study of subsurface geomorphology, as well as organic chemical biomarkers, such as biomolecules, carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopes, and other biologically significant minerals and gases. Mines on Earth can be used as analogues to investigate the geomorphology of Martian subsurface environments and perform astrobiology studies. With that goal, we have developed a low-cost, robust, remotely operable subsurface rover called KORE (KOmpact Rover for Exploration). This work illustrates the studies of a terrestrial analogue for the exploration of Mars using KORE during the Mine Analogue Research 6 (MINAR 6) campaign with the low-cost 3D mapping technology InXSpace 3D (In situ 3D mapping tool eXploration of space 3D). InXSpace 3D utilizes an RGB-D camera that captures depth information in addition to the RGB data of an image, operating based on the structured light principle capable of providing depth information in mm scale resolution at sub 3 m mapping range. InXSpace 3D is used to capture point clouds of natural and artificial features, thereby obtaining information about geologically relevant structures and also to incorporate them in earth mining safety. We tested two of the dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms: Kintinuous and Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) to check the performance of InXSpace 3D in a dark mine environment. Also, the air accumulation of volatiles such as methane and formaldehyde due to thermogenic and mining process was measured with the environmental station payload on the rover platform, which caters to both astrobiological significance and mine safety. The main conclusions of this work are: (1) a comparison made between the RTAB-Map algorithm and Kintinuous algorithm showed the superiority of Kintinuous algorithm in providing better 3D reconstruction; although RTAB-Map algorithm captured more points than the Kintinuous algorithm in the dark mine environment; (2) a comparison of point cloud images captured with and without lighting conditions had a negligible effect on the surface density of the point clouds; (3) close-range imaging of the polygonal features occurring on the halite walls using InXSpace 3D provided mm-scale resolution to enable further characterization; (4) heuristic algorithms to quickly post-process the 3D point cloud data provided encouraging results for preliminary analyses; (5) we successfully demonstrated the application of KORE to mine safety; and (6) the multi-sensors platform on KORE successfully monitored the accumulated volatiles in the mine atmosphere during its operation. The findings obtained during this KORE campaign could be incorporated in designing and planning future subsurface rover explorations to potential planetary bodies such as Mars with synergistic applications to subsurface environments in mines on Earth.

In this study, daily temperature time series for minimum and maximum temperatures were used to compute 12 extreme climate indices and 2 plant heat resource indices. The indices for the historical period 1941–2016 are computed from the observed temperature records at 10 climate stations within the Limpopo province in South Africa. The time series for the annual heat-related indices were analysed to obtain the climatology and trends for each of the indices per station. In general, statistically significant warming trends, accounting for at least 5 out of the 10 stations for all indices, were observed over the 65-year period. These are except statistically significant cooling trends observed for a few geographically high-lying stations that constitute at least 1 station. The recorded trends in growing degree days and heat stress indices suggest that the majority of stations experienced a gain in the conditions conducive for native plants to grow, while for crops sensitive to temperatures from 25 to 35 °C, the conditions went through a deterioration during the period. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Extreme temperature indices trends; Growing degree days","air temperature; climate change; extreme event; trend analysis; twentieth century; twenty first century; warming; Limpopo; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099053838

Research related to CO2 corrosion environments agrees on the occurrence of siderite (FeCO3) as a main product conforming corrosion films, suggested to impart protection to carbon steel. Identifying and understanding the presence of all corrosion products under certain conditions is of greatest importance to elucidate the behavior of corrosion films under operation conditions (e.g., flow, pH, temperature), but information regarding the nature and formation of other Fe corrosion products apart from FeCO3 is lacking. Corrosion products in CO2 environments typically consist of common Fe minerals that in nature have been demonstrated to undergo transformations, forming other Fe phases. This fact of nature has not been yet explored in the corrosion science field, which can help us to describe mechanisms associated with industrial processes. In this work, we present a multiscale and multidisciplinary approach to understand the mechanisms occurring on corrosion films under the key factors of flow and pH through the combination of molecular techniques with imaging. We report that certainly siderite (FeCO3, cylindrical with trigonal-pyramidal caps) is the main product identified under the conditions used (representative of brine transport at 80 °C), but wustite (FeO) and magnetite (Fe3O4) minerals also form, likely from the de-carbonation of FeCO3 → FeO → Fe3O4, depending on pH under the action of flow. These minerals exist across the corrosion films evidencing a more complex nature of the three-dimensional layer not currently accounted for in the mechanistic models. A relatively low flow velocity (1 m/s), as recognized for industrial operations, is enough to produce chemo-mechanical damage to the FeCO3 crystals, causing breakage at low pH where dissolution of FeCO3 occurs with a rapid crystal size reduction of the cylindrical FeCO3 geometry of ∼80% in just 8 h, changing also the local chemical structure of Fe3C under the film. Similarly, a flow velocity of 1 m/s is capable of inducing crystal removal at neutral pH, promoting further degradation of the steel, compromising the protectiveness assumption of FeCO3 corrosion films. The chemo-mechanical damage and Fe phase transformations will affect the critical localized corrosion, and therefore, they need to be accounted for in mechanistic models aiming to find new avenues for control and mitigation of carbon steel corrosion. ©","film dissolution; flow cell; flow velocity; localized corrosion; mechanical damage; pH","Carbon dioxide; Carbon films; Construction industry; Corrosion protection; Crystal structure; Crystals; Dissolution; Flow velocity; Iron ores; Iron oxides; Localized corrosion; Magnetite; Materials handling; Steel corrosion; Corrosion products; Industrial operations; Industrial processs; Mechanical breakdown; Mechanistic models; Molecular techniques; Multi-disciplinary approach; Operation conditions; Iron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100269135

Given the limited resources and environmental impacts of agricultural activities on human health, it is necessary to determine an appropriate cropping pattern. The present research aimed to maximize net profit and minimize environmental impacts, including the releases of carcinogens, noncarcinogens, ozone layer depletion, ionizing radiation, and respiratory inorganics and organics on human health. In this study, an optimal cropping pattern of irrigated and rainfed crops was proposed for the east of Lorestan Province using multi-objective nonlinear programming (MOP). Results showed that the cropping areas of chickpea, rapeseed, and potatoes decreased by 50% in the irrigated crop of MOP model and that of lentil in the MOP model of rainfed crops compared with the current pattern. Another important result was increases in the cropping areas of lentil and bean in the MOP pattern of irrigated crops and wheat in the rainfed MOP model. The environmental impacts of agricultural sector on human health can be reduced by determining an optimal cropping pattern. The implementation of this model in the region reduced the emissions of carcinogens (4%), noncarcinogens (9%), respiratory inorganics (17%), ionizing radiation (14%), ozone layer depletion (17%), and respiratory organics (15%) compared with the existing situation along with an increased net profit of $968,483. According to the findings, consideration of environmental objectives affecting human health is essential in the optimization of the cropping pattern. In addition to optimal use of water and land resources, using the proposed model helps to increase profits and reduce environmental consequences on human health. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carcinogenic release; Fuzzy logic; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective planning; Net profit; Optimization; Ozone layer depletion","cropping practice; emission inventory; environmental effect; environmental impact; environmental protection; human activity; profitability; public health; rainfall; rainfed agriculture; resource use; wheat; Iran; Lorestan; Brassica napus; Cicer arietinum; Lens culinaris; Solanum tuberosum; water; agriculture; crop; environment; human; Iran; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Humans; Iran; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091731608

This study was aimed to evaluate the influence of soil ameliorants of steel slag and lateritic soil to peat decomposition as reflected by CO2 emission. A year study was conducted in smallholder oil palm plantation in Jambi Province, Indonesia to monitor CO2 emission from treatments plots of control (T1), steel slag 600 kg ha-1 (T2), lateritic soil 600 kg ha-1 (T3) and a combination of T2 and T3 (T4), which each treatment had 5 replications. CO2 emission was measured every three months by a closed chamber method. Results showed that CO2 emission were followed the order of T4>T2>T1=T3. CO2 emission from T4 (49 ± 20 t ha-1 year-1) was 20% higher than T1 (40 ± 23 t ha-1 year-1), while T2 (44 ± 17 t ha-1 year-1) was 9% higher than T1. CO2 emission from T3 (40 ± 14 t ha-1 year-1) was similar to T1.

Although irrigated agriculture consumes considerable energy that generates GHG emissions, the biomass produced also represents an important CO2 sink, which can counterbalance the emissions. The source of the water supply considerably influences the irrigation energy consumption and, consequently, the resulting carbon footprint. This study evaluates the potential impact on the carbon footprint of partially and fully replacing the conventional supply from Tagus–Segura water transfer (TSWT) with desalinated seawater (DSW) in the irrigation districts of the Segura River basin (south-eastern Spain). The results provide evidence that the crop GHG emissions depend largely on the water source and, consequently, its carbon footprint. In this sense, in the hypothetical scenario of the TSWT being completely replaced with DSW, GHG emissions may increase by up to 50% and the carbon balance could be reduced by 41%. However, even in this unfavourable situation, irrigated agriculture in the study area could still act as a CO2 sink with a negative total and specific carbon balance of −707,276 t CO2/year and −8.10 t CO2/ha-year, respectively.

This paper presents an automated process to obtain low embodied energy buttressed earth-retaining wall optimum designs. Two objective functions were considered to compare the difference between a cost optimization and an embodied energy optimization. To reach the best design for every optimization criterion, a tuning of the algorithm parameters was carried out. This study used a hybrid simulated optimization algorithm to obtain the values of the geometry, the concrete resistances, and the amounts of concrete and materials to obtain an optimum buttressed earth-retaining wall low embodied energy design. The relation between all the geometric variables and the wall height was obtained by adjusting the linear and parabolic functions. A relationship was found between the two optimization criteria, and it can be concluded that cost and energy optimization are linked. This allows us to state that a cost reduction of €1 has an associated energy consumption reduction of 4.54 kWh. To achieve a low embodied energy design, it is recommended to reduce the distance between buttresses with respect to economic optimization. This decrease allows a reduction in the reinforcing steel needed to resist stem bending. The difference between the results of the geometric variables of the foundation for the two-optimization objectives reveals hardly any variation between them. This work gives technicians some rules to get optimum cost and embodied energy design. Furthermore, it compares designs obtained through these two optimization objectives with traditional design recommendations. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, the physico-chemical, olfactometric and textural characterization of granular active carbon (GAC) used by an urban WWTP as a deodorization system, as well as the chromatographic quantification of the retained odoriferous compounds, have been carried out. These techniques have allowed an integral evaluation of the contaminated GAC and the characterization of the retained gaseous emission from four different stages of the wastewater treatment (pretreatment header: GAC-1; sand and fat removal: GAC-2; sludge thickening: GAC-3; sludge dehydration: GAC-4). A larger amount and variety of retained odoriferous compounds were found in GAC samples from the wastewater line deodorization (GAC-1 and GAC-2) after the same operation time (one year), GAC-1 being the adsorbent bed that retained the highest mass of volatile compounds (approximately 150 μg/g GAC). Furthermore, some variables such as the removed specific odor concentration and free micropore volume were inversely correlated (R2 = 0.9945). The analysis of odor contribution showed that sulfur-containing compounds were the major odor contributors (61–97%). However, hydrogen sulfide cannot be considered a key odorant in this particular WWTP, since the elimination of this compound does not reduce the significant contribution of other (organic) sulfur compounds to the global odor (especially dimethyl disulfide). Consequently, multi-technical analysis might be a suitable alternative to better understand odor removal by GAC adsorption. © 2020","Emitted gaseous compounds; Granular activated carbon; Multi-technical analysis; Odor contribution; WWTP","Activated carbon; Chromatography; Hydrogen sulfide; Odor control; Odor removal; Sewage treatment plants; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Dimethyl disulfides; Granular activated carbons; Integral evaluation; Odor concentrations; Odoriferous compounds; Sulfur containing compound; Textural characterization; Wastewater treatment plants; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; dimethyl disulfide; granular active carbon; hydrogen sulfide; sulfur derivative; unclassified drug; activated carbon; adsorption; odor; organic sulfur compound; wastewater treatment plant; adsorption; Article; conductance; controlled study; deodorization; limit of quantitation; micropore volume; odor; olfactometry; pH; physical chemistry; physical parameters; priority journal; sludge; waste water treatment plant; wavelength dispersive X ray fluorescence spectroscopy; X ray fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090943032

HONO sources are still not well understood, and air quality models fail to predict OH as well as HONO mixing ratios. As there is little knowledge about the potential contribution of plant surfaces to HONO emission, this laboratory work investigated HONO formation by heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on Zea mays. Experiments were carried out in a flow tube reactor; HONO, NO2 and NO were measured online with a Long Path Absorption Photometer (LOPAP) and a NOx analyzer. Tests were performed on leaves under different conditions of relative humidity (5–58%), NO2 mixing ratio representing suburban to urban areas (10–80 ppbv), spectral irradiance (0–20 W m−2) and temperature (288–313 K). Additional tests on plant wax extracts from Zea mays leaves showed that this component can contribute to the observed HONO formation. Temperature and NO2 mixing ratios were the two environmental parameters that showed substantially increased HONO emissions from Zea mays leaves. The highest HONO emission rates on Zea mays leaves were observed at 313 K for 40 ppbv of NO2 and 40% RH and reached values of (5.6 ± 0.8) × 109 molecules cm−2 s−1. Assuming a mixing layer of 300 m, the HONO flux from Zea mays leaves was estimated to be 171 ± 23 pptv h−1 during summertime, which is comparable to what has been reported for soil surfaces. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Atmospheric chemistry; HONO sources; Hydroxyl radicals; Leaf surface; Solid/gas reactivity","nitrogen dioxide; nitrous acid; air quality; irradiance; laboratory method; maize; mixing ratio; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; plant extract; relative humidity; urban area; Article; light irradiance; maize; nonhuman; plant leaf; priority journal; temperature measurement; laboratory; maize; plant leaf; Zea mays; Laboratories; Nitrogen Dioxide; Nitrous Acid; Plant Leaves; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096977823

The need also emerged to both broaden and update the skills of urban planners and to improve territorial governance tools, with the aim of developing feasible regeneration and resilience strategies to face climate change. In this paper, a methodology for the production of Flood Risk Maps is presented, as applied to the Municipality of Ravenna, Italy, by only considering the static component of inundation hazard, i.e., the projected Mean Sea Level Rise, as a first step towards increased preparedness. The resulting Flood Risk Maps represent, in fact, an innovation with respect to the current cognitive framework that supports local urban planning, by providing information on a potential risk that has so far been overlooked. The method combines sea level rise projections under the pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario with georeferenced territorial data, aiming to identify the physical consistency of the urban-structure components which are potentially at risk. For successive time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2100), our results show the progressive impairment and potential degradation of extensive urban areas that are disregarded in the urban planning regulations currently in force. This preliminary evaluation phase is aimed at prompting and supporting the necessary updating of the planning tools and regulations adopted by the public bodies responsible for territorial governance, by identifying priority areas for intervention, and helping define mitigation and adaptation actions. © 2021 by the authors.

Mid-infrared imaging revealed a giant spiral dust plume that is reminiscent of a pinwheel nebula but with additional features that suggest Apep is a unique system. We have conducted observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array to resolve Apep's radio emission on milliarcsecond scales, allowing us to relate the geometry of the wind-collision region to that of the spiral plume. The observed radio emission shows a bow-shaped structure, confirming its origin as a wind-collision region. The shape and orientation of this region is consistent with being originated by the two stars and with being likely dominated by the stronger wind of the WN4-6b star. This shape allowed us to provide a rough estimation of the opening angle of ∼150° assuming ideal conditions. The orientation and opening angle of the emission also confirms it as the basis for the spiral dust plume. We also provide estimations for the two stars in the system to milliarcsecond precision. The observed radio emission, one order of magnitude brighter and more luminous than any other known non-thermal radio-emitting CWB, confirms it is produced by an extremely powerful wind collision. Such a powerful wind-collision region is consistent with Apep being a binary composed of two WR stars, so far the first unambiguously confirmed system of its kind. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","binaries: close; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; radio continuum: stars; stars: individual: Apep; techniques: interferometric",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100312745

Strategies to reduce climate change impacts require novel and integrated solutions that simultaneously benefit multiple parts of society and minimise potential conflict between economic, food production and environmental values. Here, we use a novel integrated analysis of the energy-water-food nexus, land use, and climate change to explore whether mounting environmental pressure can be reversed without negative consequences on food production and economic outcomes. Using Australia as a test case, our results show the significant potential of optimal use of land and water resources in achieving both increased crop production and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while sustaining economic outcomes. Our trade-off analysis shows that, at a regional level, up to 50% reduction in GHG emissions from irrigated crop production is possible without compromising total gross margins; in addition, regional optimisation of resource use resulted in surplus water and land available for environmental planting. Our analysis also indicates that further emissions reduction without trade-offs can be achieved with a higher carbon price and/or where water markets ensure higher value water use. To our knowledge, this is the first future-looking modelling to integrate this range of crop production, environmental and economic issues. This type of integrated approach has potential to better inform government emissions reduction policy aimed at finding an equitable and sustainable balance across multiple policy areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Agriculture; Emissions reduction; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Integrated trade-off analysis; Mitigation","Carbon; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Natural resources management; Value engineering; Water resources; Climate change impact; Emissions reduction; Environmental pressures; Environmental values; Integrated analysis; Integrated approach; Integrated solutions; Trade-off analysis; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092647233

One of the principal obstacles that hinders effective decision making is insufficient spatial knowledge frameworks. Cities climate adaptation planning must become strategic to rethink and transform urban fabrics holistically. Contemporary urban planning should merge future threats with older and unsolved criticalities, like social inequities, urban conflicts and “drosscapes”. Retrofitting planning processes and redefining urban objectives requires the development of innovative spatial information frameworks. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to overcome knowledge production limits and to support climate adaptation planning. The research was undertaken in collaboration with the Metropolitan City of Venice and the Municipality of Venice, and required the production of a multi-risk climate atlas to support their future spatial planning efforts. The developed tool is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS), which aids adaptation actions and the coordination of strategies. The model recognises and assesses two climate impacts: Urban Heat Island and Flooding, representing the Metropolitan City of Venice (CMVE) as a case study in complexity. The model is composed from multiple assessment methodologies and maps both vulnerability and risk. The atlas links the morphological and functional conditions of urban fabrics and land use that triggers climate impacts. The atlas takes the exposure assessment of urban assets into account, using this parameter to describe local economies and social services, and map the uneven distribution of impacts. The resulting tool is therefore a replicable and scalable mapping assessment able to mediate between metropolitan and local level planning systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Most tools usually tackle the problem by modelling individual ES, but do not perform a holistic analysis of a dynamic and integrated system. We developed a discrete-event model (DORIAN) and explored its potential for assessing biodiversity and multifunctionality of a mountain ski resort subjected to a changing climate. We represented this social-ecological system as a network comprising 16 binary components and 51 processes that define component interactions. We identified 22 economy- and ecology-related ES, depending on the presence/absence of components. We simulated six scenarios representing different economic, environmental and climatic situations and calculated a score (the sum of proxies for biodiversity or ES), corresponding to the level of biodiversity and multifunctionality. Results showed that climate change reduced the system's multifunctionality and increased the number of degraded states, as well as the trajectories from healthy to degraded states. With increasing levels of biodiversity, only ecology-related ES were boosted at low biodiversity levels, while both high levels of ecology- and economy-related ES were maintained at high biodiversity levels. This result demonstrates the importance of conserving high biodiversity in a social ecological system, for an optimal “biodiversity – multifunctionality” win-win strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Discrete-event model; Economy; Ecosystem service; Mountain; Qualitative modelling; Social-ecological system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106212961

With increasing pollution and extreme climatic influence, the quality assurance of groundwater becomes much important to determine its suitability for domestic needs and agriculture. A random sampling of 62 groundwater samples was conducted in the study region. The groundwater samples were analysed in the laboratory for all the major physico-chemical parameters. The pH of all except 4 samples was found &gt; 7 suggesting dominance of alkaline environment. Results suggest that the major ion chemistry is greatly influenced by the extreme arid climatic condition; however, ion exchange and reverse ion exchange along with dissolution of carbonate minerals govern the major ion chemistry in groundwater. High nitrate (NO3) exceeding the WHO guideline of 50 mg/L is a major public health concern along with high alkalinity and electrical conductivity (EC). Water quality index (WQI) was estimated based on the variables analysed in the lab to determine its appropriateness for drinking. The irrigation suitability of groundwater was estimated based on several indices such as sodium percentage (Na%), permeability index (PI), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly’s ratio (KR), and magnesium absorption ratio (MAR). WQI values of 62.9% of groundwater samples indicate good quality of water followed by 25.8% in poor range of water quality and 6.4% and 4.8% of samples are respectively under excellent and very poor water classes. The irrigation indices, i.e. Na%, RSBC, MH, KR, and MAR, are found within the suitable range; however, 53.3% of the samples has PI values &lt; 25% indicating that water is not suitable and it might increase the permeability of soil which leads to accumulation of ions in soil resulting in low productivity. USSL diagram suggests that 17.7% of the samples falls under C2S1 (medium salinity-low sodium hazard), 72% of the water samples falls under C3S1 (high salinity-low sodium hazard), and 10% of the samples falls under C4S1 zone (very high salinity-low sodium hazard), suggesting good, moderately suitable, and poor water quality for irrigation.

In this study we report on an experiment designed to compare atmospheric contaminants, in this case, PM2.5 inhaled during rickshaw, bus, metro, non-air-conditioned car, air-conditioned (AC) car and walking journeys through the city of Delhi, India. The data collection was carried out using a portable TSI SidePak Aerosol Monitor AM520, during February 2018. The results demonstrate that rickshaws (266 ± 159 μg/m3) and walking (259 ± 102 μg/m3) modes were exposed to significantly higher mean PM2.5 levels, whereas AC cars (89 ± 30 μg/m3) and the metro (72 ± 11 μg/m3) had the lowest overall exposure rates. Buses (113 ± 14 μg/m3) and non-AC cars (149 ± 13 μg/m3) had average levels of exposure, but open windows and local factors caused surges in PM2.5 for both transport modes. Closed air-conditioned transport modes were shown to be the best modes for avoiding high concentrations of PM2.5, however other factors (e.g. time of the day, window open or closed in the vehicles) affected exposure levels significantly. Overall, the highest total respiratory deposition doses (RDDs) values were estimated as 84.7 ± 33.4 μg/km, 15.8 ± 9.5 μg/km and 9.7 ± 0.9 μg/km for walking, rickshaw and non-AC car transported mode of journey, respectively. Unless strong pollution control measures are taken, the high exposure to PM2.5 levels will continue causing serious short-term and long-term health concerns for the Delhi residents. Implementing integrated and intelligent transport systems and educating commuters on ways to reduce exposure levels and impacts on commuter's health are required. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Delhi; Personal exposure; PM2.5; Travel modes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097682433

Taxus contorta, an endangered gymnosperm has reached a decisive state in the Western Himalayas, thus, demands immediate attention to rescue it. This study aims to elucidate population and landscape genetics of T. contorta to plan a successful conservation strategy. We used SSR genotyping to identify genetic diversity hotspots, and ecological niche modeling to reveal climatic hotspots of T. contorta in the Indian Western Himalayas. We observed a substantial genetic diversity, and a negligible level of inbreeding among T. contorta populations. A genetic bottleneck was observed in several populations. We propose that changing climate can cause a failure of an entire conservation management plan if the shift produces a degraded environment in the future, at the sites of conservation. Further, the conservation management is futile if it fails to enhance or conserve the genetic diversity. We propound that use of germplasm from genetic diversity hotspots for propagation in climatic hotspots, and prioritization of these hotspot patches for conservation would ensure greater genetic variability under a safe environment. This integrative approach of translating molecular and climatic data into conservation planning would save our efforts, time, and capital investment, and ensure greater success in managing the revival of T. contorta in the Western Himalayas. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Conservation; Ecological modeling; Genetic diversity; SRR markers; Taxus contorta","conservation genetics; conservation management; conservation planning; endangered species; extinction risk; genetic analysis; genetic variation; gymnosperm; landscape ecology; landscape evolution; population bottleneck; tree; Himalayas; India; Gymnospermae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095937139

There is increasing evidence for the important role of riparian wetlands in the transformation and emission of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. The considerable spatial heterogeneity of river deltas, however, forms a major obstacle for quantifying carbon emissions and their seasonality. The water chemistry in the river reaches is defined by the upstream catchment, whereas delta lakes and channels are dominated by local processes such as aquatic primary production, respiration or lateral exchange with the wetlands. In order to quantify carbon turnover and emissions in the complex mosaic of the Danube Delta, we conducted monthly field campaigns over 2 years at 19 sites spanning river reaches, channels and lakes. Here we report on the greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) from the freshwater systems of the Danube Delta and present the first seasonally resolved estimates of its freshwater carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Furthermore, we quantify the lateral carbon transport of the Danube River to the Black Sea. We estimate the delta's CO2 and CH4 emissions to be 65 GgC yr1 (30-120 GgC yr1, a range calculated using 25 to 75 percentiles of observed fluxes), of which about 8% are released as CH4. The median CO2 fluxes from river branches, channels and lakes are 25, 93 and 5.8 mmolm2 d1, respectively. Median total CH4 fluxes amount to 0.42, 2.0 and 1.5 mmolm2 d1. While lakes do have the potential to act as CO2 sinks in summer, they are generally the largest emitters of CH4. Small channels showed the largest range in emissions, including a CO2 and CH4 hot spot sustained by adjacent wetlands. Thereby, the channels contribute disproportionately to the delta's emissions, considering their limited surface area. In terms of lateral export, we estimate the net total export (the sum of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and particulate organic carbon, POC) from the Danube Delta to the Black Sea to be about 160280 GgC yr1, which only marginally increases the carbon load from the upstream river catchment (8490240 GgC yr1) by about 2 %. While this contribution from the delta seems small, deltaic carbon yield (45.6 gCm2 yr1; net export load/surface area) is about 4 times higher than the riverine carbon yield from the catchment (10.6 gCm2 yr1). © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

We use exogenous climate shocks as instruments for social distancing since people are more likely to stay home in wetter and colder periods. Our findings suggest that the health benefits of social distancing differ by levels of municipal development and may have vanished if the COVID-19 spread was not controlled in neighboring municipalities. In turn, we did not find evidence that municipalities with tougher social distancing performed worse economically.

This study assesses the aggregate impacts of state clean energy standards and emissions policies on national electricity generation, power sector carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and electricity prices and system costs. To do so, we apply the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, which is a detailed electric sector capacity expansion model, to evaluate scenarios with and without state policies and using a range of renewable energy technology cost projections. Across the scenarios analyzed, we find that the state policies drive 1.9%–10.7% of total nationwide clean energy and reduce cumulative power sector CO2 emissions by 2.6%–5.4% over the 2020–2050 study period. This incremental generation is predominantly, but not exclusively, from renewable energy technologies. In most cases, the state policies result in increases to electricity prices and electricity system costs, and policy costs are sensitive to the future cost of clean energy technologies. Across all scenarios, the levelized cost of incremental policy-driven clean energy generation is estimated to be $17–38/MWh and the average cost of CO2 abatement from the state-level policies is estimated to be $29–74/metric ton. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clean energy standard; Electricity modeling; Emissions; Energy policy; Renewable energy; Renewable portfolio standard","Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Clean energy generation; Clean energy standards; Clean energy technology; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Electricity system; Renewable energy technologies; Costs; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; policy implementation; renewable resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096193425

LULC change is affecting ecosystem services (ES) in urban areas, such as by decreasing of the water retention capacity, the urban temperature regulation capacity and the carbon sequestration. The relation between LULC change and ES is still poorly examined and quantified using actual field data. In most ES studies, GS is perceived as lumped areas instead of distributed areas, implicitly ignoring landscape patterns (LP), such as connectivity and aggrega-tion. This preliminary study is one of the first to provide quantitative evidence of the influence of landscape pattern changes on a selection of urban ecosystem services in a megacity as Jakarta, In-donesia. The impact of urbanization on the spatiotemporal changes of ES has been identified by considering connectivity and aggregation of GS. It reveals that LP changes have significantly de-creased carbon sequestration, temperature regulation, and runoff regulation by 10.4, 12.4, and 11.5%, respectively. This indicates that the impact of GS on ES is not only determined by its area, but also by its LP. Further detailed studies will be needed to validate these results. © 2021 by the authors.

This condition leads to the food security problem and creates a high demand for land to become an agricultural area. Meanwhile, Indonesia is known for having two-third of the terrestrial area as forest area and at the same time, the availability of the agricultural area is limited. These opposite issues are creating a phenomenon in forest conversion to become an agricultural area. Due to this situation the agricultural sector is considered as the sector responds for ""deforestation- leading-to-climate change""in Indonesia as happened in Labian Village, West Kalimantan. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of an involvement of the forest-dependent- community of Labian Village in the investment program of forest and climate change to combat the deforestation-leading-to-climate change issues through the activities of sustainable agriculture. Based on an explorative study from the five-year project, it is known that sustainable agriculture can be done back-to-back with the mission to avoid encroachment to the forest area.

Roundabouts are one of the most popular intersection designs in recent years, making traffic flow smoother and safer, but especially at peak times they are subject to numerous stop-and-go operations by vehicles, which increase the dispersion of emissions with high particulate matter rates. The study focused on a specific area of the city of Rzeszow in Poland. This country is characterized by the current composition of vehicle fleets connected to combustion engine vehicles. The measurement of the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) by means of a preliminary survey campaign in the vicinity of the intersection made it possible to assess the impact of vehicle traffic on the dispersion of pollutants in the air. The present report presents some strategies to be implemented in the examined area considering a comparison of current and project scenarios characterized both by a modification of the road geometry (through the introduction of a turbo roundabout) and the composition of the vehicular flow with the forthcoming diffusion of electric vehicles. The study presents an exemplified methodology for comparing scenarios aimed at optimizing strategic choices for the local administration and also shows the benefits of an increased electric fleet. By processing the data with specific tools and comparing the scenarios, it was found that a conversion of 25% of the motor vehicles to electric vehicles in the current fleet has reduced the concentration of PM10 by about 30% along the ring road, has led to a significant reduction in the length of particulate concentration of the motorway, and it has also led to a significant reduction in the length of the particulate concentration for the access roads to the intersection. © 2021 by the authors","Concentration PM10; Electric vehicles; Exhaust emission; Passenger cars; Roundabouts; Vehicle emission","Automobile engines; Data handling; Electric tools; Fleet operations; Particles (particulate matter); Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Traction motors; Traffic control; Combustion engines; Exhaust emission; Intersection design; Particulate Matter; Preliminary assessment; Road infrastructures; Road intersections; Urban agglomerations; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103255550

There is a rich literature projecting spatial shifts in climatic suitability for tree species and strong scientific evidence for the necessity of assisted migration. However, there has been limited translation of this research into operational reforestation, due in part to mismatches to the information needs of practitioners. Here, we describe a practitioner-focused climate change informed tree species selection (CCISS) model to support reforestation decisions in British Columbia (BC). CCISS projects the climate change redistribution of bioclimate units from the multi-scaled Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system with machine-learning for 90 modelled futures. It leverages the reforestation knowledge from BEC to make site-specific species projections of reforestation feasibility with climate change uncertainty metrics. We present 21st-century feasibility projections for a comprehensive set of tree species native to western North America. Some general trends are evident: augmentation of the number of feasible species in sub-boreal regions due to the rapid expansion of feasibility for temperate species; attrition at low elevations in southern BC due to declines in the feasibility of native species with little compensation by non-native species; and turnover at mid-elevations as declining feasibility for subalpine species is compensated by uphill expansion of climatic feasibility for submontane species. Edaphic (soil) factors are important; feasibility declines are higher on relatively dry sites than on wetter sites for most species. Our analysis emphasizes that changes in feasibility are species-specific, spatially variable, and influenced by edaphic site factors. By employing the multi-scaled BEC system that currently informs operational reforestation, CCISS facilitates translation of research into actionable guidance for practitioners. © 2020","Assisted migration; Bioclimate envelope modelling; Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification; Climate change adaptation; Random forests; Translational ecology","Climate models; Ecosystems; Expansion; Reforestation; Adaptation strategies; Ecological approaches; Ecosystem classification; Non-native species; Reforestation decision; Scientific evidence; Sub-boreal regions; Tree species selections; Climate change; adaptive management; bioclimatology; climate change; ecological approach; ecosystem service; feasibility study; forest ecosystem; native species; project assessment; reforestation; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; Ecosystems; Expansion; Feasibility; Reforestation; Research; Selection; Translation; Trees; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094325873

Our objective was to investigate the dynamics of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a feedlot system representative of Brazil, in order to aggregate new emission data for the characterization of intensive cattle raising in tropical regions. Excreta was obtained from Nellore steers in a feedlot (n = 25, BW = 393 ± 31 kg). Urine (1.3 L) and feces (1.3 kg) were applied separately in plots on an open-lot feedlot pen surface at the beginning of the trial and fluxes were monitored 92 d with static chambers. Although CH4 fluxes were variable, all treatments were a sink for CH4 as the average of the monitoring period (−8.9, −3.1, and −15.4 μg C m−2 h−1 for feces, urine, and control, respectively). The N2O fluxes were higher in the urine affected area, which was related to the higher soil moisture and mineral N availability in comparison to the area with feces. The occurrence of rainfall from 67 to 70 DAA was determinant of very high N2O fluxes either for urine or feces. Hence, GHG emissions from individual excreta were characterized by a period of small but significant fluxes, followed by a period of indistinguishable fluxes at the background level. A third period after rainfall portrayed the large impact of excreta on GHG emissions from the feedlot. The direct N2O emission factor (EF) for the N in urine was significantly higher than for the N in feces (2.83 vs. 0.32%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001), and combining both resulted in an EF for the N in excreta of 1.83%, which is 8.5% less than IPCC default EF for dry lot systems. From the calculated direct emissions of N2O, gas monitoring of urine and feces in separate should be also considered for the development of emission factors for inventory purposes in tropical environments. For the regions where feedlots are used in the dry season for finishing cattle, cleaning pens regularly can contribute substantially to mitigate N2O emissions as suggested by the results of the present study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bovine excreta; CH4 emission; GHG emissions; N2O emission factor","cattle; dry season; emission; flux measurement; methane; nitrous oxide; tropical environment; Brazil; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097080801

This calls for new strategies to change dietary habits, especially as many consumers are reluctant to eat less meat. This study tests the effect of labelling a meat-based ready meal with different levels of carbon footprint and healthiness on consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for these attributes. Participants took part in two sequential non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments (DCE). In the first experiment, they completed a DCE where the ready meals (i.e. beef lasagne) were labelled using a dual traffic light labelling system; one labelled for carbon footprint and one for healthiness. In the second experiment, participants repeated the DCE after they were told the carbon footprint and healthiness varied because of the meat and saturated fat content, respectively. The study found that participants were willing to pay a premium for the healthier lasagne and this did not change when they were given the information about saturated fat content. Participants were also willing to pay a premium for lasagne with a lower carbon footprint, but this decreased when they knew these meals contained less meat. Information about the meat content had the unintended consequence of discouraging people to buy lasagne with a low carbon footprint. The study provides an important insight for policy and industry into the effect of labelling information on consumers’ purchasing decisions at a time when people are being encouraged to eat less meat. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Meat; Non-hypothetical discrete choice experiment; Saturated fat; Sustainable diets; Willingness to pay","Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Labels; Meats; Saturated fatty acids; Discrete choice experiments; Fat contents; Labelling systems; Meat consumption; Purchasing decisions; Traffic light; Unintended consequences; Willingness to pay; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092499110

However, relatively little is known about the actual implementation of programs to achieve sustainable cities, especially how combinations of policy instruments are deployed in the realisation of low carbon cities. First, this study contributes to the literature in policy studies by identifying how four types relevant to carbon city development, hierarchy, market, network and information based ones, can be combined in policy mixes and play out in the effective realisation of low carbon cities in other countries. Second, this framework is used to map the application of policy instruments in China's 35 low carbon pilot cities. This study uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explore which configurations of policy instruments are in use and assesses their effects on low carbon city construction. It thus builds a bridge between theory on policy instruments, their combinations and low carbon city development. The presence of hierarchical policy instruments appears to be a necessary condition for low carbon city development and their use prevails. Market-based and network-based instruments complement hierarchical instruments but do not suffice in themselves. Applying hierarchical instruments and market-based instruments together tends to hamper the effect of network instruments and information instruments, whereas network instruments appear to be interchangeable with information instruments.

However, its simulation, including the amplitude, phase locking, and asymmetry of its two phases, is not well reproduced by the current climate system models. In this study, the sensitivity of the ENSO simulation to the convection schemes is discussed using the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Earth System version 3.0 (NESM3) model. Three convection schemes, including the default, the default coupled with the stochastic multicloud model (SMCM), and the default used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), are implemented. The model results reveal that the low-level cloud cover and surface net shortwave radiation are best represented over the tropical Pacific in the model containing the SMCM. The simulations of the ENSO behavior’s response to changes in the convection scheme are not uniform. The model results reveal that the model containing the SMCM performs best in terms of simulating the seasonal cycle of the sea surface temperature anomaly along the equatorial Pacific, the phase locking, and the power spectrum of ENSO but with a modest ENSO amplitude. Compared to the model containing the default convection scheme, the coupling of the default scheme and the SMCM provides a good simulation of the ENSO’s asymmetry, while the model containing the CMIP6 convection scheme outperforms the others in terms of the simulation of the ENSO’s amplitude. Two atmospheric feedback processes were further discussed to investigate the factors controlling the ENSO’s amplitude. The analyses revealed that the strongest positive atmospheric Bjerknes feedback and the thermodynamic damping of the surface net heat flux occurred in the model containing the CMIP6 convection scheme, suggesting that the atmospheric Bjerknes feedback may overwhelm the heat flux damping feedback when determining the ENSO’s amplitude. The results of this study demonstrate that perfectly modeling and predicting the ENSO is not simple, and it is still a large challenge and issue for the entire model community in the future. © Copyright © 2021 Ma and Jiang.","Climate System Models; Convection Schemes; ENSO; Feedback Processes; NESM3","Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Climatology; Damping; Feedback; Heat flux; Locks (fasteners); Oceanography; Stochastic systems; Surface waters; Tropics; Atmospheric feedbacks; Climate system model; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Low-level cloud covers; Science and Technology; Sea surface temperature anomalies; Short-wave radiation; Southern oscillation; Stochastic models; atmospheric convection; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; temperature anomaly; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102419286

Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 may increase the levels of dissolved CO2 in freshwater systems, via air-water exchanges, enhancing primary production in the water and catchments. Although high CO2 levels improve cyanobacterial growth and increase cyanobacterial biomass, the impacts on their internal physiological processes can be more complex. Here, we have reviewed previous studies to evaluate the physiological responses of cyanobacteria to high concentrations of CO2. In response to high CO2 concentrations, the pressures of inorganic carbon absorption are reduced, and carbon concentration mechanisms are downregulated, affecting the intracellular metabolic processes and competitiveness of the cyanobacteria. Nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism and light utilization are closely related to CO2 assimilation, and these processes are likely to be affected by resource and energy reallocation when CO2 levels are high. Additionally, the responses of diazotrophic and toxic cyanobacteria to elevated CO2 levels were specifically reviewed. The responses of diazotrophic cyanobacteria to elevated CO2 concentrations were found to be inconsistent, probably because of differences in other factors in experimental designs. Toxic cyanobacteria tended to be superior to non-toxic strains at low levels of CO2; however, the specific effects of microcystin on the regulation require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of increasing CO2 levels on cyanobacterial competitiveness in phytoplankton communities and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems were reviewed. High CO2 concentrations may make cyanobacteria less competitive relative to other algal taxa; however, due to the complexity of natural systems and the specificity of algal species, the dominant positions of the cyanobacteria do not seems to be changed. To better understand cyanobacterial responses to elevated CO2 levels and help control cyanobacterial bloom developments, this review has identified key areas for future research. © 2020","Carbon dioxide; Competitiveness; Cyanobacteria; Energy; Microcystin; Nitrogen","Air; Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Carbon; Catchments; Competition; Metabolism; Physiological models; Physiology; Water; Carbon concentrations; Cyanobacterial blooms; Freshwater ecosystem; Freshwater systems; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Physiological process; Physiological response; Phytoplankton community; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; microcystin; nitrogen; phosphate; phosphorus; algal bloom; carbon dioxide; competitiveness; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; future prospect; literature review; nitrogen; physiological response; aquatic environment; bacterial overgrowth; bacterial strain; Calothrix; carbon fixation; climate change; control strategy; cyanobacterium; Cyanothece; Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii; human; microbial competition; Microcystis aeruginosa; nitrogen metabolism; Nodularia; nonhuman; Nostoc punctiforme; nutrient cycling; phosphate metabolism; phytoplankton; priority journal; resource allocation; Review; Synechocystis; Trichodesmium; ecosystem; eutrophication; algae; Cyanobacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Cyanobacteria; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Nitrogen; Phytoplankton",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090591754

From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior. Then, the main bottlenecks and research directions that can be explored in the future are discussed. We hope this result can provide an overview of current fundamental aspects of TTOC's utilization in the urban area. © 2021 The Authors","Cruising strategy and route planning; Ridership factor; Service market partition; Traffic engineering; Transportation emission and new-energy; Travel behavior","Big data; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multimodal transportation; Petroleum prospecting; Search engines; Taxicabs; Transportation routes; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Current research status; Distribution patterns; Latest development; Point of interest; Searching strategy; Spatiotemporal distributions; Transportation congestion; Transportation mode; Behavioral research",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100596401

Different tree species have different emission levels, so adjusting greening species collocation is an effective way to control biogenic VOC pollution. However, there is a lack of measurements of tree species emission in subtropical metropolises, and the factors influencing the species-specific differences need to be further clarified. This study applied an in situ method to investigate the isoprene emission rates of 10 typical tree species in subtropical metropolises. Photosynthesis and related parameters including photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, which can influence the emission rate of a single species, were also measured. Results showed Salix babylonica always exhibited a high emission level, whereas Elaeocarpus decipiens and Ligustrum lucidum maintained a low level throughout the year. Differences in photosynthetic rate and stomatal CO2 conductance are the key parameters related to isoprene emission among different plants. Through the establishment of emission inventory and determination of key photosynthetic parameters, the results provide a reference for the selection of urban greening species, as well as seasonal pollution control, and help to alleviate VOC pollution caused by urban forests. © 2021 by the authors.

Anticipating change will require combining observational data, which predict how climatic factors limit current species distributions, with direct manipulations of climate, which can isolate responses to specific climate variables. Root endophytes are common symbionts of plants, particularly in arctic and alpine environments, yet their responses to climate warming are not resolved. Here, we directly cultured endophytic fungi from roots collected along altitudinal gradients in replicated mountain watersheds and from a 27 y field warming experiment in the Rocky Mountains, USA, to improve understanding of climate impacts on fungal root endophytes. Fungal taxa that were common at high elevations declined most under climate warming, whereas low elevation dominants responded neutrally or increased with experimental warming. Altitudinal gradients in fungal communities were strongly specific to the plant host species. Specifically, Poa species had 25–60% greater fungal isolate abundance and 25–38% greater fungal diversity at high elevations than at low elevation sites. In contrast, Festuca thurberi had 64% lower fungal diversity on roots at high elevation than at low elevation.

The direct use of low-grade ilmenite can result in low production efficiency and heavy pollution. In addition, the production of high-titanium slag via electric furnace melting consumes significant energy and possesses low production efficiency. Therefore, a novel process with low energy consumption is necessary for producing ultra-grade slag (UGS) for chlorination. For low-grade ilmenite, semi-molten reduction and magnetic separation were suggested in this study. The effects of carbon content, reduction time, and Na2CO3 addition on the reduction and separation behavior were studied. The results showed that the addition of Na2CO3 favored the formation of a semi-molten state, which was more conducive for the diffusion, aggregation, and growth of the metal phase. In this regard, excess carbon was not helpful, and it weakened the growth of the metal phase. Wet grinding and magnetic separation were used for beneficiation of the reduced sample for efficiently separating the slag iron and preventing the formation of agglomerates between slag and metal. For the sample with a carbon dosage of 13 pct, Na2CO3 dosage of 8 pct, reduction temperature of 1673 K (1400 °C), and 90 minutes holding time, high-titanium slag with a TiO2 grade of 81.63 pct and iron content of 4.53 pct was produced, with the TiO2 recovery rate of 93.43 pct and the yields of 55.37 pct. High-titanium slag can be used as a high-quality raw material to produce UGS for chlorination by leaching. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Carbon; Chlorination; Electric furnaces; Energy utilization; Ilmenite; Iron; Magnetic separation; Metal recovery; Slags; Sodium Carbonate; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; High titanium slag; Low energy consumption; Preparation process; Production efficiency; Reduction temperatures; Reduction time; Separation behaviors; Titanium industry; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096304727

Besides a development strategy associated with general urban planning, multiple strategies are elaborated in accordance with the requirements of the financing authorities and the specific spatial planning legislation. These strategies were developed at different times by different institutions and aim to substantiate the directions and priorities of development and attract funding for various programs. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis in eight municipalities and concluded that such strategies cannot be effective, as they are not always coordinated and often lack consistency and complementarity with other strategic and operational plans and programs at the local level. Based on an international literature review including the recommendations of the Harmonization for Sustainable Energy, Climate Action Plans, and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans developed by the EU financed project “Sustainable Integrated Multi-sector Planning” (SIMPLA), we propose a unification of the various strategies in a single harmonized, flexible strategic structure for the city. This harmonized structure includes specific components related to resilience in case of disasters and financing sources for all proposed projects. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, a magnetic PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs catalyst consisting of PdOx nanoparticles (NPs) and NiFe2O4 nanofibers (NFs) is synthesized by an electrospinning-calcination process. The microstructures and chemical compositions of PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs catalyst are well characterized. The optimized PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs exhibits high catalysis toward Suzuki coupling reactions under mild conditions, benefiting from the special electronic state of Pdδ+ (0 &lt; δ &lt; 2) active sites and the porous nanofiber structure of NiFe2O4 support. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the reactions of iodo-, bromo- and chloro-benzene over the PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs catalyst reach up to 2064.79, 1366.74 and 215.28 h−1, respectively, far exceeding those over the commercial Pd/C catalyst. The kinetic studies demonstrate that the PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs catalyst is more efficient to reduce the activation energy of Suzuki coupling reaction, which can be attributed to the superiority of Pdδ+ species in both charge-donating and charge-accepting steps of the reactions. Moreover, the PdOx/NiFe2O4 NFs catalyst can be facilely separated and recycled in a long-term catalytic reaction owing to its distinct magnetic feature and good structural stability. This work affords a facile approach for the synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst with tunable compositions and porous structures as well as an attractive catalyst with superior catalytic activity, high stability and reusability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-coupling reaction; Electrospinning; Heterogeneous catalysts; Hybrid nanofibers; Magnetic separation","Activation energy; Benzene refining; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Electronic states; Iron compounds; Nanofibers; Nanomagnetics; Nickel compounds; Organic carbon; Reusability; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Carbon-carbon bond; Catalytic reactions; Chemical compositions; Heterogeneous catalyst; Nanoparticle (NPs); Structural stabilities; Suzuki coupling reaction; Turnover frequency; Palladium compounds; bromobenzene; chlorobenzene; iron oxide nanoparticle; magnetic nanoparticle; nanofiber; nickel nanoparticle; nitrogen; palladium nanoparticle; adsorption; Article; calcination temperature; chemical composition; desorption; electrospinning; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; isotherm; magnetic separation; nanocatalysis; nanocatalyst; pore size distribution; priority journal; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; Suzuki reaction; transmission electron microscopy; turnover rate; vibrating sample magnetometry; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097351350

Urbanization and long-term meteorological variations play important roles in influencing the PM2.5 concentration and its associated health effects. Our results indicate that the urbanization process can enhance the PM2.5 concentration globally. The PM2.5-caused mortality density (deaths/100 km2) is also positively correlated with the urbanization degree in both developed and developing countries. The results from machine learning technique revealed that the meteorology-driven variation in PM2.5-caused health burden has increased with the increase in the urbanization degree from 1980 to 2018, suggesting that residents living in urban areas are more vulnerable to experiencing unfavorable meteorological conditions (e.g. low wind speed and planetary boundary layer height). The maximum difference in PM2.5-caused mortality due to the variation in annual meteorological conditions (between 2013 and 1986) was 270 600 (196 800–317 900).

Therefore, eight middle-rank TDC samples from the Yueliangtian coal mine (Guizhou Province, Southwest China) were screened. Pore volume and specific surface area were explored via mercury intrusion, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and carbon dioxide adsorption approaches. Based on the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance analysis for powdered TDC, the relaxation time (T2) amplitudes and the contents of adsorbed and free methane, the surface free energy reduction (SFER), and adsorption potential were measured. 1) The pore specific surface area, pore volume, T2 amplitudes and contents of adsorbed and free methane, SFER, and adsorption potential of the strongly deformed coal are obviously larger than those of the weakly deformed coal. Adsorbed methane content is dominantly affected by micropore specific surface area, and free methane content is primarily influenced by macropore volume. 2) The methane T2 spectra of the TDC contain three distinctive peaks; the first, P1 (T2 &lt; 2 ms), represents adsorbed methane, and the second, P2 (2–40 ms), corresponds to free methane. As the pressure increases, both the T2 amplitude rate and content rate of adsorbed methane decrease, while those of free methane rise. 3) With the enhancement of tectonic deformation, the specific surface area and volume of pores increase (especially those of micropores and macropores), more adsorption positions and storage space for adsorbed and free methane become available, and the SFER and adsorption potential of the TDC are enhanced, leading to increases in the T2 amplitudes and contents of adsorbed and free methane.

The question of how to ensure harmonized coordination between economic development, carbon emissions and environmental protection has become increasingly important. The conflicts between the use of energy and emission reductions in China have become more intense. It is an inevitable requirement for China’s sustainable development to promote a low-carbon circular economy and the simultaneous and coordinated development of carbon emissions, the economy and the environment. The present study took 30 provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions directly under the Central Government) as the research objects (Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are not included in the study due to the lack of relevant data), and applied quantitative analysis methods, such as three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, coupling coordination degree models and spatial analysis models, to construct a measurement index system. On the basis of the measurement of its carbon emission efficiency, the level of China’s coordination degree in regard to carbon emissions, economic development, and environmental protection at both spatial and temporal dimensions was analyzed comprehensively in order to reveal its temporal and spatial characteristics. The conclusions are as follows: (1) China’s overall carbon emission efficiency displayed a gradual upward trend, although the overall level was not that high. Therefore, there is still much scope for further improvement. (2) The level of China’s coordination degree in regard to carbon emissions, economic development, and environmental protection showed a steady yet rising trend. All provinces reached different levels of coordination development, and there was no province that displayed a disorderly declining trend. However, the number of provinces that reached or went beyond the intermediate level of coordination development was quite limited. (3) The level of China’s coordination degree in regard to carbon emissions, economic development, and environmental protection displayed obvious spatial aggregation patterns at the provincial level, showing an apparent spatial dependence and heterogeneity. Over time, the level of spatial aggregation patterns in regard to coordination degree tended to weaken. Overall, the values were high in the eastern region and low in the western region, decreasing from the eastern coastal zone towards the western inland zone, thus demonstrating a contrasting east-west spatial distribution pattern. © 2021 by the authors.

Less is known about whether air pollution is also associated with increases in the utilization of mental health services, especially outpatient mental health service utilization. This study aimed to examine the association between the number of daily outpatient visits at the psychological disease departments of two major hospitals (PSYC) and daily average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in a heavily polluted city in China, Nanjing, from 2013/7/1 to 2019/2/28, using generalized additive models with a quasi-Poisson regression. Results showed that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration on lag0 day was associated with a 0.40% increase (95% CI: 0.07-0.72) in PSYC visits, and each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration on the same day a 0.31% increase (95% CI: 0.09-0.54) in PSYC visits. Exposure-response curves suggested linear relationships between PM concentration and daily PSYC outpatient visits, without evidence of a threshold. Associations remained positive, but were non-significant, with adjustment for co-pollutants, SO2, NO2 and CO. Significantly larger effects were found for older and male participants, vs. their counterparts. These findings add to the growing literature linking air pollution to mental health service utilization, demonstrating the critical need for both air pollution mitigation measures and increased capacity of the mental health system in China. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Mental disorders; Outpatient visits; Particulate matter; Time series","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); disease prevalence; health risk; health services; mental health; particulate matter; pollution exposure; psychology; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; air temperature; ambient air; Article; child; China; concentration (parameter); female; groups by age; human; male; mental disease; mental health service; morbidity; outpatient; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; risk factor; seasonal variation; sex difference; time series analysis; adverse event; air pollutant; city; epidemiology; outpatient; particulate matter; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Humans; Male; Outpatients; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097671453

Oxygen vacancies on W-O-W (V1) and Bi-O-Bi (V2) sites are precisely controlled to obtain Bi2WO6-V1 with LSPR and Bi2WO6-V2 with defect absorption. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the V1-induced energy state facilitates photoelectron collection for a long lifetime, resulting in LSPR of Bi2WO6. Photoelectron trapping on V1 sites is demonstrated by a single-particle photoluminescence (PL) study, and 93% PL quenching efficiency is observed. With strong LSPR, plasmonic Bi2WO6-V1 exhibits highly selective methane generation with a rate of 9.95 μmol g-1 h-1 during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2-RR), which is 26-fold higher than 0.37 μmol g-1 h-1 of BiWO3-V2 under UV-visible light irradiation. LSPR-dependent methane generation is confirmed by various photocatalytic results of plasmonic Bi2WO6 with tunable LSPR and different light excitations. Furthermore, the DFT-simulated pathway of CO2-RR and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra on the surface of Bi2WO6 prove that V1 sites facilitate CH4 generation.

The findings showed that the area occupied by Eucalyptus globulus has increased greatly (by 4.6 times) in northern Spain in the last 50 years, to reach the current cover of 389033.57 ha. This area represents 18.22% of the total area of wooded land, although the proportion varies widely in different provinces (0.28% in the inland province of Ourense and 44.76% in A Coruña). In order to assess the current and future species distribution for two climate change scenarios, species distribution models were fitted to data on 53 spatially-continuous environmental variables (terrain, climate, soil and hydrographical variables) derived from 3014 plots with presence of eucalypts and included in the third Spanish national forest inventory. The Random Forest machine learning method proved to be the best approach for modelling eucalypt occurrence, which was found to be related to 18 variables. Climate, soil and terrain were the most important variables in the model (explaining respectively 51.2%, 34.2% and 10.1% of the variation). Future projections were made for 2050 and 2070 by considering representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 and applying the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report, which forecasted a significant increase in the suitable habitat in the inland areas of Galicia (northwest Spain) and a slight reduction in the other three autonomous communities in northern Spain (Asturias, Cantabria and Euskadi). The current suitable habitat in forest land and other natural and seminatural areas (SHNET) includes an area of 830885.41 ha available for potential expansion of eucalypt, of which a total of 296356.71 ha is currently occupied by native broadleaved forest, mainly in Galicia (185420.12 ha). In addition, an increase in SHNET of up 398810.27 ha is expected by 2070 in the worst climate change scenario (RCP 8.5), so that pressure on the native forest will mainly increase in the inland areas of Galicia. In natural protected areas, eucalypts currently occupy an area of 7840.40 ha, which represents 7.10% of the SHNET included in natural protected areas in the study zone (110428.78 ha). The largest such area (5032.65 ha) is in Galicia and represents 7.42% of the SHNET in natural protected areas in the region (67836.64 ha). In the future, this amount will increase by between 59.16% and 87.89% in Galicia but will decrease by between 18.41% and 30.59% in the other autonomous communities in northern Spain, with the exception of the RCP 8.5 scenario for 2070, in which an increase of 4.42% is forecast. The research findings demonstrate the significant presence of eucalypt in natural protected areas and the possibility of expansion of eucalypts in Galicia in the absence of effective control. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Environmental variables; Natural protected areas; Potential expansion; Random Forest; Species distribution model; Tasmanian blue gum","Climate models; Conservation; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Forestry; Learning systems; Random forests; Broad-leaved forests; Climate change scenarios; Environmental variables; Eucalyptus globulus labill; National forest inventories; Natural protected areas; Species distribution models; Species distributions; Climate change; climate change; environmental factor; evergreen tree; forest inventory; future prospect; machine learning; plantation; population distribution; population modeling; vegetation cover; Area; Conservation; Ecosystems; Expansion; Forestry; Increments; Spain; Variables; Asturias; Cantabria; Galicia [Spain]; Orense [Galicia]; Spain; Eucalyptus globulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095799580

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to look at this relationship using individual-level data. We find that for Mexico City there is evidence of a positive relationship between pollution and mortality that significantly grows with age and that appears to be mostly driven by long- rather than short-term exposure. By using a rich set of individual- and municipal-level covariates we are able to isolate the effect of exposure to pollution from other crucial factors, thus alleviating endogeneity concerns related to selection. Our results provide yet another reason for the need to implement environmental strategies that will reduce the exposure to air pollution: it is a key element to improve the general population's health. In addition, and considering that at this moment we do not know when the pandemic will stop or if SARS-CoV-2 will become a recurrent threat, the relationship that we uncovered suggests that financial resources should be allocated to improve medical services in those areas where PM2.5 concentrations tend to be high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Health; Mexico; Mortality; PM2.5; SARS-CoV-2","Environmental management; Air pollution exposures; Environmental strategy; Financial resources; General population; Individual levels; Municipal levels; PM2.5 concentration; Short-term exposure; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; age; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; financial management; food security; health care access; human; hypertension; mathematical analysis; Mexico; mortality; mortality rate; pandemic; particulate matter 2.5; population health; priority journal; probability; recurrence risk; resource allocation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking; adverse event; air pollutant; city; epidemiology; Mexico; particulate matter; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mexico; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097551378

Besides, the presence of biochar can affect microbial activity. However, information about the action of biochar in the microbial community is scarce. Thus, we hypothesize that biochar, with or without previous addition of NPK fertilizer may alter the activity of some enzymes and total microbial quality of soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the enzymatic activities and the total microbiological activity of soil amendments with different doses of biochar and grown with sugarcane over time. For two consecutive years, soil samples were collected in the sugarcane planted line amendment with biochar. Sugarcane was planted in 2017, in a randomized block design, a 5 × 2 factorial scheme, with four replications: five doses of biochar (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Mg ha−1 (megagram per hectare)), with and without correction of soil fertility. The activities of the enzymes β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, urease, and total microbial quality of the soil were evaluated (fluorescein diacetate method). The application of biochar from eucalyptus residues up to the dose of 30 Mg ha−1 increased the activity of the enzymes β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, urease and the total microbial quality of the soil; however, higher doses reduced the activity of these enzymes and the total microbial quality of the soil over time. The application of mineral fertilizers, in combination with biochar, increased the enzymatic activity of β-glucosidase, arylsulfatase and urease and the total microbial quality of the soil in the soil over time. On the other hand, the addition of NPK fertilizer reduced the activities of the acid phosphatase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acid phosphatase; Arylsulfatase; Fluorescein diacetate; Microbiological activity; Urease; β-glucosidase","Enzyme activity; Fertilizers; Magnesium; Phosphatases; Quality control; Beta glucosidase; Enzymatic activities; Fluorescein diacetate; Microbial activities; Microbial communities; Microbial quality; Microbiological activity; Mineral fertilizers; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097714987

It is important to know how surface climates respond under low warming targets. The present study investigates the surface temperature changes under the low-forcing scenario of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6) and its updated version (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP1-2.6) by the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (FGOALS) models participating in phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6, respectively). In both scenarios, radiative forcing (RF) first increases to a peak of 3 W m−2 around 2045 and then decreases to 2.6 W m−2 by 2100. Global mean surface air temperature rises in all FGOALS models when RF increases (RF increasing stage) and declines or holds nearly constant when RF decreases (RF decreasing stage). The surface temperature change is distinct in its sign and magnitude between the RF increasing and decreasing stages over the land, Arctic, North Atlantic subpolar region, and Southern Ocean. Besides, the regional surface temperature change pattern displays pronounced model-to-model spread during both the RF increasing and decreasing stages, mainly due to large intermodel differences in climatological surface temperature, ice-albedo feedback, natural variability, and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation change. The pattern of tropical precipitation change is generally anchored by the spatial variations of relative surface temperature change (deviations from the tropical mean value) in the FGOALS models. Moreover, the projected changes in the updated FGOALS models are closer to the multi-model ensemble mean results than their predecessors, suggesting that there are noticeable improvements in the future projections of FGOALS models from CMIP5 to CMIP6. © 2020, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AMOC; Arctic amplification; low warming targets; Southern Ocean; surface temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096384286

The non-point source pollution risk is evaluated based on the geological environment assessment and the relevant theories of the land use system combined with the multi-criteria analysis method. According to the evaluation results, subarea governance is implemented in the mountainous watershed. Besides, the SPARROW model is applied to simulate and analyze the total nitrogen transport in the watershed. The evaluation results reveal that the NPA value, the non-point source pollution risk assessment index, of some areas of the mountainous watershed has reached 0.9 or higher, which belong to heavily polluted areas. The pollution sources mainly come from agricultural production, and deep application of fertilizer can reduce total nitrogen emission. The simulation results show that the pH of the soil is instrumental in the total nitrogen reduction, with the total nitrogen loading coefficient being about 2.74.

Concentration data for each month of the first semester of 2020 were compared with those of the previous six years, on monthly, daily, and hourly bases, so that pre, during, and post-lockdown conditions of air quality could be separately analyzed. The results show that, as in many other areas worldwide, the Po Valley experienced better air quality during 2020 spring months for NO2 and benzene. In agreement with the reductions of nitrogen oxides and benzene emissions from road traffic, estimated to be -35% compared to the regional average, the monthly mean concentration levels for 2020 showed reductions in the -40% to -35% range compared with the previous years, but with higher reductions, close to -50%, at high-volume-traffic sites in urban areas. Conversely, NH3 ambient concentration levels, almost entirely due the emissions of the agricultural sector, did not show any relevant change, even at high-volume-traffic sites in urban areas. These results point out the important role of traffic emissions in NO2 and benzene ambient levels in the Po Valley, and confirm that this region is a rather homogeneous air basin with urban area hot-spots, the contributions of which add up to a relatively high regional background concentration level. Additionally, the relatively slow response of the air quality levels to the sudden decrease of the emissions due to the lockdown shows that this region is characterized by a weak exchange of the air masses that favors both the build-up of atmospheric pollutants and the development of secondary formation processes. Thus, air quality control strategies should aim for structural interventions intended to reduce traffic emissions at the regional scale and not only in the largest urban areas. © 2021 by the authors.

High-performance compact engines have not been studied, even though advantages of laser ignition could be much more pronounced for those because of harmful emission reduction and multi-fuel abilities. Compact piston engines are considered as an alternative for fuel elements and batteries for portable, automotive and unmanned aerial vehicles. These are characterized by a small combustion chamber comparable to the spark plug inter-electrode gap in axial direction, and its low ratio to bore size. However, for Wankel engines this problem exists at any scale. Laser ignition of lean fuel mixtures in such engines could significantly improve performance by reduced fuel consumption, thermal loads, and a cleaner exhaust. We have investigated the possibility of laser ignition in rotary-piston (Wankel) sub-kW scale model engine using different kinds of fuel mixtures: hydrogen, methane, propane, butane, gasoline, and ethanol based.

The flexibility of the process was recently demonstrated, yet it is unknown how intermittent hydrogen feeding impacts the functionality of the microbial communities. We investigated the effect of starvation events on the hydrogen consumption and methane production rates (MPRs) of two different methanogenic communities that were fed with hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both communities showed functional resilience in terms of hydrogen consumption and MPRs upon starvation periods of up to 14 days. The origin of the inoculum, community structure and dominant methanogens were decisive for high gas conversion rates. Thus, pre-screening a well performing inoculum is essential to ensure the efficiency of biomethanation systems operating under flexible gas feeding regimes. Our results suggest that the type of the predominant hydrogenotrophic methanogen (here: Methanobacterium) is important for an efficient process. We also show that flexible biomethanation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide with complex microbiota is possible while avoiding the accumulation of acetate, which is relevant for practical implementation. In our study, the inoculum from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating wastewater from paper industry performed better compared to the inoculum from a plug flow reactor treating cow manure and corn silage. Therefore, the implementation of the power-to-gas concept in wastewater treatment plants of the paper industry, where biocatalytic biomass is readily available, may be a viable option to reduce the carbon footprint of the paper industry. © Copyright © 2021 Logroño, Popp, Nikolausz, Kluge, Harms and Kleinsteuber.","anaerobic digester; biogas upgrading; biomethane; hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; intermittent feeding; Methanobacterium; power-to-gas; wastewater treatment","biogas; biomethane; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; methane; unclassified drug; anaerobic digestion; Article; biodegradability; biogas upgrading; carbon footprint; electricity; environmental resilience; feeding; fermentation; hydrogenotrophic methanogen; hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; industrial production; inoculation; maize; manure; methane production rate; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; microflora; nonhuman; paper mill; power to gas; silage; sludge; starvation; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101887903

The exact mechanisms behind this super-CC scaling phenomenon are still unsolved. Recent studies highlight invigorated local dynamics as a contributor to enhanced precipitation rates with warming. Here, cold pools play an important role in the process of organization and deepening of convective clouds. Another known effect of cold pools is the amplification of low-level moisture variability. Yet, how these processes respond to climatic warming and how they relate to enhanced precipitation rates remains largely unanswered. Unlike other studies which use rather simple approaches mimicking climate change, we present a much more comprehensive set of experiments using a high-resolution large eddy simulation (LES) model. We use an idealized but realistically forced case setup, representative for conditions with extreme summer precipitation in midlatitudes. Based on that, we examine how a warmer atmosphere under the assumption of constant and varying relative humidity, lapse rate changes and enhanced large-scale dynamics influence precipitation rates, cold pool dynamics, and the low-level moisture field. Warmer conditions generally lead to larger and more intense events, accompanied by enhanced cold pool dynamics and a concurring moisture accumulation in confined regions. The latter are known as preferred locations for new convective events. Our results show that cold pool dynamics play an increasingly important role in shaping the response of local precipitation extremes to global warming, providing a potential mechanism for super-CC behavior as subject for future research. © 2020.

In so doing, the high temperature waste heat discharged by the heat pump hot sink can be fruitfully exploited. Additionally, a PV array has been added to the typical layout based on the solar collectors, in order to assure the heat pump electrical driving. The energy analysis is carried out by calculating the energy performance indicators of the whole cooling system, simulating it by a dynamic model built in the MATLAB SIMULINK environment.

These models, however, capture just some of the processes that will shape future nutrition. We adopt an alternative standpoint, developing an agent-based model in which producer-consumer smallholders practice different ‘styles of farming’ in the global food system. The model represents a hypothetical rural community in which ‘orphan’ (subsistence) farmers may develop by adopting an ‘entrepreneurial’ style (highly market-dependent) or by maintaining a ‘peasant’ style (agroecology). We take a first look at the question: how might patterns of farming styles—under various style preference, climate, policy, and price transmission scenarios—impact on hunger and health-supporting conditions (incomes, work, inequality, ‘real land productivity’) in rural areas? imulations without climate change or agricultural policy found that style preference patterns influence production, food price, and incomes, and there were trade-offs between them. For instance, entrepreneurial-oriented futures had the highest production and lowest prices but were simultaneously those in which farms tended towards crisis. Simulations with climate change and agricultural policy found that peasant-orientated agroecology futures had the highest production, prices equal to or lower than those under entrepreneurial-oriented futures, and better supported rural health. There were, however, contradictory effects on nutrition, with benefits and harms for different groups. Collectively the findings suggest that when attempting to understand how climate change may impact on future nutrition and health, patterns of farming styles—along with the fates of the households that practice them—matter. These issues, including the potential role of peasant farming, have been neglected in previous global-level climate-nutrition modelling but go to the heart of current debates on the future of farming: thus, they should be given more prominence in future work. © 2021 Lloyd, Chalabi.

The electric power sector has to make its own contributions to the national CO2 emissions mitigation target. In this study, a patron–client interactive optimized (PCIO) model is proposed to investigate the regional energy–water–carbon nexus optimization under the policy background of the CEUP target. Inner Mongolia, the largest energy base in China, which is also facing the prominent contradiction including the energy production and serious environmental problems, is chosen as a case study. Multiple uncertainties, including the fuel price uncertainty and output of the wind and solar power, are considered to make the optimization process more realistic. Results show that coal-fired power will gradually be substituted by the gas, wind, and solar power in Inner Mongolia to reach the CEUP target. The CO2 capture and storage technology and air-cooling systems will play important roles, especially under the strict water policy scenario. However, the achievement of the CEUP and water-saving target will be at the expense of high system costs. The PCIO model makes it possible for the decision-maker to make flexible strategies to balance the CEUP target and saving system costs. The results have demonstrated the validity of the PCIO model in addressing the hierarchical programming problems. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, many strategies have been adopted to improve the stability of phosphors. However, it is still lack of report on the improvement of thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance of phosphors by a single layer coating. Due to the high transmittance and high chemical inertness of graphene, it was coated on the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor by chemical vapor deposition, aiming to improve its thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance. The chemical composition and microstructure of the coating were characterized and analyzed. A nanoscale carbon layer was attached on the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor particles in an amorphous state. In coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor, the oxidation degree of Eu2+ to Eu3+ was significantly suppressed. At the same time, the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ particle turned from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after carbon coating, and consequently the hydrolysis resistance of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor was greatly improved. After tests at 85 °C and 85% humidity for 200 h, the carbon coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor still maintained about 95% of its initial luminous intensity as compared with 35% of the uncoated. By observing the in-situ microstructure evolution of coated phosphor in air-water vapor environment, remained presence of the carbon layer even at 500 °C explained the excellent chemical stability of carbon coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor in complex environment. These results indicate that a nanoscale carbon layer can be used to provide superior thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance of (oxy) nitrides phosphors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Carbon layer; Chemical vapor deposition; Hydrolysis resistance; Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+; Thermal stability","Air; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Chemical resistance; Chemical stability; Chemical vapor deposition; Coatings; Hydrolysis; Light emission; Microstructure; Nanotechnology; Silicon; Thermodynamic stability; Chemical compositions; Chemical inertness; Complex environments; High transmittance; Hydrolysis resistance; Micro-structure evolutions; Phosphor particles; White light emitting diodes; Phosphors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091794443

In this research, the contributions and mechanisms of biochar on autotrophic nitrification (ANF), heterotrophic nitrification (HNF), and denitrification (DF) to N2O emissions were studied by using 15N stable isotopes and high-throughput sequencing after laboratory incubation. The results showed that biochar addition at 2% (B2) significantly reduced the N2O emissions from the ANF by an average of 20.6%, while adding 5% biochar (B5) had no significant effect on the ANF. Both B2 and B5 significantly reduced the N2O emissions from the HNF by 15.7% and 13.2%, respectively, and reduced the N2O emissions from the DF by 40.9% and 11.7%, respectively. B2 enhanced the relative contribution rate of the ANF to N2O emissions by 6.3%, while B5 had little effect on it. Biochar addition significantly changed the copy numbers of the AOA and AOB, as well as the nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, but it had no significant effect on the community composition of the AOA and had minimal effect on the AOB community. B2 significantly increased the abundance of the genus Rhodococcus of nirK type denitrifiers and had a significant effect on the relative abundance of Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas of the nosZ type denitrifiers. These results revealed that the inhibitory effects of biochar on N2O emissions from nitrification might be attributed to the direct immobilization and adsorption of inorganic N by biochar and to its promotion of the genus Rhodococcus of nirK-type denitrifiers and the genera Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas of the nosZ-type denitrifiers.

Here, we report the seasonal and spatial patterns of CH4 uptake across a 1200 km transect in arid and semi-arid steppe ecosystems in Inner Mongolia, ranging from meadow steppe in the east plain to typical and desert steppes on the west plateau. In general, seasonal patterns of CH4 uptake were site specific, with unimodal seasonal curves in meadow and typical steppes and a decreasing seasonal trend in desert steppe. Soil moisture was the dominant factor explaining the seasonal patterns of CH4 uptake, and CH4 uptake rate decreased with an increase in soil moisture. Across the transect, CH4 uptake showed a skewed unimodal spatial pattern, with the peak rate observed in the typical steppe sites and with generally higher uptake rates in the west plateau than in the east plain. Soil moisture, together with soil temperature, soil total carbon, and aboveground plant biomass, were the main drivers of the regional patterns of CH4 uptake rate. These findings are important for model development to more precisely estimate the soil CH4 sink capacity in arid and semi-arid regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Global warming; Precipitation gradient; Regional scale; Soil moisture; Steppe type","Atmospheric chemistry; Methane; Arid and semi-arid regions; Atmospheric methanes; In-situ measurement; Model development; Regional pattern; Seasonal patterns; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal patterns; Soil moisture; carbon; methane; aboveground biomass; arid region; carbon cycle; climate effect; global warming; in situ measurement; methane; precipitation assessment; regional climate; semiarid region; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; steppe; Article; atmospheric transport; biogeochemical cycle; biomass; climate change; controlled study; desert; gas evolution; Mongolia; priority journal; seasonal variation; semiarid climate; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; steppe; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096617039

However, distinct responses of O3 concentrations were observed across China. In the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions, O3 concentrations were enhanced by 90.21 and 71.79% from pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020, significantly greater than the equivalent concentrations for the same periods over 2015–2019 (69.99 and 43.62%, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, a decline was detected (−1.1%) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. To better understand the underlying causes for these inconsistent responses across China, we adopted the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and ordinary linear squares (OLS) methods in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that a sharp decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was the major driver of enhanced O3 in the BTH region as it is a NOx-saturated region. In the YRD region, season-shift induced changes in the temperature/shortwave radiative flux, while lockdown induced declines in NO2, attributable to the rise in O3. In the PRD region, the slight drop in O3 is attributed to the decreased intensity of radiation. The distinct regimes of the O3 response to the COVID-19 lockdown in China offer important insights into different O3 control strategies across China. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few studies have comprehensively explored the spatial characteristics of CO2 emissions (CEs) and their influencing factors at the city level from different perspectives. After collecting spatial data from 280 Chinese prefecture-level cities for 2005, 2012, and 2015, this work firstly uncovered the overall and local spatial characteristics of CEs by adopting spatial autocorrelation analysis. Then, five influencing factors, including the total resident population (POP), per capita GDP (PCGDP), energy intensity (EI), the proportion of secondary industry (SI), and climate factor–heating degree days (HDD), were examined using global and local regression models. The analyses revealed that (1) CEs presented spatial agglomeration features from global and local perspectives, indicating spatial association between neighboring cities; and (2) POP, PCGDP, EI, and HDD had statistically significant spatial correlations with CEs, and their effect sizes were as follows: PCGDP &gt; POP &gt; EI &gt; HDD. More importantly, the impacts of these influencing factors on CEs varied across cities, exhibiting obvious spatial heterogeneity. According to these findings, local governments should strengthen coordination and cooperation with their surrounding cities to promote regional synergistic action on emission reduction. In addition, policymakers should also design differentiated abatement policies based on regional characteristics and differences instead of applying similar policies to all cities. © 2020","CO2 emissions; Influencing factors; Multi-scale geographically weighted regression; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatially varying impacts","Climate models; Emission control; Regression analysis; Heating degree-days; Local regression models; Regional characteristics; Spatial associations; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial characteristics; Spatial correlations; Spatial heterogeneity; Carbon dioxide; abatement cost; autocorrelation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental policy; numerical model; spatial data; Article; autocorrelation; carbon footprint; China; climate; energy intensity; environmental factor; environmental impact; geographic distribution; gross national product; heating; industry and industrial phenomena; physical phenomena; priority journal; risk assessment; secondary industry; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090404680

In this study, Cu was loaded on different TiO2 substrates, pristine TiO2 and black TiO2 (denoted as H-TiO2) to achieve better CO2 photocatalytic reduction performance. Both TiO2@Cu and H-TiO2@Cu exhibited dramatic enhancement for CO and CH4 production. The peculiar phenomenon of TiO2 outperforming H-TiO2 after ALD loading was further studied by a series of characterization methods. Even though H-TiO2 showed superior performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction than TiO2, pristine TiO2 loaded with more Cu0/+ after ALD deposition surpassed the performance of H-TiO2@Cu which possessed less amount of Cu0/+ and more Cu2+. Cu0/+ is proved to be the crucial factor for CO2 reduction and it is capable of overshadowing the influence of Ti3+ and Vo. These results indicate that not only will ALD technique significantly enhance the CO2 reduction performance after Cu deposition, but the substrate employed for loading and the chemical state of loaded material will also influence the subsequent catalytic performance. In addition, our result provides additional experiment evidence for justifying the significance of Cu0/+ in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. © 2020","ALD (atomic layer deposition); Cu0/+/Cu2+; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction; TiO2","Atomic layer deposition; Carbon dioxide; Oxide minerals; Substrates; Titanium dioxide; Additional experiments; Catalytic performance; Characterization methods; Chemical state; CO2 reduction; Cu deposition; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic reduction; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089899746

Then, a three-stage solution approach is developed to solve this model, including a k-means clustering for simplifying the problem, and a hybrid heuristic for searching the optimal vehicle routes based on Clarke & Wright algorithm and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (CW-ALNS). Finally, an improved Shapley value model is constructed for determining the costs and carbon emissions reduction amount and the best alliance sequence of each participant. The experiment results indicate that: (1) the effectiveness of CW-ALNS algorithm is verified through the benchmark instances; (2) the costs and carbon emissions of the collection network could be reduced simultaneously after the implementation of cooperation; (3) constructing a large collection and transfer network is more efficient than dividing the network into several individual parts.

The results show that the NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23–37%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14–20%), SO2 (2–20%), PM2.5 (7–16%), and CO (7–11%), but the O3 increases 10–27%. Furthermore, intra/intercity travel restrictions have a better performance in curbing air pollution. These results are robust to a set of alternative specifications, including different panel sizes, independent variables, estimation strategies. The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the lockdown effects are more remarkable in cities from lower-income, more industrialized, and populous countries. We also do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 99,270 to 146,649 among 76 countries and regions involved in this study during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings underscore the importance of continuous air pollution control strategies to protect human health and reduce the associated social welfare loss both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Difference-in-differences analysis; Health benefits; Lockdown","Air quality; Health; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality indices; Back-of-the-envelope calculations; Difference-in-differences; Estimation strategies; Global perspective; Government response; Independent variables; Travel restrictions; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; environmental impact; epidemic; health impact; statistical analysis; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; analysis; Article; cause of death; city; containment and health index; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; developed country; difference in differences analysis; economic support index; economics; environmental temperature; geography; government; government response index; health; humidity; low income country; particulate matter; pollution control; population; premature death; priority journal; quarantine; rural area; stringency index; travel; weather; wind speed; air pollutant; air pollution; human; pandemic; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092141230

Periods of drought and flood, although regular, are stressful events encountered by methanogenic anaerobes in alkaline wetlands. To investigate the response of the CH4 cycle of alkaline wetlands to such stresses, we take Zhalong wetland as an example, then determined the CH4 flux and soil microbiomes in the wetland during wet, dry, and flooded periods. The in-situ CH4 flux in the wet period was 9.55–17.29 mg‧m−2‧h−1, but sharply degraded to 3.37–6.61 mg‧m−2‧h−1 in the dry period. It resumed to 4.51–20.80 mg‧m−2‧h−1 when the wetland was flooded again, which indicated that methanogenesis is quite resilient to drought. Syntrophic acetogenesis, and subsequently aceticlastic methanogenesis, were the dominant methanogenic pathways and resisted drought. Members belonging to Syntrophobacterales were the dominant syntrophic acetogens. They enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state to resist drought. The dominant Methanosarcinales have the ability to repair reactive oxygen species damage during dry periods. The community of CH4 sink was governed by anaerobic methanotrophs, which entered a VBNC state or used repair systems to survive dry periods.

The basins host many large uranium deposits. Here, we studied the geological characteristics, uranium mineralization ages, and C-O-S isotopes in the basins. In addition, we discussed the uranium mineralization stages, uranium mineralization fluids, and established the regional mineralization models. In the basins, uranium mineralization occurs at specific periods during tectonic evolution. The uranium-rich basement strata and magmatic rocks created under a certain tectonic background are the sources of uranium for the large-scale uranium metallogenic belt. Uranium mineralization occurs through multiple stages and across a long duration. Uranium metallogenic ages progressively become newer from west to east. Analysis of the C-O-S isotopes revealed that the compositions of uranium ore-forming fluids in the craton basin are more complex. Specifically, we found that meteoric water, deep oil and gas, mantle fluids, dissolution of marine organic carbonates, reducing media in sand bodies, and conate water contribute to uranium mineralization. In superimposed basins, due to the development of crust-scale thrust and high heat flow, in addition to meteoric water, connate water, dissolution of carbonate in marine organic matter, and the reducing medium in host layers, the upper mantle fluid is very large scale participated in the mineralization, and the oil and gas did not obviously participate in the uranium mineralization. The host layers sand bodies of the uranium deposits provide storage space for uranium and a channel for migration of fluids. After deposition, the basins undergoes different degrees of structural inversion, forming different degrees of denudation windows, thereby providing a basis for the migration of meteoric water and deep reduce fluids. The denudation window promotes the migration and escape of ore-forming fluids into the basin. Under the redox action of uranium ore-forming fluids and reducing media, phreatic, phreatic-interlayer oxidation zone, and interlayer oxidation zone together with uranium ore bodies are formed. Based on the study of uranium metallogenic characteristics and ore-forming fluids, the hydrodynamic models and metallogenic models of the basins are established. Moreover, the geotectonic evolution and its dynamic models at different stages in this area are discussed. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Craton basin; Fluid dynamics; Superimposed basin; Uranium deposit; Uranium mineralization characteristics; Xingmeng area","carbonate; craton; dissolution; heat flow; marine environment; meteoric water; mineralization; ore-forming fluid; organic matter; tectonic evolution; upper mantle; uranium; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099961558

Finland as an important forest industry country with the ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2035 is selected to a target county. This study aims to present a plausible assessment of the future of the Finnish forest industry until 2035 based on literature and a scenario building approach. The focus is on energy use and fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results suggest that electricity consumption will decrease, whereas electricity production will increase, which indicates that forest industry can provide more renewable electricity to the grid. Heat consumption may even increase as a result from building new biorefineries, but those mills can most probably meet their heat demand by combusting biofuels. Changes in forest industry’s direct fossil CO2 emissions can reduce Finnish fossil CO2 emissions 2─4% in comparison to 2018. Biofuels production is likely to rise, but the extent remains to be seen. It is concluded that the Finnish forest industry can contribute significantly to meeting national climate policy targets, and forest industry in general can play a role in mitigating global change. Additionally, it was found that development of the Finnish forest industry will probably be limited by the requirement for sustainable wood harvesting, which may also be a problem for other forest industry countries. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; CO2 emissions; Energy use; Forest industry; Scenario building","assessment method; biofuel; carbon dioxide; emission control; energy use; environmental policy; forest resource; fuel consumption; global change; greenhouse gas; mitigation; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103401985

The market for nanotechnology in environmental applications is rapidly growing, signifying the importance of such advancements in practice as well as research. Most nano-enabled remediation challenges in water, soil and air treatment are addressed by two primary phenomena—contaminant degradation by reduction/oxidation reactions or contaminant sequestration through adsorption processes. Despite the scientific accessibility of these fields by virtue of their shared treatment mechanisms, the unique engineering and physical challenges associated with implementation require field-specific solutions and create research bubbles where scientists and engineers may be unfamiliar with current research in parallel areas. Consequently, this review is focused on summarizing the key nano-enabled technologies and their mechanisms in the fields of water, soil and air treatment, as well as describing recent advances and highlighting areas with clear direction for further development. This review covers nano-enabled processes including photocatalysis in air and water treatment, nZVI-mediated reduction and adsorption processes in soil and water treatment, and CO2 capture and reduction including the state-of-the-art materials driving research focused on improving these technologies. This review is intended as a platform for researchers to understand how their expertise fits into the larger community of remediation technology as well as to provide direction for literature review of parallel fields suiting their interest. We conclude by identifying core research focuses and underdeveloped research directions in each of the three areas, most notably, a need for guided evaluation of meaningful composite materials for next-generation catalysts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","CO2 reduction; Electrocatalysis; Environmental remediation; Nanotechnology; Photocatalysis; Toxic metals adsorption","Driers (materials); Nanotechnology; Remediation; Soils; Contaminant degradation; Environmental applications; Environmental remediation; Literature reviews; Nano-scale materials; Reduction/oxidation; Remediation technologies; Scientists and engineers; Water treatment; carbon dioxide; dye; ferrite nanoparticle; iron nanoparticle; iron oxide nanoparticle; iron sulphide nanoparticle; metal ion; metal organic framework; nanoparticle; titanium dioxide; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; unclassified drug; accessibility; adsorption; air quality; catalysis; iron nanoparticle; nanotechnology; photochemistry; soil remediation; water treatment; adsorption; air pollution control; air treatment; chemical parameters; chemical procedures; contamination; dechlorination; degradation; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; immobilization; lattice doping; metal recovery; nano enabled remediation process; nanocatalyst; nanostructured metal electrocatalyst; nanostructured photocatalyst; nanotechnology; organic contaminant; photocatalysis; photocatalytic degradation; reduction (chemistry); Review; semiconductor heterojunction; sensitization; soil treatment; visible light sensitization; water treatment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100554530

Of particular interest in freshwater systems are those species that produce toxins or impact water quality, though evidence for how these species, and many others, will respond is limited. This study investigated the effects of elevated CO2 (1,000 ppm) relative to current atmospheric CO2 partial pressures (400 ppm), on growth, cell size, carbon acquisition, and photophysiology of five freshwater phytoplankton species including a toxic cyanophyte, Raphidiopsis raciborskii, from Lake Wivenhoe, Australia. Effects of elevated CO2 on growth rate varied between species; notably growth rate was considerably higher for Staurastrum sp. and significantly lower for Stichococcus sp. with a trend to lower growth rate for R. raciborskii. Surface area to volume ratio was significantly lower with elevated CO2, for all species except Cyclotella sp. Timing of maximum cell concentrations of those genera studied in monoculture occurred in the lake in order of CO2 affinity when free CO2 concentrations dropped below air equilibrium. The results presented here suggest that as atmospheric levels of CO2 rise, R. raciborskii may become less of a problem to water quality, while some species of chlorophytes may become more dominant.

The oral pathogen encodes an elaborate array of regulatory elements, including the carbon catabolite-responsive regulator, CcpA, a global regulator key in the control of sugar metabolism and in stress tolerance response mechanisms. The recently characterized trehalose utilization operon, integral for the catabolism of the disaccharide trehalose, is controlled by a local regulator, TreR, which has been implicated in a number of cellular functions outside of trehalose catabolism. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CcpA bound a putative cre site in the treR promoter. Loss of ccpA resulted in elevated expression of treR in cultures of the organism grown in glucose or trehalose, indicating that CcpA not only acts as a repressor of trehalose catabolism genes, but also the local regulator. The loss of both CcpA and TreR in S. mutans resulted in an impaired growth rate and fitness response, supporting the hypothesis that these regulators are involved in carbon catabolism control and in induction of components of the organism's stress response. © 2021 The Author(s).","CcpA; regulation; repressor; Streptococcus mutans; trehalose; TreR","catabolite control protein A; chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; glucose; transcription factor; trehalose; bacterial protein; repressor protein; trehalose repressor protein, bacteria; Article; bacterial growth; carbon metabolism; controlled study; DNA binding motif; gel mobility shift assay; gene deletion; gene expression; gene repression; growth rate; nonhuman; physiological stress; prediction; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulon; reporter gene; Streptococcus mutans; treR gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Streptococcus mutans; Bacterial Proteins; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Repressor Proteins; Streptococcus mutans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102153658

Its superior activity than other Hf-MOFs is attributed to its poor crystallinity, defects and large specific surface area, thereby containing more Lewis acid-base sites which promote this reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) computations are performed to explore the catalytic mechanism. The results indicate that alcohol and ketone fill the defects of Hf-MOF to form a six-membered ring transition state (TS) complex, in which Hf as the center of Lewis stearic acid coordinates with the oxygen of the substrate molecule, thus effectively promoting hydrogen transfer process. Other reactive groups, such as –NO2, C = C, -CN, of inadequate hardness or large steric hindrance are difficult to coordinate with Hf, thus weakening their catalytic effect, which explains the specific selectivity Hf-MOF-808 for reducing the carbonyl group. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Density functional theory calculation; Hf-based metal organic framework; Meerwein−Ponndorf−Verley (MPV) reduction; Reaction mechanism","Catalysis; Crystallinity; Hydrogen; Ketones; Catalytic mechanisms; Hydrogen transfer; Large specific surface areas; Poor crystallinity; Reaction mechanism; Reduction reaction; Six-membered rings; Specific selectivity; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099636836

While urinary hydroxylated metabolites of unsubstituted PAHs have been widely used as biomarkers of PAHs exposures, little information is available as to the occurrence of alkyl-PAH metabolites. In this study, we have detected carboxylic acid metabolites of alkyl-naphthalene (2-NAPCA) and alkyl-phenanthrene (2-PHECA) in 314 urine samples repeatedly collected from 45 Los Angeles residents before, during, and after they spent ten weeks in Beijing in summers of 2014–2017. We found that traveling from Los Angeles to Beijing led to 348% (95% CI: 243 to 485%) and 209% (95% CI: 149 to 282%) increases in 2-NAPCA and 2-PHECA concentrations, respectively, which returned to baseline levels after participants came back to Los Angeles. The concentration ratio between 2-PHECA and hydroxy-phenanthrenes was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in Beijing (median: 0.40, IQR: 0.27–0.53) than in Los Angeles (median: 0.51, IQR: 0.32–0.77), where more than 5,000 active gas and oil wells were located. From 2014 to 2017, the concentration ratio of 2-PHECA to hydroxy-phenanthrenes increased by 28.7 (95%CI: 12.3 to 47.6) %/yr in Los Angeles and 18.6 (95%CI: 7.9 to 30.3) %/yr in Beijing, likely resulted from both cities’ efforts to reduce pyrogenic emissions (e.g. vehicle exhaust). These results provided indirect evidence supporting the use of 2-PHECA to hydroxy-phenanthrene ratio as an index to reflect the relative exposure contributions from petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. While our study suggested that urinary PAHCAs may be novel biomarkers of exposure to alkyl-PAHs, future studies with external exposure characterization are warranted to further validate these biomarkers. © 2020 The Authors","Biomarkers; Carboxylic acid; Exposure; Petrogenic; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs); Pyrogenic","Anthracene; Biomarkers; Biomolecules; Carboxylic acids; Mineral oils; Naphthalene; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refining; Alkyl naphthalene; Concentration ratio; External exposure; Hydroxylated metabolites; Incomplete combustion; Petrogenic sources; Pyrogenic emissions; Vehicle exhausts; Metabolites; 2 naphtholic acid; 2 phenanthrenecarboxylic acid; carboxylic acid derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; biological marker; carboxylic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; biomarker; carboxylic acid; concentration (composition); metabolite; PAH; pollution exposure; adult; Article; California; China; controlled study; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; human; longitudinal study; male; metabolite; priority journal; summer; travel; urine level; urine sampling; city; environmental monitoring; Beijing [China]; California; China; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Beijing; Biomarkers; Carboxylic Acids; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Los Angeles; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097740030

Environmental impacts regarding the failure of hydrological facilities, including the loss of sustainable habitats and clean water previously provided by reservoir, have raised concerns. In this study, the potential risks to hydrological infrastructure within the context of the 100-year joint probability of maximum rainfall and peak water stage were examined over the Mountain Island Dam (North Carolina, USA) for the period of 1950–2099. We found that nearly 92% of annual maximum extreme rainfall events were closely related to the passage of hurricanes over the dam's watershed over the 25 years of the validation period. The results show that the projected annual maximum precipitation is likely to intensify under the RCP8.5 climate scenario and the frequency of the annual precipitation maxima exceeding 100 mm/day is projected to increase in the future. Noticeably, it is found that even weaker storm events can contribute a significant amount of rainfall at inland locations. The probability of occurrence of a hurricane like Gustav is higher than that of a 100-year storm rainfall event under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, this type of storm rainfall will more likely occur near the Mountain Island Dam in the future. Inspectors should focus more on observing water level fluctuation and rainfall volume variation at station two under the same rainstorm - water level situations, because it is more sensitive to the once-in-a-century co-occurrence event than other stations. A HEC-RAS (The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) developed the River Analysis System (RAS) to aid hydraulic engineers in channel flow analysis and floodplain determination) simulation demonstrated that the occurrence probability of hurricane Gustav induced rainfall is more than that of 100-year rainfall events and this type of storm rainfall would highly likely occur near the Mountain Island Dam again under the future warming conditions by the conditional prediction of Copula function. Insights gained suggest that it is critical to evaluate the risk of dam failures regarding either extreme weather conditions or potential environmental concerns under the climate change scenarios, especially where human lives are threatened. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","100-Year joint/co-occurrence return periods; Copula function; Dam break simulation; Dynamical-statistically downscaling; HEC-RAS hydrodynamic modeling; Hurricanes","Climate change; Dams; Environmental impact; Floods; Hurricanes; Landforms; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Risk perception; Storms; Water levels; Annual maximum precipitation; Climate change scenarios; Environmental concerns; Extreme weather conditions; Infrastructure failures; Occurrence probability; Probability of occurrence; Water-level fluctuation; Failure (mechanical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097723112

This paper calculates the carbon emission intensity and the carbon emissions per capita of land use in 30 provinces at the national level in China from 2006 to 2016. A spatial correlation model is used to explore its spatiotemporal features. The results show that (1) China’s land use carbon emissions continued to grow from 2006 to 2016. The spatial heterogeneity of carbon emission intensity of land use initially decreased and then increased during this period. The carbon emission of land use pattern reached a peak in 2015 and the land use carbon emission intensity was rela-tively lower in east China; (2) southern China accounts for a majority of the total Chinese carbon sink. Better economic structure, land use structure and industrial structure will lead to lower carbon emission intensity of land use; (3) carbon emissions per capita of land use in China are affected not only by land development intensity, urbanization level, and energy consumption structure, but also by the population policy. It is significant to formulate differentiated energy and land use policies according to local conditions. This study not only provides a scientific basis for formulat-ing different carbon emission mitigation policies for the local governments in China, but also provides theoretical reference for other developing countries for sustainable development.

Center, St. Gabriel, LA, United States","A pilot-scale filtration unit has been modified and operated at the Southern Regional Research Center of the US Department of Agriculture for scaled-up trials to test the efficacy of powdered activated carbon in the removal of color impurities from sugar beet extract (SBE). As a by-product of sugar beet processing, additional sucrose can be recovered from high color SBE by recycling it from the chromatography system back into the crystallization unit. Large amounts of color compounds can make this process unfeasible. Color and other impurities can be reduced prior to further processing into white refined sugar, by application of high surface area powdered activated carbon (PAC). Pilot-plant trials were undertaken to determine the feasibility of using PAC to adsorb both natural and process-induced colorants from SBE. Experiments were performed using a batch decolorization process to maximize color removal and determine optimal PAC distribution as either body feed or filter pre-coat. With initial colors at 4275 ± 114, 4256 ± 223 and 4774 ± 157 ICU for color measured at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively, a target of 50% color removal was achieved using 4000 ppm on volume of PAC, with a recommended distribution of 75% as pre-coat in the filter and 25% as body feed in the feed tank. A 50/50 PAC distribution also reached the target color removal rate. A “merry-go-round” experiment was undertaken to simulate a semi-continuous process to achieve continuous color removal over time. Overall, PAC performance was slightly better for the removal of native sugar beet colorants than colorants produced during processing. Addition of PAC did not lead to significant sucrose losses nor affected the pH of beet extract. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Color removal; Pilot plant; Powdered activated carbon; Sugar beet extract",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089100240

South Korea was analyzed as a case study for which the government has shown motivation to increase renewable energy penetration. Herein, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) including solar and wind energies were selected due to their relatively stable and mature technology. In addition, Power-to-X has been incorporated to cover other renewable energy options such as hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Therefore, an approach of forecasting the weather characteristics and demand loading over a relatively long timeframe was implemented via deep learning techniques (LSTM and GRU) and statistical approaches (Fbprophet and SARIMA), respectively. A deployment strategy incorporating HRES and Power-to-X is then proposed in correspondence to the forecasted results of the 15 regions considered in this study. An extension of this, the reliability of the designed system is further assessed based on the probability of the demand losses with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulation. With the proposed deployment strategy, a total annual cost of 9.88 × 1011 $/year and a greenhouse gas reduction of 1.24 × 106 tons/year are expected for a 35% renewable energy penetration. However, only SNG shows relatively competitive cost (at 23.20 $/m3 SNG), whereas the average costs of electricity (0.133 $/kWh) and hydrogen (7.784 $/kg H2) across the regions are yet to be competitive compared to the current market prices.

The TropO3 profiles are described without the constraints of traditional monthly averages; they are clustered based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to explore the short-term variability, and separated into two 10-year periods to investigate the long-term variability based on pooled statistical analysis. The roles of precursor emissions, dynamic transport, and photochemical formation in multiple-timescale TropO3 variability are further evaluated with the aid of meteorological and satellite data, surface observation, emission inventory, and backward trajectory analysis. The results suggest that TropO3 over Hong Kong has a seasonal and vertical distribution featuring a widely recognized spring maximum. The SOM-based clustering analysis emphasizes a strong dependence of short-term variability in TropO3 profile patterns on cross-latitude transport conditions, including rich-O3 transport from midlatitude region and poor-O3 transport from tropics. However, high O3 levels throughout the troposphere (usually in early spring) are largely due to the combination of stratospheric intrusion and biomass burning. During the whole study period, the O3 concentrations have increased substantially in the lower troposphere. Springtime wildfire-related emissions over the upwind Indochina Peninsula are responsible for the lower free-tropospheric O3 increases. In contrast, the boundary-layer O3 uptrends with a larger increasing rate near the surface are mostly attributed to the reduced NO titration effect due to the sharp reduction of NOx emissions. © 2020.

The Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped BaLa4Si3O13 phosphors exhibit superior thermal behavior to the corresponding Dy3+ singly doped and Eu3+ singly doped BaLa4Si3O13 phosphors. A remarkable enhancement of thermal stability is observed as the Eu3+ concentration increases. The emission intensity is enhanced by a factor of ∼1.1 at 423 K compared to that at 298 K for the 11 mol % Eu3+ doped sample. The improved thermal stability is ascribed to the enhanced energy transfer from Dy3+ to Eu3+ at high temperature, which enhances the Eu3+ emission and effectively compensates the thermal quenching-induced emission reduction.

A nonlinear stomatal conductance response to carbon dioxide concentration (gs-CO2) was incorporated in the VIC model for better representation of the evapotranspiration (ET) response to the elevated CO2. The annual ET of maize and wheat over the agricultural land in Northwest China was found to decrease by 0.54% and 0.21% during 1980–2010, respectively. Under doubled CO2 concentration (660 ppm), the ET reduction of maize and wheat was 23.3 mm and 8.9 mm, which accounted for 4.3% and 1.8% of the corresponding annual ET. The annual ET reduction of maize, under the four future scenarios (RCP4.5_2040s, RCP4.5_2080s, RCP8.5_2040s, and RCP8.5_2080s), was about 1.1–6.4%, resulted from an ensemble mean of eight general circulation models. The effects of elevated CO2 offset part of ET increase caused by the precipitation and temperature changes. This study has practical implications for precise irrigation. The ET response of maize should be paid more attention for its larger potential in saving irrigation water for the studied region. The elevated CO2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural land; Carbon dioxide; Evapotranspiration; Maize; Modified VIC model","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric chemistry; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Water supply; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide concentrations; CO2 concentration; General circulation model; Hydrological response; Irrigation waters; Stomatal conductance; Temperature changes; Carbon dioxide; agricultural land; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); evapotranspiration; hydrological response; maize; physiology; precision agriculture; reduction; stomatal conductance; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097778253

To thoroughly implement the overall requirements for the construction of an ecological civilization and effectively improve the capacity of cities to adapt to climate change, China launched the pilot construction of “Climate Resilient Cities” in 2017. In this paper, 16 prefecture level cities in Anhui Province of China were selected as the research objects, and the multi-level grey system evaluation method was used to measure the climate resilience of these regions. We used the difference in differences method to evaluate the effect of the pilot policy of “Climate Resilient Cities.” The pilot policies of the “Climate Resilient Cities” showed a significant contribution to the regional climate resilience, and, after isolating the impact of other factors on the regional climate resilience, the pilot policies of the “Climate Resilient Cities” increased the climate resilience of the pilot cities by four percentage points. The pilot policies of the “Climate Resilient Cities” had a significant contribution to the urban infrastructure development and ecological space optimization, as well as non-significant impacts to the urban water security, emergency management capacity-building, and science and technology innovation initiatives. © 2021 by the author.

The contribution of ammonia emissions to particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5) has been increasingly emphasized. As a world-famous agricultural country with 523 million farmers (2017, National Bureau of Statistics of China), approximately 70.0–90.0% of China's ammonia emissions come from agriculture. With such a huge population, agriculture industrialization (socioeco-nomic policies and technology upgrades to reduce ammonia emissions from fertilizers and live-stock) has a large potential but is more vulnerable to costs compared to other industries. We need a solution involving both economic benefits and environmental protection. For this purpose, we sent out an anonymous questionnaire consisting of 16 questions to 420 farmers and conducted a field visit survey in a rural area of Jiangsu Province. Through statistical analysis, we found that the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture, which are an important source of ammonia through volatiliza-tion, is normal (200/420 × 100% = 47.62% of farmers use such fertilizers). Among the 420 farmers surveyed, 90.71% of them have knowledge of air pollution from agricultural activities and 92.15% of them have certain understanding of agricultural industrialization policies, indicating that coordinated control of ammonia emissions can be achieved together with policy propaganda. Through factor analysis and correlation analysis, we find that the early propaganda of policies can help farmers to be more willing to accept the policies. The correlation coefficient between awareness of pollution and policy approval is 0.94, and that between policy publicity and policy approval is 0.95. Generally speaking, the promotion of policies is worth carrying out during the implementation pro-cess. © 2021 by the authors.

This has largely been achieved through agricultural intensification that has concurrently increased area-based GHG emissions. The challenge is for agriculture to increase grain yields to meet the food demands of a growing world population while also contributing to climate stabilization goals by reducing net GHG emissions. This study assessed yield-based and area-based emissions and efficiencies for the winter wheat-summer maize (WWSM) rotation system over the period 1996 to 2016 using longterm, longitudinal, farm survey data and detailed soil emission data in Huantai county, Shandong Province, which is an archetype for cereal production across the North China Plain (NCP). In this region, yields have been increasing over time. However, nitrogen fertilizer inputs have decreased substantially with greater adoption of soil nutrient testing. In addition, there has been widespread adoption of residue incorporation into soils. As such, since 2002, the product carbon footprints of wheat and maize have reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively. Meanwhile, area-based carbon footprints for the rotation system have reduced by around 15% over the same period. These findings demonstrate the importance of detailed assessment of soil N2O emissions and rates of soil organic carbon sequestration. They also show the potential for net reductions in GHG emissions in cropping without loss of grain yields. © 2021 by the authors.","Agricultural intensification; Agricultural soils; Carbon efficiency; Fertilizer management; GHG emission; Life cycle assessment; Product carbon footprint","agricultural intensification; carbon sequestration; cereal; cropping practice; food security; greenhouse gas; maize; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; soil emission; soil nutrient; wheat; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100279068

In particular, the increasing use of private cars not only leads to more energy consumption and produces more waste gas, but also makes the traffic structure unbalanced. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and optimize the reasonable traffic structure in order to promote the sustainable development of urban traffic. Based on the characteristics of different transportation modes, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model that maximizes transportation utility, minimizes ecological impact, and minimizes generalized cost. The ideal point method, linear weighting method, and hierarchical sequence method were used to solve and compare the model. It has been concluded that the ideal point method is more suitable for the research of this paper and can be applied to optimize the traffic structure of Beijing. Through example analysis, the optimized urban passenger traffic turnover and sharing rate are more scientific and reasonable, which verifies the feasibility of the model. This model not only guarantees the interests of passengers and reduces carbon emissions, it also maximizes the utility of urban traffic and the lowest generalized cost. It reflects the concept of sustainable development of urban transportation. Finally, we are able to make reasonable suggestions to relevant departments based on the optimization results. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Multiple objective linear programming; Optimize; The ideal point method; Traffic structure; Urban passenger transportation","carbon emission; energy use; linear programing; multiobjective programming; optimization; sustainable development; urban area; Beijing [China]; China; car; China; city; exhaust gas; system analysis; traffic and transport; Automobiles; Beijing; Cities; Programming, Linear; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095747127

Here, we present the first comprehensive and quantitative analysis of sources, potential source regions according to source sectors and source-related human health risks of multi-year atmospheric measurements of PAHs in the Canadian Great Lakes Basin (GLB). The highest PAH concentrations were observed at a rural residential site (Egbert), followed by two regionally representative remote sites [Point Petre (PPT) and Burnt Island]. The levels of most PAHs in the GLB atmosphere significantly decreased between 1997 and 2017, broadly consistent with the decreasing trends of anthropogenic emissions. Coal, liquid fossil fuel, and biomass burning were the most common potential sources. The potential source regions for most source sectors were identified south or southwest of the sampling sites. Risk assessment suggests potential health risks associated with the inhalation of atmospheric PAHs. On a positive note, health risks from coal combustion, liquid fossil fuel combustion, and petrogenic sources at PPT significantly decreased, directly demonstrating the success of emission control in reducing health impacts. In contrast, the health risk from forest fire-related PAH emissions may play an increasing role in the future due to climate change. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate change; Coal combustion; Deforestation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Health; Health risks; Lakes; Mineral oils; Risk assessment; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric measurement; Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Fossil fuel combustion; Mutagenic properties; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Potential health risks; Potential source regions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; coal; fossil fuel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; carcinogen; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; health risk; measurement method; mutagenicity; PAH; public health; residential location; risk assessment; rural area; trend analysis; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric deposition; biomass production; Canadian; climate change; combustion; comparative study; control strategy; controlled study; health hazard; inhalation; lake basin; motor vehicle; quality control; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; rural area; seasonal variation; solid phase extraction; United States; air pollutant; Canada; China; environmental monitoring; human; lake; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Air Pollutants; Canada; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Lakes; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100728731

For this reason, in 2006, total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) was proposed with capital, labor, and energy as inputs and GDP as the desirable output. The later TFEE approach further incorporated pollution as the undesirable output. However, it is problematic to regard GDP (the total value of final products) as the desirable output, because GDP does not include the intermediate consumption, which accounts for a large part of the production activities and may even be larger than the value of GDP. GDP is more suitable for measuring distribution, while VO (value of output) is more appropriate for sustainable production analysis. Therefore, we propose a VO TFEE approach that takes VO as the desirable output instead and correspondingly incorporates the other intermediate materials and services except energy into inputs. Finally, the empirical analysis of the textile industry of EU member states during 2011–2017 indicates that the VO TFEE approach is more stable and convergent in measuring energy efficiency, and is more suitable for helping policymakers achieve the SDGs of energy saving, emissions reduction, and sustainable economic development. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to the complex model physics, the difficulty is outstanding to characterize uncertainties inherited in the parameter space and its impact on the model performance and predictive skills. In this study, we conducted a series of numerical simulations based on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to quantify the sensitivity of a recently developed modeling framework by coupling the dynamics of CO2 transport into a single-layer urban canopy model. The results show that urban morphology (canyon aspect ratio), irrigation, and the physiological properties of urban vegetation predominate the processes of plant CO2 exchange in the built environment. In contrast, the CO2 budget is relatively insensitive to material properties of urban facets in the built environment. The findings in this study can help to unravel the interplay of urban carbon dynamics and the built environment, as well as to inform researchers and policy makers for sustainable urban development towards a low carbon city. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon exchange; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Model sensitivity; Plant physiology; Soil respiration; Urban environment","Aspect ratio; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Dynamics; Forestry; Markov chains; Monte Carlo methods; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Urban growth; Built environment; Low-carbon cities; Markov chain monte carlo algorithms; Model performance; Physiological properties; Sustainable urban development; Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; Urban canopy models; Urban transportation; algorithm; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; climate modeling; Markov chain; microclimate; modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; physiology; plant; sensitivity analysis; soil respiration; uncertainty analysis; urban area; urban development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098088396

Our results indicated that an extensive interface between the catalyst and the electrode substrate could lower the surface tin oxidation states and the hydrophobicity of the catalyst layer during CO2 electrolysis at a current density over 100 mA cm-2. This catalyst-substrate interfacial effect provides the nanosheets with a large interface area to become more selective for CO2 electrochemical reduction but with a higher overpotential requirement as compared to the 3D nanoparticle catalysts with limited interfacial area. Consequently, the electrode with nanosheets as the catalyst achieved a partial current density of formate at 116 mA cm-2 at a cathode potential of -1.03 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is equivalent to a formate production rate of 36 μmol min-1 cm-2. Our work here demonstrates the importance of the catalyst-substrate interface in determining the oxidation states and wettability at the catalyst surface and the ultimate performance of the gas-diffusion electrode.

Some recent studies have examined this issue and presented controversial opinions, but only focus on summertime ozone increase. This study extends a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on China's ozone changes from 2013 to 2017 out of the summer season, combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. The annual trends of air pollutants, e.g., increase in 95th percentile O3 concentration (+1.4–8.7 μg m−3 yr−1), and decreases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5; −4.0~−7.5 μg m−3 yr−1) and sulfur dioxide (−2.6~−9.7 μg m−3 yr−1) are uncovered by satellite and observational data. Model results show that the attributions of surface O3 changes from 2013 to 2017 vary spatially and seasonally, and most regions are more affected by emission changes (−9.5–47.0 μg m−3) rather than meteorological changes (−8.1–21.3 μg m−3). In specific regions and seasons, e.g., south/southwestern and eastern China south of 35°N in May and July, the surface O3 responses to climate variability could have an equal or even greater importance than emission changes. In these major pollution control regions, e.g. northern and mid-eastern China, the precursor emissions control (11–35%) contributes in the same degree as the changes in aerosol effects (35–38%) to surface ozone enhancement in the warm seasons. More scientific emission controls and climate adaptation strategies are required to attain the synergetic control of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol effects; Atmospheric warming; Emission control; Ozone","Air quality; Ozone; Pollution control; Sulfur dioxide; Adaptation strategies; Atmospheric particulate matter; Atmospheric warming; Climate variability; Comprehensive analysis; Fine particulate matter; Ground measurements; Observational data; Particles (particulate matter); ozone; sulfur dioxide; action plan; adaptation; aerosol; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; satellite data; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air pollution control; Article; China; climate change; greenhouse effect; meteorological phenomena; model; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; satellite imagery; summer; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097467588

Third Parade (Period I); the second is from 20 Aug. to 6 Sept. 2015, which is during Sept. Third Parade (Period II). Polar organic tracers, including isoprene, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene and toluene oxidation products, as well as sugars and carboxylic acids were measured. In Period II, rigorous emission-reduction measures were taken in the BTH region. With the anthropogenic emission being cut down significantly, the average concentrations of isoprene, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene and toluene oxidation products and all carboxylic acids (except tetradecanoic, palmitic, and stearic acids), were lower in Period II than those in Period I in LLH, indicating that the SOA tracers were decreased with precursor emission volumes and yields in the atmosphere. Moreover, sugar compounds were shown with comparable levels during the two periods in LLH, suggesting that no measures were taken to reduce the intensities of the biogenic sources. On the contrary, tetradecanoic, palmitic, and stearic acids were shown with obviously higher concentrations in Period II than those in Period I, demonstrating that cooking fumes increased during Sept. Third Parade period. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model combining with tracer-based method was applied to explore the sources of secondary organic carbon (SOC). It reveals that the sources of SOC include isoprene, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene and toluene oxidation products, fossil fuel combustion, cooking fumes and regionally transferred aged aerosols. These sources accounted for 11.3%, 9.0%, 15.5%, 10.9%, 29.2%, 2.9%, 21.1% of SOC for SJZ, and 12.7%, 11.2%, 9.7%, 14.4%, 25.3%, 0%, 26.7% of SOC for LLH, during the whole sampling periods respectively. © 2020 Elsevier LtdCapsule of main findings: SOA tracers can be effectively controlled under emission-reduction measures, together with the cut down of the emission of primary pollutants.

This was done by exploiting a quasi-experimental setting where a special period regulation was implemented in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan region (CZT, located within Hunan Province in southern China), but not in cities surrounding CZT over the same period. Using hourly level data from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2017, and by employing a difference-in-differences model, we found that the special period regulation significantly reduced PM2.5 concentrations, the Air Quality Index, and the probability of the occurrence of severely polluted days in CZT. Furthermore, we found that while this regulation had significant negative impacts on air pollution in Changsha, the impacts were not robust in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan. Our results further revealed that the regulatory effects were significantly negative over a 24-hour time period, but the effects temporarily weakened from 12 pm to 2–3 pm. We also confirmed that such regulations can be used to achieve a “win-win” situation in terms of environmental protection and economic growth. Thus, the results suggest that time-dependent environmental regulations will be valuable in combination with existing policies to improve air quality during specific periods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution reduction; Difference-in-differences method; Special period regulation","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental policy; pollution control; probability; time dependent behavior; Changsha; China; Fujian; Hunan; Xiangtan; Zhuzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095412231

However, little is known about microbial mechanisms behind SOC decline. This study investigated the effects of long-term N and P additions on microbial community composition and SOC decomposition (C mineralization (Cm), mean resistant times for active C pool (MRTa), and slow C pool (MRTs) in alpine meadows. Results showed that the total SOC pool was reduced by 2–9% under N and P additions, of which slow C pool decreased by 3–10%, while active C pool increased by 4–75% compared to the Control. N and P additions shortened MRTs by 34–40% but prolonged MRTa by 30–62%. The relative abundance of four bacterial families was related to Cm or MRTa, while that of most of the fungal families affected SOC decomposition (including Cm, MRTa, and MRTs). N and P additions increased fungal diversity, differentially affected microbial community composition and structure through modifying microbial preference, and increasing the abundance of microbes which are capable of decomposing complex carbohydrate. Soil pH, available N, and total P were main factors determining microbial abundances. Microbial changes due to N and P additions accelerated decomposition of recalcitrant SOC, thus led to declines in slow C pool and total SOC pool but increases in active C pool.

However, the effects of N and P additions on soil organic C (SOC) decomposition and sequestration are not fully understood and their underlying mechanisms are poorly known. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying SOC decomposition and SOC content decline in the topsoil of alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau after 9-years of field N and P additions. Stoichiometric characteristics of soil and microorganisms and their effects on microbial decomposition, including priming effects (PEs), C substrates decomposition, and microbial C use efficiency (CUE), were investigated by adding 13C labeled substrate (glucose or vanillin). Results showed that N and P additions differentially affected the magnitude and direction of PEs and SOC decomposition, accelerated mineralization of glucose and vanillin by 33–45% and 11–45%, respectively, but decreased microbial CUE of glucose and vanillin by 9–15% and 11–48%, respectively. These effects were caused by differential increase in microbial activity and acceleration of microbial decomposition due to N and P additions, and induced lower soil ecological stoichiometric ratios and higher microbial C:N:P ratios. The above effects led to different magnitudes of decomposition and accumulation of SOC and plant-derived C substrate and thus decline in SOC content depending on N and P additions. We found that long-term N and P additions would weaken soil functioning as a C pool for alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ecological stoichiometry; microbial decomposition; nitrogen and phosphorus addition; priming effect; soil organic carbon","Glucose; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Substrates; Labeled substrates; Microbial activities; Microbial decomposition; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Plant communities; Priming effects; Soil organic carbon; Stoichiometric ratio; Soils; decomposition; meadow; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; stoichiometry; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096664741

Consumers usually focus on the tangible cost when choosing an EV or CV but overlook the time cost for restricting purchase or driving and the environmental cost from gas emissions, falling to have a comprehensive understanding of the economic competitiveness of CVs and EVs. In this study, a life cycle cost model for vehicles is conducted to express traffic and environmental policies in monetary terms, which are called intangible cost and external cost, respectively. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), and CVs are compared in four first-tier, four new first-tier, and 4 s-tier and below cities in China. The comparison shows that BEVs and FCEVs in most cities are incomparable with CVs in terms of tangible cost. However, the prominent traffic and environmental policies in first-tier cities, especially in Beijing and Shanghai, greatly increase the intangible and external costs of CVs, making consumers more inclined to purchase BEVs and FCEVs. The main policy benefits of BEVs and FCEVs come from three aspects: government subsidies, purchase and driving restrictions, and environmental taxes. With the predictable reduction in government subsidies, traffic and environmental policies present important factors influencing the competitiveness of BEVs and FCEVs. In first-tier cities, BEVs and FCEVs already have a competitive foundation for large-scale promotion. In new first-tier and second-tier and below cities, stricter traffic and environmental policies need to be formulated to offset the negative impact of the reduction in government subsidies on the competitiveness of BEVs and FCEVs. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the mileage and reducing fuel prices can significantly improve the competitiveness of BEVs and FCEVs, respectively. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Battery electric vehicle; Environmental policy; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Life cycle cost; Traffic policy","Artificial life; Automotive batteries; Battery electric vehicles; Competition; Environmental protection; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Public policy; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Driving restrictions; Economic competitiveness; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental costs; Environmental policy; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Government subsidies; Life cycle cost model; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098966234

However, they suffer from a sluggish faradaic reaction of the anode and low capacity of the cathode. Zeolite-templated carbons are a distinct class of ordered microporous carbon material, which have the characteristic properties related to electrochemical performance. Herein, we design two types of ordered microporous carbon (OMC) as the cathode and anode, which occupy different potential regions, throughin situheterostructure regulation for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors. The OMC has a relatively high graphite degree and expanded interlayer spacing, which can facilitate the storage of sodium ions as the anode. And nitrogen atoms are doped into the OMC framework to achieve nitrogen-doped ordered microporous carbon (N-OMC) as the cathode. The N-OMC not only has electric double layer capacity, but also has pseudocapacitive storage as a result of nitrogen doping. The resulting sodium-ion hybrid capacitor coupling two types of OMC achieves a high energy density of 119 W h kg−1, high power density of 5807 W kg−1, low capacity decay of 0.015% per cycle after 1800 cycles, and low self-discharge rate between 0.0 and 4.0 V.

Whereas, there is an ongoing debate surrounding impact factors for change in vegetation and desertification in arid regions. The present study assesses the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation change in the Ulan Buh Desert, northwest China. Driving factors for desertification were discussed using the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI) and SPOT Vegetation NDVI datasets, high-resolution satellite images, and meteorological and socioeconomic data in the period 1982–2018. The results show a trend of overall greening, with increasing trends at rates between 0.0008/year and 0.0013/year indicated by the two NDVI datasets and with a corresponding reduction in dune activity. The spatial variations of two NDVI datasets verified the significantly greening trend in the northern and southern areas of the desert. Human activity was observed to have impacted vegetation dynamics. It is predicted that the implementation of ecological projects will contribute to the restoration of vegetation during a warmer, wetter climate trend. However, the reduction of wind strength played a dominant role in vegetation greenness and dune stability in the Ulan Buh Desert.

The application of biochar or the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to paddy soils have been proposed as technologies to mitigate N2O emissions, but their mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: An experiment was undertaken to study the combined and individual effects of biochar and DMPP on N2O emission from a paddy field. Changes in soil microbial community composition were investigated. Four fertilized treatments were established as follows: fertilizer only, biochar, DMPP, and biochar combined with DMPP; along with an unfertilized control. Results: The application of biochar and/or DMPP decreased N2O emission by 18.9–39.6% compared with fertilizer only. The combination of biochar and DMPP exhibited higher efficiency at suppressing N2O emission than biochar alone but not as effective as DMPP alone. Biochar promoted the growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), while DMPP suppressed AOB and increased AOA. Applying biochar with DMPP reduced the impact of DMPP on AOB. The nirS-/nirK- denitrifiers were decreased and nosZ-N2O reducers were increased by DMPP and the combination of DMPP and biochar. The abundance of the nirK gene was increased by biochar at the elongation and heading stages of rice development. Compared with fertilizer only, the application of biochar and/or DMPP promoted the abundance of nosZ genes. Conclusion: These results suggest that applying biochar and/or DMPP to rice paddy fields is a promising strategy to reduce N2O emissions by regulating the dynamics of ammonia oxidizers and N2O reducers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AOA; AOB; Biochar; nirS-/nirK- denitrifiers; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide","ammonia; bacterium; biochar; bioremediation; gene expression; inhibitor; microbial community; nitrification; nitrous oxide; oxidation; paddy field; soil microorganism; Archaea; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093918342

Many studies have shown that decomposing the original data into several components with similar attributes is a widely accepted method addressing highly complex data. The resulting issue is that the high complexity of some components obtained is still tricky. This paper develops a new secondary decomposition strategy, which employs the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and the variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose the original series and the acquired intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with maximum sample entropy value, respectively. All components are forecasted, including these generated by the first and secondary decomposition. The final results are obtained by synthesizing the predictions of all components.

This facile mechanical milling strategy ensures large-scale production of 3C-SiC nanoparticles with an amorphous silicon oxide (SiOx) shell and simultaneously induces abundant surface states. The surface states are demonstrated to trap the photogenerated carriers, thus remarkably enhancing the charge separation, while the thin SiOx shell prevents 3C-SiC from corrosion under visible light.

Direct electrocatalytic reduction of NH4HCO3 electrolyte to syngas without CO2 bubbling is rarely reported. A porous Br-modified Ag catalyst with trace amounts of Br on the surface was investigated in 1.0, 2.0 M, and saturated NH4HCO3 electrolyte without CO2 bubbling. This catalyst can generate CO and H2 at ratios with ranges from 2:1 to 3:1. The highest CO Faradaic efficiency of 77.8% was observed with the CO current density of 13.8 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V vs RHE in saturated NH4HCO3 electrolyte. By contrast, the Ag catalyst with high selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO cannot catalyze CO production under this condition. On the Br-modified Ag catalyst, the trace amounts of Br formed a chemical bond with Ag in the Helmholtz surface, leading to changes in the electronic state and structure of Ag.

The calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via C(sp2)[sbnd]I bond oxidative addition, CO insertion, CsI·OAc cluster anion formation, NH[sbnd]H bond activation, ligand exchange of one PPh3 ligand with CsI·HOAc cluster, CO2 insertion, and C(sp2)[sbnd]O bond reductive elimination steps. The CO2 insertion involves the rate-determining transition state with a free energy barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol, consistent with the experimental reaction condition (60 °C). The influence of solvent on the product yield was analyzed. It is found that the CO2 insertion occurs with the coordination of PPh3 ligand in THF while it needs the help of base CsOAc in toluene. The role of bases KOAc and NaOAc has been calculated and compared with CsOAc.

A large amount of this source separated organic (SSO) material is expected to be used as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion processes. Based on a review of properties for likely SSO feedstocks, it is clear that while SSO are high in volatile solids, they are also concentrated sources of nutrients (principally, ammonium). When SSO feedstocks are digested, these nutrients are released into the digestate, where ammonium can cause problems both within the digester and in downstream treatment processes. The focus of this paper is on the performance of two pilot studies designed to remove ammonia from a digester effluent. The process used in the study is a thermal stripping column with tray configuration, operating under a vacuum. In the first study, food waste digestate was treated as a slurry in the stripping column with and without NaOH addition. At process temperatures near 90◦C, the performance with and without caustic was similar. In the second study, centrate from a co-digestion facility, that blends food processing waste with wastewater process solids, was treated in the same thermal stripping column under the same conditions and without chemical addition. The results from both studies, which can be described using the same performance curves, are presented and discussed in this paper. © 2021 by the authors.

This study takes the case of study of Canary Islands, where there are more than 320 desalination plants with different sizes, private, and public. The objective is to propose a new method which integrates this analysis with the replacement of membranes, from 0% to 20% per year in sea water reverse osmosis desalination plants, to reduce the carbon footprint and ecological footprint. If it is considered a replacement of 20% of the elements per year, the carbon footprint could be reduced to between 5% and 6% and even more if it is introduced low energy consumption membranes instead of high rejection elements. The factor mix in Canary Islands, according to the technological structure of the generation park that uses oil products, is around 0.678 kgCO2 /kWh, much higher than in the Spanish mainland where it is 0.263 kgCO2 /kWh. Therefore, it is estimated in Canary Islands 5,326,963 t CO2 /year can be emitted, which represents 2.4 tCO2 /person/year, 12 times more the admissible admissions per inhabitant in the Canary Islands, only considering the seawater desalination sector.

This study carried out a structured interview and life cycle assessment to explore the influence of AWD on life-cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, yields and agronomic management in An Giang Province, Vietnam, which is the 5th-largest rice producer in the world. Farmers in An Giang Province were trained in a course that introduced them to AWD as a technological package known as ‘one must do, five reductions’. All farmers interviewed who attended the course reported that they were implementing AWD (AWD farmers), whereas interviewed farmers who did not attend the course reported that they did not implement AWD (non-AWD farmers). The present study showed that yields were almost identical among the AWD and non-AWD farmers. Irrespective of the water management, on-site burning was practised as straw management by &gt;75% of farmers. Due to the influence of the technological campaigns, AWD allowed farmers in An Giang Province to reduce LC-GHG emissions without decreasing yields significantly and with lower use of fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphate) and seeds. Furthermore, the results suggest that a reduction in the use of fertilizer and seed does not reduce yields significantly for either AWD or non-AWD farmers, but careful straw management is required to avoid an increase in LC-GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Alternate wetting and drying; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Rice yield","Agronomy; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphate fertilizers; Seed; Water management; Wetting; Emissions reduction; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management IS; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Rice production; Straw management; WETTING AND DRYING; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097711050

This study aimed to investigate the use, management, and attitudes towards biogas technology in rural communities in Ethiopia and assess its’ potential in reducing the consumption of biomass fuels and emissions of GHG. A questionnaire survey sampled from 40 biogas user and 40 non-user households was used to collect data. The biogas flow rate was measured using a gas flow meter from three random biogas digesters. Biogas and non-biogas user households reported similar socioeconomic perspectives. Our results showed that 92.5% of biogas user households and 77.5% of non-users had a positive attitude towards biogas technology, however, 52.5% of the non-users lacked information about the technology while 25% of the non-users were deterred by biogas installation costs. The average biogas consumption of each household was from 496 to 566 m3 yr−1 for cooking and from 106 to 124 m3 yr−1 for lighting. Biogas user households consumed fuelwood and crop residue to the same extent as non-user households for baking foods. However, biogas user households differed significantly from non-user households in biomass fuel use for non-baked foods owing to the suitability of biogas stoves. Each biogas user household reduced their fuelwood and charcoal use by about 2410 kg yr−1 and 379 kg yr−1, respectively, and decreased their kerosene use (for lighting) by about 9.5 L yr−1. The GHGs emitted by each household was estimated at 10,242 kg CO2e yr−1 and 16,266 kg CO2e yr−1 for biogas user and non-user households, respectively. Thus, each household with a biogas digester has the potential to reduce 6024 kg CO2e yr−1 of GHG emission. Biogas energy can offer an opportunity to mitigate GHGs emissions through reduced pressure on forests. Its’ contribution can more than double by improving the biogas stove design to fit the traditional baked foods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas digester; End use; Energy; Fuelwood; Greenhouse gas; Stove design","Agricultural wastes; Bakeries; Biomass; Charcoal; Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Flow of gases; Flowmeters; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lighting; Petroleum prospecting; Stoves; Surveys; Wood products; Biogas digesters; Biogas technologies; Forest degradation; Fuelwood extraction; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Installation costs; Positive attitude; Questionnaire surveys; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097199060

A field experiment was conducted to investigate effects of leaf trait on particulate matter trapping of 12 plant species in urban roads, Chengdu. The traits of leaf shape and surface were qualitatively described in the experiment. PM content per unit leaf area and heavy metal element content per unit leaf weight were measured respectively.PM content per unit leaf area was significantly increased by rough leaf surface characteristic of hair or complex surface texture. Meanwhile, significant positive correlation between Cd and Hg content per unit leaf weight with PM content per unit leaf area was observed. These results partially supported our hypothesis. In addition, significant linear regression between ascorbic acid content and air pollution tolerance index of plant was observed. It was suggested that increase of ascorbic acid content enhanced tolerance of plants to air pollution.

Taiwan's EF methods refer to the annual reports of the Global Footprint Network (GFN). Therefore, the calculation method closely follows international trends and is updated accordingly. Since the first calculation of Taiwan's EF in 1998, Taiwan's EF has been revised several times. At present, the EF from 1994 to 2011 can be obtained. The purpose of this study is to update Taiwan's EF from 2012 to 2018. This study divides the biologically productive lands into six categories. Since there are two different data sources for fishing grounds and carbon emissions, Taiwan's EF can be calculated with four different results. Overall, Taiwan's EF shows a slow downward trend from 2012 to 2018. Furthermore, Taiwan's carbon footprint accounted for about 70% of the EF, followed by the cropland footprint, which accounted for about 20% of the EF. Compared with global trends, Taiwan's carbon footprint is about 10% higher than the global carbon footprint, indicating that Taiwan's carbon emissions are higher than the global average.

However, it is challenging to obtain LETs with a high carrier mobility and uniform light-emission because the semiconductor channel should provide both the electrical charge transport and optical light-emission, and typical emissive semiconductors have low, imbalanced carrier mobilities. In this work, a novel device platform that adapts the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle in LETs, referred to as an ECL transistor (ECLT) is proposed. ECL is a light-emission phenomenon from electrochemically excited luminophores generated by redox reactions. A solid-state ECL electrolyte consisting of a network-forming polymer, ionic liquid, luminophore, and co-reactant is employed as the light-emitting gate insulator of the ECLT. Based on this construction, high-performance LETs that make use of various conventional non-emissive semiconductors (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene), zinc oxide, and reduced graphene oxide) are successfully demonstrated.

There are also concerns about the occupational health and safety of farmworkers. Proven mitigation technologies that are consistent with the socio-eco-nomic challenges of animal farming are needed. We have been scaling up the photocatalytic treatment of emissions from lab-scale, aiming at farm-scale readiness. In this paper, we present the de-sign, testing, and commissioning of a mobile laboratory for on-farm research and demonstration of performance in simulated farm conditions before testing to the farm. The mobile lab is capable of treating up to 1.2 m3/s of air with titanium dioxide, TiO2-based photocatalysis, and adjustable UV-A dose based on LED lamps. We summarize the main technical requirements, constraints, approach, and performance metrics for a mobile laboratory, such as the effectiveness (measured as the percent reduction) and cost of photocatalytic treatment of air. The commissioning of all systems with standard gases resulted in ~9% and 34% reduction of ammonia (NH3) and butan-1-ol, respectively. We demonstrated the percent reduction of standard gases increased with increased light intensity and treatment time. These results show that the mobile laboratory was ready for on-farm deployment and evaluating the effectiveness of UV treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

Various mitigation measures such as business closures have been imposed to reduce health risks. Such measures also limit economic activities and reduce emissions. Measures disproportionately affect the contact-intensive sectors such as the leisure and hospitality industry, as their economic activities involve more person-to-person interactions. Thus, the extent of emission reduction depends on the severity of a measure and the size of the contact-intensive sectors. Using data on business and restaurant closures, school closures and bans on gatherings across 50 U.S. states during the Covid-19 pandemic, an empirical analysis shows that emissions decrease more in states with a more stringent measure and a larger share of the contact-intensive sectors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Contact-intensive sectors; Emissions; Mitigation measures; Pandemics","Economics; Emission control; Health risks; Leisure industry; Plant shutdowns; Economic activities; Emission reduction; Empirical analysis; Hospitality industry; Mitigation measures; Risk assessment; business; economic activity; emission control; environmental economics; health risk; measurement method; risk factor; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099771218

On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO2 showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and environmental protection policy makers, not only to assess the impact of outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality. © The Author(s).","Aging; Heterogeneous reaction; Positive matrix factorization; Seasonal variation","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Disease control; Economics; Energy utilization; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Viruses; Aerosol optical depths; Coal consumption; Nitrogen dioxides; Observational data; Preventive measures; Scientific community; Seasonal differences; Secondary process; Quality control; air quality; COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; epidemic; particulate matter; quarantine; satellite altimetry; solubility; suspended particulate matter; China; Hubei; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Wuhan; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100515271

Engines fueled by diesel without using secondary emission reduction technologies cannot meet MARPOL 73/78 Tier III regulations. The MEPC.203 (62) EEDI directive of the IMO also stipulates a standard for CO2 emissions. This study presents the results of research on ecological parameters when a CAT 3516C diesel engine is replaced by a dual-fuel (diesel-liquefied natural gas) powered Wartsila 9L20DF engine on an existing seaport tugboat. CO2, SO2 and NOx emission reductions were estimated using data from the actual engine load cycle, the fuel consumption of the KLASCO-3 tugboat, and engine-prototype experimental data. Emission analysis was performed to verify the efficiency of the dual-fuel engine in reducing CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions of seaport tugboats. The study found that replacing a diesel engine with a dual-fuel-powered engine led to a reduction in annual emissions of 10% for CO2, 91% for SO2, and 65% for NOx. Based on today’s fuel price market data an economic impact assessment was conducted based on the estimated annual fuel consumption of the existing KLASCO-3 seaport tugboat when a diesel-powered engine is replaced by a dual-fuel (diesel-natural gas)-powered engine. The study showed that a 33% fuel costs savings can be achieved each year. Based on the approved methodology, an ecological impact assessment was conducted for the entire fleet of tugboats operating in the Baltic Sea ports if the fuel type was changed from diesel to natural gas. The results of the assessment showed that replacing diesel fuel with natural gas achieved 78% environmental impact in terms of NOx emissions according to MARPOL 73/78 Tier III regulations. The research concludes that new-generation engines on the market powered by environmentally friendly fuels such as LNG can modernise a large number of existing seaport tugboats, significantly reducing their emissions in ECA regions such as the Baltic Sea. © 2021 by the authors.

We uncover past region-wide declines in effective population size that correspond to decreases in temperature and community biomass in the Northwest Atlantic. We find vulnerable populations near the southern range limit, indicating northward shifts and a possible loss of commercially important life-history variation in response to climate change.

Although the emissions from individual vehicles are regulated by the European emission standards, real driving emissions often exceed these limits. In this study, two multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments on opposite sides of the motorway were used to measure the NO2 absorption caused by road traffic at the A60 motorway close to Mainz, Germany. In combination with wind data, the total NOx emissions for the occurring traffic volume can be estimated. Hereto, the ozone-dependent photochemical equilibrium between NO and NO2 is considered. We show that for 10 May 2019 the measured emissions exceed the maximum expected emissions calculated from the European emission standards for standardised test cycles by a factor of 11 ± 7. One major advantage of the method used here is that MAX-DOAS measurements are very sensitive to the integrated NO2 concentration close to the surface. Thus, all emitted NO2 molecules are detected independently from their altitude, and therefore the whole emission plume originating from the nearby motorway is captured, which is a key advantage compared to other approaches such as in situ measurements. © 2021 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atomic absorption spectroscopy; emission inventory; integrated approach; molecular analysis; optical method; standard (regulation); traffic emission; Germany; Mainz; Rhineland-Palatinate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100474527

ZENs rely on the use of passive-house technologies in combination with local renewable-energy production such as by photo-voltaic (PV) systems to meet the internal energy demand and for export of surplus energy to the external power grid. We developed a modular LCA model that includes five physical elements: buildings, mobility, infrastructure, networks, and on-site energy. The model is applied on Ydalir, an ambitious ZEN in the early planning phases in Norway. Several scenarios were created to explore alternative mobility patterns and an upscaling of electricity production. The results show mobility to be the major source of greenhouse-gas emissions, with 62% of the total emissions in a baseline scenario. To reduce the travel distance of the inhabitants, measures such as car-sharing or greater use of public transports are highlighted as the best options to improve the climate performance of Ydalir. An upscaling of the electricity production from PV panels would allow for significantly reduced system-wide emissions if more surplus electricity is exported and can substitute power generated from fossil fuels or replace fossil fuels used in mobility. © 2020 The Author(s)","Energy locally produced; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Mobility scenarios; Net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission neighbourhood (ZEN)","Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Electricity production; Internal energies; Mobility pattern; Physical elements; Public transport; Scenario analysis; Total emissions; Travel distance; Zero energy buildings; alternative energy; climate change; electricity generation; element mobility; emission control; emission inventory; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098190401

Vehicular traffic is one of the main sources of nitrogen oxides (NO x) and particulate matter (PM), strongly related to human morbidity and mortality. In this study, the pollutant level and distribution in a section of one of the main road arteries of Antwerp (Belgium, Europe) are analyzed. The assessment is performed through computational fluid dynamics (CFD), acknowledged as a powerful tool to predict and study dispersion phenomena in complex atmospheric environments. The two main traffic lanes are modeled as emitting sources and the surrounding area is explicitly depicted. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach specific for Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) simulations is employed. After a validation on a wind tunnel urban canyon test case, the dispersion within the canopy of two relevant urban pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm (PM10), is studied. An experimental field campaign led to the availability of wind velocity and direction data, as well as PM10 concentrations in some key locations within the urban canyon. To accurately predict the concentration field, a relevant dispersion parameter, the turbulent Schmidt number, Sct, is prescribed as a locally variable quantity. The pollutant distributions in the area of interest – exhibiting strong heterogeneity – are finally demonstrated, considering one of the most frequent and concerning wind directions. Possible local remedial measures are conceptualized, investigated and implemented and their outcomes are directly compared. A major goal is, by realistically reproducing the district of interest, to identify the locations inside this intricate urban canyon where the pollutants are stagnating and to analyze which solution acts as best mitigation measure.

Increased water scarcity, due to climate change, is a constraint to agricultural development, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. This increases pressure on agriculture which often manages water inefficiently and competes with other sectors for water use. Enhancing farmers’ production efficiency may lead to substantial water savings and conservation. Public sector is called to play a role in water governance and to introduce appropriate multilevel regulatory and incentive measures for better water management. This work applies a spatial stochastic frontier model to the case of high water-demanding fruit and vegetable crops in the Apulia region of Southern Italy, where water is scarce due to semi-arid climate and erratic rainfall. Using cross-sectional data from the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network, this work incorporates firm specific heterogeneity into technical efficiency analysis and implements an autoregressive specification of the inefficiency component. Results support the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity exists in on-farm efficiency of irrigated crop production and is adequately captured by the spatial stochastic frontier model approach. Technical efficiency of farms with similar structural and management characteristics greatly varies across crops and geographical areas, because of the different natural resource endowment and agro-climatic factors. Policies providing incentives to on-farm adoption of modern water-saving technologies and measures to promote small family farm activities could effectively contribute to water conservation goal, but they should be well-articulated to account for agriculture spatial diverseness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture sustainability; Farm technical efficiency; Spatial dependence; Spatial stochastic frontier model; Water policy; Water scarcity","alternative agriculture; conservation; environmental policy; irrigation; public goods; spatial analysis; stochasticity; sustainability; water supply; water use efficiency; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087174203

Laser treatments on the central part of dog-bone specimens, extracted from a strain hardenable Aluminium sheet (AA5754) in wrought condition (H32), were simulated through an inversely tuned Finite Element model (FE) and performed using a CO2 laser. In order to establish a correlation between the temperature history in each point and the corresponding material properties after the heat treatment, preliminary local annealing tests were conducted by means of the Gleeble 3180 system; such heat treated samples were then subjected to Vickers micro-hardness tests along the longitudinal direction in order to obtain data for defining a simple but effective annealing function based on the maximum temperature (Tpeak) experienced by the material. Tensile tests on the laser heat-treated specimens were assisted by a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system, which allowed to obtain the full-field deformation history and, as a consequence, to extract different flow stress curves, since each region of the sample was subjected to different temperature levels. The material behaviour in terms of stress vs. strain curves extracted by DIC could be related to the same variable (Tpeak) and finally implemented into a FE model. The proposed methodology revealed to be effective in extracting the flow stress curves (yielding plus hardening) and, as demonstrated by the simulation of the tensile test, it allowed to predict the deformation behaviour of the material with graded properties more accurately than the qualitative approach based on the assignment of different mechanical properties by partitions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital image correlation; Gleeble test; Inverse method; Local properties; Numerical simulation","Aluminum alloys; Carbon dioxide lasers; Deformation; Heat treatment; Microhardness; Plastic flow; Tensile testing; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Deformation behaviour; Heat-treated specimens; Longitudinal direction; Material characterizations; Qualitative approach; Temperature history; Vickers microhardness; Extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092522609

To survive in increasingly fluctuating and unpredictable environments, species can either migrate or evolve through rapid local adaptation, plasticity and/ or bet-hedging. For small ectotherm insects, like parasitoids and their hosts, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging could be critical strategies for population and species persistence in response to immediate, intense and unpredictable temperature changes. Here, we focus on studies evaluating phenotypic responses to variable predictable thermal conditions (for which phenotypic plasticity is favoured) and unpredictable thermal environments (for which bethedging is favoured), both within and between host and parasitoid generations. We then address the effects of fluctuating temperatures on host parasitoid interactions, potential cascading effects on the food web, as well as biological control services. We conclude our review by proposing a road map for designing experiments to assess if plasticity and bet-hedging can be adaptive strategies, and to disentangle how fluctuating temperatures can affect the evolution of these two strategies in parasitoids and their hosts. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

The land area cultivated with soybean in subtropical regions, such as Brazil, is continuously expanding, in some instances at the expense of carbon storing natural habitats. Strategies to decrease yield/seed losses and increase production efficiency are urgently required to meet global demand for soybean in a sustainable manner. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of an Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE), SealicitTM, in increasing yields of different soybean varieties, in two geographical regions (Canada and Brazil). In addition, we investigated the potential of SealicitTM to reduce pod shattering at the trials in Brazil. Three different concentrations of SealicitTM were applied to pod shatter-susceptible (SS) UFUS 6901 and shatter-resistant (SR) UFUS 7415 varieties to assess their impact on pod firmness. SS variety demonstrated a significant decrease in pod shattering, which coincided with deregulation of GmPDH1.1 and GmSHAT1–5 expression, genes that determine pod dehiscence, and higher seed weight per pod. SealicitTM application to the SR variety did not significantly alter its inherent pod shatter resistance, but provided higher increases in seed yield at harvest. This yield increase maybe associated with to other yield components stimulated by the biostimulant. This work demonstrates that SealicitTM, which has previously been shown to improve pod firmness in Arabidopsis and selected commercial oilseed rape varieties through IND gene down-regulation, also has the potential to improve pod resistance and seed productivity in soybean, a member of the legume family sharing a similar strategy for seed dispersal. © Copyright © 2021 Łangowski, Goñi, Marques, Hamawaki, da Silva, Nogueira, Teixeira, Glasenapp, Pereira and O’Connell.","Ascophyllum nodosum extract; plant biostimulants; pod shattering; seaweed; seed loss; soybean (Glycine max); sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102470879

As climate models do not currently simulate total sea level, these uncertainties must be quantified through summation of uncertainties in individual sea-level components. This summation depends on the correlation between the components, which has previously been prescribed or derived from each individual component's dependence on global mean surface temperature. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, regional correlations between sea-level components based on regional climate change projections. We compute regional sea-level projections consistent with climate projections from an ensemble of 14 Earth System Models. From the multi-model spread, we estimate the uncertainty in the regional climate's response to greenhouse forcing. To quantify the total uncertainty, we add the uncertainty in the response of sea-level components to this regional climate change. This approach reveals how regional climate processes impose correlations between sea-level components, affecting the total uncertainty. One example is an anti-correlation between North Atlantic sterodynamic change and Antarctic dynamic mass loss, suggesting a teleconnection established by the large-scale ocean circulation. We find that prescribed correlations, applied in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, lead to a global overestimation in the uncertainty in regional sea-level projections on the order of 20%. Regionally, this overestimation exceeds 100%. We conclude that accurate uncertainty estimates of regional sea-level change must be based on projections of regional climate change and cannot be derived from global indicators such as global mean surface temperature. © 2021.

Air over Taiwan may be affected by emissions from mainland China so the changes provided an opportunity to detect the effect of long-range pollutant transport to Taiwan, especially at remote sites. Small decreases were observed in NOx and PM2.5 concentrations, when comparing 2020 with earlier years, as well as some hints of increases in O3. Back trajectories from China were used to select days when this effect would be strongest and showed clearer evidence of reductions at remote sites in Taiwan. These were strongest for NOx and PM2.5 in Kinmen and Matsu, close to the Fujian coast, but the effects were seen even on Magong in the Penghu archipelago and at Cape Fugui at the very north of Taiwan. Larger reductions on the coastal islands is not surprising given their proximity to major cities, but on Magong and at Cape Fugui, PM2.5 concentrations are reduced by a few micrograms per cubic metre. Decreases in NOx are smaller and at Cape Fugui, barely amounting to a ppb. Changes in O3 are distinctive, showing concentration increases of around 20% under trajectories deriving from Northern China, in keeping with observations that reductions in NOx lead to substantial increases in O3. Overall, there was only a small reduction in NOx and PM in Taiwan. Although these changes in pollutant concentrations may be relatively large in remote areas, they are not likely to have a major effect on cumulative exposure in larger cities, where concentrations of these pollutants can be high. Nevertheless, the observations support calls for agreement over emission reductions to lessen pollutant transfer across the Taiwan Strait. © The Author(s).","Carbon monoxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particulate matter","Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Viruses; Back trajectories; Cumulative exposures; Emission reduction; Long range transport; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Pollutant transport; Small reduction; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; particulate matter; pollutant transport; virus; China; Fuguei Cape; Fujian; Hubei; Quemoy; Taiwan; Taiwan Strait",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100415346

We surveyed pipeline-associated microbiomes from geographically distinct oil field facilities and found methanogens to account for 0.2 to 9.3% of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing reads. Neither the type nor the abundance of the detected methanogens was correlated with the perceived severity of MIC in these pipelines. Using fluids from one pipeline, MIC was reproduced in the laboratory, both under stagnant conditions and in customized corrosion reactors simulating pipeline flow. High corrosion rates (up to 2.43 mm Fe0 • yr21) with macroscopic, localized corrosion features were attributed to lithotrophic, mesophilic microbial activity. Other laboratory tests with the same waters yielded negligible corrosion rates (&lt;0.08 mm Fe0 • yr21). Recently, a novel [NiFe] hydrogenase from Methanococcus maripaludis strain OS7 was demonstrated to accelerate corrosion. We developed a specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay and detected the gene encoding the large subunit of this hydrogenase (labeled micH) in corrosive (&gt;0.15 mm Fe0 • yr21) biofilms. The micH gene, on the other hand, was absent in noncorrosive biofilms, despite an abundance of methanogens. Reconstruction of a nearly complete Methanococcus maripaludis genome from a highly corrosive mixed biofilm revealed micH and associated genes in nearly identical genetic configuration to that in strain OS7, thereby supporting our hypothesis that the encoded molecular mechanism contributed to corrosion. Lastly, the proposed MIC biomarker was detected in multiple oil fields, indicating a geographically widespread involvement of this [NiFe] hydrogenase in MIC. IMPORTANCE Microorganisms can deteriorate built environments, which is particularly problematic in the case of pipelines transporting hydrocarbons to industrial end users. MIC is notoriously difficult to detect and monitor and, as a consequence, is a particularly difficult corrosion mechanism to manage. Despite the advent of molecular tools and improved microbial monitoring strategies for oil and gas operations, specific underlying MIC mechanisms in pipelines remain largely enigmatic. Emerging mechanistic understanding of methanogenic MIC derived from pure culture work allowed us to develop a qPCR assay that distinguishes technically problematic from benign methanogens in a West African oil field. Detection of the same gene in geographically diverse samples from North America hints at the widespread applicability of this assay.

We investigated the response of root-associated fungi to experimental drought (66% reduction in growing season precipitation) across six North American grassland ecosystem types to determine how extreme drought alters root-associated fungi, and understand what abiotic factors influence root fungal community composition across grassland ecosystems. Next generation sequencing of the fungal ITS2 region demonstrated that drought primarily re-ordered fungal species' relative abundances within host plant species, with different fungal responses depending on host identity. Grass species that declined more under drought trended toward less community re-ordering of root fungi than species less sensitive to drought. Host identity and grassland ecosystem type defined the magnitude of drought effects on community composition, diversity and root colonization, and the most important factor affecting fungal composition was plant species identity. Fungal diversity was less responsive to drought than fungal composition. Across ecosystems, latitude and soil pH were better predictors of fungal diversity than experimental drought. Drought significantly reduced fungal diversity and evenness only in sideoats grama Bouteloua curtipendula and reduced root colonization only in blue grama B. gracilis. Our results illustrate that predicting the effects of drought on root-associated fungi will require attention to host plant identity and ecosystem type. By comparing our findings against soil microbe responses in the same experiment, we propose the hypothesis that fungi in plant roots are less sensitive to drought than fungi inhabiting soils. Our study highlights the importance of studying community-level re-ordering of fungal composition for understanding plant responses to climate change. © 2020 British Ecological Society","climate change; dark septate endophytes; diversity; latitudinal gradient; microbiome; mycobiome; mycorrhiza","abiotic factor; assembly rule; community composition; community structure; drought; experimental study; fungus; grassland soil; growing season; host plant; root colonization; soil ecosystem; North America; Bouteloua curtipendula; Bouteloua gracilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096640001

This manuscript reports on an experimental study designed to test the fire resistance of one such concrete, prepared to contain natural zeolite-bearing tuff. The fire resistance of concretes containing natural zeolites has received little attention and is therefore poorly understood. Relative reductions in residual uniaxial compressive strength as a function of increasing temperature (up to 1000 °C) were very similar for the reference concrete (containing no tuff) and the tuff-bearing concrete. These data can be explained by the similar influence of high-temperature on the chemical (dehydroxylation reactions) and physical (microcracking and porosity) properties of both concretes. The satisfactory performance of the concrete containing natural zeolites following fire is welcome owing to the economic, climatic, and environmental benefits of using natural pozzolan and aggregate substitutes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Concrete; Fire; Tuff; Uniaxial compressive strength; Zeolite","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Environmental impact; High performance concrete; High temperature effects; Zeolites; Dehydroxylation reactions; Environmental benefits; High strength concretes; High temperature; Increasing temperatures; Natural pozzolan; Relative reduction; Uniaxial compressive strength; Fire resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097888387

One such substance is chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), a cheap, widely used refrigerant with a high global warming potential and a chemical target for phase-out under the Montreal protocol. Botswana like all signatory countries to the Montreal Protocol is required to develop and implement a country-level Hydrochlorofluorocarbon Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP). This study focused on evaluating the environmental and socioeconomic implications of phasing out HCFC-22 in Botswana. A census of nine HCFC-22-importing companies was conducted and probability sampling proportional to company size was used to select a sample of 159 respondents from the Department of Meteorological Services, Customs officers and HCFC-22 Industrial consumers. Annual HCFC-22 importation figures for Botswana in 2009–2017 from the National Ozone Unit were analysed. It emerged that HCFC-22 phase-out had reduced HCFC-22 consumption by approximately 510,400 kg in 2011–2017, translating to 28,072 ozone depleting potential (ODP) saved. Also, the HCFC-22 phase-out plan saved the country 128 kW h of electricity for 2009–2017. While decreasing demand for HCFC-22, the HPMP had correspondingly occasioned the higher replacement and servicing costs of HCFC-22-compliant equipment, as HCFC-22 substitutes cost more. To deter use of HCFC-22 and promote phase-out, the price of substitute refrigerants can be made less expensive than HCFC-22. Participating stakeholders attest that HCFC-22 phase-out has positive social benefits such as raising community awareness of the ozone depleting phase-out. As a recommendation, the government of Botswana could offer a number of incentives towards HCFC-22 substitutes uptake in order to give impetus to technology transfer. © 2021 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Botswana; Global warming; HCFC-22 phase-out; Hydrochlorofluorocarbon phase-out management plan; Montreal protocol; Ozone depleting substance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099534809

Data from insulation markets, economic parameters, fuel prices, and heating degree days (HDDs) were introduced into the model as input variables. To complete the most thorough analysis, three learning algorithms, Levenberg Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) were employed. Five statistical indexes were utilized to evaluate models' performances: determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), standard error of prediction (SEP), RMSE observations' standard deviation ratio (RSR), and average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE). Moreover, visualization techniques were used to assess the similarity between the OIT, ATS, and RCO2 values calculated and predicted. The results obtained clearly show that the LM model outperformed the BR and SCG models in all estimations. Thereafter, the developed ANNs model was validated for different cities.

Growing appreciation of the ecological and societal benefits of healthy seagrass meadows has stimulated efforts to protect and restore them, largely focused on reducing nutrient input to coastal waters. Here we analyze a unique data set spanning 135 years on eelgrass (Zostera marina), the dominant seagrass of the northern hemisphere. We show that meadows in the Western Baltic Sea exhibited major declines relative to historic (1890–1910) reference due to the wasting disease in the 1930s followed by eutrophication peaking in the 1980s, but have only shown modest improvement despite major eutrophication mitigation, halving nitrogen input since the 1980s. Across the past century, we identified generally shallower colonization depths of eelgrass for a given submarine light penetration and, hence, increased apparent light requirements. This suggests that eelgrass recovery is limited by additional stressors. Our study indicates that bottom trawling and intense recent warming (0.5°C per decade, 1985–2018), which impact on deeper and shallower meadows, respectively, suppress eelgrass from fully recovering from eutrophication. Warming is most severe in shallow turbid waters, while clear-water areas offer eelgrass refugia from warming in deeper, cooler waters; but trawling can prevent eelgrass from reaching these refugia. Efforts to reduce nutrient input and thereby improve water clarity have been instrumental in avoiding a catastrophic loss of eelgrass ecosystems. However, local-scale future management must, in addition, reduce bottom trawling to facilitate eelgrass reaching deeper, cooler refugia, and increase resilience toward realized and further warming. Warming needs to be limited by meeting global climate change mitigation goals. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","light requirement; long-term trends; management; multiple pressures; Zostera marina","climate change; ecosystem management; eutrophication; global climate; long-term change; meadow; seagrass; trawling; Zostera marina; nitrogen; climate change; ecosystem; eutrophication; Zosteraceae; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Nitrogen; Zosteraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096699264

Flue gas and municipal solid wastes are proposed for use as sustainable raw materials, thus minimizing waste, emissions, and fossil fuel consumption.

This technique provides several environmental benefits: •adapting existing processes operating with well-known technologies to use waste as raw materials •determining optimal and sustainable production rates and raw material consumption •including raw material circular integration between. The retrofitted applied technique was tested on existing methanol, formalin and urea formaldehyde resin processes, with replacement of natural gas with flue gas and municipal solid wastes as a raw material, generating an additional profit of 7.8 MEUR/a.

Sentinel-5 Precursor/ Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) monthly mean tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations show an average change of34%toC20%and39% to 5% with an average decrease of 15% and 11% for March and April 2020 respectively, compared with the previous year, over the six larger Greek metropolitan areas; this is mostly attributable to vehicular emission reductions. For the capital city of Athens, weekly analysis was statistically possible for the S5P/TROPOMI observations and revealed a marked decline in the NO2 load of between 8%and 43% for 7 of the 8 weeks studied; this is in agreement with the equivalent Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)/Aura observations as well as the ground-based estimates of a multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy ground-based instrument. Chemical transport modelling of the NO2 columns, provided by the Long Term Ozone Simulation European Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) chemical transport model, shows that the magnitude of these reductions cannot solely be attributed to the difference in meteorological factors affecting NO2 levels during March and April 2020 and the equivalent time periods of the previous year. Taking this factor into account, the resulting decline was estimated to range between 25% and 65% for 5 of the 8 weeks studied, with the remaining 3 weeks showing a positive average of 10 %; this positive average was postulated to be due to the uncertainty of the methodology, which is based on differences. As a result this analysis, we conclude that the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the restriction of transport emissions over Greece is 10 %. As transport is the second largest sector (after industry) affecting Greece s air quality, this occasion may well help policymakers to enforce more targeted measures to aid Greece in further reducing emissions according to international air quality standards. © Author(s) 2021.

Recent climate-driven shifts in distribution have significantly increased their mortality risk from human activities. After twelve NARWs died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2017 from fishing gear entanglement and ship strikes, Canada adopted measures designed to decrease overlap between these whales and relevant threats. Real-time monitoring of whale distribution combined with dynamic management of shipping corridors and fishing areas proved to be effective in reducing regional mortality to zero in 2018. Yet, this complex system was expensive to implement and caused tension with affected sectors. Following stakeholder consultations, Canada modified the system of static and dynamic measures for the 2019 season. These measures were less effective and eight observed right whale deaths triggered additional emergency responses. This paper reviews scientific and legal tools that were used to implement spatial management of NARW and marine activities between 2017 and 2019. It identifies key legislation that directs the government to protect NARW, such as the Species at Risk Act (SARA), as well as the regulatory tools under the Fisheries Act and Canada Shipping Act and discusses weaknesses in the implementation of these legal frameworks that contributed to compromised outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations designed to promote recovery and protect endangered species that may undergo similar changes in distributions and threats under ongoing climate and environmental change. The need to strengthen the role of Canada's Species at Risk Act in future conservation efforts is highlighted, specifically the need to address the effects of climate change in recovery planning and the importance of expanding critical habitat protections. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Climate change; North Atlantic right whale; Oceans; Species at risk","Animals; Conservation; Fisheries; Fishing (oil wells); Laws and legislation; Oceanography; Ships; Canada; Emergency response; Environmental change; Oceans; Real time monitoring; Right whales; Species at risks; Stakeholder consultation; Climate change; climate change; conservation status; disaster management; fishery management; fishing mortality; habitat management; Law of the Sea; mortality risk; policy approach; stakeholder; whale; Canada; Balaenidae; Cetacea; Eubalaena glacialis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082849082

The biopotential of the republic allows cultivating drought-resistant oilseeds, including sunflower. After the commissioning of an oil plant in Black Sea region, with a capacity of up to 35 thousand tons of products per year, the production of the corresponding volume of oil seeds becomes especially relevant. To achieve the required amount of oilseed raw materials and stable provision of the population of the republic with sunflower oil, a mechanism of organizational and economic interaction of producers of raw materials and its processors, the introduction of adaptive hybrids and varieties of sunflower, as well as the development of adaptive technology for their cultivation are necessary. The research held in 2017-2019 at the Research Institute of Agriculture will help to solve the problems posed by introducing scientifically based technology for the cultivation of sunflower domestic selection on the peninsula. It has been established that the maximum harvest of sunflower oil (more than 0.5 t/ha) when cultivating the early ripe Avangard hybrid will be obtained by sowing in the first ten days of April with a plant density of 40K pcs/ha. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Drought; Oil field development; Oil field equipment; Oilseeds; Adaptive technology; Biopotentials; Black Sea regions; Economic interactions; Environmental resources; Oil plants; Plant densities; Research institutes; Sunflower oil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101714409

Landowners try to grow the most commercially profitable varieties and crops, which leads to the emergence of monocultures, and as a result to the use of high doses of fertilizers, intensive tillage, and frequent use of pesticides and growth regulators. This land-use regime inevitably leads to a decrease in humus in the soil, to an increase in erosion processes, and to a decrease in agricultural returns. Application according to V. R. 's developments Williams, perennial grasses improves the structure of the soil, increases and preserves its fertility. When using feed based on legumes and grasses, as the most natural for most animals, their life expectancy increases, the quality of final products improves in terms of consumer indicators, and in terms of environmental safety. For the successful use of perennial grasses, it is necessary to select the species and varietal composition of these grasses depending on the region and soil and climatic conditions. In many cases, the necessary varieties of the necessary species do not yet exist and they need to be derived based on the use of methods of ecological selection and the creation of an effective system of scientific support aimed at obtaining the final product. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Land use; Profitability; Soils; Agricultural productions; Climatic conditions; Effective systems; Environmental safety; Growth regulators; Life expectancies; Maximum profits; Perennial grass; Agriculture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101666297

Today, we face the problem of further scaling up renewable energy infrastructure, which requires the creation of reliable energy storages, environmentally friendly carriers, like hydrogen, and competitive international markets. These issues provoke the involvement of resource-based countries in the energy transition, which is questionable in terms of economic efficiency, compared to conventional hydrocarbon resources. To shed a light on the possible efficiency of green hydrogen production in such countries, this study is aimed at: (1) comparing key Russian trends of green hydrogen development with global trends, (2) presenting strategic scenarios for the Russian energy sector development, (3) presenting a case study of Russian hydrogen energy project «Dyakov Ust-Srednekanskaya HPP» in Magadan region. We argue that without significant changes in strategic planning and without focus on sustainable solutions support, the further development of Russian power industry will be halted in a conservative scenario with the limited presence of innovative solutions in renewable energy industries. Our case study showed that despite the closeness to Japan hydrogen market, economic efficiency is on the edge of zero, with payback period around 17 years. The decrease in project capacity below 543.6 MW will immediately lead to a negative NPV. The key reason for that is the low average market price of hydrogen ($14/kg), which is only a bit higher than its production cost ($12.5/kg), while transportation requires about $0.96/kg more. Despite the discouraging results, it should be taken into account that such strategic projects are at the edge of energy development. We see them as an opportunity to lead transnational energy trade of green hydrogen, which could be competitive in the medium term, especially with state support. © 2021 by the authors.","Carbon neutrality; Carbon-free energy; Electrolyze; Energy scenarios; Hydrogen; Hydropower; Power accumulator; Renewable energy; Sustainable energy; Zero carbon emission","Climate change; Costs; Energy policy; Energy storage; International trade; Investments; Petroleum prospecting; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Conventional hydrocarbons; Economic efficiency; Innovative solutions; International markets; Renewable energies; Renewable Energy industries; Sustainable solution; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102831766

Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for. The recognition of the value created by these activities is essential for designing effective policy support measures, and for market development of the sector and its potential to facilitate the wider adoption of NBS. © 2021 by the authors.

However, knowledge about the annual and seasonal variations of green roof carbon uptake due to changes in meteorological conditions and water availability remains scarce. We studied the annual variation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by eddy-covariance flux measurements during a 5-year period from 2014 to 2019 on a large and unirrigated green roof at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport (BER) in Berlin, Germany. The roof vegetation was dominated by Sedum species and herbs. The BER green roof showed net uptake of carbon in each of the 5 study years with an average uptake of −141.1 g C m−2 y−1 and an average measurement uncertainty of ±15.5 g C m−2 y−1. The NEE, however, was characterized by significant interannual variation in which the maximum annual uptake of −189 g C m−2 y−1 in a year with above average precipitation roughly doubles the minimum uptake of −95 g C m−2 y−1 in a dry year. The variation of NEE was a function of the annual amount of precipitation and the frequency of rainfall, that is, the number of dry days per year (DDY). The roof might lose its carbon uptake function in a warmer future climate with an increasing number of DDY. Sustainable irrigation of the roof (e.g., rainwater harvesting) could help to maintain the carbon uptake function of the green roof vegetation. © 2020.

This is especially so for projections of future precipitation in most tropical regions, at the spatial scale of many adaptation decisions in water-related sectors. Attempts have been made to constrain the uncertainty in climate projections, based on the recognised premise that not all of the climate models openly available perform equally well. However, there is no agreed ‘good practice’ on how to weight climate models. Nor is it clear to what extent model weighting can constrain uncertainty in decision-relevant climate quantities. We address this challenge, for climate projection information relevant to ‘high stakes’ investment decisions across the ‘water-energy-food’ sectors, using two case-study river basins in Tanzania and Malawi. We compare future climate risk profiles of simple decision-relevant indicators for water-related sectors, derived using hydrological and water resources models, which are driven by an ensemble of future climate model projections. In generating these ensembles, we implement a range of climate model weighting approaches, based on context-relevant climate model performance metrics and assessment. Our case-specific results show the various model weighting approaches have limited systematic effect on the spread of risk profiles. Sensitivity to climate model weighting is lower than overall uncertainty and is considerably less than the uncertainty resulting from bias correction methodologies. However, some of the more subtle effects on sectoral risk profiles from the more ‘aggressive’ model weighting approaches could be important to investment decisions depending on the decision context. For application, model weighting is justified in principle, but a credible approach should be very carefully designed and rooted in robust understanding of relevant physical processes to formulate appropriate metrics. © 2021, Crown.","Climate modelling, model weighting; Impact modelling and water-food-energy nexus","Climate change; Investments; Water resources; Adaptation decisions; Appropriate metrics; Climate change adaptation; Climate projection; Investment decisions; Model performance; Systematic effects; Weighting approaches; Climate models; adaptive management; assessment method; climate effect; climate modeling; climate prediction; decision making; future prospect; precipitation (climatology); river basin; tropical region; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100969312

The present paper is a comment on E. Gibney’s article ‘Whose coronavirus strategy worked best?’ (Nature 2020;581:15–6). The strategy for phase 2 should be more complex and interdisciplinary than described in the paper in Nature, especially in the period before a vaccine and specific treatments are available. The focus on reducing the mortality of COVID-19 will have side effects, including excess mortality from other causes. A part of this excess mortality will be based on the reduction of health-care offers as a consequence of the pandemic, and on structural limitations of the health-care system. A special challenge is to understand the relationship between death from and death with COVID-19, and therefore the relevance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in people with pre-existing burdens, for example coronary heart disease, cancer or older age. There is a need to extend the recently used tools to all available instruments, including physiological principles of prevention and promotion. The way to integrate global solidarity into the strategies of the different countries is critical not only for global health but also for the peace and long-term success for each individual country.

As the world is increasingly urbanized, it is crucial to identify cost-effective pathways to decarbonize and enhance the resilience of cities, which ensure the well-being of their dwellers. Here, we propose a 'SolarEV City' concept, in which integrated systems of cities' roof-top photovoltaics and electric vehicles (EVs) supply affordable and dispatchable CO2-free electricity to urban dwellers. Our analyses indicate that implementations of the concept can meet 53%-95% of electricity demands in nine major Japanese urban areas by 2030. CO2 emission from vehicle use and electricity generation in these areas can be reduced by 54%-95% with potential cost savings of 26%-41%. High cost-effectiveness and seasonally stable insolation in low latitudes may imply that the concept may be more effective to decarbonize urban environments in emerging economies in low latitudes.

Climate adaptation management strategies are proposed to serve as buffers to changes in air temperature and precipitation, with these strategies potentially providing relatively stable protection for flow and thermal regimes. Using a hydrologic and water temperature modeling approach in the Meramec River basin in eastern Missouri, U.S.A., we examined the ability of forested riparian buffers to serve as a useful climate adaptation strategy against ongoing and projected changes in climate. We developed a multi-scale approach using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic and water temperature models as well as a Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTEMP) with different amounts of simulated riparian vegetation to estimate streamflow and water temperature variation within the Meramec River basin under both contemporary and projected future climate conditions. Our results suggest that riparian buffers offer benefits to mitigating increases in water temperature due to shading effects; however, patterns in discharge did not vary substantially based on simulations. From an ecological perspective, the addition of riparian buffers is also projected to reduce the impacts of climate change on Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) by decreasing the number of days water temperatures exceed the thermal tolerance of this species. © 2021 by the authors.

Feedbacks regulate the size of the surface carbon reservoir, and on million-year timescales the carbon cycle must be in steady state. A major question about the early Earth is whether carbon was cycled through the surface reservoir more quickly or slowly than it is today. The answer to this question holds important implications for Earth's climate state, the size of the biosphere through time, and the expression of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth-like planets. Here, we examine total carbon inputs and outputs from the Earth's surface over time. We find stark disagreement between the canonical histories of carbon outgassing and carbon burial, with the former implying high rates of throughput on the early Earth and the latter suggesting sluggish carbon cycling. We consider solutions to this apparent paradox and conclude that the most likely resolution is that high organic burial efficiency in the Precambrian enabled substantial carbon burial despite limited biological productivity. We then consider this model in terms of Archean redox balance and find that in order to maintain atmospheric anoxia prior to the Great Oxidation Event, high burial efficiency likely needed to be accompanied by greater outgassing of reductants. Similar mechanisms likely govern carbon burial and redox balance on terrestrial exoplanets, suggesting that outgassing rates and the redox state of volcanic gases likely play a critical role in setting the tempo of planetary oxygenation. © 2020.

The period mean impact of the SMA diesel vehicle emissions on the PM2.5 concentration was 0.8 μg/m3 over the SMA during the simulation period, which was led by organic carbon (OC, 0.4 μg/m3) and primary PM2.5 (0.4 μg/m3) rather than nitrate (0.0 μg/m3) formed from NOX. When the impact of NOX emissions from the diesel vehicle to the monthly mean nitrate was evaluated, the negative impact, so-called ‘NOX-disbenefit’, in which NOX reductions increased nitrate formation appeared in December 2019 (-0.5 μg/m3) and January 2020 (-0.1 μg/m3). An alternative air quality simulation with an additional 50% reduction of NOX emissions from all the emission sources except the on-road mobile greatly reduced the NOX-disbenefit effect. As a result, the NOX-reduced condition increased the overall impact of the SMA diesel vehicle emissions on PM2.5 and nitrate over the region by up to 1.3 μg/m3 and 0.5 μg/m3, respectively. It implies that even the same emission control may exhibit different effectiveness in the PM2.5 change depending on the NOX conditions. Thus, it is necessary to better understand how the non-linearity of the secondary PM2.5 formation plays a role in determining the overall impact of emission abatement plans to improve air quality over a region. © 2021.

Despite the governmental and institutional efforts, odor-related complaints from the neighborhood communities around the swine farms are rapidly increasing and have been identified as a key concern to sustaining progress of the swine industry globally. Bio-liquor circulation systems (BCSs) in swine farms have become popular among the farmers as an odor reduction technology in Korea. However, due to the lack of appropriate operating strategies, the odor reduction capacity of BCSs is often depleted. In this lab-scale study, a real-time control strategy based on oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH (mV) time profiles was developed and applied for BCS operation. This study shows the potential effectiveness of using ORP and pH (mV) time profiles as operational parameters for the BCS to improve swine manure properties in slurry pits and thus reduce odor emission. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a real-time control strategy using oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH (mV) time profiles for the efficient operation of bioliquor circulation system (BCS) in swine farms and its effectiveness in reducing odor emission through improving manure properties in the slurry pit was evaluated. The lab-scale BCS used in this study comprised a bioreactor and a slurry pit. The bioreactor was operated in a sequence of inflow of swine manure → anoxic phase → aerobic phase → circulation to the slurry pit. The improvement in swine manure properties was elucidated by comparing the results of the BCS slurry pit (circulation type, CT) and conventional slurry pit (non-circulation type, NCT). The results revealed that the ORP time profile successfully detected the nitrate knee point (NKP) in the anoxic phase. However, it was less stable in detecting the nitrogen break point (NBP) in the aerobic phase. The pH (mV) time profile showed a more efficient detection of NBP. Compared to the NCT slurry pit, concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and soluble total organic carbon (STOC) and other analyzed swine manure properties were much lower in the CT slurry pit. In the aspect of odor reduction, around 98.3% of NH3 was removed in the CT slurry pit. The real-time controlled BCS can overcome the drawbacks of fixed time-based BCS operation and therefore can be considered as a useful tool to reduce odor emission from intensive swine farming operations. However, further studies and refinement in control algorithms might be required prior to its large-scale application. © 2021 by the author.","Bio-liquor circulation; NH3; Odor; Oxidation-reduction potential; pH; Real-time control; Swine manure","ammonia; biogas; fertilizer; methane; nitrate; nitrogen; organic carbon; agricultural land; algorithm; anaerobic digestion; animal experiment; Article; Bio liquor circulation system; biodegradability; chemical oxygen demand; control strategy; controlled study; cyanobacterium; denitrification; lung ventilation; methanogenesis; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; odor; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; phytoplankton; pig; pig farming; reactor operation; robot-assisted prostatectomy; signal processing; simulation; solid waste management; suspended particulate matter; swine manure; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099934636

However, the current EIA on GHG emissions can support wrong decision-making because the evaluation does not consider Scope 3 GHG emissions. Accordingly, this study proposed the life cycle EIA (LCEIA) method to identify changes in GHG emissions that need to be managed by considering Scope 3 GHG emissions in construction projects. The LCEIA method incorporates life cycle CO2 (LCCO2 ) including Scope 1, Scope, and Scope 3 GHG emissions using the concept of life cycle assessment (LCA) into the scoping step of the EIA process. The case study was conducted using existing EIA on GHG emission and LCEIA methodology for a development project in Gwangyang City. Scenario 1 is defined as an approach that calculates GHG emissions using the existing EIA method, and scenario 2 is also defined as a process using the LCEIA method. Results reveal that Scenario 2, including Scope 3 GHG emissions, had 46.4−51.2% more GHG emissions than Scenario 1. Sensitivity analysis for electricity and liquefied natural gas (LNG) density was also performed. Although the change in the carbon emission factor of electricity had a slightly sensitive effect on the research results, the LNG density was found to be less sensitive. This study believes the importance of switching to an EIA reflecting life cycle carbon dioxide (LCCO2 ) to calculate the exact amount of GHG emissions for construction work. © 2021 by the authors.

We developed a wet deposition model for the microscale model by improving on the global modeling initiative scheme. We evaluated the model by comparing it to the observed washout ratio from the total wet deposition. The simulated washout ratio calculated using the wet scavenging coefficient (WSC) based on the theoretical calculation is six times lower than that observed, suggesting that the wet deposition amount of SIAs from below-cloud scavenging might be underestimated. When we applied the WSC based on field measurements, the washout ratio was much improved; however, it was slightly overestimated compared to the observed rate. Therefore, we estimated the optimal WSC for SIAs in the urban area using a linear regression approach. We conducted a model using the wet deposition of SIAs in a megacity to understand the effects of wet deposition on the SIA concentration using estimated optimal WSCs. The simulated results indicate that washout processes decrease the surface aerosol concentration, showing that reductions in the average surface concentrations from washout processes were from 7.1% to 11.2%. The simulation results suggest that washout processes can reduce the particulate matter concentration in urban areas, indicating that washout processes should be considered in the microscale model, although the modeling domain can only simulate washout processes. © 2021 by the authors.

Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Climate change; Endogenous switching model; Farmer livelihood; Vietnamese Mekong river delta",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090935775

Risk estimates associated with these extreme event scenarios are expected to be significantly higher than estimates derived from a standard evaluation of individual hazards. In this study, we present case studies of compound flood hazards affecting critical infrastructure (CI) in coastal Connecticut (USA). We based the analysis on actual and synthetic (considering future climate conditions for atmospheric forcing, sea-level rise, and forecasted hurricane tracks) hurricane events, represented by heavy precipitation and surge combined with tides and SLR conditions. We used the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, to simulate the combined coastal and riverine flooding of selected CI sites. We forced a distributed hydrological model (CREST-SVAS) with weather analysis data from theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the synthetic events and from the National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) for the actual events, to derive the upstream boundary condition (flood wave) of HEC-RAS.We extracted coastal tide and surge time series for each event from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to use as the downstream boundary condition of HEC-RAS. The significant outcome of this study represents the evaluation of changes in flood risk for the CI sites for the various compound scenarios (under current and future climate conditions). This approach offers an estimate of the potential impact of compound hazards relative to the 100-year flood maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is vital to developing mitigation strategies. In a broader sense, this study provides a framework for assessing the risk factors of our modern infrastructure located in vulnerable coastal areas throughout the world. © Author(s) 2021.",,"climate change; coastal zone; flood damage; flooding; future prospect; human activity; infrastructure; risk assessment; risk factor; Connecticut; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101180074

Novel catalyst chemistries and morphologies may provide high selectivity to both one-carbon (C1) and two-carbon (C2) products over hydrogen; however, the limited aqueous solubility of CO2 restricts the CO2RR current density. Here, we demonstrate how gasphilic bubble-trap surfaces enhance mass transfer and enrich and maintain CO2 concentration during CO2RR by forming a catalyst-proximal plastron layer, consequently increasing the CO2RR activity on both smooth and nanostructured copper as compared to the conventional headspace or bubbling modes of CO2 delivery. The H2 Faradaic efficiency is suppressed from 33% to 13% on smooth copper and from 62% to 33% on nanostructured copper, accompanied by enhanced formation of C2+ products, including ethylene, propanol, and ethanol, and &gt;1% acetone and acetate. We highlight the importance of the catalyst-proximal plastron approach by comparing against recent aqueous-phase CO2RR studies. Khan et al. report how bubble-capturing surfaces can enhance electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by local supersaturation of CO2 in the electrolyte near the catalyst, overcoming mass transport limitations. Thereby, hydrogen co-evolution is suppressed and formation of attractive C2+ products, such as ethanol and ethylene, is increased. © 2020 The Author(s)","bubble capture; CO2 electroreduction; copper; electrocatalysts; gasphilic surfaces; hydrophobicity; plastron; solar fuels",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100626876

The provenance and accumulation age of these strongly altered terrestrial karst-filling sediments are constrained by X-ray powder diffraction, heavy mineral analysis and zircon U-Pb dating. The heavy minerals of the Southern Bakony Mountains samples are dominated by the ultra-stable zircon-rutile-tourmaline association. Zircon U-Pb data indicate accumulation between 20 and 16 Ma. Furthermore, Archaean to Palaeogene grains were also determined, reflecting the principally fluvial recycling of Eocene bauxites and their cover sequences. In contrast, the sample from the Keszthely Hills consists almost exclusively of airborne material including zircons of 18-14 Ma, reflecting a dominant contribution from the Carpathian-Pannonian Neogene volcanism. The shift in the Miocene age components is inferred to have been caused by the landscape evolution and burial history of the planation surface remnants controlled by local block tectonics. © 2020 The Author(s).

The most common method in North America is to bury waste in landfills. Landfill operators comply with regulations to control hazardous emissions known as landfill gas (LFG). The gas is extracted via horizontal or vertical wells and removed from the site. This study examines arrays of horizontal wells placed side by side or stacked, and resultant landfill gas flux between adjacent cells. A landfill's lifetime often sees changes in the number, relative location and efficacy of wells. The ability to predict the response of an array of wells to variation in a single well's functionality is an essential aspect of landfill design and operation. The integrated normal flux between cells is identified as a salient quantity required to construct such prediction models. Numerical solution of flow equations reveals a stunningly simple dependence of the flux on the relative suction strength of proximate cells in a wide range of operational conditions. The flux is one of scarcely few parameters accessible in the field with relative ease and certainty, and thus traceable over time. This property makes the proposed models easy to construct, implement and adjust in practice in custom configurations. © 2021 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

Meanwhile, soft computing techniques might be suitable tools to be used with such data management scenarios. The present paper aimed at evaluating the generalizability of the gene expression programming (GEP) technique for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) through cross-station assessment and exogenous data supply, using data from Turkey and Iran. The GEP-based models were established and learnt using data from 10 stations in Turkey, and then the developed models were tested (validated) in 18 stations of Iran with considerable latitude differences. Different time periods (beginning and the end of time series) were selected for the training and testing stations so that there was no overlap among the dates of the events in both the groups. A comparison was also performed between the GEP models and the corresponding commonly used empirical equations. The obtained results revealed that the generalized GEP models presented promising outcomes in simulating daily ET0 values when they were trained and tested in quite distant stations with different chronological periods of the applied parameters.

Cationic substitution in CZTS layer is one of the leading approaches to capture the great potential of kesterite solar cells for future cost-effective photovoltaic technology. Here, chromium incorporation in CZTS is studied for cationic substitution in CZTS layer, as it renders multiple chemical states including +1, +2 and + 4 of Cu, Zn and Sn cations in CZTS. The CZTS films determine to have good crystallinity and morphology with no significant disparity among pristine and Cr-doped CZTS films, apart from slight shift of XRD (112) peak indicating partial cation substitution by smaller Cr atoms. However, the Zn content is found to be decreased with increasing Cr content in CZTS layer. Substantial enhancement in the absorption of Cr-doped CZTS films indicate intermediate band (IB) within the band gap. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra strongly suggests reduced non-radiative recombination and potential fluctuations in Cr-CZTS films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations reveal Zn substitution by Cr in CZTS crystal geometry. Using nanoscale Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and Conducting Atomic Force Microscopy (CAFM), we verify the surface potential variation and nanoscale electrical conductivity in pristine and Cr-CZTS films. Additionally, Zn substitution by Cr eventually lead to suppression of ZnSn deep level defects segregated at grain boundaries (GBs). CAFM strongly confirms the GB passivation in Cr-CZTS films. This work widens the opportunity of exploring potential cationic substitution in CZTS for developing high efficiency CZTS solar cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cation substitution; Deep level defect; Surface potential; VOC deficit; ZnSn antisite","Atomic force microscopy; Binary alloys; Chromium; Chromium metallography; Cost effectiveness; Crystallinity; Emission spectroscopy; Energy gap; Grain boundaries; Morphology; Nanotechnology; Open circuit voltage; Passivation; Point defects; Positive ions; Solar cells; Surface potential; Tin alloys; Tin metallography; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc; Conducting atomic force microscopy; Electrical conductivity; Kelvin probe force microscopy; Large open circuit voltages; Non-radiative recombinations; Photoluminescence emission; Photovoltaic technology; Potential fluctuations; Zinc metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091769455

Particularly, aerobic methanotrophs showed significantly stimulated growth and activity in the presence of accompanying microorganisms in an interaction network (interactome). Yet, little is known of how the interactome responds to disturbances, and how community functioning is affected by the disturbance-induced structuring of the interaction network. Here, we employed a time-series stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using 13C–CH4 coupled to a co-occurrence network analysis after Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene to directly relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the network structure of the interactome after desiccation-rewetting of a paddy soil. Methane uptake rate decreased immediately (&lt;5 days) after short-term desiccation-rewetting. Although the methanotroph subgroups differentially responded to desiccation-rewetting, the metabolically active bacterial community composition, including the methanotrophs, recovered after the disturbance. However, the interaction network was profoundly altered, becoming more complex but, less modular after desiccation-rewetting, despite the recovery in the methanotrophic activity and community composition/abundances. This suggests that the legacy of the disturbance persists in the interaction network. The change in the network structure may have consequences for community functioning with recurring desiccation-rewetting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Community ecology; Methane-based foodweb; Methanotrophs; pmoA; Stable-isotope probing","Computer system recovery; Driers (materials); Methane; Microorganisms; Recovery; RNA; Time series analysis; 16S rRNA gene; Bacterial community composition; Co-occurrence networks; Community composition; Interaction networks; Methanotrophs; Network structures; Stable-isotope probing; Complex networks; bacterium; community structure; complexity; desiccation; ecosystem function; growth rate; methane; methanotrophy; microbial community; rewetting; stable isotope; time series analysis; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097652808

Manuscripts can be dated and localized paleographically, but this method has its limitations. The Fragmenta membranea manuscript collection at the National Library of Finland has proved difficult to date using paleographic methods. Radiocarbon dating has been applied to manuscripts of parchment before, but a systematic protocol for radiocarbon dating of parchment has not been established with a minimally destructive sampling strategy. In this work, we have established a radiocarbon dating procedure for parchments combining a clean-room based chemical pretreatment process, elemental analyzer combustion, automatic graphitization and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements to reduce the AMS target size from a typical 1 mg of carbon. Prolonged acid treatment resulted in improved dating accuracy, since this is consistent with the manufacturing process of medieval parchment involving a lime bath. Two different combustion processes were compared. The traditional closed tube combustion (CTC) method provided a well-established though labor-intensive way to produce 1 mg AMS targets. The Elemental Analyzer-based process (EA-HASE, Elemental Analyzer Helsinki Adaptive Sample prEparation line), is designed for fast combustion and smaller sample sizes. The EA-HASE process was capable of reproducing the simulated radiocarbon ages of known-Age samples with AMS graphite target sizes of 0.3 mg of carbon, corresponding to a 3 mm2 area of a typical medieval parchment. The full potential of the process to go down to as little as 50 μg will be further explored in the future in parallel to studies of sample-specific contamination issues. © The Author(s), 2020.

In an attempt to limit the expansion of the pandemic in its initial phase, nearly all countries imposed restriction measures, which resulted in an unprecedented reduction of air pollution. This study aims to assess the impact of the lockdown effects due to COVID-19 on in situ measured aerosol properties, namely spectral-scattering (bsca) and absorption (babs) coefficients, black carbon (BC) concentrations, single-scattering albedo (SSA), scattering and absorption Ångström exponents (SAE, AAE) in Athens, Greece. Moreover, a comparison is performed with the regional background site of Finokalia, Crete, for a better assessment of the urban impact on observed differences. The study examines pre-lockdown (1-22 March 2020), lockdown (23 March-3 May 2020) and post-lockdown (4-31 May 2020) periods, while the aerosol properties are also compared with a 3-4 year preceding period (2016/2017-2019). Comparison of meteorological parameters in Athens, between the lockdown period and respective days in previous years, showed only marginal variation, which is not deemed sufficient in order to justify the notable changes in aerosol concentrations and optical properties. The largest reduction during the lockdown period was observed for babs compared to the pre-lockdown (-39%) and to the same period in previous years (-36%). This was intensified during the morning traffic hours (-60%), reflecting the large decrease in vehicular emissions. Furthermore, AAE increased during the lockdown period due to reduced emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, while a smaller (-21%) decrease was observed for bsca along with slight increases (6%) in SAE and SSA values, indicating that scattering aerosol properties were less affected by the decrease in vehicular emissions, as they are more dependent on regional sources and atmospheric processing. Nighttime BC emissions related to residential wood-burning were slightly increased during the lockdown period, with respect to previous-year means. On the contrary, aerosol and pollution changes during the lockdown period at Finokalia were low and highly sensitive to natural sources and processes. © 2021 by the authors.

The performance of dusty solar PV array is compared with that of the clean array of the same PV system. The clean solar array is equipped with an automatic-sprayer cleaning system that is powered by the PV system. The automatic cleaning system utilized in the test system reduces human effort by cleaning the PV array using closed-cycle water with low energy consumption (less than 10 Wh). The PV array under test is part of a 15 kW grid-tied PV system. The experimental results show significant improvement in the performance parameters of efficiency, performance ratio, and the energy gain compared to the clean array.

The smart practise was applied in intensively rice cultivation both in irrigated and rainfed rice field in Pati District, Central Java Province, Indonesia. The objective of the study was to identify plant performing and rice productivity both in irrigated and rainfed rice field. Five components of Panca Kelola Ramli consisted of high yielding rice varieties, Urea coated by biochar (UBICHAR), biochar-compost, integrated pest and disease management and also water management. In the rainfed rice field, the Panca kelola ramli was applied and modified to four treatments consisted of biochar - compost + UBICHAR, compost + UBICHAR, biochar - compost + Urea and compost + Urea. The observation was carried on methane emission, plant growth and rice yield. The study showed that methane emission, number of tillering, plant height and rice yield in irrigated rice fields were 172.13 kg ha-1, 14 tillers, 94.75 cm and 6.0 t ha-1, respectively. While in the rainfed rice field, the plant parameters vary among the treatments. The highest rice grain was produced by the treatment of compost + UBICHAR which was supported by the highest root weight.

This paper analyses the power supply situation in this region for year 2018 to evaluate the impact of renewable energy policies on energy costs and the resulting cost of avoided carbon. An optimisation model is built using GAMS. Model results show that the cost of absorbing renewable energy due to the “must run” policy for solar and wind energy plants ranges from $1.9/tCO2 to $4.5/tCO2 across states in the region, over and above the carbon tax of $5/tCO2 levied on all electricity consumers in India through the coal cess. ‘Must run’ status implies that the evacuation of power from solar and wind power plants should not be curtailed for factors other than grid or equipment safety. The total additional cost due this policy ranges from $200 to $350 million/year. Inter-regional transfer of renewable energy after meeting the mandated renewable purchase obligations in the region, is suggested as one possible route to reduce the financial burden on distribution utilities.

During the emission sensitivity simulations, the Clean Air Policy Support System 2016 emission inventory was processed at a horizontal grid resolution of 9 km. Among 13 source sectors, agriculture showed a high impact (5.0 μg/x3) on the nation-wide PMx2.5concentration, but NHx4x+converted from the agricultural NHx3emissions explained only 25% of the total impact. It means that about 75% of agricultural impact is mainly attributed to SOx42x-and NOx3x-converted from their precursors released from other source sectors. Except agriculture, on-road mobile showed the highest nation-wide PMx2.5impact of 1.4 μg/x3(8.0%) followed by industrial combustion (1.3 μg/x3; 7.6%), and non-road mobile (0.9 μg/x3; 5.3%). However, industrial combustion was the highest contributor in Chungnam (impact 3.0 μg/x3) while non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and manufacturing process was the predominant contributor for Busan (2.0 μg/x3), Daegu (2.1 μg/x3), and Ulsan (2.3 μg/x3), respectively. When the total impacts of precursor emissions on the nation-wide PMx2.5were compared, NOx (2.4 μg/x3) showed the highest impacts on the PMx2.5followed by Primary PMx2.5(PPMx2.5; 1.9 μg/x3), NH3 (1.5 μg/x3), and SOx2(0.6 μg/x3). However, PPMx2.5became the dominant precursor that showed the highest impact (4.6 μg/x3) to the PMx2.5in Seoul. The national emission-to-concentration conversion rate of PPMx2.5was approximately 5 and 10 times higher than that of NOxx(to NOx3x-) and SOx2(to SOx42x+), respectively. However, the emission sectoral impacts and the emission-to-concentration conversion rates changed a few times among provinces. Overall, when developing provincial air quality improvement plans, it is strongly recommended to figure out their own key source sectors and the target precursors to regulate. © 2021.

In Korea, the management of NH3 is insufficient, and the emission factor used by EPA is the same as the one used when calculating emissions. In particular, waste incineration facilities do not currently calculate NH3 emissions. In the case of combustion facilities, the main ammonia emission source is the De-NOx facility, and, in the case of a power plant with a De-NOx facility, NH3 emission is calculated. Therefore, in the case of a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incinerator with the same facility installed, it is necessary to calculate NH3 emissions. In this study, the necessity of developing NH3 emission factors for an MSW incinerator and calculating emission was analyzed. In addition, elements to be considered when developing emission factors were analyzed. The study found that the NH3 emission factors for each MSW incinerator technology were calculated as Stoker 0.010 NH3kg/ton and Fluidized Beds 0.004 NH3 kg/ton, which was greater than the NH3 emission factor 0.003 NH3kg/ton for the MSW incinerator presented in EMEP/EEA (2016). As a result, it was able to identify the need for the development of NH3 emission factors in MSW incinerators in Korea. In addition, the statistical analysis of the difference between the incineration technology of MSW and the NH3 emission factor by the De-NOx facility showed a difference in terms of both incineration technology and De-NOx facilities, indicating that they should be considered together when developing the emission factor. In addition to MSW, it is believed that it will be necessary to review the development of emission factors for waste at workplaces and incineration facilities of sewage sludge. © 2021 by the authors.

This study predicts extreme weather and air pollution changes that occur in urban street canyons as the basic data necessary for research on energy conservation. Changes in PM and microclimate elements based on the change in floor area ratio are analyzed. In addition, the effects of microclimate elements on the distribution of PM factors are examined. Based on the change in floor area ratio, high-concentration PM was negatively correlated with PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, NOx, Ta, Tmrt, and Tsurface . Extreme heat was observed to be negatively correlated with Tmrt and Tsurface, and extreme cold negatively correlated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx . The higher the floor area ratio, the higher the wind speed (WS), indicating a positive correlation between the two factors. Ta, Tmrt, and Tsurface were observed to be negatively correlated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx . WS showed negative correlations with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx . The results of this study can be used as basic data for the derivation of evaluation indices and to determine prediction and response strategies with respect to a combination of extreme weather and air pollution to ensure a suitable and sustainable quality of life. This study helps predict energy loads according to urban street canyon structures and examines whether trees and green walls are effective in reducing extreme weather and air pollution and saving energy. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the resulting higher transaction costs, mainly related to transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (and additional financial costs) involved in face-to-face meetings, are in direct conflict with the urgent need to reduce our carbon footprint. This research explored the development of an online platform, “CoLabS”, specifically designed as a virtual meeting and learning space to support collaboration within and between communities to accelerate sustainable community development efforts. While the move towards online collaboration in virtual environments has steadily increased in the past decade, it has now become essential due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We identified higher seasonal extinction efficiency in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter due to variations in relative humidity, particle characteristics, and wind direction. In addition, the annual extinction efficiency rate with the values of 0.72 and 0.87 (m2/g)/year in Busan and Ulsan, respectively, indicated an increasing trend in both regions from 2015 to 2019. However, no considerable trend was observed in relative humidity during the study period. We conclude that the annually increasing trend might be associated with the particle characteristics, such as an increase in the number of particles per unit mass due to the smaller particle size compared to the past, or an increase in the particles with the light scattering characteristics. Considering the wind direction, the extinction efficiency was also high when the eastward wind was dominant compared to other winds. Despite the reduction in PM2.5 mass concentration, citizens can not feel this effect, since they perceive the PM2.5 mass concentration reduction by an increase in visibility. Our study suggests that it can be more effective to implement the pollution reduction policies based on the particle characteristics such as particle size, particle components, and the source of particle origination, not only the fine particle weight. © 2021.

Such trade-offs are particularly conspicuous for coastal cities, which often have more ambitious emission reduction targets and are more likely to face threats of extreme weather events such as typhoons. To tackle the Energy Trilemma of the city-level energy transition, this study develops a bottom-up multi-objective optimisation framework. The framework enables simultaneous optimising the long-term energy portfolio for a 20-year horizon and the short-term hourly dispatch strategy considering demand-side flexibility of energy storage. By setting multiple objectives, the trade-offs between three representative scenarios are evaluated via Pareto frontiers, i.e., the least-cost, the least-emissions, and the diversity-optimal scenarios. The case study in a typical coastal city, i.e., Xiamen, China, indicates that with limited local resources for solar, wind, and other renewable resources, the electricity transition would still need to rely on imported power to a large extent. Compared to the least-cost pathway, additional costs of 3.9% can help achieve a pathway with maximum energy diversity to enhance resilience, whereas 26.8% additional costs are needed to achieve the least-emissions pathway. In addition, the initial 10-year modelling results are verified by comparison with real-world actual data to further generate valuable insights into sustainable transition pathways of similar coastal cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal cities; Energy diversity; Energy planning; Energy Trilemma, energy resilience; Multi-objective optimization","Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Multiobjective optimization; Dispatch strategy; Emission reduction targets; Energy portfolio; Energy transitions; Extreme weather events; Multiple-objectives; Renewable resource; Transition pathway; Electric load dispatching; carbon emission; coastal zone; cost analysis; demand-side management; ecosystem resilience; emission control; energy planning; extreme event; optimization; trade-off; typhoon; China; Fujian; Xiamen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096859466

In this work, we propose a simple and efficient strategy to construct multi-color solid-state carbon dots (CDs) materials with photo-switchable and reversible dynamic-optical properties. A photochromic and positively-charged cellulose derivative C-Im+-SP with an imidazole salt (Im+) group and a spiropyran (SP) group is designed and synthesized. Subsequently, C-Im+-SP is spontaneously coated on the surface of negatively-charged CDs (NCDs) via electrostatic attraction to form a physical protective shell, which not only inhibits aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) in NCDs but also promotes effective fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The resultant NCDs@C-Im+-SP exhibits a photo-triggering reversible dynamic-optical property. The NCDs to C-Im+-SP ratio can be used to effectively regulate fluorescence emission and fluorescence kinetics. The polymeric C-Im+-SP shell layer endows NCDs with excellent processability and formability, whereby NCDs@C-Im+-SP materials can be utilized as functional coatings and inks to fabricate photo-rewritable paper and dynamic anti-counterfeit patterns that have considerable potential applications for special coatings, complex anti-counterfeiting, and information encryption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-counterfeiting; Carbon dots; Cellulose; Dynamic optical materials; Photo-rewritable paper; Solid fluorescence","Carbon; Cellulose; Energy transfer; Forster resonance energy transfer; Photochromism; Protective coatings; Anti-counterfeiting; Dynamic optical property; Electrostatic attractions; Fluorescence emission; Fluorescence kinetics; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Negatively charged; Solid-state materials; Cryptography; Carbon; Cellulose; Energy Transfer; Fluorescence; Optical Materials; Photographs; Protective Coatings; Shells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090229275

Many cities have already implemented these systems based on docks but new problems have arisen from their use, such as the lack or surplus of bicycles in each of the docks. To solve these problems predictive models have been proposed for forecasting the demand at each station. In this work, it is proposed to exploit the usage patterns of the users registered in these systems to build models able to forecast future demand. A case study is presented in the city of Salamanca where the methods based on dock information are evaluated against the proposed approach.

An on-board diagnostics (OBD)-based I/M program could be a cost-effective emission reduction program for diesel HDVs. Forty-five vehicles equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with either the check-engine-light-on or malfunction-indicator-light (MIL)-on, or both, and in certain repairs categories, were identified and their emissions were measured before and after the repairs in this study. The post-repair nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions decreased by 46%–75% for check-engine-light-on vehicles and by 53%–81% for MIL-on vehicles at different test speeds. NOx reductions for more than 55% of the vehicles showed reductions greater than 80% for at least one test speed. Pre-repair opacity readings from these HDVs were mostly lower than 5%, except for 6 vehicles that showed the opacity readings from 5.3% to 12.3%. After the repairs, opacity readings for all vehicles were below 5%, and average reductions of 43% in opacity were found for both check-engine-light-on and MIL-on cases.

However, the achievement of the 2D semiconductor-based heterojunction photocatalyst with the exposures of both abundant light-harvesting and catalytic sites at the hetero-interface region is still a huge challenge. Herein, we synthesized phosphotungstic acid/graphitic carbon nitride (HPW/g-C3N4) heterojunction nanosheets (NSs) with the highly-dispersed distribution of ultra-small HPW clusters (1∼2 nm) by using a facile self-assembly method based on the static adsorption-deposition process. The formed molecular-scale hetero-interface between HPW clusters and g-C3N4 NSs resulted in the exposure of abundant active-sites on the highly-dispersed HPW/g-C3N4 hetero-interface. By combining the steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectra with the wavelength-controlled experiments, we demonstrated that the hetero-interfacial charge-transfer process occurring in the HPW/g-C3N4 heterojunction NSs obeyed the Z-scheme mechanism rather than the common “type-II” heterojunction mechanism. In this way, the lifetimes of photoinduced electrons on the conduction band of g-C3N4 could be prolonged for initiating the photocatalytic solar-to-fuels conversion. Upon interband excitations of both the two hetero-components in the HPW/g-C3N4 heterojunction NSs, the photocatalytic activities of H2 generation and CO2 reduction could be enhanced by ∼2.2 and ∼6.7 times as compared to the pure g-C3N4 NSs, even though the HPW component was photocatalytic-inert for either H2 generation or CO2 reduction upon UV–vis light irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2reduction; g-C3N4 nanosheets; H2generation; Photocatalysis; Z-scheme mechanism","Carbon dioxide; Carbon nitride; Charge transfer; Heterojunctions; Molecules; Nanosheets; Photoluminescence; Photosensitizers; Reduction; Self assembly; Controlled experiment; Inter-band excitations; Interfacial charge transfer; Phosphotungstic acid; Photoinduced electrons; Photoluminescence spectrum; Self-assembly method; Steady state and transients; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090323107

Yet it remains challenging to improve the performance of one objective without creating unintended consequences for other objectives. This is especially difficult for smallholders navigating a diverse array of environmental and personal demands. This study demonstrates how combining participatory research through the Science and Technology Backyards (STB) approach with Pareto-based ranking modeling can increase smallholder production while also reducing environmental impact. Through an intensive farmer survey in a 1 × 1 km grid in Quzhou County, we demonstrate that farmers engaged in STBs performed better according to multiple objectives (i.e., optimizing overall grain yield, benefit-cost ratio, and GHG emissions, without compromising any one of these objectives) than farmer's not engaged in STBs. Moreover, we used a Pareto optimization approach (OPT) to determine the optimal smallholder scenario. We found that under OPT, grain yield could reach 9.5 t/ha, with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.1, a 100% N recovery efficiency, and 7,395 kg CO2eq ha−1 GHG emissions. With OPT as a final goal, our research team worked with STB farmers to improve economic and environmental outcomes without compromising yield. Our findings demonstrate that no significant difference was obtained between farmers engaged in STBs and these under OPT. Compared with non-STB farmers, STB farmers’ grain yield improved by 18%, benefit-cost ratio improved by 26% due to improved N recovery efficiency, and GHG emissions were reduced by 31%. These improvements demonstrate the power of scientist–farmer engagement for optimizing wheat production. Such engagement allows farmers to modify their agronomic practices to more closely match Pareto optimal conditions, thus improving environmental and economic benefits without compromising yield. Our results provide solid evidence of the potential for sustainable wheat production by combining modeling with participatory research. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, spatial and temporal changes of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and potential influencing factors were analyzed in different elevations and land uses across southwest China. Results showed: (1) there was a critical elevation of 3400 m, with different NDVI responses to climate and human interventions above and below 3400 m. Below 3400 m, mean NDVI in each land use area and the whole region did not change with elevation due to compensative effects of decreasing cultivated land and increasing woodland and grassland towards high elevations. Above 3400 m, cultivation effectively ceases. NDVI decreased with elevation as alpine plant species shifted from woody trees to alpine grass, primarily related to declining temperature towards high altitudes. (2) NDVI responses to climate change and human activities are also different above and below 3400 m. NDVI below 3400 m increased significantly after 1980s, primarily as a result of reforestation on hillslopes and improved agricultural productivity. Above 3400 m, under climate warming since the 1980s, NDVI did not increase significantly in 1990s and even decreased in 2000s as the consecutive rise of temperature is higher towards higher altitudes in the 2000s. (3) The area-weighted NDVIs illustrated that from 1980s to 2000s, the increased mean NDVI in the whole region arose from contributions of 20.93, 60.66 and 18.41% changes in NDVIs in cultivated land, woodland and grassland, respectively. In 2000s, the proportion of the woody trees contribution to NDVI increased due to reforestation in the low elevation area (<3400 m), but decreased due to shift of the woody trees to alpine grass under the consecutive climate warming in the high elevation area (>3400 m). The decease of NDVI in the high elevations did not alter increasing trend of NDVI across the whole region during 1982–2015. However, in future, the greening could diminish or even cease as climate warming continues and effects of artificially managed ecological restoration reduce. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change; Land use; Mountain vegetation; NDVI; Southwest China","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Ecology; Land use; Productivity; Reforestation; Vegetation; Agricultural productivity; Ecological restoration; Effective management; Human activities; Human intervention; Normalized difference vegetation index; Spatial and temporal changes; Spatiotemporal patterns; Climate change; climate change; grassland; mountain environment; NDVI; reforestation; satellite altimetry; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation cover; woodland; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097715245

Yet, little information is available about the factors that control soil DON in the alpine ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau, a region that is extremely sensitive to climate change. Methods: Here, we examined the relationship between DON and climate, plant, and soil attributes along a precipitation gradient in five alpine ecosystems (alpine wetland, alpine meadow, alpine shrub, alpine steppe, and alpine desert) across 20 sites that were up to 4000 km apart on the Tibetan Plateau. Results: Results showed that soil DON concentration varied significantly across these alpine ecosystems, and had a positive relationship with mean annual precipitation. Belowground biomass, soil moisture, micro biomass carbon (MBC), and soil total phosphorus (TP) explained 84% of the variation in DON concentrations. The percentage of DON in soil total dissolved N (TDN) varied with vegetation type, with the lowest percentage observed in the alpine meadow (52%) and the highest in the alpine desert (77%), indicating the slow turnover of DON into inorganic N in systems with low litter input and microbial activity.

Although as a key quantity of terrestrial ecosystems, there is a lack of high-spatialand- temporal-resolution, real-time and observation-based GPP products. To address this critical gap, here we leverage a state-of-the-art vegetation index, near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV), along with accurate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), to produce a SatelLite Only Photosynthesis Estimation (SLOPE) GPP product for the contiguous United States (CONUS). Compared to existing GPP products, the proposed SLOPE product is advanced in its spatial resolution (250m versus >500 m), temporal resolution (daily versus 8 d), instantaneity (latency of 1 d versus >2 weeks) and quantitative uncertainty (on a per-pixel and daily basis versus no uncertainty information available). These characteristics are achieved because of several technical innovations employed in this study: (1) SLOPE couples machine learning models with MODIS atmosphere and land products to accurately estimate PAR. (2) SLOPE couples highly efficient and pragmatic gapfilling and filtering algorithms with surface reflectance acquired by both Terra and Aqua MODIS satellites to derive a soil-adjusted NIRV (SANIRV) dataset. (3) SLOPE couples a temporal pattern recognition approach with a long-term Cropland Data Layer (CDL) product to predict dynamic C4 crop fraction. Through developing a parsimonious model with only two slope parameters, the proposed SLOPE product explains 85% of the spatial and temporal variations in GPP acquired from 49 AmeriFlux eddy-covariance sites (324 site years), with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.63 gCm-2 d-1. The median R2 over C3 and C4 crop sites reaches 0.87 and 0.94, respectively, indicating great potentials for monitoring crops, in particular bioenergy crops, at the field level. With such a satisfactory performance and its distinct characteristics in spatiotemporal resolution and instantaneity, the proposed SLOPE GPP product is promising for biological and environmental research, carbon cycle research, and a broad range of real-time applications at the regional scale.

By using the PSR model, 13 indexes were divided into pressure layer, state layer and response layer, the indexes were standardized, weight distribution and synthesis. The green development level of industrial park was divided into 5 grades combined with the pressure state response factors. The results show that the energy consumption per unit industrial output of a stainless-steel industrial park is 0.7116 tons of standard coal per million yuan, the water consumption per unit industrial output is 6.1466 cubic meters per million yuan, the wastewater discharge per unit industrial added value is 3.12 tons per million yuan, the reduction rate of carbon emissions per unit industrial added value is 19.53%, and the green development index is 0.65, which belongs to the third level of green development. The problems are reflected in particulate emission, resource recycling, energy efficiency, industrial structure, and park greening.

To understand the distribution and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), surface water and sediment samples were collected from areas around the industrial parks. The total concentrations of 19 PAHs in water and sediment were 32.98–286 ng L−1 and 15.14–5355 ng g−1, respectively. The highest PAH concentrations in water and sediment were found in samples from Wuxi city, which were dominated by high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs, and strongly influenced by fine chemical parks. HMW compounds dominated in the sediment with PAHs containing four and five rings accounting for 61% of the sedimentary ΣPAHs, PAHs in water were dominated by low molecular weight (LMW) compounds (PAHs with two and three rings represented &gt;68% of ΣPAHs). The results of isomeric ratio analysis and principal component analysis with multiple linear regression indicated that the PAH concentrations in water and sediment near the YRD chemical parks are strongly influenced by industrial emissions. The fugacity fraction approach was applied to explain the trend for water–sediment exchange of 16 priority PAHs, which showed that net fluxes for most were from the sediment into water. The results indicated that the LMW PAHs were in a non-steady state in the sediment–water system. An ecological risk assessment showed that most sites were low to medium risk, but one site was high risk. © 2020","Chemical industry; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Sediment; Water; Yangtze River Delta","Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Industrial emissions; Linear regression; Mineral oils; Molecular weight; Risk assessment; Sediments; Surface waters; Chemical industry parks; Ecological risk assessment; High molecular weight; Low molecular weight compounds; Multiple linear regressions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Sediment exchanges; Yangtze river delta; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; surface water; chemical industry; concentration (composition); PAH; sediment pollution; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; water pollution; Article; chemical analysis; chemical industry; chemical parameters; chemical structure; China; concentration (parameter); molecular weight; multiple linear regression analysis; prediction; principal component analysis; priority journal; risk assessment; river ecosystem; sediment; steady state; urban area; water pollution; water sampling; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090322005

The electrospun carbon fiber membranes (CFMs) have the possibility of being used as flexible electrodes due to their one-dimensional fiber structure. The pristine CFMs generally have poor porosity, and the activation process is of the essence. However, the conventional blending activation process will produce an uneven pore distribution and destroy the fiber membrane structure, which is not conducive to maintaining the flexibility of CFMs and hindering the application in flexible supercapacitors. Herein, by treating the electrospun CFMs with KOH impregnation activation process, we have succeeded in making the activation of CFMs more uniform and avoiding the occurrence of local over-activation. On the premise of ensuring that the fiber structure of CFMs is not damaged, the specific surface area of activated CFMs (ACFMs) was increased to 2408 m2 g−1, and the mechanical flexibility of CFMs was well maintained. As a result, the optimal ACFMs delivers a specific capacitance of 289.2 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in aqueous electrolyte and an energy density of 14.8 Wh kg−1 in neutral electrolyte. In addition, the flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor also shows excellent electrochemical performance, making it have great potential in energy storage applications for wearable, foldable, and portable electronic devices. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Blending; Chemical activation; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Potassium hydroxide; Specific surface area; Aqueous electrolyte; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage applications; High specific surface area; Mechanical flexibility; Neutral electrolytes; Portable electronic devices; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095846413

Nevertheless, the effect of denitrifiers on N2O emission has not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, we explored the denitrifying gas kinetics, nitrate content, transcribed denitrifying functional genes (narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ), and the active bacteria during anaerobic incubation of soils with conventional intensive N fertilization (CNS) and reduced N fertilization (RNS), both sampled from a vegetable greenhouse experimental site. The CNS sample showed significantly higher N2O emission rates relative to the RNS sample. However, the difference in N2O emission between the soils was neither because of the cumulative nitrate content nor the quantity of denitrifying gene transcripts. The distinct fertilization regimes shaped the significantly different bacterial communities in these soils. The absolute abundance of bacteria that produce N2O but lack the nosZ gene for N2O reduction (for example, the dominant Kaistobacter) was higher in CNS than in RNS. Meanwhile, the abundance of two operational taxonomy units (OTUs), namely Rhodanobacter, belonging to the most abundant genus in denitrifying guilds, was strongly enriched in CNS and showed significant positive correlation with N2O/(N2O + N2). The predominance of these bacterial OTUs in the CNS denitrifying guild strongly suggested that high N2O emission from the soil with long-term conventional intensive fertilization might be primarily attributed to the reshaping of distinct denitrifying guilds in their bacterial communities. © 2021 Soil Science Society of China","denitrification; denitrifier community; denitrifying bacteria; denitrifying functional gene; greenhouse gas; N fertilization","agricultural land; agricultural soil; anoxic conditions; bacterium; experimental study; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; microbial community; reaction kinetics; sampling; Bacteria (microorganisms); Kaistobacter; Rhodanobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097666037

However, Mn(III) disproportionation and Jahn–Teller distortion can induce Mn(II) dissolution and irreversible phase changes, greatly deteriorating the cycling life. Herein, a multi-valence cobalt-doped Mn3O4 (Co-Mn3O4) with high capacity and reversibility, which lies in the multiple roles of the various states of doped cobalt, is reported. The Co2+ doping between the phase change product δ-MnO2 layer acts as a “structural pillar,” and the Co4+ in the layer can increase the conductivity of Mn4+ and hold the high specific capacity. More importantly, Co ion (Co2+, Co3+) doping can effectively inhibit the Jahn–Teller effect in discharge products and promote ion diffusion. Using X-ray absorption spectra results and density functional theory modelling, the multiple roles of doped cobalt are verified. Specifically, the Co-Mn3O4 cathode shows high specific capacity of 362 mAh g–1 and energy density of 463.1 Wh kg–1 at 100 mA g–1.

In this preliminary study, CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes and associated microbial characteristics in four groups of subsurface-flow CWs, i.e., ceramsite CWs (C-CWs), biochar-amended CWs (B-CWs), intermittently aerated B-CWs (AB-CWs) and tide-flow B-CWs (TB-CWs), were comparatively investigated. The results showed that biochar amendment significantly mitigated CH4 and N2O fluxes from the CWs by supporting higher abundances of mcrA and nosZ genes and higher ratios of pmoA/mcrA and nosZ/(nirK + nirS), thus reducing global warming potential (GWP, a decrease of 55.8%), in addition to promoting total nitrogen (TN) removal by 41.3%, mainly by increasing the abundances and activities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The TF mode efficiently improved nitrogen removal, but it greatly increased GHG fluxes since large amounts of GHGs escaped from the empty CW matrix after water draining. IA abated GHG emissions from the CWs, mainly after aeration. TF and IA decreased the abundances of functional bacteria and archaea related to C and N transformation, except nitrifiers, and shaped the microbial community structures. The application of a biochar substrate and IA mode can facilitate the design and operation of CWs in a more ecologically sustainable way. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar media; Functional microorganisms; Greenhouse gas emissions; Microbial community; Operation modes; Subsurface-flow constructed wetlands","Gas emissions; Global warming; Microorganisms; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Substrates; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Design and operations; Global warming potential; Intermittent aeration; Microbial characteristics; Microbial community structures; Treatment performance; Greenhouse gases; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; methane; nitrogen; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; nitrous oxide; aeration; biochar; carbon emission; constructed wetland; greenhouse gas; microbial community; substrate; subsurface flow; Article; carbon footprint; chemical modification; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameter); constructed wetland; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; gene; greenhouse effect; heavy metal removal; intermittent aeration; mcrA gene; microbial community; microcosm; nonhuman; nosZ gene; pmoA gene; real time polymerase chain reaction; tidal flow; greenhouse gas; wetland; Archaea; Charcoal; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098531075

Then we describe the design of our methods for calculation and visualization of certain agro-climatic factors. We then run two case studies. Firstly, the case study of Kojčice validates the uncertainty of input data by in-situ sensors. Then, the case study of the Pilsen region presents certain agro-climatic factors calculated for a representative point of the area and visualizes their time-variability in graphs. Maps represent a spatial distribution of the chosen factors for the Pilsen region. The calculated agro-climatic factors are frost dates, frost-free periods, growing degree units, heat stress units, number of growing days, number of optimal growing days, dates of fall nitrogen application, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff sums together as water balance and solar radiation.

Caprock layers/zones, which are saturated with brine and CO2 at different degrees of saturation (DOSs), behave differently. Since the risk of CO2 back-migration through different zones in the caprock varies, the focus of this study is on the effects of injected CO2 on the mineralogical and mechanical behavior of caprock with different DOSs due to chemical alteration. A series of reactivity tests were conducted on siltstone samples under different saturation conditions. The experimental results showed that fast dissolution of minerals such as kaolinite and muscovite due to carbonic acid increases the pore volume of caprock. Therefore, flow paths and porosity increase in the fully CO2-brine-saturated zone compared to other zones in the caprock that are not fully saturated with CO2 and brine. In addition, the caprock layer, which is fully saturated with CO2 and brine, has the highest stress corrosion and shear weakening due to mineral dissolution and wetting softening effects, which occur due to surface energy consumption. The next weakest zone in the caprock is the fully brine-saturated siltstone layer due to quartz hydrolysis and wetting softening effects. Therefore, serious attention should be paid to a caprock layer fully saturated with a CO2-brine mixture during sequestration because the risk of CO2 migration via this caprock zone is high, and this affects the permanence and security of injected CO2, especially during periodic CO2 injections and minor seismic events. ©",,"Aquifers; Corrosion; Dissolution; Energy utilization; Hydrogeology; Kaolinite; Mica; Shear flow; Wetting; Chemical alteration; Deep saline aquifers; Geochemical characteristic; Mechanical behavior; Mineral dissolution; Saturation conditions; Scientific community; Sequestration of CO2; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100833280

Sri Lanka is also affecting this problem mainly due to the petroleum and petroleum-derived industries. Therefore, the magnitude of heavy metals in air and their emission sources are needed for making the policies to control air pollution. Biomonitoring is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly air monitoring technique and in the present study moss Hyophila involuta was used as a biomonitor to monitor the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in the western province of Sri Lanka in the vicinity of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery and the Kelanitissa power plant. Moss samples and relevant soil samples were collected in March 2013 and in January 2014 and the concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) were determined. The results obtained from the principal components analysis revealed that the elements can be grouped into two different components that indirectly reflected two different anthropogenic sources and Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr are believed to have originated from petrochemicalbased applications operating around the studied area. © 2021 World Research Association.

The composition data were applied to mass closure analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model along with detailed wind direction analysis for quantifying and identifying the probable sources of both PM size fractions. The average concentrations of PM2.5 (40 μg m−3) and PM10 (146 μg m−3) were greatly exceeded the WHO air quality thresholds for 78–92% of the sampling days. Mass closure indicated the predominance of secondary inorganic aerosol (39%) and EC (7%) in fine PM, while mineral dust contributes 50% to the total mass of coarse particles. PMF identified six major sources of fine and coarse PM, including secondary inorganic aerosols, vehicular emissions, heavy oil combustion, marine aerosols, mineral and fugitive dust. The wind direction analysis indicated that both local and regional sources impact Qatar's air quality attributed to specific wind conditions. Two main sources of heavy oil combustion and secondary aerosols are closely related to regional emissions from shipping vessels and the petrochemical industry in the Gulf region. The desert dust transport mixed with local re-suspended dust and sea-salt particles also contributes considerably to the local PM concentrations. The significant contributions of regional anthropogenic and natural emissions pose a significant challenge in meeting local PM standards, signifying the importance of regional collaboration for better control policies on reducing transboundary air pollution. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Backward trajectories; Chemical mass closure; PM2.5-10; PM2.5; PMF model; PSCF",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094626086

Various efforts have been made to predict the diffusivity of such gas dissolved in heavy oil with or without considering the oil swelling. Practically, the oil swelling is always considered in an excessively simplified manner so that such swelling is not able to exhibit its true effect on the estimated diffusivity. In most studies where the oil swelling is considered, the liquid-phase hydrocarbon is assumed to swell equally at every location because the height of liquid-phase in a diffusion vessel is simply extended proportionally to the oil swelling direction. Such a proportional swell is often realized during numerical solutions by uniformly extending the numerical cells, regardless of the amount of dissolved gas contained in each of them. In addition, no studies have been made to examine the contribution of one gas over the other for a gas mixture-liquid system. In this study, a pragmatic approach is proposed to determine the main- and cross-term diffusivities of gas-liquid systems considering local swelling effect. More specifically, diffusivities of CO2 and a CO2-C3H8 mixture in a Lloydminster heavy oil are respectively estimated by implementing the finite difference approximation (FDA) with the face-centered explicit scheme. For the CO2-C3H8 mixture, the individual diffusivity of each gas in the mixture is firstly computed independent of the other gas in the mixture. Then, the cross-term diffusivity is included to verify the effect of the other gas in heavy oil for the diffusion of one gas, while the local oil swelling is implemented during the estimation of the individual gas diffusivities. It is found that the obtained diffusivities of pure CO2 and each individual component of the CO2-C3H8 mixture in the Lloydminster heavy oil are reasonable and accurate to reproduce the measured oil swelling factors obtained from the dynamic volume analysis (DVA) tests. © 2020 by ASME.","cross-term diffusivity; dynamic volume analysis (DVA); explicit finite difference approximation (FDA); local oil swelling; main-term diffusivity; petroleum engineering; unconventional petroleum","Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Diffusion; Dissolution; Finite difference method; Gases; Liquids; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Explicit scheme; Finite difference approximations; Gas-liquid systems; Heavy oil reservoirs; Individual components; Molecular diffusion; Numerical solution; Volume analysis; Heavy oil production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091816194

In coastal plain sandy soils particularly, leaching along with volatilization in warmer climates may be a predominant pathway for N loss to the environment. A replicated field study to determine both crop N requirement and recovery efficiency of N (REN) in tomatoes (var. BHN 602) grown on sandy soils under a plastic-mulched bed system was conducted in north Florida. Isotope labeled-ammonium nitrate (15NH415NO3) was applied in spring at four different N rates (0, 168, 224, 280 kg N ha−1). A subsequent study in the fall was conducted in order to determine the recovery of residual N fertilizer in tomatoes. In spring, no appreciable response to applied fertilizer N rate above 168 kg N ha−1 (lowest rate) were observed, indicating recommended N rates may be more than what is required. On average, approximately, 62 % of N accumulation in the plant came from fertilizer, whereas 38 % came from soil N. In the fall, recovery of residual 15N fertilizer at harvest ranged from 1.9 to 5.4 kg N ha−1. At the end of both studies, a 15N balance was calculated to estimate total crop and soil recovery of N fertilizer, where approximately 15.4 % of applied 15N fertilizer was recovered. Unrecovered N in this study shows that optimizing N fertilizer management in warmer climates is critical in order to avoid unnecessary excess application of fertilizer and minimize loss of N to the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","15N; Nitrogen use efficiency; Plant uptake; Residual nitrogen fertilizer; Sandy soil; Soil nitrogen","ammonium nitrate; fertilizer application; fruit; isotopic analysis; leaching; mulching; nitrogen; sandy soil; volatilization; Florida [United States]; United States; Florida; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096820554

The Black Summer bushfires that occurred in Australia from September 2019 to early February 2020 were unprecedented in their scale and intensity. The fires led to loss of lives and homes, and widespread destruction of flora, fauna and ecosystems. Dense smoke from these catastrophic fires blanketed major cities and towns for weeks. A Commonwealth Royal Commission and two state inquiries provided recommendations for reducing the risk of future bushfires and for better disaster management processes to support the preparedness, relief, response and recovery to such megafires. While strategies to reduce the risk of bushfires and the damage to our biota and ecosystems are necessary and important, there is also an urgent need for mitigation strategies to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases. If we are to minimise the planetary effects of a warming climate, we need to limit global warming to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels and to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This requires transformative thinking and action by our political leaders that builds on the Australian public and industry's willingness to play their part. © 2021 AHHA.",,"Australia; climate change; ecosystem; fire; human; prevention and control; Australia; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fires; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100603632

In this paper, 5-8 years of annual methane collection data from 114 closed landfills located in 29 states were used to estimate site-specific waste decay rates (k) and methane collection potentials (Lc). These sites account for approximately 9% of all landfills required to report GHG emissions to the US EPA annually. The mean methane collection potential (Lc) for the sites located in regions with less than 635 mm (25 in) annual rainfall was significantly (p<0.002) lower than the mean methane collection potential of the sites located in regions with more than 635 mm (25 in) annual precipitation (49 and 73 m3 methane Mg-1 waste, respectively). This finding suggests that a fraction of the in-place biodegradable waste may not be decomposing, potentially due to a lack of adequate moisture content of landfills located in arid regions. The results of this evaluation offer insight that challenges assumptions of the traditional landfill methane estimation approach, especially in arid climates, that all methane corresponding to the total methane generation potential of the buried solid waste will be produced. Decay rates showed a significant correlation with annual precipitation, with an average k of 0.043 year-1 for arid regions (< 508 mm (20 in) year-1), 0.074 year-1 for regions with 508-1,016 mm (20-40 in) annual precipitation, and 0.09 year-1 in wet regions (> 1,016 mm (40 in) year-1). The data suggest that waste is decaying faster than the model default values, which in turn suggests that a larger fraction of methane is produced during a landfill's operating life (relative to post-closure).

Recent studies using stable isotope analyses have indicated that isotope signatures in partially mycoheterotrophic plants vary widely among species, but the relative contributions of family- or species-specific characteristics and the identity of the fungal symbionts to the observed differences remain unclear. Here, we investigated in detail mycorrhizal communities and isotopic signatures in four co-occurring terrestrial orchids (Platanthera chlorantha, Epipactis helleborine, E. neglecta and the mycoheterotrophic Neottia nidus-avis). All investigated species were mycorrhizal generalists (i.e., associated with a large number of fungi simultaneously), but mycorrhizal communities differed significantly between species. Mycorrhizal communities associating with the two Epipactis species consisted of a wide range of fungi belonging to different families, whereas P. chlorantha and N. nidus-avis associated mainly with Ceratobasidiaceae and Sebacinaceae species, respectively. Isotopic signatures differed significantly between both Epipactis species, with E. helleborine showing near autotrophic behavior and E. neglecta showing significant enrichment in both carbon and nitrogen. No significant differences in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were observed between the two partially mycoheterotrophic orchids, despite significant differences in isotopic signatures. Our results demonstrate that partially mycoheterotrophic orchids of the genus Epipactis formed mycorrhizas with a wide diversity of fungi from different fungal families, but variation in mycorrhizal community composition was not related to isotope signatures and thus transfer of C and N to the plant. We conclude that the observed differences in isotope signatures between E. helleborine and E. neglecta cannot solely be explained by differences in mycorrhizal communities, but most likely reflect a combination of inherent physiological differences and differences in mycorrhizal communities. © Copyright © 2021 Jacquemyn, Brys, Waud, Evans, Figura and Selosse.","mixotrophy; mycorrhiza; Orchidaceae; photosynthesis; stable isotopes; trophic modes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101550985

According to IPCC (2006), the waste sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which accounts for about 5% of the global greenhouse budget. This 5% is methane (CH4) emissions from the anaerobic decomposition of solid waste and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the decomposition of wastewater. Methane is one of the most important greenhouse gas (GHG) due to it has about 21-23 times global warming potential than CO2. The CH4 and N2O emissions released in leachate treatment systems are the second-largest sources of greenhouse gases. The study is aimed to estimate methane emissions in leachate treatment plant in Landfill Rimba Mas Perlis, Malaysia, and its carbon credit revenue. The CH4 emission from the leachate treatment plant was estimated by using the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) methodology AM0013 and its economic benefit was determined based on the Clean Development Mechanism. From the study, the greenhouse gas emission in a leachate treatment plant has contributes to a reduction in carbon emissions by 233.21 tonnes/yr which could attract the carbon credit of RM 8,162.35 based on RM35/tonnes of CO2. The results indicate the anthropogenic emission in the leachate treatment plant can bring direct economic benefits to the local. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Wastewater disposal; Anaerobic decomposition; Anthropogenic emissions; Clean Development Mechanism; Environmental issues; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Leachate treatment plant; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Leachate treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102168943

The quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted to analyze the collected data through an authoritative purposive sampling technique and finally interpreted and discussed. The results of adaption strategies showed different variations on pesticides usage. The probit model indicated that age, education, the cultivated area in an acre, housing pattern, perception on climate change and meal per day influence the farmers to triggers an adaptive strategy. The results of the binary logit model are also consistent with the probit model findings. The multi-nominal logit model indicated that age, sex, total cultivated area, and perception of climate change have negatively influenced to adopt strategy 2 (use pesticides), while age, family size and perception of climate change have positively influenced the farmers to adopt strategy 5 (use pesticides + take financial loan).

X. fastidiosa is limited to the xylem tissue and following infection induces extensive plant-derived xylem blockages, primarily in the form of tyloses. Tylose-mediated vessel occlusions are a hallmark of PD, particularly in susceptible V. vinifera. We temporally monitored tylose development over the course of the disease to link symptom severity to the level of tylose occlusion and the presence/absence of the bacterial pathogen at fine-scale resolution. The majority of vessels containing tyloses were devoid of bacterial cells, indicating that direct, localized perception of X. fastidiosa was not a primary cause of tylose formation. In addition, we used X-ray computed microtomography and machine-learning to determine that X. fastidiosa induces significant starch depletion in xylem ray parenchyma cells. This suggests that a signalling mechanism emanating from the vessels colonized by bacteria enables a systemic response to X. fastidiosa infection. To understand the transcriptional changes underlying these phenotypes, we integrated global transcriptomics into the phenotypes we tracked over the disease spectrum. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that considerable transcriptomic reprogramming occurred during early PD before symptom appearance. Specifically, we determined that many genes associated with tylose formation (ethylene signalling and cell wall biogenesis) and drought stress were up-regulated during both Phase I and Phase II of PD. On the contrary, several genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were down-regulated during both phases. These responses correlate with significant starch depletion observed in ray cells and tylose synthesis in vessels. © 2020 The Authors.

Estimating urban resilience is thus one of the important processes to understanding the current and potential future risks of cities providing practical policies and qualified strategies to cope with climate change effects. This study presents a disaster risk analysis in Southern Taiwan at the municipal and zone levels using the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI). The index was estimated at both the zone and city scale of three coastal cities, namely Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung. The CDRI approach consists of five different dimensions (physical, social, economic, institutional, and natural), with several parameters and variables reflecting the abilities, strength, and threats of case study cities to cope with potential climate-related disasters. The findings show that, while the physical dimension has the highest resilience among cities, the lowest average scores and the least resilience belong to the natural dimension. The overall CDRI score for different cites also revealed various capabilities, shortcomings, drawbacks, and potential risks of neighbored cities in the same region. It is expected that the findings of this study shall serve as an urban planning tool to recognize the sectors within an urban context that are more or less resilient, enhance actions at the local level, and support future planning decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, lean burn systems are susceptible to thermo-acoustic instabilities which can lead to deterioration in engine performance. This paper will focus on one of the common industrial techniques for controlling combustion instabilities, secondary injection, which is the addition of small quantities of secondary gas to the combustor. This approach has often been employed in industry on a trial-and-error basis using the primary fuel gas for secondary injection. Recent advances in fuel-flexible gas turbines offers the possibility to use other gases for secondary injection to mitigate instabilities. This paper will explore the effectiveness of using hydrogen for this purpose. The experiments presented in this study were carried out on a laboratory scale bluff-body combustor consisting of a centrally located conical bluff body. Three different secondary gases, ethylene, hydrogen and nitrogen, were added locally to turbulent imperfectly-premixed ethylene flames. The total calories of the fuel mixture and the momentum ratio were kept constant to allow comparison of flame response. The heat release fluctuations were determined from the OH* chemiluminescence, while the velocity perturbations were estimated from pressure measurements using the two-microphone method. The results showed that hydrogen was the most effective in reducing the magnitude of self-excited oscillations. Nitrogen had negligible effect, while ethylene only showed an effect at high secondary flow rates which resulted in sooty flames. © 2020 The Authors","Combustion instability; Gas turbine; Hydrogen; Lean burn; NOx Emissions; Self excited oscillations","Aliphatic compounds; Combustors; Deterioration; Ethylene; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Hydrogen; Nitrogen; Thermoacoustic engines; Combustion instabilities; Engine performance; Gas turbine applications; Heat release fluctuations; Self excited oscillation; Thermoacoustic instability; Two-microphone methods; Velocity perturbation; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097464155

However, there has been limited analysis of the extent to which urban planning policy documents addresses climate change adaptation and or mitigation. There is a need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and to be well adapted to this change (in line with the Paris Agreement). Achieving this goal will assist in limiting damage and loss to humans and the natural environment. This paper presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of urban planning documents (policy, regulation and law) in the state of Victoria, Australia, and the degree to which climate change mitigation and adaptation (with a focus on sea level rise) are addressed and integrated. Two scales of government (state and local) were analysed across three policy disciplines (urban planning, climate change and flood management). The evaluation framework contributes to the few tools for analyzing legislation, regulation and strategic policies for climate change adequacy. The findings reveal limited climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in urban planning documents. Additionally, there is limited integration of adaptation and mitigation actions. Important opportunities for better alignment of policies across disciplines and government levels in line Paris Agreement goals are identified, to ensure implementation in decisions made about land use and development. The analysis finds that urban planning policy must do more to include and integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Government; Integration; Mitigation; Policy; Sea level rise; Urban planning","climate change; government; integrated approach; mitigation; sea level change; urban planning; urban policy; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096863307

However, how does the urbanization process impact the peak of future carbon emissions from buildings is still unclear. This study first establishes a comprehensive urbanization framework from three dimensions. Then, a dynamic scenario simulation model is innovatively constructed by combining the extended Kaya identity and Monte Carlo simulation approach to explore future dynamic evolution trajectory, possible peaks and peaking time of China's building carbon emissions from 2000 to 2050, considering the uncertainties of factors. Finally, dynamic sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the contributions of different dimensions of the urbanization. Results show that under the business-as-usual scenario, the rural residential building sector will be the first to reach its energy peak in 2027. Dynamic scenario simulation shows that the building sector will peak at 3.09 (±0.36) Bt CO2 in 2037 (±4). Specifically, the urban residential building sector will peak at 1.27 (±0.18) Bt CO2 in 2040 (±4), while the rural residential building sector will peak at 0.51 (±0.03) Bt CO2 in 2021 (±4) and the commercial building sector will peak in 2038 (±4) at 1.41 (±0.30) Bt CO2. Dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that rural–urban migration will exert promoting effect on the peaking time and emission peaks of building carbon emissions through the concomitant effects of the urbanization process, i.e., the economic urbanization and space urbanization. Overall, this study can provide a better insight into the impact of urbanization on carbon emission peak and can support governments and decision-makers to formulate effective carbon-mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building sector; Carbon emission peak; Dynamic scenario simulation; Extended Kaya identity; Monte Carlo simulation; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Housing; Monte Carlo methods; Office buildings; Sensitivity analysis; Urban growth; Carbon mitigation; Commercial building; Concomitant effects; Dynamic evolution; Dynamic scenarios; Dynamic sensitivity analysis; Rural residential buildings; Urban residential buildings; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095983208

However, an advanced synthesis that characterizes the existing studies is lacking. In this review, we used citation network analysis and a text mining approach to identify research trends and extract common research topics and the emerging domains in urban climatology. Based on the clustered networks, we found that aerosols and ozone, and urban heat island are the most popular topics. Together with other clusters, four emerging topical fields were identified: secondary organic aerosols, urban precipitation, flood risk and adaptation, and greenhouse gas emissions. The city case studies' geographical information was analyzed to explore the spatial–temporal patterns, especially in the emerging topical fields. Interdisciplinary research grew in recent years as the field of urban climatology expanded to interact with urban hydrology, health, energy issues, and social sciences. A few knowledge gaps were proposed: the lack of long-term high-temporal-resolution observational data of organic aerosols for model validation and improvements, the need for predictions of urban effects on precipitation and extreme flooding events under climate change, and the lack of a framework for cooperation between physical sciences and social sciences under urban settings. To fill these gaps, we call for more observational data with high spatial and temporal resolution, using high-resolution models that adequately represent urban processes to conduct scenario analyses for urban planning, and the development of intellectual frameworks for better integration of urban climatology and social-economical systems in cities.

Multiple CAVs can form a CAV platoon with a close inter-vehicle distance, which can further improve energy efficiency, save space, and reduce travel time. To date, there have been few detailed studies of self-driving algorithms for CAV platoons in urban areas. In this paper, we therefore propose a self-driving architecture combining the sensing, planning, and control for CAV platoons in an end-to-end fashion. Our multi-task model can switch between two tasks to drive either the leading or following vehicle in the platoon. The architecture is based on an end-to-end deep learning approach and predicts the control commands, i.e., steering and throttle/brake, with a single neural network. The inputs for this network are images from a front-facing camera, enhanced by information transmitted via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The model is trained with data captured in a simulated urban environment with dynamic traffic. We compare our approach with different concepts used in the state-of-the-art end-to-end self-driving research, such as the implementation of recurrent neural networks or transfer learning. Experiments in the simulation were conducted to test the model in different urban environments. A CAV platoon consisting of two vehicles, each controlled by an instance of the network, completed on average 67% of the predefined point-to-point routes in the training environment and 40% in a never-seen-before environment. Using V2V communication, our approach eliminates casual confusion for the following vehicle, which is a known limitation of end-to-end self-driving. © 2021 by the authors.

However, photochemical models often have difficulty capturing the observed magnitudes of SOA due to uncertainties in precursor emissions and modeling approach. In this study, we conducted a modeling study of SOA in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China to investigate the impact of emissions of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOC) and the SOA modeling schemes. IVOC emissions, which are important SOA precursors but are missing from most emission inventories, are estimated for the YRD region based on two methods. First, scaling IVOC from emissions of primary organic aerosols (POA) estimates 730 Gg with on-road and industry sectors being the main contributors. Second, scaling IVOC emissions using emission factors and activity data estimates 313 Gg, 57% lower than the first method, with industry and off-road sectors being the major contributors. A photochemical model simulation of SOA for July 2018, conducted using standard emission inventories for the YRD region, significantly underestimates SOA by 61% at the Dianshan Lake monitoring site (DSL). A series of simulations with two different SOA modeling schemes found that with the traditional two-product modeling framework, IVOC emissions enhance simulated SOA concentrations by 8%–27% at DSL and 5%–26% over the YRD region in July 2018. Increasing SOA mass yields from IVOC by a factor of five leads to better agreement with observations at the DSL site. Switching to the 1.5-Dimension Volatility Basis Set (VBS) approach increases simulated SOA by 76% at DSL but reduced POA concentration by 72%, leading to an overall decrease of organic aerosol (OA) by 12%. Unlike the two-product scheme where POA is entirely inert, the VBS scheme includes POA in the OA chemistry. The SOA:OA ratio and the anthropogenic-to-biogenic SOA ratio (ASOA:BSOA) also vary systematically with SOA modeling schemes suggesting that detailed measurements of SOA composition could further constrain modeling methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CAMx; Intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOC); Secondary organic aerosols (SOA); Yangtze river delta","Aerosols; Digital subscriber lines; Organic compounds; Roads and streets; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Monitoring sites; Photochemical modeling; Photochemical models; Secondary organic aerosols; Yangtze river delta; Uncertainty analysis; volatile organic compound; aerosol; concentration (composition); emission inventory; observational method; organic compound; particulate matter; photochemistry; road; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution control; China; priority journal; river; secondary organic aerosol; simulation; time series analysis; China; Lake Dianshan; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096904083

We also found the larger sugar pools (both in the dry and wet season) and the highest increased NSC in the roots (2.2-fold) of P. massoniana after N addition. Despite the increases in NSC of trees, we found no changes in chloroplast and photosynthetic capacity in response to N addition; however, the increased NSC may support prime defense of trees, as evidenced by significant correlations between NSC pools with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission (P &lt; 0.05, R2 in the range of 0.5–0.8). Our findings indicate that long-term N deposition induced carbon distribution and adaptation strategies of different subtropical trees, with increased NSC storage at the whole-tree and organ levels and more NSC being allocated to the branches of broadleaf tree species and to the roots of coniferous tree species, respectively. This study provides a new insight into understanding the mechanisms of subtropical forest trees adapting and surviving under long-term N deposition, and is also important for exploring the ecosystem C-N coupling relationships under global environment changes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Broadleaf trees; Carbon allocation; Coniferous trees; Nitrogen deposition; Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC)","Carbon; Deposition; Lakes; Network security; Nitrogen; Starch; Tropics; Volatile organic compounds; Adaptation strategies; Carbon distribution; Dry and wet seasons; Global environment; Nitrogen additions; Non-structural carbohydrates; Photosynthetic capacity; Subtropical forests; Forestry; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; forest ecosystem; global change; growth; root system; seasonal variation; subtropical region; Carbon; Deposition; Lakes; Nitrogen; Starch; Tropics; China; Castanopsis chinensis; Coniferales; Pinus massoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095810023

In contrast to the previous understanding of the monotonic influence of the electronic effect on the selectivity of CO2reduction, the dual roles of the electronic effect on the selectivity are revealed in the present study,i.e., (1) the electronic effect on redox originating from σ-donation and (2) the electronic effect on π-back-donation,viacomprehensive DFT studies on four representative classes of pincer NHC NiIIcatalysts. On the one hand, the electron-rich C, B-coordinating (CCCandCBC) ligands guarantee that the catalysts possess the driving force to reduce CO2in a lower-electron reduction state (NiI), leading to lower free energy barriers for the formation of HCOOH, which results from the lower ligand-field deformation energies for the hydride transfer and the stronger p-σ* interactions in the metal-hydride intermediates. In contrast, the less electron-rich N-coordinating (CNCandC(B)NC) ligands require an Ni0electron reduction state to reduce CO2, preferring kinetic-controlled CO formation due to the higher free energy barriers for the generation of HCOOH. This redox effect well explains the unprecedented experimentally observed selectivity of HCOOH in the stronger electron donorCCC-Nisystem, which is different from the traditional understanding of the electronic effect. On the other hand, at an identical reduction state, the electronic effect plays an important role in tuning the back-donation ability of the metal center, benefiting the π-back-donation in the metal-carbonyl intermediates, and thus favors the formation of CO. This back-donation effect is consistent with the traditional understanding of selectivity. This work provides comprehensive insights into the dual role of the electronic effect on the selectivity for CO2reduction, which can be instructive for the future design and development of catalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbonylation; Design for testability; Electrons; Energy barriers; Formic acid; Free energy; Hydrides; Ligands; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electron reduction; Electronic effects; Hydride transfers; Kinetic controlled; Metal carbonyl; Metal hydride intermediates; Reduction state; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100925066

These studies used ambient NO2 concentrations as a proxy of personal exposure of outdoor-originated NO2 (PEO NO2), which may lead to biased health effect estimates. This study was aiming to explore whether modified outdoor NO2 exposure can reduce this error. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the outdoor-originated NO2 concentration in residential buildings in 271 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015, and then PEO NO2 was obtained according to time-activity-location patterns of people. We adopted a typical time-series analysis to compare the mortality associations between PEO and outdoor NO2. The averaged concentrations of PEO and outdoor NO2 were 16.5 μg/m3 and 31.6 μg/m3, respectively. PEO NO2 showed a better model fitting and larger effect for its daily mortality association. A 10 μg/m3 increase in two-day moving average concentration of PEO and outdoor NO2 was associated with a 2.08% (1.70%, 2.45%) and 1.03% (0.83%, 1.22%) increase in total mortality, respectively.

This study investigated the formation mechanism of a severe air pollution event over the SB using synoptic approaches and model simulations. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) Heavy air pollution in the SB was characterized by low visibility, low atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height, high temperature, high relative humidity, strong temperature inversion layer, subsidence in the troposphere, high water vapor content between 500 and 900 hPa, southerly winds in the low troposphere, and surface winds with low speed and irregular direction. (2) Air quality in the SB was closely related to the weather system at 700 hPa over the basin. When the 700 hPa weather system affecting the SB was a high-pressure system, the subsidence and stable atmospheric stratification increased the air pollutant concentrations near the ground. When the 700 hPa weather system affecting the SB was a low-pressure system and the basin was in front of this low-pressure system, southwesterly warm and moist airflow and adiabatic subsidence warming formed the thick temperature inversion layer over the basin. As a result, the temperature inversion layer trapped air pollutants in the basin and induced the heavy air pollution event. When the 700 hPa weather system over the SB was a low-pressure system and the basin was behind the low-pressure system, the dry and cold airflow from the north invaded southward to the basin and broke the temperature inversion layer. Consequently, air pollutants dispersed vertically, resulting in decreased concentrations near the ground. (3) Air pollutants from December 17, 2017 to January 4, 2018 were mainly from local emissions. (4) The WRF-Chem model not only reproduced the variations in PM2.5 concentrations, the ABL height, and the height-time cross-sections of temperature, water vapor content, and wind over Chengdu during the air pollution event, but also revealed the formation mechanism of this heavy air pollution event. The results of this study reveal the formation mechanism of winter heavy air pollution events over the SB and help develop effective regional air quality management strategies to reduce the likelihood of local air pollution events and minimize the adverse impacts of air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; HYSPLIT model; Meteorological condition; Sichuan Basin; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric humidity; Climatology; Inversion layers; Quality management; Subsidence; Troposphere; Water pollution; Water vapor; Air pollutant concentrations; Atmospheric stratification; High pressure system; High relative humidities; Local air pollutions; Low pressure systems; Temperature inversion layers; Water vapor contents; Atmospheric temperature; air quality; airflow; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; inversion layer; pollutant transport; stratification; subsidence; temperature inversion; water vapor; wind velocity; adiabaticity; air quality; airflow; article; boundary layer; China; cold stress; high temperature; humidity; hypobarism; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; simulation; troposphere; velocity; visibility; warming; water vapor; weather; winter; Chengdu; China; Sichuan; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098161862

Therefore, “lockdown” was issued in affected countries to control the spread of the virus. To assess air pollution during and after lockdowns, this study selected pandemic hotspots in China (Wuhan), Japan (Tokyo), the Republic of Korea (Daegu), and India (Mumbai) and compared the Air Quality Index (AQI) in these areas for the past three years. The results indicated that air pollution levels were positively correlated with a reduction in pollutant levels during and after lockdowns in these cities. In Tokyo, low levels of air pollution, no significant change in the distribution of “good” and “moderate” days was observed during lockdown. In Daegu, mid-level air pollution, the percentage of “unhealthy” days (AQI&gt;100) markedly reduced during lockdown; however, this reverted after lockdown was lifted. In Wuhan and Mumbai, high air pollution levels, the percentage of unhealthy days remarkably decreased during lockdown and continued to reduce after lockdown. It was found that PM2.5 was the critical pollutant for all cities because its sub-AQI was the largest of the six pollutant species for the majority of days. In addition, PM10 dominated the overall AQI for 2.2–9.6% of the period in Wuhan and Mumbai, and its sub-AQI reduced during lockdown. The mean sub-AQI for NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 was within the “good” category for all cities. In conclusion, the lockdown policy reduced air pollution in general and this reduction was more significant for regions with high air pollution levels. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Asian cites; COVID-19 lockdown; Critical air pollutant; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097401307

Specifically, ENGOs, as a classic informal institution, has gradually become as important as governments in stimulating polluting firms to reduce pollutant emissions and implement green innovation. At the same time, due to the imbalances of ENGOs' resource endowments and geographic distributions in various regions, the normative pressure from ENGOs on polluting firms may also differ by geographic distance. Given that, building on economic geography and institutional theory, the current study developed a theoretical framework to illustrate the relationship between geographic proximity to ENGOs and firms' green innovation. The roles of ownership types and regional pollution level are then examined. For a sample of Chinese heavy-polluting firms from 2009 to 2015 and employing multiple linear regression, the study found that a firm's geographic proximity to ENGOs affects green technology innovation positively and significantly. However, the effect of geographic proximity on green management innovation varies as the radius changes. In addition, the regression results also indicated that the positive relation between geographic proximity and green technology innovation is stronger in SOEs than in NSOEs. In turn, the positive relation between geographic distance beyond a 100 km radius and green management innovation is stronger in NSOEs than in SOEs. Moreover, the results further demonstrated that regional pollution level weakens the impact of geographic proximity to ENGOs on green management innovation. The study not only provides an enhanced understanding about the literature on corporate environmental responsibility but also has important practical implications for prompting heavy-polluting firms' green innovation with the aid of ENGOs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic proximity to ENGOs; Green innovation; Heavy-polluting firms; Ownership types; Regional pollution level","economic geography; economic theory; emission control; firm size; geographical variation; green economy; innovation; spatiotemporal analysis; article; China; conceptual framework; geography; non-governmental organization; responsibility; theoretical study; China; environmental protection; organization; pollution; social responsibility; China; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution; Organizations; Social Responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095785399

This study designs an educational and practical workshop for adaptation to climate change at a local community level. The community universities in Taiwan normally facilitate social activities and informal learnings. This study thus defines the educational or social activities conducted in community universities as community-based affairs. After reviewing the phase II adaption action plan of Taiwan, critical adaptation sectors of disasters and water resources are identified. A case study on designing the community-based adaptation (CBA) workshop for water resources management in the Dahan River Basin is thereby developed. The learning subjects or practicing topics include an introduction to climate change impacts and their mitigation and adaptation; adaptation sectors of disasters, infrastructure, water resources, and agricultural production; and the utilization of water resources under climate change. Concept mapping of climate change impacts and debating possible global climate trends could further encourage participants to think in-depth and to act accordingly. This study also applies the rigor and relevance (R&R) framework to assist in the design of the CBA workshop and thereby to assess the effectiveness after its delivery. To further investigate the two-dimensional R&R levels of the CBA workshop, this study proposes eight combinations of contents and outcomes (tasks). In summary, this workshop gives background knowledge on geography and applies the analysis tool of concept mapping. The 10 learning subjects or practicing topics developed are mostly at the high rigor levels of 4-Analysis and 5-Synthesis. The overall “application level” of the CBA workshop is ranked as level 4 of “predictable real-world application.” The eight tasks that can “expand” the rigorousness of knowledge acquisition and “empower” the relevance of skill application are found to fall into Quadrant “C-Assimilation”.

If it is not managed properly, it will cause pollution. On the other hand, it is a significant source of raw materials and energy. This paper aims to develop a multi-period multi-objective linear programming model to design a municipal waste management planning model. Cost, air pollution, and volume of waste constitute the objectives. Incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion, landfill with and without gas recovery, recycling, and composting are the candidate technologies. Two scenarios, including examining all technologies and removing recycling and composting from the options, are considered. Incineration and gasification with average capacities of 31.8 MW and 10.4 MW were the first scenario's energy generation systems. On the other hand, in the second scenario, incineration, gasification, and anaerobic digestion with average capacities of 62.4 MW MW, 30.8 MW, and 59.8 MW, respectively, were the proposed options for energy production. All in all, results indicated that recycling and composting are preferable for waste management in Tehran; besides, among energy production technologies, incineration and anaerobic digestion are the best systems for the non-biodegradable and biodegradable portion of waste, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste; economic and environmental impacts; Energy and material recycling; Municipal solid waste management","Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Environmental technology; Gasification; Linear programming; Recycling; Waste incineration; Average capacities; Energy generations; Energy production technologies; Energy productions; Gas recovery; Multi-objective linear programming; Municipal waste; Planning models; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094622377

An evaluation of the net health effects of such pollutant changes is therefore important to ascertain whether the emission control measures effectively improve the overall protection of public health. In this study, we use a short-term health risk (added health risk or AR) model developed for the multi-pollutant air quality health index (AQHI) in Hong Kong to examine the overall health impacts of these pollutant changes. We first investigate AR changes associated with NO2 and O3 changes, followed by those associated with changes in all four AQHI pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2, and particulate matter (PM)). Our results show that for the combined health effects of NO2 and O3 changes, there is a significant reduction in AR in urban areas with dense traffic, but no statistically significant changes in other less urbanized areas. The increase in estimated AR for higher O3 concentrations is offset by a decrease in the estimated AR for lower NO2 concentrations. In areas with dense traffic, the reduction in AR as a result of decreased NO2 is substantially larger than the increase in AR associated with increased O3. When additionally accounting for the change in ambient SO2 and PM, we found a statistically significant reduction in total AR everywhere in Hong Kong. Our results show that the emission control measures resulting in NO2, SO2, and PM reductions over the past decade have effectively reduced the AR over Hong Kong, even though these control measures may have partially contributed to an increase in O3 concentrations. Hence, efforts to reduce NOx, SO2, and PM should be continued. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Control measures; Health risk tradeoffs; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Short-term health risk","Air quality; Emission control; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Combined effect; Control measures; Dense traffics; Emission control measures; Health effects; Health indices; Particulate Matter; Urbanized area; Health risks; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollution control; trade-off; air pollution; air quality health index; ambient air; Article; concentration (parameter); health hazard; health impact assessment; Hong Kong; particulate matter; pollutant; scoring system; traffic; urban area; air pollutant; China; Hong Kong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Hong Kong; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098531159

Therefore, we evaluated of the concentrations and emission sources of MSs, including 7 cyclic methylsiloxanes (D3–D9; CMSs, the number refers to the number of Si–O bonds) and 13 linear methylsiloxanes (L3–L15; LMSs) in ambient air collected from Saitama, Japan. This is a first study regarding the evaluation of 20 methylsiloxanes in the Japanese atmosphere. We improved the air sampling methodology by determination the stability of D5 during a 7-d air sampling and arbitrary sample storage period using polystyrene-divinyl benzene copolymer sorbent (Sep-Pak plus PS-2). We analyzed air samples for MSs seasonally collected from nine locations in Saitama, including urban, suburban, rural, and mountainous areas. The mean CMS and LMS concentrations were 358 ng m−3 and 13.4 ng m−3, respectively. The D5 concentrations were distributed widely, with high concentrations in urban/suburban populous areas and dispersed at low concentrations in surrounding areas (north and mountainous areas). We analyzed 7-d air samples collected every week over a year and found apparent seasonal and periodic trends in the CMS concentrations. In the diurnal sampling campaign, we observed periodic fluctuations in ambient CMSs, with an inverse relationship with the atmospheric boundary layer development during the day. Backward trajectories and the prevailing wind direction during the sampling period indicated that the specific profiles of D4 observed in fall/winter weeks and north of Saitama could be ascribed to northwestward air-mass advection. We employed a novel approach in estimating CMSs emission sources and source apportionment by using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The concentration matrix was divided successfully into two factors (emission sources) namely, personal care and household products and industrial activities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmosphere; Emission source apportionment; Non-negative matrix factorization; Persistent substances; Silicone; Volatile methylsiloxanes","Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric movements; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Inverse problems; Atmospheric environment; Atmospheric pollution; Distribution characteristics; Industrial activities; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Periodic fluctuations; Polystyrene divinyl benzenes; Prevailing wind directions; Matrix algebra; copolymer; cyclic methylsiloxane; dermatological agent; divinylbenzene; domestic chemical; linear methylsiloxane; methylsiloxane; organosilicon derivative; polystyrene; unclassified drug; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; organic compound; persistent organic pollutant; PPCP; seasonal variation; silicon; source apportionment; air pollution; air sampling; ambient air; Article; autumn; chemical structure; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); industrialization; Japan; non-negative matrix factorization; priority journal; rural area; seasonal variation; suburban area; trend study; urban area; wind; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091977176

To investigate this mode of foraging, some researchers use stable isotope analysis to detect these animals in populations and estimate their individual diets. In this study, we develop an integrative approach to measure the proportion of corn, a C4 plant, in the diets of free-ranging mammalian omnivores in C3-dominated ecosystems. We fed captive mice corn, C3 plants, and meat until carbon stable isotopes (δ13C) from each diet equilibrated in their hair. We then used carbon discrimination factors (Δ13C; offsets between stable isotope values of consumer tissues and their foods) for mice from these feeding trials and a simple carbon stable isotope mixing model to estimate the corn-based diets of free-ranging American black bears in Wisconsin and brown bears in Slovenia. We used Δ13C factors for mice to estimate the diets of bears because mouse models are used commonly to study mammalian diet and health, including humans and bears, and body mass has no effect on carbon discrimination factors in monogastric mammalian omnivores. In this study, we found that mice grew fastest, largest, and δ13C values equilibrated quickest in the hair of mice fed meat versus plant-based diets, suggesting protein quantity (quality was the same) has an effect on Δ13C. Evidence also suggests that Δ13C did not increase with animal growth rate as all mice grew throughout the 109-day feeding trials, but isotopic equilibration occurred early while mice still were subadults and was maintained throughout their adult lives. We also found that Δ13C was highest and most variable in the hair, serum, and liver, of mice fed a mixed diet of C3 plants, supporting our mixed diet hypothesis that states that Δ13C varies more among tissues of animals fed mixed diets than animals fed nonmixed diets because the former are composed of multiple foods, each with different macromolecular and isotopic compositions. Lastly, we found that corn may have been a more important component of bear diets in Wisconsin than previously thought (adults: x¯ = 29%; x¯ = 33%; subadults: x¯ = 22%; x¯ = 28%), and male brown bears may have fed on 50% more corn (x¯ = 47% versus 31%) in autumn during a year when beechnut availability was low. In a world that is rapidly changing, it is more important than ever to develop the appropriate quantitative tools to measure the impact people have on wildlife. Here, we provide such a tool for monogastric mammalian omnivores and encourage other researchers to do the same for other taxa of interest. © 2021 The Author(s).","Anthropogenic foods; black bears; brown bears; carbon stable isotopes; corn; IsotopeR; isotopic discrimination factors; isotopic turnover; mammalian omnivores; mixing models","ecological impact; maize; mammal; omnivory; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104945179

It is worth mentioning that no comprehensive study has been done so far on the overall change of LULC within the surrounding of Desa'a forest areas. This study aimed at analyzing the LULC changes and driving factors in Desa'a forest through Landsat images (i.e., 1973 (MSS), 1986 (TM), and 2015 (OLI)) and maximum likelihood supervised classification. Post classification pixel to pixel comparison was also performed to detect changes from year to year. Finally, focus group discussions were made to identify the LULC change drivers and support the computer-based classifications accuracy. Results demonstrated that both dense (54.11%) and open forest (28.48%) in 1973 covered almost 83% of the total forest area while only 17% was covered by grasslands (10%), farmland (3%), and bare land (4%). This is despite the fact that woody vegetation covered only 39% of the total forest reserve in 2015. During the study period, almost 54,000 ha of grasslands and open and dense forests have been converted to either bare land or farmland, of which 48,163 ha were previously open dense forests. Continuing with such a trend will lead to more severe deforestation and it is necessary to identify and modify the driving variables in Desa'a forest. The results also showed that fire, agricultural expansion, grazing and browsing effect, drought, extraction of wood, and lack of government attention are the major deforestation driver in Desa'a forest. The results of this study can provide a practical perspective for land use planners to manage LULC changes, reduce greenhouse gases, and enhance the biodiversity conservation in the region. In addition, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy-making decisions to protect and manage plans for Desa'a forest. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon balance; Change detection; Deforestation; Land use land cover; Remote sensing","annual variation; carbon balance; deforestation; forest management; land cover; land use change; Landsat; remote sensing; supervised classification; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094847557

However, the issue of social equity requires serious consideration to ensure their sustainability. We assessed performances in implementing a REDD+ project during its demonstration phase (2013–2018) in five villages in the northern mountainous region of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, inhabited by people of the predominant Khmu and Hmong ethnicities. The evaluation covered actual land-cover changes (revealed through satellite imagery) and social changes and income generation assessed through a questionnaire-based survey. Prior to the implementation of the REDD+ demonstration project, natural resources varied across the five villages, whose social characteristics were closely linked to these resources. After the project’s implementation, income generation varied significantly among the ethnic groups and across village types according to determined land allocation and each ethnic group’s characteristics relating to the adoption of new and alternative livelihoods. The results of a canonical discriminant analysis using explanatory variables indicated that 77.3% of the initially categorized respondents were correctly classified for the ethnic group variable, and 70.1% were correctly classified for the village types variable within the village cluster targeted in the project. The results showed that rural people who depend on natural resources vary in their capabilities to transition to alternative livelihoods. Traditional livelihoods and social conditions, entailing capabilities and functions for implementing alternative livelihoods were closely linked to land and forest management outcomes. Levels of performance in implementing activities aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation evidently differed among rural groups and villages. Moreover, our findings indicated that to avoid implementation difficulties and to keep equity, the village-level REDD+ should be informed by the specific features and capabilities of rural people within each village, thereby reducing the risk of unsustainable REDD+. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Capabilities and functions; Dependency on forest resources; Emission reduction; Participatory approach; Rural area","climate change; deforestation; discriminant analysis; emission control; environmental degradation; ethnicity; forest management; greenhouse gas; mitigation; mountain region; questionnaire survey; rural population; sustainability; Democratic Republic Congo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083208420

This framework, called “PSACONN Mining”, is based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), with data mining techniques. It was aimed to find envelope combinations that provide minimum thermal energy consumptions for each climate. Firstly, attribute reduction was applied for climatic parameters according to thermal energy consumptions in order to provide more consistent results by eliminating irrelevant attributes. Then, energy simulation models were generated by using a certain number of building envelope combinations, which consist of various building materials. Finally, an ANN model based on PSO and ACO (PSACONN) was used in order to determine the most suitable envelope combinations by utilizing the reduced climate attributes and related envelope combinations along with thermal energy consumptions obtained through the simulation. PSO and ACO algorithms were used in order to train the ANN structure more appropriately by generating more consistent weight and bias matrices. The framework was applied to a public building in the design phase. It was observed that feature reduction improved the correlation between climate characteristics and thermal energy consumption by values of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively.

In this sense, it is important to identify the concentration of sea ice in different regions of Antarctica in order to measure the impact of environmental changes on the region’s ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the multiple linear regression and Box–Jenkins methods for predicting the concentration of sea ice along the northwest coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Sea ice concentration data from May to November for the period 1979–2018 were extracted from passive remote sensors including a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer, special sensor microwave imager, and special sensor microwave imager/sounder. Meteorological variables from the atmospheric reanalysis model ERA5 of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were used as predictor variables, and the leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to calibrate and validate the models. It was found that both statistical models have similar performance when analyzing residual analysis results, root mean square error of cross-validation, and final accuracy and residual standard deviation, these responses being related to the regionalization of the study area and to the Box–Jenkins presents strong, homogeneous, and stable correlations in the time series modeled for each pixel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Box–Jenkins; ERA5; Multiple linear regression; Passive remote sensors; Time series","Linear regression; Mean square error; Microwave devices; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric reanalysis; European center for medium-range weather forecasts; Leave-one-out cross validations; Meteorological variables; Multiple linear regressions; Root mean square errors; Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer; Special sensor microwave imagers; Microwave sensors; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); performance assessment; regression analysis; sea ice; sensor; time series analysis; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctic Peninsula Bransfield Strait East; Antarctic Peninsula Bransfield Strait West; Antarctic Peninsula Drake Passage West; Antarctic Peninsula West; Arctic and Antarctic; Article; atmospheric moisture; Box Jenkin method; calibration; concentration (parameter); cross validation; cryosphere; environmental change; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; geopotential height; humidity; measurement accuracy; multiple linear regression analysis; remote sensing; sea ice; statistical analysis; statistical model; time series analysis; validation study; Antarctica; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; ice cover; statistical model; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Antarctic Regions; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Ice Cover; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100126576

The measurement campaign ran at Marylebone Road (roadside) and Honor Oak Park (background) urban monitoring sites over a 12-month period between 1 September 2019 and 31 August 2020. The measurement data were used to determine the traffic increment (roadside–background) and covered a range of meteorological conditions, seasons, and driving styles, as well as the influence of the COVID-19 “lockdown” on non-exhaust concentrations. Non-exhaust particulate matter (PM)10 concentrations were calculated using chemical tracer scaling factors for brake wear (barium), tyre wear (zinc), and resuspension (silicon) and as average vehicle fleet non-exhaust emission factors, using a CO2 “dilution approach”. The effect of lockdown, which saw a 32% reduction in traffic volume and a 15% increase in average speed on Marylebone Road, resulted in lower PM10 and PM2.5 traffic increments and brake wear concentrations but similar tyre and resuspension concentrations, confirming that factors that determine non-exhaust emissions are complex. Brake wear was found to be the highest average non-exhaust emission source. In addition, results indicate that non-exhaust emission factors were dependent upon speed and road surface wetness conditions. Further statistical analysis incorporating a wider variability in vehicle mix, speeds, and meteorological conditions, as well as advanced source apportionment of the PM measurement data, were undertaken to enhance our understanding of these important vehicle sources. © 2021 by the authors.

The main process yielding N2O under oxygen limited conditions is denitrification, which is the sequential reduction of nitrate/nitrite to N2O and/or N2. N2O reduction to N2 is impaired by pH &lt; 6 in classical model denitrifiers and many environments. Key microbes of peat circles are important but largely unknown catalysts for C- and N-cycling associated N2O fluxes. Thus, we hypothesized that the peat circle community includes hitherto unknown taxa and is essentially unable to efficiently perform complete denitrification, i.e., reduce N2O, due to a low in situ pH. 16S rRNA analysis indicated a diverse active community primarily composed of the bacterial class-level taxa Alphaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobiae, and Bacteroidia, as well as archaeal Nitrososphaeria. Euryarchaeota were not detected. 13C2- and 12C2-acetate supplemented anoxic microcosms with endogenous nitrate and acetylene at an in situ near pH of 4 were used to assess acetate dependent carbon flow, denitrification and N2O production. Initial nitrate and acetate were consumed within 6 and 11 days, respectively, and primarily converted to CO2 and N2, suggesting complete acetate fueled denitrification at acidic pH. Stable isotope probing coupled to 16S rRNA analysis via Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing identified acetate consuming key players of the family Burkholderiaceae during complete denitrification correlating with Rhodanobacter spp. The archaeal community consisted primarily of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea of Nitrososphaeraceae, and was stable during the incubation. The collective data indicate that peat circles (i) host acid-tolerant denitrifiers capable of complete denitrification at pH 4–5.5, (ii) other parameters like carbon availability rather than pH are possible reasons for high N2O emissions in situ, and (iii) Burkholderiaceae are responsive key acetate assimilators co-occurring with Rhodanobacter sp. during denitrification, suggesting both organisms being associated with acid-tolerant denitrification in peat circles. © Copyright © 2021 Hetz and Horn.","16S rRNA stable isotope probing; climatechange; isotope tracing; nitrous oxide; permafrost affected soils","acetylene; ammonia; carbon; carbon dioxide; diclofenac; glyphosate; ground water; hemicellulose; inulin; lignocellulose; nitrate; nitric oxide reductase; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; peat; rituximab; RNA 16S; stable isotope; acidification; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; ammonia oxidizing archaeon; arctic tundra; Article; bacterial growth; Bacteroidia; Betaproteobacteria; biodegradation; bioremediation; Burkholderiaceae; cyanobacterium; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; density gradient centrifugation; electron transport; Escherichia coli; Firmicutes; flow rate; gene amplification; gene sequence; high performance liquid chromatography; human; isotope tracing; marine environment; methanogenesis; microcosm; nonhuman; organismal interaction; permafrost; photosynthesis; Proteobacteria; spectrofluorometry; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101056289

We overexpressed PA28αβ, a proteasome activator with properties protective against aggregation and oxidative stress, and examined whether they are less prone to develop cataract arisen from aging and/or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. Another objective of this work was to compare the H2O2-induced cataracts of mouse lenses ex vivo to cataracts formed upon aging in mice. As part of an aging study of F2 hybrid C57BL/6NxBALB/c mice, ocular lenses of mature adult (7 months), middle-aged (15 months), and old (22 months of age) PA28αOE mice and their wildtype littermates (n = 22–44 lenses per group) were dissected and evaluated with regard to their cataractous state. In parallel, ocular lenses from 3 to 4 months old PA28αOE and wildtype C57BL/6 N littermates were treated with 100 μM H2O2 every 24 h for 7 days, with progression of cataract and physical appearance monitored daily. Lenses from both studies were also subjected to analysis of oxidative protein damage (carbonylation) and protein solubility. We found that overexpression of PA28αβ had no effect on neither age-related nor H2O2-induced cataract and conclude that overexpression of PA28αβ does not protect mice from developing cataract. The inefficiency of PA28αβ against cataract could be due to its anti-aggregation activity being already excessively present in the eye lens, exerted by crystallins. Crystallins are likely also constituting the 20–25 kDa proteins that were the dominant carbonyl targets in the eye lens irrespective of cataractous state. Assessment of H2O2-induced cataract in relation to age-related cataract demonstrated that high molecular weight protein carbonylation correlates to cataract both in vivo and ex vivo, while reduced protein solubility is more pronounced in age-related cataract. Furthermore, this work highlights vast dissimilarities in the physical manifestations of cataract upon aging and H2O2 ex vivo treatment. Age-related cataract initiation can take various forms, as a vague general blurriness or as a barely visible demarcated opacity, while H2O2-induced cataractogenesis seems to follow a specific scheme. In mice, this scheme begins with relatively opaque peripheral areas emerging that clear up later on as the lenses start to display a hat-like appearance. This transformation takes place synchronous to swelling of the eye lens, and is likely a result of osmotic disturbances causing a phase separation between the viscous lens cortex and the more solid fibers of the lens nucleus. © 2020 The Authors","Age-related cataract; H2O2-Induced cataract; Mice; Ocular lens; Proteasome activator PA28αβ","crystallin; hydrogen peroxide; pa28alphabeta protein; proteasome; unclassified drug; hydrogen peroxide; oxidizing agent; proteasome; Psme1 protein, mouse; Psme2 protein, mouse; adult; aged; aging; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blurred vision; C57BL 6 mouse; C57BL/6N mouse; carbonylation; cataractogenesis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; ex vivo study; gene overexpression; hybrid mouse strain; in vivo study; male; middle aged; molecular weight; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; physical appearance; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein carbonylation; senile cataract; solubility; wild type mouse; animal; Bagg albino mouse; C57BL mouse; cataract; chimera; disease model; drug effect; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; lens; metabolism; organ culture technique; pathology; physiology; Western blotting; Aging; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cataract; Chimera; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Organ Culture Techniques; Oxidants; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Protein Carbonylation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098190523

Despite positive biophysical results, low adoption rates have been the focus of studies identifying constraints to wider uptake. While the adoption framework is popular for measuring agricultural innovation, objective adoption measurements remain problematic and do not recognize the contextual and dynamic decision-making process. This study uses a technographic and participatory approach to move beyond the adoption framework and understand: (a) how agricultural decision-making takes place including the knowledge construction, (b) how agriculture is performed in a context of project intervention and (c) how practice adaptation plays out in the context of interacting knowledge. Findings confirm that farmer decision-making is dynamic, multidimensional and contextual. The common innovation diffusion model uses a theory of change, showcasing benefits through training lead farmers as community advocates and demonstration trials. Our study shows that the assumed model of technology transfer with reference to climate-smart agriculture interventions is not as linear and effective as assumed previously. We introduce four lenses that contribute to better understanding complex innovation dynamics: (a) social dynamics and information transfer, (b) contextual costs and benefits, (c) experience and risk aversion, and (d) practice adaptation. Investments should build on existing knowledge and farming systems including a focus on the dynamic decision process to support the 'scaling up, scaling out and scaling deep' agenda for sustainable agricultural innovations. © 2020 The Authors.

The results indicate that (1) the emission network is stable and there is a relationship of control between regions, (2) Central China is the most important region in agricultural GHG networks; however, the importance of the northwest and southwest has increased; the northeast has remained relatively independent, (3) influencers are mainly concentrated in the middle of the Yangtze River and the northwest, while dependentors are concentrated in municipalities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and the coastal regions in the southeast, and (4) the interprovincial agricultural GHG correlation can be enhanced by shortening the spatial distance, strengthening economic ties, and increasing the diffusion of technology.

Understanding both intracellular and extracellular ARGs has particular implications for the flux and fate of ARGs that are airborne via fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the ambient atmosphere to the human airway. In this study, we developed an operationally defined protocol for urban PM2.5 to quantify the abundance of ARGs occurring in free and phage-associated DNA, in addition to their counterparts commonly analyzed within bacterial cells. The results demonstrated that the extracellular fraction comprises a significant proportion of total ARGs in PM2.5, with subtype-specific dominance in either free or phage-associated DNA. A comparison between temperate and subtropical cities revealed geographical disparities of PM2.5-associated intracellular and extracellular ARGs due to the influences of regional meteorological factors and oxidative gases.

To deal with the increasingly serious air quality problem, Sichuan government agencies had made great efforts to formulate various control measures and policies during the past decade. In order to better understand the emission control progress in recent years and to guide further control policy formulation, the emission trends and source contribution characteristics of SO2, NOX, PM10 and PM2.5 from 2013 to 2017 were characterized by using emission factor approach in this study. The results indicated that SO2 emission decreased rapidly during 2013–2017 with total emission decreased by 52%. NOX emission decreased during 2013–2015 but started to increase slightly afterward. PM10 and PM2.5 emissions went down consistently during the study period, decreased by 26% and 25%, respectively. In summary, the contribution of power plants kept decreasing, while contribution of industrial combustion remained steady in the past 5 years. The contribution of industrial processes increased for SO2 emission, and decreased slightly for NOX, PM10 and PM2.5 emissions. The on-road mobile sources were the largest emission contributor for NOX, accounting for about 32–40%, and its contribution increased during 2013–2015 and then decreased. It was worth mentioning that nonroad mobile sources and natural gas fired boilers were becoming important NOX contributors in Sichuan. Fugitive dust were the key emission sources for PM10 and PM2.5, and the contribution kept increasing in the study period. Comparison results with other inventories, satellite data and ground observations indicated that emission trends developed in this research were relatively credible. © 2021 by the authors.

The reaction process and products of the performed carbothermal reduction are analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelec-tric spectroscopy (XPS) and enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity (HSC) thermodynamic software. According to the shapes of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks in XPS spectra, together with the XRD analyses, the reduction products of TiO, TiCxOy or TiC can be judged. The phase evolution mechanism involves FeTi2O5, Ti2O3, Fe, TiO, TiCxOy and TiC under enhancing the content of carbon. The phase evolution law can be written as FeTiO3 → FeTi2O5 → Ti2O3 + Fe → TiO + Fe → TiCxOy + Fe. Due to the incomplete reduction state of TiCxOy, the ΔGθ of TiCxOy is detected between TiC and TiO. TiCxOy could be attained under reduction conditions of Ti:C, 1:3 – 1:4 in argon atmosphere at 1550 °C after 2 h. Grinding, flotation and magnetic separation processes displayed that C, TiCxOy and Fe are not dissociated until the particle size of −38 μm. TiCxOy and Fe can be separated by an iron-bath in a high temperature. 95.56% TiCxOy can be obtained, and resistance of TiCxOy is less than 0.05 Ω. © 2021 by the authors.

Reasons are mostly unfavorable economic conditions for coal, including competition from natural gas and renewables in the power sector, as well as an aging coal-fired power plant fleet. Nevertheless, coal remains a major energy source in the North American energy markets. Supplementing EMF34 energy system analyses, we take a sectoral perspective to analyze coal's future role in this context. The U.S. Energy Information Administration as well as most models in EMF34 depict continuously high shares of coal-fired power generation over the next decades in their current policy scenarios. We contrast their results with coal sector modelling based on bottom-up data and recent market trends. We project considerably lower near-term coal use for power generation in the U.S. This has significant effects on regional coal production. Allowing new export terminals along the U.S. West Coast could ease cuts in U.S. production. Yet, exports are a highly uncertain strategy because the U.S. could be strongly affected by changes in global demand, for example from non-U.S. climate policy. © 2020 The Authors","Coal; EMF34; International coal trade; Numerical modeling; Scenarios; USA","Coal; Commerce; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas industry; Natural gas wells; Natural gasoline plants; Shale gas; Coal consumption; Coal production; Coal-fired power generation; Coal-fired power plant; Economic condition; Energy system analysis; Political support; U.s. energy information administrations; Coal industry; alternative energy; coal industry; energy market; export; numerical model; scenario analysis; shale gas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097753289

These storms present a significant challenge for forecasting because of their development in seemingly marginal environments. They often have been observed to intensify upon approaching the coast, with case studies and climatological analyses indicating that interactions with the sea breeze are key to this process. The relative importance of the additional lifting and vorticity along the sea-breeze front in comparison with the change to a cooler, moister air mass with stronger low-level shear behind the front has yet to be investigated. Here, the role of the sea-breeze air mass is isolated using idealized numerical simulations of storms developing in a horizontally homogeneous environment. The base-state substitution (BSS) modeling technique is utilized to introduce the sea-breeze air mass following initial storm development. Relative to a simulation without BSS, the storm is longer lived and more intense, ultimately developing supercell characteristics including increased updraft rotation, deviant motion to the left of the mean wind vector, and a strong reflectivity gradient on the inflow edge. Separately simulating the changes in the thermodynamic and wind fields reveals that the enhanced storm longevity and intensity are primarily due to the latter. The change in the low-level environmental winds slows gust-front propagation, allowing the storm to continue to ingest warm, potentially buoyant environmental air.

To quantitatively assess these uncertainties, two bidirectional air-surface exchange models for gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), originally developed by Wang et al. (2014, Atmos. Chem. Phys., doi:10.5194/acp-14-6273-2014) and Wright and Zhang (2015, J. Adv. Model. Earth Syst., doi:10.1002/2014MS000367), were compared quantitatively. The two models were applied to two vegetated land covers, including a deciduous broadleaf forest and a cropland, near a monitoring site in Georgia, USA for calculating air-surface exchange fluxes of Hg0. The model inputs include measured 2-hourly ambient Hg0 concentrations and archived surface meteorology data produced from a weather forecast model. The estimated annual net fluxes differed significantly between the two models, i.e., −0.7 μg m−2yr−1 by Wang et al.’s model vs. −8.6 μg m−2yr−1 by Wright &amp; Zhang's model over the deciduous broadleaf forest and 8.4 μg m−2yr−1 vs. −10.7 μg m−2yr−1 over the cropland. When considering dry deposition and emission fluxes separately, similar deposition fluxes were produced by the two models, regardless of season and land cover, due to the similar canopy resistance formulas used in the two models. Much higher soil and lower stomatal emission fluxes were produced by Wang et al.’s model than Wright &amp; Zhang's model (soil: 30 vs. 8.9 μg m−2yr−1 and stomata: 0.5 vs. 8.3 μg m−2yr−1, averaged over the two canopies) due to the very different emission potentials used in the two models. Cuticle emission fluxes contributed less than 0.1% to the total emission flux in Wang et al.’s model, and were not considered in Wright &amp; Zhang's model. The differences in soil emission flux, total emission flux, and net flux were more pronounced in winter than in the other seasons. The large differences in the net fluxes between the two models were primarily caused by their very different schemes of soil emission potential. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bidirectional air-surface exchange; Gaseous elemental mercury; Model intercomparison; Soil emission; Stomatal emission","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Forestry; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Air-surface exchanges; Atmospheric dry deposition; Atmospheric mercury; Chemical transport models; Emission potential; Gaseous elemental mercury; Monitoring network; Weather forecast models; Weather forecasting; mercury; organic carbon; water; air sampling; air-soil interaction; atmospheric modeling; chemical pollutant; comparative study; deciduous forest; dry deposition; land cover; mercury (element); pollution monitoring; soil emission; air; Article; autumn; canopy; compensation; controlled study; cropland; diffusion; environmental temperature; forest; land use; leaf area; meteorology; net flux; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil; spring; summer; temperature; weather; wind speed; winter; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097913748

Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alpine forests; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem carbon storage; Forest dynamics; Global meta-analysis; Treeline advance; Treeline migration","alpine environment; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; future prospect; meta-analysis; treeline; Indicator indicator",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100655823

Particularly, the ordered AuCu intermetallic catalyst achieves a high faradic efficiency of 75% with a partial current density of 78.3 mA cm-2 at -0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for producing CO in a flowing cell configuration. Moreover, the content of the generated syngas is widely controlled according to the potential-dependent CO2 reduction.

However, how the taxonomic composition and functional attributes of N-cycling-microbes within different soil particle-size fractions under a long-term fertilization treatment remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the composition and metabolic potential for urease activity, nitrification, N2O production and reduction of the microbial communities attached to different sized soil particles (2000–250, 250–53 and &lt;53 μm) using a functional gene microarray (GeoChip) and functional assays. We found that urease activity and nitrification were higher in &lt;53 μm fractions, whereas N2O production and reduction rates were greater in 2000–250 and 250–53 μm across different fertilizer regimes. The abundance of key N-cycling genes involved in anammox, ammonification, assimilatory and dissimilatory N reduction, denitrification, nitrification and N2-fixation detected by GeoChip increased as soil aggregate size decreased; and the particular key genes abundance (e.g., ureC, amoA, narG, nirS/K) and their corresponding activity were uncoupled. Aggregate fraction exerted significant impacts on N-cycling microbial taxonomic composition, which was significantly shaped by soil nutrition. Taken together, these findings indicate the important roles of soil aggregates in differentiating N-cycling metabolic potential and taxonomic composition, and provide empirical evidence that nitrogen metabolism potential and community are uncoupled due to aggregate heterogeneity. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; urease; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; microbial gene; microbiology; microflora; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; physiology; soil; Fertilizers; Genes, Microbial; Microbiota; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Urease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100053443

However, existing NDC commitments are inadequate to achieve this goal. Placing health as a key focus of the NDCs could present an opportunity to increase ambition and realise health co-benefits. We modelled scenarios to analyse the health co-benefits of NDCs for the year 2040 for nine representative countries (ie, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, the UK, and the USA) that were selected for their contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and their global or regional influence. Methods: Modelling the energy, food and agriculture, and transport sectors, and mortality related to risk factors of air pollution, diet, and physical activity, we analysed the health co-benefits of existing NDCs and related policies (ie, the current pathways scenario) for 2040 in nine countries around the world. We compared these health co-benefits with two alternative scenarios, one consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (ie, the sustainable pathways scenario), and one in line with the sustainable pathways scenario, but also placing health as a central focus of the policies (ie, the health in all climate policies scenario). Findings: Compared with the current pathways scenario, the sustainable pathways scenario resulted in an annual reduction of 1·18 million air pollution-related deaths, 5·86 million diet-related deaths, and 1·15 million deaths due to physical inactivity, across the nine countries, by 2040. Adopting the more ambitious health in all climate policies scenario would result in a further reduction of 462 000 annual deaths attributable to air pollution, 572 000 annual deaths attributable to diet, and 943 000 annual deaths attributable to physical inactivity. These benefits were attributable to the mitigation of direct greenhouse gas emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity. Interpretation: A greater consideration of health in the NDCs and climate change mitigation policies has the potential to yield considerable health benefits as well as achieve the “well below 2°C” commitment across a range of regional and economic contexts.

To discuss the concept of Planetary Health in the context of Europe, a conference entitled: “Europe That Protects: Safeguarding Our Planet, Safeguarding Our Health” was held in Helsinki in December 2019. The conference participants concluded with a need for action to support Planetary Health during the 2020s. The Helsinki Declaration emphasizes the urgency to act as scientific evidence shows that human activities are causing climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, overuse of natural resources and pollution. They threaten the health and safety of human kind. Global, regional, national, local and individual initiatives are called for and multidisciplinary and multisectorial actions and measures are needed. A framework for an action plan is suggested that can be modified for local needs. Accordingly, a shift from fragmented approaches to policy and practice towards systematic actions will promote human health and health of the planet. Systems thinking will feed into conserving nature and biodiversity, and into halting climate change. The Planetary Health paradigm ‒ the health of human civilization and the state of natural systems on which it depends ‒ must become the driver for all policies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Chemical pollution; Climate change; Nature; Planetary health; Urbanization","aging; air pollution; biodiversity; climate change; contamination; environmental protection; Europe; food; food security; health hazard; human; human activities; land use; medical ethics; multidisciplinary team; natural resource; Note; pollution; priority journal; safety; sustainable growth; urbanization; water pollution; wellbeing; astronomy; ecosystem; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Europe; Helsinki Declaration; Humans; Planets",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097769192

In many localities around the world, REDD+ and related interventions have been superimposed on, and overlap with, existing decentralized institutional arrangements such as community forests. These interventions often modify local institutions through new rules and practices that comply with mostly carbon-related objectives, prompting questions about the compatibility of a top-down mechanism such as REDD+ with the decentralized approaches of community forestry. Thus, we asked: are REDD+ interventions in community forests enhancing or detracting from communities’ abilities to practice adaptive management and governance—key desired components of local social-ecological resilience and the ability of communities to respond to disturbance and global change? We conducted a systematic review of studies examining REDD+ interventions in community forests. We extracted data on 59 case studies reported on in 43 articles, stemming from 14 countries, with two thirds of the cases located in two countries alone. Our meta-analysis found that REDD+ has had mixed impacts on communities’ social-ecological resilience. Increases in network ties, connectivity across scales, and increased participation in decision making are indicators of enhanced potential for local adaptability. However, we also see that, through restrictions on local forest practices, rigidity in rules, and communities’ natural capital being locked into carbon contracts, REDD+ has limited communities’ ability to manage for uncertainty. While not representative of all existing REDD+ projects, our results suggest important implications for REDD+ policymakers and forest-reliant communities engaging in REDD+. Reconciling REDD+ goals with the need for forest communities to retain adaptive capacity will be a challenge moving forward, particularly if REDD+ compromises the ability of forest-reliant communities to respond to unexpected shocks or their ability to adapt to changing environmental or economic conditions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Our study aimed to estimate land use change and its impact on net carbon emissions, as well as to formulate strategies for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change downstream of a National park. We analyzed land cover changes from satellite imagery and measured carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil (0 to 30 cm) pools. Satellite imagery of land cover in 1994, 2001, 2011 and 2017 showed a decrease in natural forest area and an increase in the area of shrubs, agroforestry, production forests and annual crop land. Net CO2 emission increased from 2.4 to 6.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Sand mining is the most destructive land use pattern in the area, as it leaves soil profiles stripped of their topsoil. Vulnerability to less reliable rainfall has been addressed by the common creation of small reservoirs and the abundant use of irrigation for vegetables growing under partial shade in the agroforestry zone. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Catchments; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Land use; Satellite imagery; Soils; Carbon emissions; Global climates; Land use pattern; Land-cover change; Land-use change; National parks; Natural forests; Small reservoirs; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102252520

Structural changes (globalization, neoliberalism, competition states, and global governance) have generated new opportunities for individuals to become extremely rich and to engage in politics across borders. The political agency of billionaires is being conceptualized in terms of capacities, goals, and power, which is contingent upon the specific political field a billionaire is trying to enter. Six case studies explore the power of billionaires in their pursuit of security, wealth, and esteem. The chapter on security analyzes Raj Rajaratnam’s relationship to the Tamil cause in Sri Lanka, and Sheldon Adelson’s transnational electioneering in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Regarding the economy, the book studies how the Koch brothers’ political protection of fossil fuels is affecting climate change mitigation, and how Rupert Murdoch’s opinion-shaping is valorizing conservatism across borders. The chapter on social entrepreneurship and esteem examines the role of Bill Gates in the governance of global health and George Soros’s attempts to build open societies as a ‘stateless statesman’. An analytical conclusion evaluates the prior findings in order to address three major questions: Is it more appropriate to see billionaires as ‘super-actors’, or as a global ‘super-class’? What is the relative power of billionaires within the international system? What does the power of billionaires mean for the liberal norms of legitimate political order?. © Peter Hägel 2020.","Agency; Billionaires; Individual actors; Inequality; International relations IR; Oligarchy; Plutocracy; Private authority; Private power; Transnational actors",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113099715

These models have had a major impact on context learning from text in many fields, e.g., health care, finance, manufacturing; however, there have been no empirical advances to date in electric mobility. Given the digital transformations in energy and transportation, there are growing opportunities for real-time analysis of critical energy infrastructure. A large, untapped source of EV mobility data is unstructured text generated by mobile app users reviewing charging stations. Using transformer-based deep learning, we present multilabel classification of charging station reviews with performance exceeding human experts in some cases. This paves the way for automatic discovery and real-time tracking of EV user experiences, which can inform local and regional policies to address climate change. © 2020 The AuthorsThe transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a driver of adverse health effects globally. Increasingly, government policies have promoted the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as a solution to mitigate GHG emissions. However, government analysts have failed to fully utilize consumer data in decisions related to charging infrastructure. This is because a large share of EV data is unstructured text, which presents challenges for data discovery. In this article, we deploy advances in transformer-based deep learning to discover topics of attention in a nationally representative sample of user reviews. We report classification accuracies greater than 91% (F1 scores of 0.83), outperforming previously leading algorithms in this domain. We describe applications of these deep learning models for public policy analysis and large-scale implementation. This capability can boost intelligence for the EV charging market, which is expected to grow to US$27.6 billion by 2027. © 2020 The AuthorsGovernment analysts and policy makers have failed to fully utilize consumer behavior data in decisions related to EV charging infrastructure.

Road traffic, rice straw open burning, and industry were the major anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 and its precursors in BMR in 2016. The EI results were used to prepare input data for 3D photochemical smog WRF-CAMx modeling with nested domains. WRF model satisfactorily reproduced meteorological data observed at 2 international airports. WRF-CAMx simulated PM2.5, gridded at 2x2 km, were evaluated against the available observed data at 3 monitoring sites in BMR which showed better agreement for longer averaging time (daily, monthly, and annual) than the hourly values. Hourly simulated PM2.5 could capture well the range of the observed values but not the temporal variations. The daily and monthly PM2.5 were satisfactorily simulated with all the statistical parameters of the performance evaluation meeting the suggested goals. The simulated weekly PM2.5 mass and compositions of sulfate and nitrate were also reasonably compared with the available observed data at a suburban site. Especially, a good agreement between the simulated annual PM2.5 and the observed, with relative errors of 8%–18%, justified the use of the simulated data for the health impact assessment. The health impact analysis using BenMAP-CE showed that reducing annual PM2.5 to meet the WHO guideline would help avoid 1,415 deaths (1,068 – 1,758) in BMR with 911 in Bangkok alone. Further reducing PM2.5 to the counterfactual concentration of 2.4 μg/m3 would help avoiding 2,990 PM2.5-attributable mortality in BMR with 1,770 in Bangkok alone.

We analyse the climate implications of different scenarios for forestry, bioenergy and wood construction. We consider three main forestry scenarios for Kronoberg County in Sweden, over a 201-year period. The Business-as-usual scenario mirrors today's forestry while in the Production scenario the forest productivity is increased by 40% through more intensive forestry. In the Set-aside scenario 50% of forest land is set-aside for conservation. The Production scenario results in less net carbon dioxide emissions and cumulative radiative forcing compared to the other scenarios, after an initial period of 30–35 years during which the Set-aside scenario has less emissions. In the end of the analysed period, the Production scenario yields strong emission reductions, about ten times greater than the initial reduction in the Set-aside scenario. Also, the Set-aside scenario has higher emissions than Business-as-usual after about 80 years. Increasing the harvest level of slash and stumps results in climate benefits, due to replacement of more fossil fuel. Greatest emission reduction is achieved when biomass replaces coal, and when modular timber buildings are used. In the long run, active forestry with high harvest and efficient utilisation of biomass for replacement of carbon-intensive non-wood products and fuels provides significant climate mitigation, in contrast to setting aside forest land to store more carbon in the forest and reduce the harvest of biomass. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy system; Forest management; Forest residues; Radiative forcing","Atmospheric radiation; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Concretes; Ecosystems; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Harvesting; Timber; Wood fuels; Wooden buildings; Wooden construction; Business-as-usual; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate mitigations; Emission reduction; Forest productivity; Intensive forestry; Radiative forcings; Wood construction; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092268715

In 2020, when the ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic spread across the world, it brought economic instability in its wake. Sectors of the built environment (BE), among others, were hit hard by a public health crisis followed swiftly by an unprecedented economic downturn. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the need for rapid and drastic action on climate change by 2030 to prevent the disastrous effects of a world warmed by more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, raising the urgency of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by Member States in 2015. Even rapid decarbonisation, the report warned, would likely not be sufficient to address the intertwined problems of poverty, mass migration, politics and ecological collapse that the SDGs seek to address. Digital technology offers an opportunity to better understand and model solutions to these complex crises, but it is unclear how digital technology should be harnessed in the face of an uncertain future. Written at the beginning of this critical decade leading up to 2030, this paper looks ahead 20 years in the future to better understand the resources, technology, economy, governance, infrastructure, mobility and social factors that may shape the development of Britain's digital BE. By exploring four scenarios around the variables of i) the UK's compliance with the interconnected targets of the SDGs and ii) the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population (dependency), this paper concludes with the identification of key strategies that can lead to the sustainable development of the BE sectors, outlining a number of actions that should be combined with the path for recovery from Covid-19 and are based on digital technology and a green information economy that ensures a future better for everyone in a digital built Britain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2040; Built environment; Future studies; Resilience; Scenario planning; Smart cities","Climate change; Planning; Public health; Built environment; Decarbonisation; Digital technologies; Economic downturn; Economic instability; Information economy; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Pre-industrial levels; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097714669

However, predicting EOS change with climate variation is still challenging, given that there are several environmental factors that can affect EOS apart from warming. In this study, EOS over the Northern Hemisphere (&gt;30°) was calculated by three different extracting methods using the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) records from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies third generation (GIMMS3g) during 1982 to 2015. We used partial correlation and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses to investigate the EOS variations in response to five global environmental change factors, including temperature, precipitation, insolation, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen (N) deposition. We found that about 58.5% (13.6% were significant) of the study area showed earlier EOS trends and 41.5% (10.3% were significant) with later EOS. Warming played a critical role in regulating EOS. The cumulative precipitation during the preseason had the greatest positive impact on EOS in arid/semiarid regions. Sufficient insolation could contribute to the delayed EOS over high latitudes. Compared with climatic factors, EOS also showed high sensitivity to changes in the atmospheric factors, and the dominant control of atmospheric CO2 and N deposition on EOS was found at 25–30% of the areas. Our results confirmed the dominant role of climatic factors in regulating EOS, but other global environmental cues, for instance, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition should also be included in the autumn phenological model to further understand the carbon and N cycles of terrestrial ecosystems with climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric change; Autumn phenology; Climate change; Normalize Difference Vegetation Index","Biology; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Deposition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Incident solar radiation; Least squares approximations; Nitrogen; Cumulative precipitation; End of growing seasons; Environmental factors; Global environmental change; Normalized difference vegetation index; Northern Hemispheres; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change; carbon cycle; dynamic response; environmental change; least squares method; NDVI; nitrogen cycle; Northern Hemisphere; phenology; semiarid region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097584664

In this study, contamination with OTC and Cu alone or in combination reduced the total nitrogen (TN) content of the fermentation products. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that the contribution of microorganisms to nitrogen metabolism changed significantly in different stages of fermentation. OTC and Cu affected the formation and utilization pattern of NO2−-N by microorganisms, which were mainly responsible for the reduced N2O emissions. In the presence of OTC and/or Cu, Myxococcus_stipitatus, Myxococcus_xanthus, and Gimesia_maris were evidently enriched at the end of fermentation, and their increased roles in the dissimilatory reduction of nitrite to ammonium were confirmed by network analysis. Ardenticatena_maritima was the main contributor to denitrification (NO3−-N to NO). Furthermore, organic matter (OM) was the most important factor responsible for driving the variation in nitrogen-transforming microorganisms and controlling denitrification. OTC affected the formation of OM, which can directly affect TN (λ = –0.37, p &lt; 0.001), and the adverse impact of Cu on nirK- and nifH-dominant microorganisms was validated (p &lt; 0.05). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural waste; Assimilation and dissimilation of nitrite reduction; Functional genes; Metagenomics; Nitrogen preservation","Agriculture; Copper; Denitrification; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Waste treatment; Aerobic fermentation; Characteristics and mechanisms; Fermentation products; Livestock wastes; Metagenomic analysis; Nitrogen metabolism; Oxytetracyclines (OTC); Utilization patterns; Fermentation; ammonia; copper; nitrogen; organic matter; oxytetracycline; copper; nitrite; ammonium; copper; denitrification; fermentation; genomics; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen; oxic conditions; oxytetracycline; aerobic fermentation; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; denitrification; DNA extraction; environmental parameters; metagenomics; microbial community; Myxococcus xanthus; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; process monitoring; water content; water treatment; fermentation; Myxococcus stipitatus; Myxococcus xanthus; Copper; Denitrification; Fermentation; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Oxytetracycline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090897509

Based on the ACE statistics of Jilin Province in China from 1998 to 2018, this article considers the sources of ACE in depth, and fourteen different carbon sources are selected to calculate ACE. Besides, the paper explores the variation characteristics of ACE in Jilin Province, their structure, and the relationship between the intensity and density of the dynamic changes in ACE in the province in terms of time. Finally, this paper uses the Kaya identity and logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to analyze the influential factors in ACE. The results show the following: (1) During 1998–2018, the amount of ACE in Jilin Province increased, with an average annual growth rate of 1.13%. However, the chain growth rate has been negative in recent years, which reflects that carbon emission reduction has been achieved to a certain extent. (2) The characteristics of ACE in Jilin Province during the years is that of the low-intensity, high density category. Furthermore, agricultural resource input is the main source of the planting industry’s carbon emissions. From the perspective of animal husbandry, the proportion of CH4 decreased, while the proportion of N2O is relatively stable. (3) Based on the LMDI decomposition model, production efficiency, industrial structure, and labor are the three main factors that reduce ACE in Jilin Province. The economic level is the main factor of ACE, and it will be the most important factor leading to an increase in ACE in the short term. On the basis of comprehensive analysis, this article puts forward reasonable suggestions in terms of policy improvement, production mode and industrial structure adjustment, technological innovation, and talent introduction. © 2021 by the authors.

Particulate matter is a key atmospheric pollutant that impacts millions of people. In particular, the high mass concentration of particulate matter reduces visibility, which has severely damaged the economy and endangered human lives. But the underlying chemical mechanisms and physical processes responsible for initiating haze and fog formation remain poorly understood. Here we present the measurement results of chemical composition of particulate matter in Delhi and Chennai. We find persistently high chloride in Delhi and episodically high chloride in Chennai. These measurements, combined with thermodynamic modelling, suggest that in the presence of excess ammonia in Delhi, high local emission of hydrochloric acid partitions into aerosol water. The highly water-absorbing and soluble chloride in the aqueous phase substantially enhances aerosol water uptake through co-condensation, which sustains particle growth, leading to haze and fog formation. We therefore suggest that the high local concentration of gas-phase hydrochloric acid, possibly emitted from plastic-contained waste burning and industry, causes some 50% of the reduced visibility. Our work implies that identifying and regulating gaseous hydrochloric acid emissions could be critical to improve visibility and human health in India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; aqueous solution; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; concentration (composition); incineration; particulate matter; water uptake; Chennai; Delhi; India; Tamil Nadu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099754352

Weak coupling to the environment leads to decoherence, which is traditionally modeled with a Lindblad equation for the system's density matrix. Starting from a pure state, such a system approaches a steady state (mixed or otherwise) in an underdamped or overdamped manner. This transition occurs at an eigenvalue degeneracy of a Lindblad superoperator, called an exceptional point (EP), where corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in creating exceptional points in a truly quantum domain, driven by the enhanced sensitivity and topological features EPs have shown in their classical realizations. Here, we present Floquet analysis of a prototypical qubit whose drive or dissipator strengths are varied periodically. We consider models with a single dissipator that generate global loss (phase damping) or mode-selective loss (spontaneous emission). In all cases, we find that periodic modulations lead to EP lines at small dissipator strengths and a rich EP structure in the parameter space. Our analytical and numerical results show that extending Lindblad Liouvillians to the Floquet domain is a potentially preferred route to accessing exceptional points in the transient dynamics towards the Lindblad steady state. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Quantum theory; Enhanced sensitivity; Exceptional points; Floquet analysis; Lindblad equations; Numerical results; Periodic modulation; Topological features; Transient dynamics; Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101821517

Various measures aimed at making these solutions highly performing in any climate context, in fact, have been developed in the last few years. However, their benefits have been evaluated and quantified almost uniquely with the aid of conventional tools, e.g. energy and environmental assessments. Therefore, in this work the most power thermodynamic tool for such a purpose, i.e. the advanced exergy analysis, was applied to the state-of-the-art transcritical R744 supermarket refrigeration systems for the first time ever. Three advanced solutions, namely R744 unit with parallel compression and a R744 system using parallel compression and overfed evaporators with and without two-phase ejectors, were selected in addition to two baselines, being conventional and improved basic R744 units. The investigation was based on the outdoor temperature of 40 °C and operating conditions derived from field measurements. The results obtained suggested that the conventional basic R744 unit features total irreversibilities of 194.49 kW and total unavoidable irreversibilities of 81.96 kW, whereas total irreversibilities and total unavoidable irreversibilities respectively amounted to 168.80 kW and 81.44 kW for the improved basic R744 system. As parallel compression was considered, potential reductions from 143.30 kW down to 67.20 kW, i.e. approximately 18% lower in comparison with the conventional basic unit and the improved basic system, were assed. The use of overfed evaporators was found to lead to potential decrements in total irreversibilities down to 63.79 kW, which were around 5% lower in comparison with parallel compression and 22% lower than with the conventional basic unit and the improved basic system. In addition, the outcomes associated with advanced exergy analysis implementation revealed the need to adopt two-phase ejectors as well as more efficient parallel compressors. The first measure would permit decreasing the total irreversibilities potentially from 115.04 kW down to 44.35 kW, resulting in decrement by about 46% compared to conventional and improved basic R744 systems, 34% in relation to the unit with parallel compressors and 30.5% over the solution with parallel compressors and overfed evaporators. Also, if 10% more efficient parallel compressors had been available, total irreversibilities, total unavoidable irreversibilities and total avoidable irreversibilities of the solution with two-phase ejectors would have been further reducible by 9.3%, 2.6% and 13.5%, respectively. It could be concluded that ejector-based transcritical R744 supermarket refrigeration systems possibly with high performing parallel compressors are capable of providing great thermodynamic performance at high sink temperatures. In addition, the vapour ejectors were found to be responsible for 22.9% of the total avoidable inefficiencies. These irreversibilities could be decremented by almost uniquely enhancing the performance of the ejectors themselves. However, unlike the results derived from conventional energy and environmental analyses, the outcomes of the advanced exergy methodology did not reveal a significant contribution on the part of the overfed evaporators to the thermodynamic performance enhancement of transcritical R744 supermarket refrigerating plants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced exergetic analysis; CO2; Exergy destruction; Overfed evaporator; Parallel compression; Two-phase ejector","Climate change; Compressors; Ejectors (pumps); Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Evaporators; Exergy; Retail stores; Climate change mitigation; Environmental analysis; Environmental assessment; Operating condition; Potential reduction; Refrigeration system; Supermarket refrigeration; Thermodynamic performance; Refrigeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098453448

The transition to organic farming of rice farms could represent a solution for environmental protection, as well as for their economic sustainability, consumer safety, and as a measure of climate mitigation. However, there are currently several weaknesses in the control and certification system. The objective of the current study was to propose advice for improving the control and certification scheme in the organic rice sector. The goal was achieved by adopting a qualitative methodology based on participant observation at stakeholder meetings and community-led workshops, and information collected in focus groups and deep interviews with relevant local actors. The findings show that there are some solutions to mitigate the weakness of the Italian certification scheme. The study also contributes to improving the Italian organic rice sector by highlighting that a revision of procedures and sanctions alone is not enough, and that an ethical and cultural change is also needed along the whole value chain. © 2021 by the authors.

We find thatψcan effectively describe the adsorption energies of the intermediates of CO2reduction such as *CO, *COOH, and *HCOO on BACs. Moreover, this descriptor provides a straightforward way to understand the local-environment effect of active centers and specify the different roles of M, X, and N dopants in adsorption and reaction.

Scholars of the past, how-ever, show that societies have dynamically and heterogeneously coped with climate variability and with recurrent and abrupt weather extremes. This research aims to explore climate adaptation in preindustrial societies taking into account different levels of social organisation. We argue that this multilevel perspective can enrich our understanding of the different strategies to cope with climate impacts in past societies. Archival research was carried out in the early modern villages of Terrassa and Sant Pere (Barcelona, Spain) to recon-struct the set of strategies to cope with recurrent droughts both at community and household levels. We found that peasant families developed a wider range of strategies than communities, but that many strategies used by households and communities overlapped, potentially generating a redundancy effect and fostering complex strategies operating through cross-level interactions. By studying past adaptation strategies with common taxonomies and detailed methodologies, our paper aims to improve interdisciplinary communication with research about the human dimensions of anthropogenic climate change. © 2019 The White Horse Press.","Adaptation; Climate change; Drought; Multilevel analysis; Preindustrial","adaptive management; climate change; complexity; extreme event; heterogeneity; industrialization; nature-society relations; research work; strategic approach; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Terrassa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099742554

Local and global economic and socio-cultural influence are also driving city redevelopment. This, fundamentally political, development highlights issues of who pays and who gains, who decides and how, and who/what is to be valued. Climate change adaptation has primarily been informed by science, but the adaptation discourse has widened to include the social sciences, subjecting adaptation practices to political analysis and critique. In this article, we critically discuss the just city concept in a climate adaptation context. We develop the just city concept by describing and discussing key theoretical themes in a politically and justice-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in cities. We illustrate our arguments by looking at recent case studies of climate change adaptation in three very different city contexts: Port Vila, Baltimore City, and Karlstad.

Most previous research on the ASL has focused on its variability with only a few studies attempting to understand why the climatological ASL exists. These studies have proposed different hypotheses to explain the presence of the ASL, however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of the ASL remains uncertain. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the ASL is a consequence of the interaction between Antarctic topography and the westerly wind jet, with negligible influence from low-latitude teleconnections. A nonrotating fluid flow simulation further suggests that the ASL can be explained by flow separation resulting from the interaction of westerly winds with the topography of Antarctica. © 2021.

Dynamic cylinder activation (DCA), a variant of CDA where the set of deactivated cylinders varies on a cycle-by-cycle basis, has been demonstrated to enable greater control over driveline torsional vibration while maintaining the fuel efficiency and thermal management benefits shown by fixed CDA via appropriate design of firing patterns. A model-based algorithmic approach to designing firing patterns during DCA – to control driveline torsional vibration in a user-defined frequency range, given firing density, engine speed, and maximum length of firing pattern – is described in this article. The described algorithm is generalizable to any engine configuration including different piston–cylinder layouts and number of cylinders. The algorithm is extended to design firing patterns for constrained DCA operation when CDA hardware is installed on a subset of cylinders of the engine. The resulting optimal firing patterns using the algorithm, for various combinations of inputs, are presented through an experimentally-validated simulation framework and discussed. It is demonstrated that the weighted phase-angle approach can accurately predict the frequencies and relative amplitudes of the vibration content, and, if theoretically possible, the proposed algorithm determines firing patterns that meet the specified requirements. The presented algorithm can be easily extended in future work for simultaneous selection of firing density and firing pattern during online, real-time implementation during both steady-state and transient operating conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cylinder deactivation (CDA); Drivetrain resonance; Dynamic cylinder activation (DCA); Firing frequency; Firing pattern design; Noise vibration and harshness (NVH); Phase angle diagrams; Torsional vibrations; Vibration control","Diesel engines; Efficiency; Elastic waves; Emission control; Machine vibrations; Real time control; Temperature control; Algorithmic approach; Diesel engine vibrations; Engine configuration; Model- based designs; Real-time implementations; Simulation framework; Steady state and transients; User-defined frequency; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096822232

The ideal gas law is inapplicable at such extreme conditions, and real fluid thermodynamic and transport properties are required to accurately model the combustion physics at supercritical conditions. The computational framework used in this study integrates real fluid property estimation into the steady-state, freely-propagating flame solver available in the Cantera combustion suite [Goodwin et al., 2017]. The Peng-Robinson equation of state provides closure for the thermodynamic terms in the governing equations. High-pressure thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity coefficients are obtained using the Chung and Takahashi correlations, respectively. A mixture-averaged mass diffusion model is assumed, while neglecting the Soret and Dufour effects. The reaction rate terms are modeled with the standard Arrhenius ideal gas kinetics model using the CH4–O2 mechanism from Lindstedt. The effects on laminar flame structure are presented. It is found that the choice of chemical mechanism has a much greater influence on mass burning rates than the real fluid effects. Real fluid properties produce lower mass burning rates by just ∼10% near the critical region, while the laminar flame speeds are reduced by a factor of ∼5. It is shown that using dilute gas transport properties in combination with a real fluid equation of state and differential diffusion effects may cause a qualitatively different, non-monotonic density profile in the flame. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Methane-oxygen; Peng-Robinson; Premixed flames; Real gas; Supercritical","Diffusion in liquids; Diffusion in solids; Equations of state of gases; Gases; Reaction kinetics; Rockets; Thermal conductivity; Computational framework; Computational investigation; Differential diffusion effect; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Real-fluid properties; Soret and Dufour effects; Supercritical condition; Thermodynamic and transport properties; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093693547

Mitigation approaches for reducing emissions are difficult to evaluate at appropriate field scales because of the substantial effort and expense associated with relatively new technology allowing eddy covariance measurements of N2O fluxes (FN2O). Here we present a new approach for gap filling eddy covariance FN2O and estimating annual uncertainties for a temperate grazed grassland. We tested the potential of using one flux tower to evaluate emissions mitigation options in one paddock relative to an adjacent, unchanged paddock by partitioning data by source footprint contribution. Because of the complexity of spatiotemporal controls on FN2O, we generated a large set of environmental variables and features as input for machine learning algorithms. Inputs were transformed using partial least squares (PLS) decomposition, isolating features with the greatest influence on FN2O. PLS scores were fed to both a neural network (NN) and a locally-weighted k-nearest neighbours (kNN) regression. While the NN and kNN preformed similarly well, kNN regression accounted for the largest proportion of variance (52-72%) and resulted in the lowest bias for each of the three source footprint areas (full footprint and two separated adjacent paddocks, P53 and P54). Annual uncertainty estimates included random measurement uncertainty, accuracy and precision of the gap filling approach, and uncertainty associated with choice of threshold for atmospheric turbulence filtering and footprint contributions. Total N2O emissions for the full footprint, P53, and P54 were 7.4 ±0.35, 7.7 ±0.80, and 6.4 ±0.63 kg N2O-N ha−1, respectively in Year 1, and 6.9 ±0.33, 7.3 ±0.63, and 6.7 ±0.63 kg N2O-N ha−1, respectively in Year 2. These 95% confidence intervals on the annual FN2O suggest that we could detect differences of 10-15% between paddocks at this site when testing mitigation options. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"eddy covariance; grazing; greenhouse gas; machine learning; nitrous oxide; precision; soil emission; spatiotemporal analysis; turbulence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097458360

Fragrance emissions have been associated with adverse health effects such as asthma attacks and breathing difficulties. Further, fragrance terpenes are primary indoor air pollutants that can react with other compounds and contribute to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. This paper examines volatile emissions and exposures from fragranced laundry products, and the implications for air quality and health. The paper synthesizes and analyzes data from studies conducted across the United States (US) and Australia (AU), providing results in three main themes: adverse health effects associated with exposure to fragranced laundry products, volatile emissions from fragranced and fragrance-free laundry products, and reductions in VOC emissions by switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products. Across the US and AU, 12.5% and 6.1% of the general population and 28.9% and 12.1% of asthmatics report health problems (respectively) when exposed to scented laundry products coming from a dryer vent. Among the volatile emissions from products, terpenes were the most prevalent VOCs detected in all fragranced laundry products; however, terpenes were absent in all fragrance-free products. By switching from fragranced to fragrance-free laundry products, dryer vent emissions of limonene can be reduced up to 99.7%. As context for significance, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free laundry detergent could reduce limonene emissions from dryer vents per household by an estimated 1.68 g/year. For the study area of metropolitan Melbourne, this represents a reduction in limonene emissions by an estimated 1.58 tons/year. Results from these analyses point to a promising way to reduce emissions and exposures to volatile compounds, and create potential improvements for air quality and health. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Dryer vents; Fragranced consumer products; Health effects; Indoor air quality; Laundry products; Outdoor air quality; Terpenes; Volatile organic compounds","air quality; asthma; emission; metropolitan area; pollution exposure; public health; volatile organic compound; Australia; Melbourne; United States; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090765184

Colombia has the fourth largest cattle herd in Latin America, and DPS account for 39% of the cattle population, and 58% of national milk production. Therefore, focusing on reducing the carbon footprint (CF) of DPS can have a huge contribution on mitigating the environmental impacts of the cattle farming sector. The present study aimed to estimate, based on a farm gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, the environmental impact of 1313 dual-purpose farms in Colombia. The study also aimed at identifying the main hotspots of negative environmental impacts and proposing possible mitigation options and their cost-effectiveness. The impact categories such as CF, non-renewable energy use, and land use were estimated using the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC, databases, and locally estimated emission factors. Three methods of allocating environmental burdens to meat and milk products were applied. A principal component multivariate analysis (PCA) and a Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) were performed. The largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) in dual-purpose cattle systems comes directly from enteric fermentation, and manure deposited on pasture. The proportion of environmental burdens allocated to meat differed, with the economic method assigning the greater burden (36%), followed by energy content (30%) and mass production (13%). Four farms clusters and two production strategies were identified, a more intensive strategy with high proportion of improved pastures and higher fertilizer application rates (Clusters 1 and 2), and a more extensive with low input of fertilizers and grazing on natural pastures (Clusters 3 and 4). The CF values ranged between 2.1 and 4.2 CO2-eq per kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and between 9.0 and 18.3 CO2-eq per kg meat among clusters. CF, land use, and non-renewable energy use were lowest for clusters 1 and 3. Concerning cost-effectiveness, the adoption of improved pastures is a negative-cost measure and a promising climate change mitigation option. Overall, the CF could be reduced by around 25 to 48% for milk and meat. Therefore, our results suggest that it is possible to reduce GHG emissions by adopting improved pastures, better agricultural management practices, efficient fertilizer usage, and using the optimal stocking rate. It is expected that these reductions can be achieved with at negative costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Colombian cattle systems; Environmental impact; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Livestock production systems; Mitigation","fat; fertilizer; protein; agricultural management; animal experiment; animal husbandry; Article; carbon footprint; cattle farming; cattle manure; climate change; Colombia; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; dairy cattle; dairy product; economic aspect; environmental impact; female; fermentation; greenhouse gas; land use; life cycle assessment; male; milk production; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; pasture; principal component analysis; priority journal; renewable energy; South and Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096169164

The aim of the application is to improve the coordination and information exchange mechanisms between the existing systems of ports and ships during piloting ordering process to ensure their effective interoperability, giving a better understanding of the impact of digitalization on the sustainability of seaports and maritime transport. To implement this concept, a system of step‐by‐step actions was developed, including determining the current situation, developing a business model and business logic for implementing an appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) solution, analysing the local government structure, analysing intermodal information exchange between stakeholders, developing and testing a new ICT tool. The ports of Rauma, Finland, and Gävle, Sweden, were used as pilot ports. As a result of the study, the main bottlenecks in the process of information exchange in ordering pilotage were identified. An improved business model and business logic, that allows the rational use of resources and reduces CO2 emission and the pressure on the environment, was developed. The testbed was conducted in an environment of real port operations. Currently, the open access source code is available for use for maritime cluster actors. © 2021 by the authors.

An alternative approach overcoming these technical challenges is analyzed in this paper. It is based on conducting the gasification of biomass with steam in a fluidized bed using solid particles that are separately heated in a solid particle receiver using concentrating solar energy. The present study includes the thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of solar steam gasification in a completely allothermal single fluidized bed gasifier as well as in a partially allothermal dual fluidized bed gasification system.

In order to achieve this, it is necessary to understand how manufacturing systems use energy directly and indirectly. These types of analyses have been carried out at the process level for traditional machining processes, as well as at the factory level to understand macroenergy flows and bottlenecks. Other researchers have accomplished considerable energy optimization work for laser processing. However, the emphasis of this work has been on the optimization of the laser-material interaction. This focus has overlooked the whole system viewpoint and the significance of supporting equipment. Laser welding, using a 300 W fiber laser, was chosen as the subject for this study; first, due to its ubiquity in many high-value manufacturing industries and second due to its potential as a gateway into other manufacturing processes, such as directed energy deposition and additive manufacturing. In this paper, the initial work was to produce a framework for categorizing the process states and subsystems found in a standard or generic laser machine tool. An electrical energy meter was used to measure the energy consumption for individual subsystems when creating autogenous weld tracks in 316L stainless steel. Analysis of these data showed that the laser is only 18% of the total power consumption, the most significant being the water-cooling subsystem (37%). Reported here is a complete analysis of laser welding energy efficiency at a system level. This primary analysis of current equipment typical energy consumption can be used to identify future strategies for energy efficiency improvements beyond the direct laser interaction. By focusing on the most energy-inefficient parts of the system, the greatest potential for improvements to the carbon footprint of laser processing can be quantified. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fiber lasers; Machine tools; Machining; Welding; 316 L stainless steel; Electrical energy; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy optimization; High value manufacturing; Laser-material interactions; Manufacturing process; Total power consumption; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099520882

At steady state similar chain growth probabilities of about 0.4 according to the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution were observed for alcohols, hydrocarbons and olefins indicating common intermediates. Alkanes were found to be formed consecutively from primarily formed olefins. The observed decrease of the selectivities to alcohols with increasing CO conversion at higher temperatures and higher residence times is ascribed to an increased availability of adsorbed atomic hydrogen, which decreases the saturated coverage of CO-derived CxHyOz species favoring hydrocarbon formation. Correspondingly, reaction orders of 0 and 0.8 for CO and H2, respectively, were derived based on a power-law approach including an apparent activation energy of 140 kJ mol−1. A reaction network based on the CO insertion factor was established, in which the competing reactions β-hydrogen elimination, chain growth and CO insertion proceed from common adsorbed CxHy intermediates. Selective higher alcohol formation was favored at low temperatures and short residence times, high pressures and a moderate H2:CO ratio of 1 requiring a compromise between conversion and selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bulk Co-Cu catalyst; Chain growth; CO insertion; Higher alcohol synthesis; Reaction network; Steady-state kinetics","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Catalysts; Hydrogen; Olefins; Reaction intermediates; Residence time distribution; Anderson-Schulz-Flory distributions; Apparent activation energy; Complex reactions; Cu-based catalyst; Higher alcohol synthesis; Hydrocarbon formation; Hydrogen elimination; Steady-state kinetics; Reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096146746

The strategy we propose takes advantage of the metastable nanoscale atomic arrangement of highly disordered and amorphous materials, to overcome the limits of the typical transition metal dichalcogenide crystalline catalysts. For the H2 evolution reaction, going beyond the creation of point defects in crystalline structures in favor of fully amorphous organizations not only increases the per-site activity and active surface area but also improves the conductivity and the reaction kinetics. In addition, the incorporation of nanoscale disorder promotes the formation of complex products in CO2 reduction through reaction pathways inaccessible on other sites.

At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented. At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS. Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptation and mitigation to climate change; Cumulative effect assessment; Ecosystem-based management; Multiple stressors; Spatially explicit assessment; Systematic review","Ecosystems; Fisheries; Sea level; Artisanal fisheries; Biological organization; Cumulative effects; Ecological response; Ecosystem-based management; Environmental conditions; Management measures; Spatial interaction; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem management; environmental conditions; environmental stress; literature review; marine ecosystem; marine environment; climate change; fishery; human; introduced species; marine environment; nonhuman; review; sea level rise; sediment; systematic review; ecosystem; temperature; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Humans; Introduced Species; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092086172

Such communities are often dominated by species of the genus Cladonia, which are very variable in morphology, reproduction strategies, and secondary metabolites. In this work, we investigated traits-environment relationships considering vegetation dynamics, substrate pH, disturbance, and climate. A total of 122 plots were surveyed in 41 acidic dry grasslands in the western Po Plain (Northern Italy). Relationships between Cladonia traits and environmental variables were investigated by means of a model-based Fourth Corner Analysis. Thallus morphology and metabolites responded to vegetation dynamics, substrate pH, disturbance, and climate, whereas reproduction strategies responded only to vegetation dynamics. Traits’ correlations with vegetation dynamics elucidate their colonization patterns in open dry habitats or suggest biotic interactions with bryo-phytes and vascular plants. In addition, correlations between metabolites and environmental factors support interpretations of their ecological roles. Our results also stress the importance of studying traits’ relationships with climatic factors as an alert towards lichen reactions to climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Eighteen LCA studies were reviewed which included assessments of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), flow-through systems, net cages, and pond systems. This review considered the potential to mitigate environmental burdens with a movement from extensive to intensive aquaculture systems. Due to the diversity in study results, specific processes (feed, energy, and infrastructure) and specific impact categories (land use, water use, and eutrophication potential) were analyzed in-depth. The comparative analysis indicated there was a possible shift from local to global impacts with a progression from extensive to intensive systems, if mitigation strategies were not performed. The shift was partially due to increased electricity requirements but also varied with electricity source. The impacts from infrastructure were less than 13 % of the environmental impact and considered negligible. For feed, the environmental impacts were typically more dependent on feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the type of system. Feed also contributed to over 50 % of the impacts on land use, second only to energy carriers. The analysis of water use indicated intensive recirculating systems efficiently reduce water use as compared to extensive systems; however, at present, studies have only considered direct water use and future work is required that incorporates indirect and consumptive water use. Alternative aquaculture systems that can improve the total nutrient uptake and production yield per material and energy based input, thereby reducing the overall emissions per unit of feed, should be further investigated to optimize the overall of aquaculture systems, considering both global and local environmental impacts. While LCA can be a valuable tool to evaluate trade-offs in system designs, the results are often location and species specific. Therefore, it is critical to consider both of these criteria in conjunction with LCA results when developing aquaculture systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impacts; Extensive aquaculture; Intensive aquaculture; Life cycle assessment; RAS","Aquaculture; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Land use; Nutrients; Comparative analysis; Environmental burdens; Eutrophication potentials; Feed conversion ratios; Intensive aquacultures; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Recirculating aquaculture system; Recirculating system; Life cycle; aquaculture; comparative study; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; literature review; recirculating system; water use",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096351737

Therefore, the capability of estimating PM2.5 concentrations at high spatiotemporal resolutions, particularly in places with no ground stations, would be invaluable. Although several studies have involved the estimation of PM2.5, few have estimated PM2.5 concentrations at high spatial resolutions. In this study, we leverage the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate daily 1-km PM2.5 concentrations over Texas from 2014 to 2018. For this purpose, we use collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To address the different sources and speciation of PM2.5 over Texas, we use several important control parameters. As a result, the accuracy of RF remains consistent throughout the study area. After estimating ground-level PM2.5 levels, we apply a ten-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.83–0.90 and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.47–1.77 μg/m3. Our results show that RF is highly capable of estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. In addition to the RF model, we also compare the capability of commonly used models, including multiple linear regression (MLR) and mixed effects model (MEM), for estimating the PM2.5 concentrations of global regions. Results indicate that RF, compared to the other models, has the highest accuracy, MEM the second-highest, and MLR the third. We also leverage the USEPA Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) to estimate the impact of changes in PM2.5 levels on the number of respiratory-related premature mortalities in Texas in 2014–2018. Considering 2014 as the baseline year, the BenMAP analyses reveal that PM2.5 reductions could have prevented a large number of premature mortalities, particularly among adults aged 25–99, from 2014 to 2018 in Texas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BenMAP; High-resolution PM2.5; Machine learning; MODIS AOD; Remote sensing; Texas","Decision trees; Linear regression; Machine learning; Atmospheric constituents; Correlation coefficient; High spatial resolution; Machine learning approaches; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Multiple linear regressions; Spatio-temporal resolution; Radiometers; concentration (composition); estimation method; ground-based measurement; machine learning; MODIS; mortality; optical depth; particulate matter; pollution effect; respiratory disease; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; adult; aerosol; aged; article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross validation; human; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; premature mortality; random forest; remote sensing; species differentiation; Texas; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099621855

Different reactive nitrogen species (NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3−, and N2O) are set free by a large variety of anthropogenic activities and cause numerous negative impacts on the environment. The complex nature of the nitrogen cycle hampers public awareness of the nitrogen problem. To overcome this issue and to enhance the sensitivity for policy action, we developed a new, impact-based integrated national target for nitrogen (INTN) for Germany. It is based on six impact indicators, for which we derived the maximum amount of nitrogen losses allowed in each environmental sector to reach related state indicators on a spatial average for Germany. The resulting target sets a limit of nitrogen emissions in Germany of 1053 Gg N yr−1. It could serve as a similar means on the national level as the planetary boundary for reactive nitrogen or the 1.5◦C target of the climate community on the global level. Taking related uncertainties into account, the resulting integrated nitrogen target of 1053 Gg N yr−1 suggests a comprehensible INTN of 1000 Gg N yr−1 for Germany. Compared to the current situation, the overall annual loss of reactive nitrogen in Germany would have to be reduced by approximately one-third. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper presents the results derived from a new micrometeorological model that employs an integrated biometeorology module to model Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). This is PALM-4U, which includes an integrated human body-shape parameterization, deployed herein for a pilot domain in Prague, Czech Republic. The results highlight the key role of radiation in the spatiotemporal variability of thermal exposure in moderate-climate urban areas during summer days in terms of the way in which this directly affects thermal comfort through radiant temperature and indirectly through the complexity of turbulence in street canyons. The model simulations suggest that the highest thermal exposure may be expected within street canyons near the irradiated north sides of east–west streets and near streets oriented north–south. Heat exposure in streets increases in proximity to buildings with reflective paints. The lowest heat exposure during the day may be anticipated in tree-shaded courtyards. The cooling effect of trees may range from 4 °C to 9 °C in UTCI, and the cooling effect of grass in comparison with artificial paved surfaces in open public places may be from 2 °C to 5 °C UTCI. In general terms, this study illustrates that the PALM modelling system provides a new perspective on the spatiotemporal differentiation of thermal exposure at the pedestrian level; it may therefore contribute to more climate-sensitive urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

This process has important consequences for the global climate. While global change factors, such as increased temperature, are known to affect bacterial- and fungal-mediated decomposition rates, the role of trophic interactions in affecting decomposition remains largely unknown. We designed synthetic microbial communities consisting of eight bacterial and eight fungal species and tested the influence of predation by a model protist, Physarum polycephalum, on litter breakdown at 17 and 21 °C. Protists increased CO2 release and litter mass loss by ~35% at 17 °C lower temperatures, while they only had minor effects on microbial-driven CO2 release and mass loss at 21 °C. We found species-specific differences in predator–prey interactions, which may affect microbial community composition and functioning and thus underlie the impact of protists on litter breakdown. Our findings suggest that microbial predation by fast-growing protists is of under-appreciated functional importance, as it affects decomposition and, as such, may influence global carbon dynamics. Our results indicate that we need to better understand the role of trophic interactions within the microbiome in controlling decomposition processes and carbon cycling. © 2020, International Society for Microbial Ecology.",,"bacterium; bioremediation; carbon cycle; catalyst; fungus; leaf litter; microbial community; protist; temperature profile; Bacteria (microorganisms); Physarum polycephalum; Protista; carbon; animal; carbon cycle; ecosystem; fungus; microbiology; soil; temperature; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Fungi; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091766058

Objectives: Our goal is to determine the primary abiotic controlling factor(s) on shrub canopy structure using a dataset of approximately 23 million individual shrubs, generated using remote sensing and ground-truthing by Young et al. (in Remote Sens 9(5):16, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs9050458, 2017). We posit that landscape position and local-scale geomorphic features in a desert alluvial fan environment will influence canopy volume and shrub spacing of creosote bush Larrea tridentata. Methods: We relate selected characteristics (canopy volume and spatial distribution) of identified L. tridentata to aspect and surface geomorphology at each shrub location. Statistical analyses included K-S testing, distribution fitting, and several generalized linear models (GLMs). The study was located in Eldorado Valley, Nevada, USA. Results: Aspect and surface age have demonstrable influences on both shrub canopy volume and shrub spacing for all 5 geomorphic surfaces studied, with the highest median canopy volumes on east-facing surface (0.758 m3) almost 5 × larger than the lowest median volumes (0.152 m3) on the WNW-facing surfaces; variability in shrub volume was also higher on east-facing than west-facing surfaces. Shrub spacing on alluvial flat and fan skirt surfaces (2.418 and 2.333 m, respectively) were larger than older alluvial fan, fan piedmont and fan remnant surfaces (1.776, 1.837 and 1.892 m, respectively). Conclusions: Results show a significant relationship between shrub spacing and canopy volume by aspect and geomorphic surface, indicating a threshold at which biotic effects on canopy structure from intra-species competition transition to abiotic effects governed by geomorphic and climatological factors. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Geomorphology; Larrea tridentata; Mojave Desert; Shrub characteristics; Soil structure","abiotic factor; alluvial fan; creosote; geomorphology; intraspecific competition; landscape ecology; remote sensing; shrub; spatial distribution; Mojave Desert; Nevada; United States; Larrea tridentata; Tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095997768

Here, we use outputs from 15 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate projected changes in precipitation extremes for SEA at the end of the 21st century. The results suggest that CMIP6 multi-model ensemble medians show better performances in characterizing precipitation extremes than individual models. Projected changes in precipitation extremes linked to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (represented by the latest proposed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) increase significantly over the Indochina Peninsula and the Maritime Continent. Substantial changes in the number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm) and the intensity of daily precipitation (SDII) indicate that such locally heavy rainfall is likely to occur over a short time and that more precipitation extremes over SEA are probable in a warmer future. This is consistent with projections from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment and CMIP5 models. The present study reveals the high sensitivity of the precipitation extremes over SEA, and highlights the importance of constrained anthropogenic GHG emissions in an ambitious mitigation scenario. © 2021 The Author(s).

The experiments varied different cumulus, microphysics and planetary boundary layer parameterization schemes. Rainfall characteristics over three climatic zones, Guinea Coast, Savannah and Sahel, was analyzed. The potential change associated with global warming is assessed by the pseudo global warming (PGW) downscaling method. Multiple PGW runs were conducted using climate perturbation from the 40-member ensemble of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) coupled with Community Atmospheric Model version 5.2 (CAM5.2) component large ensemble project. The model output was compared with TRMM and GPCP rainfall and atmospheric parameters from ECMWF reanalysis datasets. Results show that the rainfall amount in the 2070s estimated from the PGW runs substantially increases, especially in the eastern Sahel due to enhanced moisture convergence, compared to the current climate. The percentage change in simulated total rainfall amount can increase or decrease by 50% in the PGW runs and the theoretical rainfall computed based on Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Also, found is an increase (decrease) in heavy (both light and moderate) rainfall amount. These results, however, depend on the GCM used as the boundary conditions of the RCM. This suggests that the 4 o C change in average surface temperature derived from the 40-member ensemble model strongly influenced the increased rainfall simulated by the PGW experiments. Thus, highlighting the advantage of using the PGW technique to estimate the likely difference between present and future climate with reduced large-scale model biases and computational resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Community earth system model; Guinea Coast; Pseudo global warming; Rainfall; Sahel; Savannah; Temperature; Weather Research and Forecasting model","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Global warming; Rain; Rain gages; Atmospheric parameters; Clausius Clapeyron relation; Community atmospheric model; Computational resources; Parameterization schemes; Planetary boundary layers; Pseudo-global warming methods; Rainfall characteristics; Climate models; air temperature; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; global warming; monsoon; rainfall; savanna; TRMM; weather forecasting; Guinea; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096691644

Model errors (model posterior—observed CO2 dry air mole fractions) were categorized by region (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South), frontal sector (warm or cold), and transport model (predominantly Tracer Model 5 (TM5) and Goddard Earth Observing System—Chemistry [GEOS-Chem]). All inversions assimilated the same CO2 observations. Overall, the median inversion profiles reproduce the general structures of the observations (enhanced/depleted low-level CO2 in warm/cold sectors), but 1) they underestimate the magnitude of the warm/cold sector mole fraction difference, and 2) the spread among individual inversions can be quite large (&gt;5 ppm). Uniquely in the Mid-Atlantic, inversion biases segregated according to atmospheric transport model, where TM5 inversions biases were −3 to −4 ppm in warm sectors, while those of GEOS-Chem were +2 to +3 ppm in cold sectors. The large spread among the mean posterior CO2 profiles is not explained by the different atmospheric transport models. These results show that the inversion systems themselves are the dominant cause of this spread, and that the aircraft campaign data are clearly able to identify these large biases. Future controlled experiments should identify which inversions best reproduce mid-latitude CO2 mole fractions, and how inversion system components are linked to system performance. © 2021.

However, recent studies suggest that the Ediacaran oceanic redox conditions were spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic. In this study, we report high-resolution pyrite S-isotope data (δ34Spy) for a continuous Ediacaran drill core that was deposited in a very shallow setting from the Yangtze platform, South China. Combined with petrographic observations, statistics of pyrite framboid diameters, total carbon (TC), total sulfur (TS), trace element, and published data, we attempt to characterize the details of sulfur cycle as well as oceanic redox change in the shallow-water regions of the Yangtze platform during the Ediacaran. The δ34Spy profile exhibits a large amplitude of variation, ranging from –13.7‰ to 41.4‰ throughout the drill core. Both global and regional changes in environment could have exerted effects on δ34Spy values. For the Doushantuo Formation, distinct δ34Spy records from shelf to basin may reflect spatial heterogeneity in sulfate concentrations, depositional environments, and availability of organic matter. Notably, periods of upwelling may cause oxygen-deficient zones within shallow water column and facilitate persistent burial of organic matter and pyrite in shelf regions. Subsequent exposure and weathering of these reduced carbon and sulfur may contribute to the “Shuram-Wonoka” event. The prevalence of high δ34Spy values in the terminal Ediacaran (Dengying Formation) likely indicates an enhanced pyrite burial flux at a global scale, during which extensive marine anoxia might take place. In addition, enrichments of V and U in three shale intervals of the drill core support periods of oxygenation for the Ediacaran oceans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ediacaran; Shuram Excursion; Sulfur isotopes; Trace elements; Yangtze platform","chemostratigraphy; concentration (composition); Ediacaran; marine environment; paleoceanography; reconstruction; redox conditions; shallow water; sulfur cycle; sulfur isotope; trace element; China; Yangtze Platform; Metazoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097792203

Notwithstanding, upgraded biogas has to be achieved by removing as much carbon dioxide as possible. In this study, a novel anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor-microbial electrolysis cell (AnOMBR-MEC) system was developed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment. The AnOMBR-MEC elicited an excellent and stable soluble chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus removal. As the experiment progressed, unwanted carbon dioxide produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a SnO2 nanoparticles electrocatalytic cathode in an electrocatalytic-assisted MEC, with the highest faradic efficiency of formate being 85% at 1.2V. Compared to AnOMBR, the methane content increased from 55% to 90% at the end of operation and methane yield experienced a1.6-fold increment in the AnOMBR-MEC.

However, previous studies only focused on forecasting accuracy and neglected modeling mechanisms. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel fractional grey Riccati model (FGRM(1,1) model), which combines the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis and differential information principle. The least-squares parameter estimation and mathematics analytical methods are utilized to obtain model parameters and the discrete response function, and the bare bone fireworks algorithm is introduced and designed to obtain the optimal fractional order. 20 data sets from M-competition are studied for confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the performance test shows that it has higher stability and accuracy. Finally, the proposed model is employed to estimate and forecast the CO2 emissions of the United States, China, and Japan. Compared with three types of classical models without considering modeling mechanisms, the results show that the FGRM(1,1) model demonstrates better estimation in all cases and efficiency in short-term carbon emission forecasting. Results also indicated that these three countries all will reduce their carbon emissions gradually in future and the carbon emissions under current policies are estimated to be 0.31% (Japan), 4.52% (U.S.) and 4.49% (China) below 2020 levels by 2025, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bare bone fireworks algorithm; Carbon emission forecasting; FGRM(1,1) model; Grey forecasting model; Time response sequence","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decision support systems; Economics; Estimation; Functions; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Least squares approximations; Sustainable development; Differential information; Environmental governances; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Fireworks algorithms; Forecasting accuracy; Least-squares parameter estimations; Regional sustainable development; Response functions; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093926196

Although the low-carbon evaluation (LCE) indicator system and benchmarks have been extensively studied, most benchmarks ignore the needs of the evaluated object at the development stage. When the local economy develops to a certain level, it may be restricted by static low-carbon target constraints. This study reviews the relevant research on LCE indicator system and benchmarks based on convergence. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), a dynamic benchmark system for per capita carbon emissions (PCCEs), is proposed for low-carbon counties. Taking Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, China as an example, a dynamic benchmark for PCCEs was established by benchmarking the Carbon Kuznets Curve (CKC) of best practices. Based on the principles of best practice, comparability, data completeness, and the CKC hypothesis acceptance, the best practice database is screened, and Singapore is selected as a potential benchmark. By constructing an econometric model to conduct an empirical study on Singapore’s CKC hypothesis, the regression results of the least squares method support the CKC hypothesis and its rationality as a benchmark. The result of the PCCE benchmarks of Changxing County show that when the per capita income of Changxing County in 2025, 2030, and 2035 reaches USD 19,172.92, USD 24,483.01, and USD 29,366.11, respectively, the corresponding benchmarks should be 14.95 tons CO2/person, 14.70 tons CO2/person, and 13.55 tons CO2/person. For every 1% increase in the county’s per capita income, the PCCE allowable room for growth is 17.6453%. The turning point is when the per capita gross domestic product (PCGDP) is USD 20,843.23 and the PCCE is 15.03 tons of CO2/person, which will occur between 2025 and 2030. Prior to this, the PCCE benchmark increases with the increase of PCGDP. After that, the PCCE benchmark decreases with the increase of PCGDP. The system is economically sensitive, adaptable to different development stages, and enriches the methodology of low-carbon indicator evaluation and benchmark setting at the county scale. It can provide scientific basis for Chinese county decision makers to formulate reasonable targets under the management idea driven by evaluation indicators and emission reduction targets and help counties explore the coordinated paths of economic development and emission reduction in different development stages. It has certain reference significance for other developing regions facing similar challenges of economic development and low-carbon transformation to Changxing County to formulate scientific and reasonable low-carbon emission reduction targets. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a highly resolved of county-based atmospheric emission inventory of Hg, As, Cd, Cr and Pb for Chinese CFIBs in 2017 is established firstly based on integrated source-specific information of both activity level and air pollution control devices (APCDs) from ~61,000 CFIBs in mainland China. Our results estimated that the total emissions of Hg, As, Cd, Cr and Pb from national CFIBs in 2017 were about 25.46, 115.33, 7.04, 371.40, and 589.76 t, respectively. Hg0 was the majority species of atmospheric Hg, accounting for 71.5% of the total Hg emission. The peak emission intensities of five TMs were mainly concentrated in northern and eastern region of China due to its large demand of coal consumption for winter heating, broad economic activity, as well as high population density. Monthly emission characteristics of TMs exhibited seasonal peak. The overall uncertainties of the newly updated emission inventory were estimated at the ranges of −42.0%–45.5%. Generally, TMs emissions from Chinese CFIBs were effectively controlled through implementing energy substitution, APCDs upgrading, and ultra-low emission (ULE) retrofitting in different regions of China, which contributed to 18.8%–29.4% of five TMs emission reductions. We believe that our highly resolved county-level emission inventory will be comprehensively explored the current tempo-spatial emission characteristics of atmospheric TMs from Chinese CFIBs and the forecast results will be useful for developing effective emission control programs for policy makers in the county levels and improving the regional air quality in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coal-fired industrial boiler (CFIBs); County-level emission inventory; Monthly partition coefficients; Scenario projection; Trace metals (TMs)","Air pollution control equipment; Air quality; Coal; Coal industry; Economics; Emission control; Population statistics; Quality control; Trace elements; Uncertainty analysis; Air pollution control devices; Atmospheric emission inventory; Emission characteristics; Emission inventories; High population density; Industry applications; Regional air quality; Specific information; Coal fired boilers; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; lead; mercury; arsenic; atmospheric pollution; cadmium; chromium; coal-fired power plant; emission inventory; industrial emission; lead; mercury (element); partition coefficient; scenario analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; trace metal; air pollution control; air quality; Article; boiler; China; coal fired industrial boiler; flue gas; geographic distribution; partition coefficient; population density; priority journal; seasonal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097058311

Here we use, for the first time, four state-of-the-art Land Surface Models that explicitly consider ground freezing states, forced by a subset of bias-adjusted CMIP5 General Circulation Models to estimate the impact of different global warming scenarios (RCP2.6, 6.0, 8.5) on two modes of winter travel: overland travel days (OTDs) and ice road construction days (IRCDs). We show that OTDs decrease by on average -13% in the near future (2021-2050) and between -15% (RCP2.6) and -40% (RCP8.5) in the far future (2070-2099) compared to the reference period (1971-2000) when 173 d yr-1 are simulated across the Pan-Arctic. Regionally, we identified Eastern Siberia (Sakha (Yakutia), Khabarovsk Krai, Magadan Oblast) to be most resilient to climate change, while Alaska (USA), the Northwestern Russian regions (Yamalo, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Nenets, Komi, Khanty-Mansiy), Northern Europe and Chukotka are highly vulnerable. The change in OTDs is most pronounced during the shoulder season, particularly in autumn. The IRCDs reduce on average twice as much as the OTDs under all climate scenarios resulting in shorter operational duration. The results of the low-end global warming scenario (RCP2.6) emphasize that stringent climate mitigation policies have the potential to reduce the impact of climate change on winter mobility in the second half of the 21st century. Nevertheless, even under RCP2.6, our results suggest substantially reduced winter overland travel implying a severe threat to livelihoods of remote communities and increasing costs for resource exploration and transport across the Arctic. © 2021 The Author(s).","Arctic accessibility; Arctic transport; Climate change; Ice roads; Land surface models; Permafrost; Winter roads","Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Climate mitigations; Climate scenarios; General circulation model; Increasing costs; Land surface models; Permafrost degradation; Remote communities; State of the art; Global warming; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; CMIP; global warming; scenario analysis; travel behavior; vulnerability; Arctic; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100759722

The experimental tests are conducted at four equivalence ratios (Φ) of 0.67, 0.74, 0.94, and 1.2. A coaxial burner, supplied with a circular disc stabilizer, is provided with a twin spill return atomizer. The assessment of the combustor efficiency is obtained through the calculation of the heating load and the measurements of the cooling load, and exhaust load of a cylindrical water-cooled combustor. The results showed that the blending of fuel additive with LDO and WCO reduces the CO emissions by 87.5% and 21%, respectively. The blending of CITAF with LDO and WCO fuels reduces the local cone angle by nearly 2.7% and 9.3%, respectively compared to pure fuels. The mean droplet diameters are decreased by an average of 30% and 19% for LDO and WCO related to without fuel additive. The blending of fuel additive increases the exhaust gas temperature by 14.45% for LDO but it decreases by 12% for WCO. The adiabatic flame temperatures are raised by an average of 4.4% and 7% for diesel and WCO, respectively.

Several countries around the world instituted partial or total lockdown as part of the control measures for the pandemic. This presented a unique opportunity to study air pollution under reduced human activities. In this study, we investigated the impact of the lockdown on air pollution in three highly populated and industrious cities in Nigeria. Compared with historical mean values, NO2 levels increased marginally by 0.3% and 12% in Lagos and Kaduna respectively. However, the city of Port Harcourt saw a decrease of 1.1% and 215.5% in NO2 and SO2 levels respectively. Elevated levels of O3 were observed during the period of lockdown. Our result suggests that there are other sources of air pollution apart from transportation and industrial sources. Our findings showed that the COVID-19-induced lockdown was responsible for a decrease in NO2 levels in two of the locations studied.

This paper evaluated the efficiency and order of ULUS of thirteen cities in Jiangsu province, China, using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and information entropy method to characterize the spatial-temporal variation. Although literature using the DEA approach and information entropy method to measure the performance of ULUS exists, the main contributions of this study were considering different types of undesirable outputs and using long-term panel data in the process of urban land use. The Slacks-Based Measure (SBM)-Undesirable window analysis technique was used to measure the annual change of urban land use efficiency (ULUE) in Jiangsu during the period 2006–2017. In particular, urban land resource saving, undesirable output emission reduction potential and reducing size were constructed to comprehensively evaluate the improvement approaches of ULUE. Moreover, the grey relational grade between efficiency and order of ULUS, land use types and ULUE were evaluated using the grey relational model. The empirical results revealed that the ULUE in Jiangsu province was relatively high and the potential to improve ULUE was small. The change of information entropy of ULUS showed a low fluctuation trend of “decline-rise-decline"". In addition, there was a distinct correlation between ULUE and information entropy of ULUS during the period examined. The analysis using DEA and information entropy approach elucidated that overall, the performance of ULUS presented a typical spatial and temporal distribution, which was closely related to the level of regional social and economic development and urbanization. Based on these results, several policy implications are proposed to improve urban land use performance within Jiangsu province. Furthermore, these results enable researchers and policymakers to understand the performance of ULUS and set goals for further improvement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Grey relational analysis; Jiangsu province; Land use efficiency; Land use policy; SBM-Undesirable window analysis; Urban land use structures","Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; Public policy; Emission reduction potentials; Grey relational grade; Grey relational model; Information entropy; Information entropy method; Social and economic development; Spatial and temporal distribution; Urban sustainable development; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093979610

For this purpose, this study utilizes the energy trilemma index (ETI) 2018 of the World Energy Council (WEC) to measure, evaluate and assess the energy efficiency of the top ten best-performing countries around the world. This study formulates an interval decision matrix to apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) by reducing a large set into a small set of underlying variables with comprehensive information. Finally, this study uses the Fuzzy-TOPSIS method to determine the comprehensive ranks of all countries. This study shows that Denmark holds overall first rank in energy efficiency with a score of one in energy security, eleven in energy equity, and seventeen in environmental sustainability. In contrast, Germany has dominated all top ten performers by energy and environmental progress, which cannot be shirker within the UK's social progress concept. Thus, with ceteris paribus, a higher energy price will indicate a higher degree of scarcity of energy sources, encouraging working for cheaper and renewable alternatives and ultimately influencing the energy supply side. Carbon valuation can reduce greenhouse emissions by paying the extra dollar to the enterprise for less emission.

Understanding the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under land use change and management is essential for achieving soil C sequestration through land-based solutions for drylands. In this paper, we briefly reviewed the literature to evaluate the impact of land use change and management on dryland SOC stocks. While the site-level field measurements of SOC stocks under different types of land use change and land management are remarkable, we found that the impact is hardly quantified at the regional level using selected soil datasets or process models and may be due to insufficient data quality, representativeness and information availability, which are among the major challenges of upscaling from field measurements to estimating regional SOC stocks. Therefore, we proposed a comprehensive framework following the IPCC inventory approach to improve future studies, which underlines the needs of data collection from multiple sources, meta-analysis for calculating SOC stock change factors, and matching land and soil datasets. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"carbon cycle; data assimilation; land management; land use change; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Matthiola",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099152196

The current research status of drylands globally was reviewed together with a conceptual framework that included four key themes: (1) dryland social-ecological system dynamics and driving forces, (2) dryland social-ecological system structure and functions, (3) dryland ecosystem services and human well-being in a changing environment and society, and (4) ecosystem management and sustainable livelihoods in drylands. The themes and their linkages were then analysed to outline three research priorities under each theme. The resulting conceptual framework and research priorities were proposed as the agenda of a new scientific programme, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Global-DEP), which is intended to facilitate actionable interdisciplinary research on drylands. This framework could be useful for wider dryland research and help meet the needs of practitioners and policymakers in drylands. © 2020",,"arid region; climate change; conceptual framework; ecosystem management; global perspective; interdisciplinary approach; livelihood; research work; Sustainable Development Goal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091224424

There are still controversies regarding origin of the MLCIE and its possible causal link(s) with respect to the preceding LKB. Surprisingly, the isotope fractionation of carbon between inorganic and organic carbon pools during the MLCIE was not investigated in detail. To constrain better this parameter of marine C cycle, its linkage to the LKB, and local sulfur cycle, we analysed high-resolution δ13Ccarb, δ13Corg, and δ34Spy records in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) representing one of the most complete records of the MLCIEcarb in the world. Evaluation of these high-resolution δ13Corg and δ13Ccarb records reveals their tight coupling, which in turn indicates the photosynthetic origin of the MLCIEorg via links to primary production and changing rates of organic carbon burial. On the other hand, our data also reveal a short-term decoupling of the δ13Corg and δ13Ccarb records preceding the MLCIE which may have been related to a purported increase in atmospheric pCO2 levels or anoxic event. The peak of the Δ13C anomaly exactly coincides with the LKB and, therefore, for the first time suggests a tight link between the change in marine carbon cycling and the bioevent. Subsequent rapid drop of the Δ13C values (and by inference also atmospheric pCO2) fits well with a rapid cooling and globally documented regression reported for this time interval. Finally, the documented strong coupling of δ13Ccarb and δ34Spy records during the MLCIE points to an intensive microbial sulfate reduction which should increase carbonate alkalinity input, thus contributing to formation of authigenic carbonates and an increase in δ13C values of DIC (and anticipated seawater carbonate saturation). The coupling of δ13Corg and δ34Spy values suggests a global enhancement of organic carbon and pyrite burial likely driven by an expansion of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic water column) conditions in the oceans. Present study of C and S isotope variations during the MLCIE reveals for the first time a tight link among carbon and sulfur cycling, global cooling, and reorganization of faunal communities and fits well with purported seawater carbonate hypersaturation at the onset and during MLCIE. © 2020","Atmospheric CO2; Carbon isotopes; Peri-Gondwana; Prague Basin; Redox conditions; Sulfur isotopes","anoxic conditions; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbonate; isotopic fractionation; organic carbon; Phanerozoic; pyrite; seawater; Silurian; sulfur cycle; Czech Republic; Prague Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100006750

Among them, the niobate shows the most promising performance under UV irradiation not only in terms of conversion and light utilization ability, but also regarding the selectivity towards CO2 reduction against hydrogen evolution from water protons. Further modification of NaNbO3 with silver as co-catalyst results in an increase of the selectivity towards highly reduced products, primarily methanol, against the carbon monoxide production mainly observed with the bare semiconductor. A thorough structural, electronic, electrochemical characterization, together with in-situ surface analysis by APXPS, was undertaken to gain deeper insight into the reasons that account for such changes. On the one hand, for the bare semiconductors, increased light absorption and the sole presence of Nb in +4 state at the surface seem to drive the superior activity of NaNbO3. On the other hand, electronic and surface chemistry modifications induced by 0.1 wt.% silver deposition are proposed to govern the higher selectivity towards methanol. Excessive metal loading, in turn, enhances the selectivity effect but at the expense of conversion, in such a way that light utilization becomes poorer than with the bare niobate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APXPS; CO2 conversion; Cocatalyst; Perovskite; Photocatalysis; Silver","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst selectivity; Hydrothermal synthesis; Irradiation; Light absorption; Methanol; Niobium; Perovskite; Photocatalysis; Silver; Sodium compounds; Surface analysis; Surface chemistry; Tantalum; Tantalum compounds; APXPS; Cocatalyst; Electrochemical characterizations; Hydrogen evolution; Light utilization; Photo-catalytic; Selectivity effects; Silver deposition; Niobium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077717997

Common passivation procedures, when applied to Ni/ Al2O3 catalysts, typically result in a significant decrease of the overall Ni surface area and, accordingly, the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, passivation and reactivation is an attractive pre-treatment option for this system. Ni/ Al2O3 typically requires reduction temperatures much higher than the desired reaction temperature, whereas reactivation of passivated samples is a low-temperature reduction. This can be used to avoid temperature limitations of existing systems. Thus, more insight into the passivation process of this system is desirable. In this work we analyzed the impact of passivation on the catalytic performance of a series of Ni/ Al2O3 catalysts in dry reforming of methane. This approach allows for the elimination of scale effects during passivation. We show that changes in conversion and especially of the coke content can be used to track sintering of Ni particles. These metrics allows to identify an adverse effects of catalyst passivation in excess O2, which gives rise to rapid local overheating and, accordingly, Ni sintering even when operating at tens of mg catalyst scale. Our study demonstrates that such problems are not limited to scaling issues and sufficient care must be taken even on a lab-scale when passivating Ni/ Al2O3 catalysts. © 2021 The Author(s)","Catalyst deactivation; Dry reforming of methane; Heterogeneous catalysis; Nickel; Passivation","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst activity; Catalytic reforming; Methane; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Sintering; Temperature; Catalytic performance; Dry reforming-of-methane; Low-temperature reduction; Passivation process; Protective oxide layers; Reaction temperature; Reduction temperatures; Temperature limitation; Passivation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099244901

Small commercial buildings are those with less than 50,000 ft2 of conditioned area and represent 94% of total commercial buildings in the U.S. Since windows are responsible for 34% of commercial space conditioning energy use, windows in small commercial buildings should be given considerable attention. Besides the window material, selecting an optimum window dimension and location has played an important role in building energy performance. Since different weather conditions and sun angles impact on determining the optimum window dimensions and location, the goal of this study is to identify the optimum window design parameters in seven US climate zones in order to minimize building energy use. In this study, an optimization model using a genetic algorithm is developed and coupled with EnergyPlus software to identify the optimum window design parameters including a window to wall ratio, aspect ratio, and fenestration location. A double-story commercial building model, as a case study, is designed using DesignBuilder software to illustrate the application of the model.

On the demand side, climate change could shift demand patterns due to increased air temperatures. On the supply side, climate change could lead to deratings of thermal units due to changes in air temperature, water temperature, and water availability. Past studies have typically analyzed these risks separately. Here, we developed an integrated, multimodel framework to analyze how compounding risks of climate-change impacts on demand and supply affect long-term planning decisions in the power system. In the southeast U.S., we found that compounding climate-change impacts could result in a 35% increase in installed capacity by 2050 relative to the reference case. Participation of renewables, particularly solar, in the fleet increased, driven mostly by the expected increase in summertime peak demand. Such capacity requirements would increase investment costs by approximately 31 billion (USD 2015) over the next 30 years, compared to the reference case. These changes in investment decisions align with carbon emission mitigation strategies, highlighting how adaptation and mitigation strategies can converge. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Investments; Capacity expansion; Capacity requirement; Climate change impact; Electric power sector; Electricity generation; Installed capacity; Investment decisions; Mitigation strategy; Climate change; carbon; water; climate change; climate effect; decision making; electricity generation; electricity supply; power generation; power plant; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; econometric model; electric power plant; electricity; hydrological model; hydropower; investment; renewable resource; simulation; solar energy; United States; wind; electricity; temperature; United States; United States; Climate Change; Electricity; Southeastern United States; Temperature; United States; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100668478

As a result, there are projected environmental, economic and social impacts in several sectors, including agriculture. However, the extent of climatic impacts depends on farmers’ awareness and their capacity for adaptation in response to changes in the climate. This study analyzes the factors that influence farmers’ perception of climate change. Data were collected from a farm-household survey in the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Using a logistic regression model, we identified that farm size, support of extension workers, number of conservation practices adopted, and ecocentrism value influenced positively the perception. Moreover, we found that farm size relied on government actions, subsidies, and anthropocentric value was affected negatively. These findings showed that socioeconomic and psychological factors shape farmers’ perception of climate change. Extension workers and policymakers should increase farmers' awareness on climate change improving the communication on the nature importance for the ecosystem as a whole (ecocentrism) and/or explaining the importance of nature for human welfare (anthropocentrism). © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Anthropocentrism; Drought; Ecocentrism; Extreme weather events; Psychology","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; economic impact; environmental impact; extreme event; farmers attitude; governance approach; perception; regression analysis; social impact; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079168358

To approach the issue of PD's risk factors from a new perspective, we hypothesized that coupling the geographic distribution of PD with spatial statistics may provide new insights into environmental epidemiology research. The aim of this case-control study was to examine the spatial dependence of PD prevalence in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland (population = 474,211). Methods: PD cases were identified through Geneva University Hospitals, private neurologists and nursing homes medical records (n = 1115). Controls derived from a population-based study (n = 12,614) and a comprehensive population census dataset (n = 237,771). All individuals were geographically localized based on their place of residence. Spatial Getis-Ord Gi* statistics were used to identify clusters of high versus low disease prevalence. Confounder-adjustment was performed for age, sex, nationality and income. Tukey's honestly significant difference was used to determine whether nitrogen dioxide and particulate matters PM10 concentrations were different within PD hotspots, coldspots or neutral areas. Results: Confounder-adjustment greatly reduced greatly the spatial association. Characteristics of the geographic space influenced PD prevalence in 6% of patients. PD hotspots were concentrated in the urban centre. There was a significant difference in mean annual nitrogen dioxide and PM10 levels (+3.6 μg/m3 [p &lt; 0.001] and +0.63 μg/m3 [p &lt; 0.001] respectively) between PD hotspots and coldspots. Conclusion: PD prevalence exhibited a spatial dependence for a small but significant proportion of patients. A positive association was detected between PD clusters and air pollution. Our data emphasize the multifactorial nature of PD and support a link between PD and air pollution. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Environment; Epidemiology; Parkinson's disease; Prevalence; Spatial dependence","nitrogen dioxide; adult; age; air pollution; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; disease hotspot; geographic distribution; human; income; major clinical study; medical record; neurologist; nursing home; Parkinson disease; particulate matter 10; population research; prevalence; priority journal; sex; spatial analysis; Switzerland; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099598390

The analyzed plant components consist of stem, branch, and leaf organs. We found similar ratios of component biomass to total AGB for stems, branches, and leaves amongst shrubs and deciduous tree genera/species across the southern Northwest Territories, while the evergreen Picea genus differed in the biomass allocation to aboveground plant organs compared to the deciduous genera/species. Shrub component AGB allometric models were derived using the three-dimensional variable volume as predictor, determined as the sum of line-intercept cover, upper foliage width, and maximum height above ground. Tree component AGB was modeled using the cross-sectional area of the stem diameter as predictor variable, measured at 0.30 m along the stem length. For shrub component AGB, we achieved better model fits for stem biomass (60.33 g ≤ RMSE ≤ 163.59 g; 0.651 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.885) compared to leaf biomass (12.62 g ≤ RMSE ≤ 35.04 g; 0.380 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.735), as has been reported by others. For short-stature trees, leaf biomass predictions resulted in similar model fits (18.21 g ≤ RMSE ≤ 70.0 g; 0.702 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.882) compared to branch biomass (6.88 g ≤ RMSE ≤ 45.08 g; 0.736 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.923) and only slightly better model fits for stem biomass (30.87 g ≤ RMSE ≤ 11.72 g; 0.887 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.960), which suggests that leaf AGB of short-stature trees (&lt;4.5 m) can be more accurately predicted using cross-sectional area as opposed to diameter at breast height for tall-stature trees. Our multi-species shrub and short-stature tree allometric models showed promising results for predicting plant component AGB, which can be utilized for remote sensing applications where plant functional types cannot always be distinguished. This study provides critical information on plant AGB allocation as well as component AGB modeling, required for understanding boreal AGB and aboveground carbon pools within the dynamic and rapidly changing Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield ecozones. In addition, the structural information and component AGB equations are important for integrating shrubs and short-stature tree AGB into carbon accounting strategies in order to improve our understanding of the rapidly changing boreal ecosystem function. © 2021 by the authors.

When colonizing a new host tree, I. confusus beetles coordinate a mass attack to overcome the tree's defenses using aggregation pheromones. Ips confusus, as with other Ips spp. beetles, biosynthesize ipsdienol and ipsenol in a specific enantiomeric blend and ratio as aggregation pheromones. While several of the initial steps in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway have been well defined, the final steps were unknown. We used comparative RNA-Seq analysis between fed and unfed male I. confusus midgut tissue to identify candidate genes involved in pheromone biosynthesis. The 12,995 potentially unique transcripts showed a clear separation based on feeding state. Differential expression analysis identified gene groups that were tightly connected. This analysis identified all known pheromone biosynthetic genes and suggested a novel monoterpene double bond reductase, ipsdienone reductase (IDONER), with pheromone biosynthetic gene expression patterns. IDONER cDNA was cloned, expressed, and functionally characterized. The coding DNA sequence has an ORF of 1101 nt with a predicted translation product of 336 amino acids. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 36.7 kDa with conserved motifs of the medium chain dehydrogenases/reductase (MDR) superfamily in the leukotriene B4 dehydrogenases/reductases (LTB4R) family. Tagged recombinant protein was expressed and purified. Enzyme assays and GC/MS analysis showed IDONER catalyzed the reduction of ipsdienone to form ipsenone.

Here, we take a first step in understanding the material outcomes of these efforts. Specifically, we provide an overview of climate-related activism as a form of civic engagement, paying particular attention to the targets of this activism and its environmental outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Then, we focus on one of the most common tactics to gain momentum in recent years: the school strike, which has mobilized a growing number of participants around the world. We discuss how the Coronavirus pandemic has changed the climate movement with much activism moving online.

Carbon isotope values are commonly used to reconstruct pCO2, C3 vs. C4 plant types, and carbon cycle dynamics. Oxygen isotope values of the same carbonates have been used to reconstruct past temperatures and elevations. In the geologic record, changes in these isotope values can be difficult to interpret because they are affected by a suite of multiple local (e.g. precipitation and temperature) and global variables (e.g. pCO2 and global temperature) that can be difficult to separate. In this study, we develop a semi-mechanistic model of factors that affect carbon and oxygen isotope values of pedogenic carbonate. The model links these factors to a common suite of environmental variables using theoretical and empirical relationships. We test and optimize the model using modern environmental data and a compilation of modern pedogenic carbonate isotope measurements. This comparison indicates that the model best reproduces the observed data when carbonates are assumed to form under conditions where (1) evaporation affects oxygen isotope values of source waters at shallow soil depths only, (2) source waters mix precipitation from prior to and during the period of carbonate formation, and (3) soil CO2 respiration rates are anomalously low.

Load flexibility poses new challenges regarding the reactor design and operation in comparison to the conventional steady state operating mode. These challenges can be managed by a more conservative reactor design, but it creates a performance gap between conventional and load flexible reactors. The intensification of load flexible wall-cooled fixed bed reactors is approached using the methanation of carbon dioxide as case study. An optimization problem is formulated which bases on the simultaneous optimization of the reactor design and several steady state operating points within a desired load range. The identified staged reactor setup with a catalyst dilution profile tolerates large variations of the flow rate up to 80 % and shows a significant improvement of the load flexible reactor performance. A considerable potential of a split and bypass of the feed stream to other stages is identified, which enables an adaption of the axial flow field according to the current load level. The feasibility of the identified setup for the dynamic operation is successfully verified by dynamic simulation of different operating scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide methanation; Catalyst dilution profile; Dynamic operation; Feed distribution; Model-based reactor optimization; Wall-cooled tubular reactor","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Catalyst dilutions; Dynamic operations; Fixed bed reactor; Flexible operation; Optimization problems; Reactor performance; Simultaneous optimization; Steady-state operating; Chemical reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095584687

However, regional sea level is expected to vary across ocean basins, superimposed by the influence of natural internal climate variability. Here, we address the detection of dynamic sea level (DSL) changes by combining the perspectives of a single and a multimodel ensemble approach (the 50-member CanESM5 and a 27-model ensemble, respectively, all retrieved from the CMIP6 archive), under three CMIP6 projected scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. The ensemble analysis takes into account four key metrics: signal (S), noise (N), S/N ratio, and time of emergence (ToE). The results from both sets of ensembles agree in the fact that regions with higher S/N (associated with smaller uncertainties) also reflect earlier ToEs. The DSL signal is projected to emerge in the Southern Ocean, Southeast Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, and the Arctic. Results common for both sets of ensemble simulations show that while S progressively increases with increased projected emissions, N, in turn, does not vary substantially among the SSPs, suggesting that uncertainty arising from internal climate variability has little dependence on changes in the magnitude of external forcing. Projected changes are greater and quite similar for the scenarios SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 and considerably smaller for the SSP1-2.6, highlighting the importance of public policies towards lower emission scenarios and of keeping emissions below a certain threshold. © 2021, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CMIP6; dynamic sea level; sea level rise; signal-to-noise; time of emergence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100008158

Economic complexity research applies new empirical methods and considers both social and environmental sustainability, but seldom scrutinizes theory and policy. Industrial policy research focuses on green growth policies but tends to omit social sustainability issues and advanced empirical methods. Research on economic diversification in poor regions provides insights on the livelihood diversification of farmers, but is disconnected from the economic complexity and industrial policy research.

The reactor was inoculated with granular sludge obtained from a pulp and paper industry and fed at a constant inlet sulfate concentration of 250 mg S-SO42−L−1 and a constant C/S ratio of 1.5 ± 0.3 g Cg−1 S for over 500 days. Apart from the regular analysis of chemical species, Illumina analyses of the 16S rRNA gene were used to study the dynamics of the bacterial community along with the whole operation. The reactor was sampled along the operation to monitor its diversity and the changes in targeted species to gain insight into the performance of the sulfidogenic UASB. Moreover, studies on the stratification of the sludge bed were performed by sampling at different reactor heights. Shifts in the UASB performance correlated well with the main shifts in microbial communities of interest. A progressive loss of the methanogenic capacity towards a fully sulfidogenic UASB was explained by a progressive wash-out of methanogenic Archaea, which were outcompeted by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Desulfovibrio was found as the main sulfate-reducing genus in the reactor along time. A progressive reduction in the sulfidogenic capacity of the UASB was found in the long run due to the accumulation of a slime-like substance in the UASB. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper introduces an approach based on driver volatility measured by vehicle acceleration and jerk to estimate HEV emissions rates. Dynamic emission models represented by nine driving behaviors associated with vehicular jerk classification, and considering the on/off state of the internal combustion engine are proposed. To assess real-world emission performance, data were collected from one vehicle using a portable emissions measurement system. Results indicated that proposed models using engine speed as input were good predictors of carbon dioxide and particulate matter (R2 ranged from 0.72 to 0.96, depending on the pollutant and jerk type) for both internal combustion engine on/off states. However, the predicted emissions of nitrogen oxides resulted in values of R2 lower than 0.57, mostly due in part to the proportion of measured concentrations lower than the instrument detection limit (~47%). Driving volatility-based models accurately characterized measured carbon dioxide (with 1–16% of measured value) and yielded lower relative mean square errors than the traditional vehicle specific power modal approach. Our results suggest that vehicular jerk classification can be useful to reduce instantaneous emission impacts during different driving regimes. For instance, these models can be integrated into electronic car units to provide feedback about emission rates associated with volatile driving and into warning systems that could detect/prevent unsafe maneuvers. These classifications would allow for better energy efficiency and eco-efficient driving behavior controls for automated vehicles. © 2020","Carbon dioxide; Driving volatility; Hybrid electric vehicle; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate matter; Vehicular jerk","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Energy efficiency; Internal combustion engines; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Dynamic emission models; Instrument detection limits; Portable emissions measurement systems; Real-world emission; Relative mean square errors; Road traffic network; Vehicle acceleration; Vehicle specific power; Hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; combustion; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy use; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; road traffic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096849209

Yoshida Katsumi, a Medical Professor at Mie Prefectural University, consulted the Atomic Bomb Medical Law to establish Yokkaichi's own certification system. Because both leukaemia and asthma are non-specific diseases, they may also be caused by non-pollution-related factors. In the Yokkaichi lawsuit, Yoshida applied the epidemiological causation to the legal judgment for the purpose of providing compensation to individuals. As the case for compensation unfolded from 1967 to 1972, epidemiological knowledge, legal theory and social norms were deployed to advance the plaintiffs' claim, whose success set a good example for other legal proceedings. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Over the past decade, IITA has implemented ten circular bioeconomy focused research for development (R4D) interventions in several countries in the region. This article aims to assess the contributions of IITA’s circular bioeconomy focused innovations towards economic, social, and environmental outcomes using the outcome tracking approach, and identify areas for strengthening existing circular bioeconomy R4D interventions using the gap analysis method. Data used for the study came from secondary sources available in the public domain. Results indicate that IITA’s circular bioeconomy interventions led to ten technological innovations (bio-products) that translated into five economic, social, and environmental outcomes, including crop productivity, food security, resource use efficiency, job creation, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Our gap analysis identified eight gaps leading to a portfolio of five actions needed to enhance the role of circular bioeconomy in SSA. The results showcase the utility of integrating a circular bioeconomy approach in R4D work, especially how using such an approach can lead to significant economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The evidence presented can help inform the development of a framework to guide circular bioeconomy R4D at IITA and other research institutes working in SSA. Generating a body of evidence on what works, including the institutional factors that create enabling environments for circular bioeconomy approaches to thrive, is necessary for governments and donors to support circular bioeconomy research that will help solve some of the most pressing challenges in SSA as populations grow and generate more waste, thus exacerbating a changing climate using the linear economy model. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper we ask to which extend are Visegrád Group countries prepared for the widespread utilization of electric cars and define a new coefficient K called the infrastructural country electromobility coefficient. Its computing is covered by appropriate analysis and calculations done previously. Several indices that keep particular information about the state of preparation for electromobility are defined and debated here, as well. Their product forms the coefficient K. Obtained results include outcomes and discussion regarding the level of infrastructural electromobility preparedness for the chosen states, among which we extra focus on the position of Slovakia compared to the European Union average and European electromobility leaders. Based on the data obtained, we found out that the stage of preparation of Slovakia for electromobility among Visegrad Group countries is rather good, although it is far behind the European Union leaders. We realized that there was a rapid growth of electromobility infrastructure in Slovak Republic in the last five years as its infrastructural country electromobility coefficient grew 334 times. © 2021 by the authors.

Optimization of the dual services is the ultimate goal in forest management for mitigating global climate change and safeguarding terrestrial water balance. However, there are some tradeoffs between gain in forest productivity and ecosystem water balance. We conducted literature review based on published articles for learned knowledge on forest carbon fixation and hydrological regulations. Some knowledge gaps and research needs are identified by examining the inter-connections between forest carbon sequestration and water conservation. Past researches have helped gain basic understanding of the mechanisms and controls of forest carbon fixation and hydrological regulations as two separate issues. Tools and approaches are well established for quantifying and monitoring forest carbon and hydrological issues, operating at different spatial and temporal scales. There are knowledge gaps on how to design afforestation schemes facilitating enhanced ecosystem services in forest carbon sequestration and water conservation. For the top-down planning of afforestation in regions where water availability is anticipated to be problematic, the questions of how much and where to plant for given land availability, known environmental implications, and sustained regional development and livelihood need to be addressed. For local management considerations, the questions of what and how to plant prevail. Efforts are needed in joint studies of forest carbon sequestration and water conservation functionalities, specifically in relation to establishment and management of planted forests aiming for delivering regulatory ecosystem services in carbon sequestration, water conservation and other social values. We propose an integrated framework with dual consideration of carbon sequestration and water conservation in forest management for future research pursue. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon balance; Ecosystem services; Forest management; Hydrological processes; Tradeoff","afforestation; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; forest management; global climate; plantation forestry; water management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084446416

Through the screening of SDMs, random forest (RF), gradient boosting model (GBM), artificial neural network (ANN), and flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) with TSS greater than 0.8 are selected to construct a high-precision ensemble model (EM) as the prediction model. We use specimen sites and environmental variables containing climate, soil, terrain, and human activities to simulate and predict the invasion trend of three invasive weeds in China in current, the 2050s, and the 2070s. Results indicate that the highly invasive risk area of three exotic plants is mostly distributed along the river in the provinces south of 30° N. In the future scenario, the three exotic plants obviously invade northwards Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangxi and Fujian. Climate is the most important variable that affects the spread of three kinds of alien plant invasions. Temperature and precipitation variables have a similar effect on A. adenophora and E. odoratum, while M. micrantha is more sensitive to temperature. It has been reported that Ipomoea batatas and Vitex negundo can prevent the invasion of three invasive plants. Hence, we also simulate the suitable planting areas for I. batatas and V. negundo. The results show that I. batatas and V. negundo are suitable to be planted in the areas where the three weeds show invasion tendency.

This paper aims to disclose the driving mechanism and decoupling effect of industrial PM2.5 emissions. First, this study reveals the spatial-temporal drivers of industrial PM2.5 emissions in China spanning 2000–2014 through geographical detector and logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition, respectively. Then, the decoupling causal chain of industrial economic growth and PM2.5 emissions is investigated by a refined Laspeyres index method. The empirical results illustrate that: (1) Population distribution is the dominating factor for the spatial heterogeneity of industrial PM2.5 emissions. Different influencing factors show significant synergistic effects. (2) Industrial development effect is the main reason for the increase of industrial PM2.5 emissions, while the reduction in industrial PM2.5 emissions is primarily due to energy intensity effect, followed by coal pollution intensity and energy mix effects. (3) During the study period, the PM2.5-economic growth decoupling undergoes two states, and shows the tendency towards strong decoupling. (4) The PM2.5-coal consumption effect and energy consumption-economic growth effect are important factors influencing the changes of PM2.5-economic growth decoupling indicator, while the impact of the coal consumption-energy consumption effect is quite small.

However, the practical application of n-DAMO has been greatly limited by its extremely slow growth-rate and low reaction rate.

This system presented robust capacity to withstand unstable partial nitritation effluent, achieving complete nitrogen removal at a varied nitrite to ammonium ratio in the range of 1.10–1.40. It is confirmed that n-DAMO and Anammox microorganisms jointly dominated the microbial community by pyrosequencing technology.

As a consequence, adverse atmospheric conditions may hinder the effects of policies intended to improve air quality through reduction of emissions. In particular, low ventilation conditions and temperature inversions may significantly inhibit pollutant transport and mixing, determining high concentrations close to the ground. In order to disentangle the contribution of weather conditions on observed pollutant concentrations, meteorological normalization techniques can be applied. In this study, a normalization procedure based on a random forest predictive model is applied to 8-year–long series of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations measured at five air quality stations in the Province of Bolzano (Italian Alps). The normalization is performed on daily–averages of NO2 concentrations, related to a dataset composed of time variables and meteorological data from seven weather stations and one temperature profiler. The strong dependence of observed NO2 concentrations on atmospheric variables (i.e. air temperature, atmospheric stability and wind speed) measured at the valley floor justifies the application of a normalization procedure. The resulting normalized time series of NO2 concentrations, instead, clearly display changes in correspondence of roadworks or other measures capable of modifying the emission regime, and allow to address the reliability of the applied procedure. © 2020","Air quality; Complex mountainous terrain; Meteorological normalization; Nitrogen dioxide; Random Forest; Valley","Air quality; Decision trees; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Predictive analytics; Wind; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric stability; Atmospheric variables; Meteorological data; Meteorological normalization; Pollutant concentration; Reduction of emissions; Temperature inversions; Atmospheric temperature; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); forest floor; nitrogen dioxide; pollutant transport; soil emission; time series analysis; ventilation; wind velocity; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; city; decision tree; explanatory variable; Italy; meteorology; pollutant; pollution transport; prediction; priority journal; random forest; reliability; suburban area; time series analysis; traffic; weather; wind speed; Alps; Bolzano; Italy; Trentino-Alto Adige",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096161711

In this paper, numerical studies are conducted to explore the performance of baffles on heat transfer deterioration (HTD) mitigations for supercritical CO2 (sCO2) flowing in a horizontal mini tube using RNG k-e turbulence model with enhanced wall treatment (EWT). Three kinds of baffle arrangements: in-lined, staggered and centred, with the same blockage ratio (BR = 0.25) are selected to explore their performance on HTD mitigation. The thermo-hydraulic performances of the baffled tubes are examined using the dimensionless parameters based on normalized Nusselt numbers and Fanning friction factors, Nu/Nu0, f/f0 and PEC = (Nu/Nu0)/(f/f0)1/3. The results reveal that unlike the in-lined and staggered baffles, the centred baffles induce jet impingements directly onto the tube walls and generate significant amounts of transverse fluid velocity near the tube wall (which exceeds that in the core region), making it the most influential baffle arrangement on the HTD mitigations. The effects of baffles on buoyancy flow under a wide range of heat and mass fluxes are explored based on Jackson's criterion (Gr/Re2&lt;103). It is observed that the Gr/Re2 increases at a relatively lower rate in baffled tube than in the smooth tube under increased heat flux variation whereas it decreases at a higher rate than the smooth tube under increased mass flux variation, thus revealing the buoyancy weakening effects of baffles.

This indicates some population adaptation to local climate but information on how quickly this adaptation will occur under climate change is lacking. Methods: To investigate this, we associated daily mortality data with temperature during the warm period in 2004–2013 for London inhabitants born in five climatic zones (UK, Tropical, Sub-tropical, Boreal and Mixed). We fitted Poisson regression with distributed-lag non-linear models for each climatic zone group separately to estimate group-specific exposure-response associations and MMTs. We report relative risks of death comparing the 95th percentile (21 °C) and maximum (25 °C) of the temperature distribution in London with the zone-specific minimum mortality temperature. Results: No heat-related mortality was observed for people born in countries with Sub-tropical and Mixed climates. We observed an increase of 26%, 35% and 39% in the risk of death at 25 °C compared to the MMT in people born in the UK (marine climate), Tropical and Boreal climate respectively. The temperatures with the lowest mortality in these groups ranged from 15.9 to 17.7 °C. Discussion: Our findings imply that people born in different climatic zones do not adapt fully to their new environment within their lifetime. This implies that populations may not adapt readily to climate change and will suffer increased effects from heat. In the presence of climate change, policy makers should be aware of a delayed process of adaptation. © 2020","Adaptation; Distributed lag nonlinear models; Minimum mortality temperature; Mortality; Temperature","adaptation; Boreal; climate conditions; environmental risk; extreme event; mortality; nature-society relations; seasonality; subtropical region; temperature profile; tropical environment; article; climate change; controlled study; England; heat; human; mortality; risk factor; season; time series analysis; adaptation; England; epidemiology; female; heat; mortality; pregnancy; season; temperature; London; Adaptation, Physiological; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; London; Mortality; Pregnancy; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094623473

Climate change has a significant impact on the agricultural sector and is projected to global gross domestic product. Java Island, as a center of food production, has a strategic location because of its strong impact on food availability in Indonesia. The study aimed to provide information about the status of the vulnerability of farming system for food at the district/city level in Java Island and the determinant factors that affect the level of vulnerability. The analysis was based on soil fertility, water availability and demand, climate, and socio-economy expressed in terms of exposure and sensitivity index and adaptation capacity index using the quadrant method. The results show that 20% of districts/cities in Java have very high levels of vulnerability. The main determinants identified in Java are the ratio of the number of extension agents and the number of farmer groups/rice field area and the rice consumption ratio to total carbohydrate food.

At the same time, expanding pipeline networks continue to transport hazardous materials around and under these changing river systems. The interaction of these phenomena has produced a series of incidents—notably, on the Yellowstone River in 2011 and 2015—when exposed pipelines have been damaged or corroded, releasing oil and other contaminants into rivers with significant ecological, economic, and social consequences. These events have prompted some evolution of policy and best practices; however, the power of the status quo has slowed the pace of policy change, forcing us to also consider justice implications. In this study we employ a qualitative, longitudinal methodology to examine the dominant ‘truth regime’—or collection of truisms that reinforces the status quo—that operates in this context. We analyze the discourse of citizen stakeholders on the Yellowstone River, gathered over three field seasons: 2006, 2012 and 2018. Our findings highlight four components of a truth regime—‘we need oil,’ ‘this is conservative country,’ ‘it's always been clean,’ and ‘problem solved’—and demonstrate how they are reinforced and challenged over time.

To the best of the authors knowledge, no flood-vulnerability study has combined geophysical modelling of floods with socio-economic assessments of vulnerability at finer municipal or household scale. In addition, the extent to which vulnerability assessments actually feed into flood adaptation policies remains largely unknown. A new flood vulnerability index, and associated methodology, is proposed, combining high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling with built-environment and socio-economic indicators at the smallest spatial scale at which socio-economic data is available. The main advantage of the methodology is its ability to incorporate place-specific data, hence yielding more refined simulations of floods and the capacity to make projections into climate futures at local scale. The index is built and applied to the inter-city suburb of Marrickville in Sydney and used to assess the effects of future climate change on vulnerability mapping in the suburb. Finally, the results of the assessment are presented to, and discussed with, the local government authority responsible for implementing flood adaptation policies for Marrickville. Locally specific modelling of floods, combined with socio-economic and built-environment mapping, has yielded a rich set of information on flood vulnerability and significant variability within a single suburb. Flood duration is projected to increase by more than 100% under some climate change scenarios, as a result of reduced drainage caused by sea level rise. Feedback from municipal council has highlighted the potential usefulness of the knowledge generated by the assessment, especially for emergency services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Flood; Municipal planning; Sea level rise; Social vulnerability; Vulnerability","Economics; Emergency services; Floods; Geophysics; Mapping; Sea level; Climate change scenarios; Flood vulnerabilities; Flood vulnerability indices; Local government authorities; Socio-economic assessments; Socio-economic indicators; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability mappings; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; flood; flooding; geophysical method; policy making; suburban area; vulnerability; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092372056

About 70% of India's energy depends heavily on non-renewable fossil fuels. The cost and demand for the fuel are incredibly high. Over and above these reasons, environmental pollution is causing great concern. Consequently, many of the present researchers are focusing on finding a renewable fuel that can become an alternative for fossil fuel that is fast depleting. Biodiesels have drawn much attention from the research community because of their natural characteristics and chemical composition. In this manuscript, we have reported the linseed oil, which is effectively used as biodiesel (B20) and pre-heated to decrease the viscosity of the fuel with the aid of heater up to 100°C. The nanoparticle used in this work is titanium dioxide because of its highest oxygen content and easy availability in the market. Different proportions of titanium dioxide nanoparticles are blended (50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm, and 200 ppm) with pre-heated linseed oil in a coated diesel engine. The coating material used is Partially Stabilized Zirconium and the preferred thickness of 0.5 mm that is achieved with plasma spray techniques guidance. The crown of the piston or the top surface of the piston is coated with Partially Stabilized Zirconium (PSZ). It is observed that pre-heated PLSNP200 linseed oil has shown the enhanced performance and lower emissions when correlated with all the other blends. Pre-heating of Linseed oil and diesel engine (DI) coating has resulted in a 5.2% increase in thermal efficiency. The combination of PLSNP 200 reduces emissions of CO, smoke, and HC by 37.78%, 25%, and 37.92%, respectively. The oxides of nitrogen are elevated drastically by 7.43% when correlated with diesel fuel. The blend PLSNP200 increased the BTE and NOx by 8.11% and 6.53% respectively when compared with PLS20. The PLSNP200 blend HC, CO and Smoke opacity emission is drastically decreased by 33.82 21.05% and 26.57% when compared with the preheated linseed oil B20 (PLS20). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Low heat rejection engine; Partially stabilized zirconium; Plasma spray coating; Pre-heated linseed oil; Titanium dioxide","Biodiesel; Blending; Coatings; Diesel engines; Drying oils; Fuel additives; Nanoparticles; Oilseeds; Oxides; Petroleum additives; Pistons; Plasma spraying; Pollution; Smoke; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Zirconium; Chemical compositions; Different proportions; Environmental pollutions; Low heat rejection engine; Oxides of nitrogen; Plasma spray techniques; Pollution reduction; Research communities; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093940868

In the United States (US), most states have imposed a partial to complete lockdown that has led to decreased traffic volumes and reduced vehicle emissions. In this study, we investigate the impacts of the pandemic‐related lockdown on air quality in the US using remote sensing products for nitrogen dioxide tropospheric column (NO2), carbon monoxide atmospheric column (CO), tropospheric ozone column (O3), and aerosol optical depth (AOD). We focus on states with distinctive anomalies and high traffic volume, New York (NY), Illinois (IL), Florida (FL), Texas (TX), and California (CA). We evaluate the effectiveness of reduced traffic volume to improve air quality by comparing the significant reductions during the pandemic to the interannual variability (IAV) of a respective reference period for each pollutant. We also investigate and address the potential factors that might have contributed to changes in air quality during the pandemic. As a result of the lockdown and the significant reduction in traffic volume, there have been reductions in CO and NO2. These reductions were, in many instances, compensated by local emissions and, or affected by meteorological conditions. Ozone was reduced by varying magnitude in all cases related to the decrease or increase of NO2 concentrations, depend-ing on ozone photochemical sensitivity. Regarding the policy impacts of this large‐scale experiment, our results indicate that reduction of traffic volume during the pandemic was effective in improving air quality in regions where traffic is the main pollution source, such as in New York City and FL, while was not effective in reducing pollution events where other pollution sources dominate, such as in IL, TX and CA. Therefore, policies to reduce other emissions sources (e.g., industrial emissions) should also be considered, especially in places where the reduction in traffic volume was not effective in improving air quality (AQ). © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to conduct energy, economic and environmental (3E) analysis for an autonomous hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) composed of a wind and solar photovoltaic systems. In this article, HOMER Pro software is adopted for economic evaluation and optimization. The simulations were carried out for a total of 24 selected cities distributed in different climatic regions for a comprehensive assessment approach. The meteorological data for these cites was generated by the NASA platform. The daily energy load of 319.35 kWh/day was used for a typical village in the Fez-Meknes region with a peak power of 30.89 kW. The examined levelized cost of energy ranged between 0.32 $/kWh and 0.171 $/kWh. The lowest levelized cost of energy was predicted for Eddakhla city. The energy shares in this site were to be 25.6% and 74.4%, respectively for the wind turbine system and the PV field. The HRES saves 128.21 tonnes of CO2 release in the city of Eddakhala. This type of projects will enable Morocco to increase its energy independence and supports its national strategy. Furthermore, these projects can promote the socioeconomic development in remote and isolated sites and can be widespread in the African continent, especially with the decreasing costs of renewable energy equipment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Environment analysis; HOMER; Moroccan regions; Stand-alone hybrid power plant","Electric batteries; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Meteorology; NASA; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Comprehensive assessment; Economic evaluations; Electricity production; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); National strategies; Socio-economic development; Solar photovoltaic system; Wind turbine systems; Economic analysis; alternative energy; economic analysis; electricity generation; environmental assessment; photovoltaic system; power plant; software; wind power; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098587647

The high population growth rate annually in KSA, fast urbanization, and an increase in the number of pilgrims and visitors annually, all lead to an increase in the levels of waste products. The generation rate of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is expected to reach 26.9 million tons per year in 2032. The recent studies show that the major components of MSW in KSA were organic waste, plastics, paper, cardboard, and organic present the highest percentage which indicating its potential for energy generation.

This paper presents the state of art of using biofuels in spark ignition engines (SIE). Different biofuels, mainly ethanol, methanol, i-butanol-n-butanol, and acetone, are blended together in single dual issues and evaluated as renewables for SIE. The biofuels were compared with each other as well as with the fossil fuel in SIE. Future biofuels for SIE are highlighted. A proposed method to reduce automobile emissions and reformulate the emissions into new fuels is presented and discussed. The benefits and weaknesses of using biofuels in SIE are summarized. The study established that ethanol has several benefits as a biofuel for SIE; it enhanced engine performance and decreased pollutant emissions significantly; however, ethanol showed some drawbacks, which cause problems in cold starting conditions and, additionally, the engine may suffer from a vapor lock situation. Methanol also showed improvements in engine emissions/performance similarly to ethanol, but it is poisonous biofuel and it has some sort of incompatibility with engine materials/systems; its being miscible with water is another disadvantage. The lowest engine performance was displayed by n-butanol and i-butanol biofuels, and they also showed the greatest amount of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO emissions, but the lowest greenhouse effect. Ethanol and methanol introduced the highest engine performance, but they also showed the greatest CO2 emissions. Acetone introduced a moderate engine performance and the best/lowest CO and UHC emissions. Single biofuel blends are also compared with dual ones, and the results showed the benefits of the dual ones. The study concluded that the next generation of biofuels is expected to be dual blended biofuels. Different dual biofuel blends are also compared with each other, and the results showed that the ethanol–methanol (EM) biofuel is superior in comparison with n-butanol–i-butanol (niB) and i-butanol–ethanol (iBE). © 2021 by the author.

Due to its potential opportunities and risks for the people of the Eastern Nile Basin, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile River has commanded regional and international attention. Once completed, it will rank the largest hydropower dam in Africa and among the largest worldwide. Discourse among scientists and negotiators from Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt on the design, initial filling, and long-term operation of the GERD is ongoing since the construction started in 2011, but no agreement has yet been reached. The discourse has hitherto focused on the impacts on hydropower production, water availability, and irrigated agriculture, with little attention to the dam’s potential environmental impacts. Here, we communicate our viewpoint on this gap, drawing on knowledge from other dams around the world and some GERD characteristics. The hydrological alterations associated with the GERD could adversely impact fish, aquatic plants, and biodiversity in the downstream due to possible changes in water temperature, salinity, and oxygen content. The GERD’s expected flooded area, location at low latitude in the tropics, and the deep turbine intakes could intensify greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the dam’s high reservoir depth would abate the emissions. The dam’s electricity could also reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions if combined with cleaner intermittent solar and wind energy sources. With a maximum reservoir area of 1904 km2, surface evaporation and consequently local extreme precipitation and humidity could increase. The aforementioned impacts could have transboundary ecological, agricultural, and health implications and, therefore, should be taken into consideration alongside the benefits of the dam. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eastern Nile Basin; Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Greenhouse gases; Hydrological alterations; Regional climate; Tropics","dam; electricity; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; hydrological change; reservoir; spatiotemporal analysis; Egypt; Ethiopia; Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Nile Basin; Nile River; Sudan; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; Egypt; Ethiopia; human; river; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Egypt; Ethiopia; Humans; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099022461

While most ATPF areas are covered by mangroves, these areas have been experiencing severe anthropogenicdriven degradation and conversion. This study aims to evaluate land cover changes and associated carbon emissions in the ATPF over a 35-year period (1985-2020) by utilizing the available Landsat and Sentinel imagery from 1985, 2000, and 2020. Throughout the analysis period, we observed 63% (from 10,886 to 4059 ha) primary and secondary forest loss due to land use change. We identified three primary anthropogenic activities driving these losses, namely, land clearing for plantations and agriculture (3693 ha), coconut plantations (3315 ha), aquaculture (245 ha). We estimated that the largest carbon emissions were caused by coconut plantation conversion, with total carbon emissions of approximately 14.14 Mt CO2-eq. These amounts were almost 4 and 21 times higher than emissions from land clearing and aquaculture, respectively, as substantial soil carbon loss occurs once mangroves get transformed into coconut plantations. While coconut plantation expansion on mangroves could generate significant carbon stock losses and cleared forests become the primary candidate for restoration, our dataset could be useful for future land-based emission reduction policy intervention at a subnational level. Ultimately, our findings have direct implications for current national climate policies, through low carbon development strategies and emission reductions from the land use sector for 2030, as outlined in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). © 2021 by the authors.","Coastal forest; Deforestation; Land cover change; Mangrove forestz; Remote sensing","Agricultural robots; Aquaculture; Carbon; Catchments; Conservation; Emission control; Land use; Runoff; Anthropogenic activity; Emission reduction; Emission reduction policies; Land-cover change; Low-carbon development; Lowland catchment; Secondary forests; Sumatra , Indonesia; Forestry; carbon emission; deforestation; human activity; land cover; Landsat; mangrove; plantation; protected area; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Carbon; Conservation; Conversion; Forestry; Indonesia; Land Use; Plantations; Runoff; Indonesia; South Sumatra; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100855875

However, there still will be the need to introduce carbon into the EAF process either to carburize the steel or to create foaming slag to improve the energy efficiency of the melting process. So, to reach the emission reduction goals set around the world, it will be necessary to substitute fossil charge and injection carbon used in EAF steelmaking with alternative carbon sources. This review presents the recent research on carbon-neutral biomass-based and circular rubber or plastics-based carbon sources and their potential to substitute fossil charge or injection carbon in the EAF process. It also discusses the current state-of-the art and suggests further opportunities and needs for research and development to use alternative carbon sources to produce a really green and carbon neutral and/or fully circular steel. © 2021 by the author.

Recently, there has been significant research into Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology due to its potential for simultaneous bioenergy generation and wastewater treatment. The fundamental physical processes within CW and MFC are highly complementary, and combining them offers a number of tantalising possibilities for greatly improving wastewater treatment methods. Recent findings have demonstrated a number of beneficial symbiotic interactions that improve overall system performance within an integrated CW-MFC system. Notably, CW operation is enhanced by improvements in the electrochemically active bacteria population at the electrode surfaces, consequently boosting wastewater treatment efficiency. Similarly, the MFC can utilise the natural redox gradient present within CW to assist bioelectricity generation. In this review article, the performance of integrated CW-MFC systems was discussed in comparison with both standalone MFC and CW systems based on criteria that the review identified as significant. The review shows that the combination of CW and MFC increases wastewater treatment efficiency by phytoremediation, MFC power generation is enhanced by the action of the wetland plants, and wetland greenhouse gas emissions are reduced due to the dominance of electrogenic bacteria. Consequently, a CW-MFC can achieve higher efficiency for contaminant removal and bioelectricity generation compared to standalone CWs and MFCs. However, in view of the physical size and operational life span of wastewater treatment systems required for domestic or metropolitan applications, the CW-MFCs presented within the literature are small and have only been studied over short periods of time. Large-scale controlled trials and long-term studies are urgently needed to provide more definitive evidence that can enable CW-MFC technology to advance to the point of successful implementation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy generation; Constructed wetland; Microbial fuel cell; Pollutant removal; Sustainability; Wastewater treatment","Bacteria; Bioelectric phenomena; Bioremediation; Electrophysiology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Reclamation; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Contaminant removal; Electrochemically active bacteria; Electrode surfaces; Symbiotic interaction; Symbiotic relationship; Wastewater treatment efficiencies; Wastewater treatment system; Microbial fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099732169

Owing to pioneering work initially in the United States and thereafter in Germany and Japan, increasing focus is on the carbon-ion beam: 12 centers are in operation, with five under construction and three in planning. While the carbon-ion beam has demonstrated unique and promising suitability in laboratory and clinical trials toward the hypofractionated treatment of hypoxic and/or radioresistant cancer, substantial developmental potential remains. Perhaps most notable is the ability to paint LET in a tumor, theoretically better focusing damage delivery within the most resistant areas. However, the technique may be limited in practice by the physical properties of the beams themselves. A heavy-ion synchrotron may provide irradiation with multiple heavy-ions: carbon, helium, and oxygen are prime candidates. Each ion varies in LET distribution, and so a methodology combining the use of multiple ions into a uniform LET distribution within a tumor may allow for even greater treatment potential in radioresistant cancer. © Copyright © 2021 Ebner, Frank, Inaniwa, Yamada and Shirai.","carbon-ion radiotherapy; heavy-ion radiotherapy; helium-ion irradiation; multi-ion radiotherapy; radiation therapy","adenoid cystic carcinoma; Article; brachytherapy; cancer radiotherapy; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; linear energy transfer; microdosimetry; particle therapy; propensity score; radiation dose; radiation dose distribution; relative biologic effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102387780

An economic framework was developed to inform a guideline developed by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to estimate the required level of efficacy necessary for an intervention to be cost-saving in dwellings across England. Meth-ods: An economic modelling framework was built to estimate the incremental costs pre-and post-implementation of interventions designed to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution within dwellings of varying building-related risk factors and profiles. The intervention cost was varied simulta-neously with the relative reduction in symptomatic cases of each health condition to estimate the point at which an intervention may become cost-saving. Four health conditions were considered. Results: People living in dwellings with either an extreme risk profile or usable floor area &lt;90m2 have the greatest capacity to benefit and save National Health Service (NHS) costs from interventions at any given level of effectiveness and upfront cost. Conclusions: At any effectiveness level, the threshold for the upfront intervention cost to remain cost-saving is equivalent across the different home characteristics.

A Renewable Natural Gas Implementation Decision-Making Conceptual Model was created to provide a framework for considering the feasibility of renewable natural gas (RNG) projects and applied to New Jersey, specifically investigating landfills and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Data from the US EPA’s Landfill Methane Outreach Program and New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection Sewage Sludge databases were used to identify seven landfills and 22 WWTPs as possible locations for RNG projects. Landfills were found to have a higher potential for producing RNG, on average potentially producing enough RNG to heat 12,792 homes per year versus 1227 for the average WWTP. Additionally, landfills, while having higher capital expenses, have lower projected payback periods, averaging 5.19 years compared to WWTP’s 11.78 years. WWTPs, however, generally are located closer to existing natural gas pipelines than landfills and when they produce more than 362 million standard cubic feet per year (MMSCFY) of biogas are financially feasible. RNG projects at Monmouth County Reclamation Center, Ocean County Landfill, and Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission WWTP show the greatest potential. Greenhouse gas emission reductions from RNG projects at these facilities utilizing all available biogas would be 1.628 million metric tons CO2 equivalence per year, synonymous to removing over 351,000 passenger vehicles from the road each year. In addition, expanding federal and state incentives to encompass RNG as a heating fuel is necessary to reduce financial barriers to RNG projects throughout the US. Overall, this paper supports the hypothesized conceptual model in examining the feasibility of RNG projects through examples from New Jersey and confirms the potential for RNG production utilizing existing waste streams. © 2021 by the authors.

This includes, for instance, the use of nonfood crops or residual biomass as raw material and a higher potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The present review focuses on the recent progress related to the production of advanced bioethanol, (i) highlighting current results from using novel biomass sources such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and certain industrial residues (e.g., residues from the paper, food, and beverage industries); (ii) describing new developments in pretreatment technologies for the fractionation and conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as the bioextrusion process or the use of novel ionic liquids; (iii) listing the use of new enzyme catalysts and microbial strains during saccharification and fermentation processes. Furthermore, the most promising biore-finery approaches that will contribute to the cost-competitiveness of advanced bioethanol production processes are also discussed, focusing on innovative technologies and applications that can contribute to achieve a more sustainable and effective utilization of all biomass fractions. Special attention is given to integrated strategies such as lignocellulose-based biorefineries for the simultaneous production of bioethanol and other high added value bioproducts. © 2021 by the authors.

Large average reductions are recorded between the stations in each state such as PM10 (−46 to −58%), PM2.5 (−49 to −55%), NO2 (−27 to −58%), NO (−54% to −59%), CO (−4 to −44%), NH3 (−2 to −38%), while a slight increase is observed for O3 (+4 to +6%) during the lockdown period compared to same periods in previous years. Furthermore, PM and air pollutants are significantly reduced during lockdown compared to the respective period in previous years, while a significant increase in pollution levels is observed after the re-opening of economy. The meteorological changes were rather marginal between the examined periods in order to justify such large reductions in pollution levels, which are mostly attributed to traffic-related pollutants (NOx, CO and road-dust PM). The WRF-CHIMERE model simulations reveal a remarkable reduction in PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels over whole Indian subcontinent and mostly over urban areas, due to limitation in emissions from the traffic and industrial sectors. A PM2.5 reduction of −48% was simulated in Delhi in great consistency with measurements, rendering the model as a powerful tool for simulations of lower pollution levels during lockdown period. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Aerosols; Air pollutants; COVID-19; Delhi-NCR; Ground measurements; Remote sensing; WRF-CHIMERE",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096830459

Mesh sieves with different pore sizes were used as primary pretreatment at the start-up-stage of the biological process to separate some POM from the liquid system. The changes in soluble carbohydrates and proteins were monitored to investigate the hydrolysis performance of the sieved POM, with waste activated sludge (WAS) as the control test. The results showed that an average of 35% POM could be entrapped before filtrate mat development. In addition, benefiting from the high polysaccharides concentration, as well as the high availability due to the relatively loose physical structure, a 23% hydrolysis efficiency of POM was obtained, in contrast to that of WAS (3.4%), with a hydrolysis constant of 0.39 h−1. The prominent performance was also attributed to the unique microbial communities having been domesticated at a lower temperature, especially the cellulose-degrading bacteria Paraclostridium and psychrophile Psychrobacter, making up 6.94% and 2.56%, respectively. Furthermore, the potential benefits and application of improved POM hydrolysis by start-up stage recovery via mesh sieves combined with anaerobic fermentation were evaluated, including selective POM entrapment, alleviation of blockage and wear, and a reduction in aeration energy. By the proposed strategy, carbon availability for biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes is anticipated to be improved more economically than that can be achieved by primary clarifier elimination.

High emissions of black carbon (BC) from vehicles are observed at major road intersections, in areas surrounding industrial zones and on highways. Highest emission values from road traffic are observed for carbon monoxide (CO) (14.8 t/d) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ) (7.9 t/d), usually considered as the major traffic pollution tracers. Furthermore, peak values of CO emissions due to personal cars (PCs) are mainly linked to the old age of the vehicle fleet with high emission factors. The highest emitting type of vehicle for BC on the highway is PC (70.2%), followed by inter-communal taxis (TAs) (13.1%), heavy vehicles (HVs) (9.8%), minibuses (GBs) (6.4%) and intra-communal taxis (WRs) (0.4%). While for organic carbon (OC) emissions on the main roads, PCs represent 46.7%, followed by 20.3% for WRs, 14.9% for TAs, 11.4% for GB and 6.7% for HVs. This work provides new key information on local pollutant emissions and may be useful to guide mitigation strategies such as modernizing the vehicle fleet and reorganizing public transportation, to reduce emissions and improve public health. © 2021 by the authors.

Nowhere is this challenge more prominent than in Brazil, where low productivity and environmentally degrading agricultural activities occupy vast areas. We used the emergy synthesis approach, including innovative indices - emergy footprint and carbon-emergy output intensity - to assess and compare the environmental performance of an integrated crop-livestock system to a continuous crop and a continuous livestock system. Our analysis uses survey and empirical case study data from the 2017/18 crop season in Mato Grosso state, Brazil - the largest grain and beef producer in the country. Economic indicators such as gross revenue, production costs and profitability were calculated to complement the sustainability assessments. The emergy indices indicate that integrated crop-livestock system shows a balanced performance between input use and economic and environmental outcomes. In contrast, due to its heavy dependence on external inputs, the cropping system has poor environmental results, but the highest profitability. By excluding these environmental costs, current accounting of soy-corn production in Brazil dramatically overstates its net benefits to society and overall sustainability. The Emergy Sustainability Index for the integrated system was 0.66 and its Net Profit was USD 235.69 ha-1, while for the continuous crop system the values were 0.47 and USD 295 ha−1, respectively. The livestock system performed poorly in both, economic and environmental outcomes, underscoring the need to transition away from existing extensive systems. Livestock shows the highest positive greenhouse gas emissions, 7.98 E−09 tonCO2eq for each joule produced, and Net Loss of USD 0.58 ha-1. These results provide further support for Brazil's investment in integrated systems as part of its climate mitigation and sustainable agricultural development plans and warrant consideration in sustainable agriculture initiatives in other countries where cattle production is widespread. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon; Cerrado; Crop-livestock systems; Emergy synthesis; Sustainable agriculture","Agricultural robots; Costs; Crops; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integrated control; Investments; Land use; Profitability; Agricultural activities; Empirical case studies; Environmental outcome; Environmental performance; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable agricultural development; Sustainable agriculture; Warrant consideration; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094118630

Our models suggest that shocks in Seyfert 2 nuclei have velocities in the range of 50-300 $\rm km \: s^{-1}$ and imply a narrower metallicity range ($0.6 \: \lesssim \: (Z/Z_{\odot }) \: \lesssim \: 1.6$) than those derived using pure photoionization models. Our results indicate that shock velocity in AGNs cannot be estimated using standard optical line ratio diagrams, based on integrated spectra. Our models predict a different temperature structure and $\rm O^{+}$/O and $\rm O^{2+}$/O fractional abundances throughout the NLR clouds than those derived from pure photoionization models, mainly in shock-dominated objects. This suggests that, in order to minimize the shock effects, the combination of emission-lines emitted by ions with similar intermediate ionization potential could be good metallicity indicators. Finally, we derive two calibrations between the N/O abundance ratio and the N2O2 = log([N ii]λ6584/[O ii]λ3727) and N2 = log([N ii]λ6584/H α) indexes which agree with that derived from pure photoionization models. © 2021 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","galaxies: abundances; galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100357108

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic analysis of publications 1954–1956: scientific and semiscientific articles, publications of C.-N. Martin and contemporary newspaper articles, especially from the Asia–Pacific region. Findings: First, epistemological and scientific reasoning about the likelihood of extreme natural events aligned to political convictions and pressure. Second, a geographical and social distribution of arguments: the relativizing “energy argument” prevailed in English-language scientific journals, while the “precautionary argument” dominated in popular journals and newspapers published worldwide. Third, while the “energy argument” attained general scientific consensus within two years, it lost out in the long run. The proponents of the “precautionary argument” raised relevant research questions that, though first rejected in the 1950s, later exposed the fallacies of the “energy argument” (shown for the case of the climatologist William W. Kellogg). Originality/value: In contrast to the existing secondary literature, this paper presents a balanced view of the weaknesses and strengths of two lines of arguments in the 1950s. Further, this historical study sheds light on how once-discarded scientific theories may ultimately be reconsidered in a completely different political and scientific context, thus justifying the original precautionary argument. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","C.-N.

In China, the government immediately implemented lockdown measures to curb the spread of this virus. These measures severely affected transportation and industrial production across the country, resulting in a significant change in the concentration of air pollutants. In this study, the Euclidean distance method was used to select the most similar meteorological field during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Changes in the concentration of air pollutants in China were analyzed under similar meteorological background conditions. Results indicate that, compared with data from 2015-2019, air quality in China significantly improved; with the exception of ozone (O3), the concentration of major air pollutants declined. Compared with baseline conditions, the reduction of air pollutants in China from 25 January to 22 February 2020 (Period 2) was the most significant. In particula r, NO2 decreased by 41.7% in the Yangtze River Delta. In Period 2, the reduction of air pollutants in areas other than Hubei gradually decreased, but the reduction of NO2 inWuhan reached 61.92%, and the reduction of air pollutants in various regions after February 23 was significantly reduced. By excluding the influence of meteorological factors and calculating the contribution of human activities to atmospheric pollutants by linear fitting, in Period 2 the effect of artificial controls on NO2 in Wuhan attained 30.66%, and reached 48.17% from 23 February to 23 March (Period 3).

In this context, the development of green infrastructures has gained interest for providing new win-win solutions for improving air quality and urban climate. In the present work, we have characterized an innovative, engineered green infrastructure, the CityTree (CT), in a real urban setting. Abatement rate of priority pollutants (PMx, NOx, black carbon) by a CT unit was determined, during three intensive field campaigns in the city of Modena (Italy). The measurements of the air filtered through the CT (active mode) showed significant reductions in particulate matter concentration: 19–23% for PM10 aerosol mass, 15–20% for PM2.5, 11–13% for PM1, 38% for ultrafine particle number concentration and 17% for black carbon concentration. The measurements in passive mode (with ventilation off) enabled the estimation of the deposition velocities of aerosol particles and gases onto the device surface. The average deposition velocities for PM10 and NOx observed for the CT mosses fall in the range reported in the scientific literature for other types of green surfaces (e.g., grass lawns, hedges). A comparison of the pollutant removal efficiency between passive and active CT mode was performed. The aerosol removal efficiency of the CT resulted from ~3 to almost 20 times higher in filtration than in deposition mode, according to the selected aerosol parameter. These results indicate that moss bio-filters can be more effective in removing air pollutants than standard green infrastructures for in situ applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Filtration system; Nature-based solutions; Nitrogen oxides; Particles deposition; Traffic air pollution","Aerosols; Air quality; Carbon; Deposition; Efficiency; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Aerosol parameters; Deposition velocities; Green infrastructure; Particulate Matter; Pollutant removal efficiency; Priority pollutants; Scientific literature; Ultrafine particle number; Passive filters; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; filtration; particulate matter; pollutant removal; street canyon; urbanization; ventilation; aerosol; air conditioning; air pollutant; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Italy; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; urban area; velocity; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Modena; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100051151

This interval includes the Miocene climatic optimum (MCO) and the Miocene climatic transition (MCT) at 14.8–12.0 Ma. Here we study the pollen record from marine strata in eight wells and sections (Hevlín, Slup, Medlov, Iváň, Lomnice, Židlochovice, Baden Soos, and Devínska Nová Ves) including a total of 92 samples. The standard pollen diagrams are simultaneously analysed using the Palaeotropical/Arctotertiary concept (P/A), synthesized diagrams, coexistence approach, and a technique allowing to reconstruct diversity of plant functional types in order to unravel climate changes and their impact on the biosphere. Warmest climate conditions supporting a diverse, thermophilous mixed mesophytic forest vegetation with a high proportion of broadleaved evergreen PFTs persisted in the neighbouring continental parts during the Karpatian to Early Badenian (NN4-NN5 biozone) representing the MCO. Evidence for the MTC and subsequent cooling (NN5 and NN6 at ca. 14 Ma) comes from lower percentages of thermophilous and evergreen elements and higher diversity of deciduous PFTs in the ecospectra (Devínska Nová Ves, NN6 biozone). Inferred annual precipitation rates above 800 mm and the almost continuous presence subtropical swamp tree pollen point to the persistence of overall humid climate conditions in the study area. Reconstructed precipitation data and the presence of drought-tolerant plant functional types (PFTs) point to a seasonal climate. The studied records partly show shorter term cyclic changes in climate and plant diversity related to glacial events in the Langhian. Using the proportion of broadleaved evergreen versus broadleaved deciduous tree diversity as indicator for temperature changes, several alternations of warmer and cooler phases are obvious from the record. Moreover, sedimentary facies plays an important role for quality and resolution of terrestrial signals in marine strata. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Central Paratethys; Miocene climatic optimum/transition; palaeoclimate; palaeovegetation; palynology","climate change; landscape evolution; marine sediment; Miocene; paleoclimate; palynology; Paratethys; pollen; vegetation dynamics; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097497824

The bill stipulated the implementation of community scale monitoring and the development of local emissions reductions plans. We aimed to develop a streamlined, robust, and accessible PM2.5 exposure assessment approach to support environmental justice analyses. We sought to characterize individual PM2.5 exposure over multiple 24-hr periods in the inland Southern California region, which includes the underserved community of San Bernardino, CA. Personal sampling took place over five weeks in the spring of 2019, and personal PM2.5 exposure was monitored for 18 adult participants for multiple, consecutive 24-hr periods. Exposure and location data were analyzed at 5-second resolution, and participant data recovery was 50.8% on average. A spatial clustering algorithm was used to classify data points as one of seven microenvironments. Mean and median personal-ambient PM2.5 ratios were aggregated along SES lines for eligible datasets. GIS-based spatial clustering facilitated efficient microenvironment classification for more than 900,000 data points. Mean (median) personal-ambient ratios ranged from 0.26 (0.14) to 2.78 (0.65) for each microenvironment when aggregated along SES-lines. Aggregated ratios indicated that participants from the lowest SES community experienced higher home exposures compared to participants of all other communities over consecutive 24-hr monitoring periods, despite high participant mobility and relatively low variability in ambient PM2.5 during the study. The methods described here highlight the robust and accessible nature of the personal sampling campaign, which was specifically designed to reduce participant fatigue and engage members of the inland Southern California community who may experience barriers when engaging with the scientific community.

Management of irrigation and compost may be used to tackle this issue. Crop models are the powerful tools that could predict grain yield (GY) and water productivity (WP) under a broad range of irrigation, compost and temperature interactions. In addition, modeling irrigation management requires the selection of the most suitable evapotranspiration (ET) approach to achieve robust simulations. To achieve this goal, two crop models in Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) (i.e. CERES-Wheat and N-Wheat), were calibrated and evaluated using a field dataset of three growing seasons in a high-temperate region in Egypt (Luxor). Then, the models were applied to explore GY and WP across a wide range of irrigation (11 options) and compost (8 rates) interactions using two ET routines such as Priestley-Taylor (PT) and FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (PM). The models were also used to predict (GY) and (WP) within the same range of irrigation and compost interactions at higher temperatures (i.e. +1,2,3 and 4) compared to the baseline outputs (1981–2010). Simulation results showed that, deficit irrigation up to 80% and 85% from soil available water achieved the highest values of GY (7.5 t ha-1) and WP (18.4 kg ha-1 mm-1) respectively, provided that using higher rate of compost (12 t ha-1). Rising temperature up to 4 °C decreased GY and WP by 17.2% and 7.4% respectively relative to the baseline without any benefits from compost.

The input of Pd in the rainfall-runoff is an important contributing factor to the accumulation of Pd in receiving water bodies. In this study, the Meishe River in Haikou, Hainan Province, China, was used as the research area, and palladium (Pd) was selected as the target pollutant. This study explored the response of Pd in the receiving water body to rainfall-runoff and to analyze the influencing factors. The results showed that the dissolved Pd concentration in the receiving water body had a corresponding relationship with that in rainfall-runoff. The response of suspended Pd in the receiving water body to rainfall-runoff was closely related to the location of the drainage outlet. Compared with that of suspended Pd, the response of dissolved Pd in the receiving water body to that in the rainfall-runoff was more obvious. Seven meters downstream from the outfall was the most sensitive response distance of dissolved Pd in receiving water bodies to rainfall-runoff, and the response time was approximately 0–10 min. The suspended Pd at 3 m downstream from the outfall also had a certain response to the rainfall-runoff, and the response time was approximately 15–25 min. The response time of the suspended Pd in the receiving water body depended largely on the first flush ability of the runoff. There was a moderately positive correlation between the dissolved Pd and Cl− in the receiving water body (r = 0.687; p &lt; 0.05). The effects of pH, Eh, and total suspended solids (TSS) on suspended Pd were reduced in the response process of the receiving water body. The synergistic effect of multiple factors increased the uncertainty of the Pd response. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Influencing factors; Palladium; Rainfall-runoff; Receiving water body; Response","catalysis; drainage water; emission inventory; palladium; pollutant transport; rainfall-runoff modeling; suspended load; water pollution; water quality; palladium; rain; water; China; environmental monitoring; water flow; water pollutant; China; Environmental Monitoring; Palladium; Rain; Water; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095429248

Nowadays, urban emission estimates are mainly based on bottom-up calculation approaches with high uncertainties. A reliable and long-term top-down measurement approach could reduce the uncertainty of these emission inventories significantly.</p> We present the Munich Urban Carbon Column network (MUCCnet), the world's first urban sensor network, which has been permanently measuring GHGs, based on the principle of differential column measurements (DCMs), since summer 2019. These column measurements and column concentration differences are relatively insensitive to vertical redistribution of tracer masses and surface fluxes upwind of the city, making them a favorable input for an inversion framework and, therefore, a well-suited candidate for the quantification of GHG emissions.</p> However, setting up such a stationary sensor network requires an automated measurement principle. We developed our own fully automated enclosure systems for measuring column-averaged CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span>, CH<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">4</span> and CO concentrations with a solar-tracking Fourier transform spectrometer (EM27/SUN) in a fully automated and long-term manner.

These results include the seasonal cycle of CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> since 2015, as well as concentration gradients between sites upwind and downwind of the city.

By correlating the CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> column concentration gradients to the traffic amount, we demonstrate that our network is capable of detecting variations in urban emissions.</p> The measurements from our unique sensor network will be combined with an inverse modeling framework that we are currently developing in order to monitor urban GHG emissions over years, identify unknown emission sources and assess how effective the current mitigation strategies are. In summary, our achievements in automating column measurements of GHGs will allow researchers all over the world to establish this approach for long-term greenhouse gas monitoring in urban areas. © Author(s) 2021.

The objective is to unveil a governance framing that unmasks how cities shape their climate leadership discourse according to their governance aspirations and capacity. By looking at the adaptations across cities' discourses, this research acknowledges the need to confront the limitations and challenges that cities encounter to effectively contribute to global climate governance. It suggests that a governance framing exposes these challenges by showing the different realities of cities when they highlight particular governance modes in their discourse. The methodology combines critical discourse analysis and corpus techniques to analyse a total of 18 campaigns in different temporal, geographical and political contexts. EMW's discourse issued at European level is used as the reference corpus to examine how cities reframe their discourse by weakening or strengthening two governance modes characterised as an action-taking approach that focuses on the steering role of government, and a decision-making approach that highlights the city's interdependencies in a societal context. Learning more about discourse as a vindicator of governance modes in urban climate governance can contribute to a better understanding of how climate transitions are actually put into practise. The research suggests that climate leadership attributed to cities is in fact a complex and dynamic reality that has to be cautiously examined in order to understand the challenges of climate transitions. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","city; climate change; discourse; framing; governance","climate change; decision making; global climate; governance approach; state role; urban climate; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088826844

Objectives: We aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of using grassland-forest ecotone trees to reconstruct spatial and temporal properties of the historical fire regime in a complex landscape of montane forests and adjacent grasslands. Methods: We sampled and crossdated fire-scarred trees along ecotones and compared variations in historical fire occurrence within and among nine adjoining valle basins in a 10,158 ha landscape. We analyzed fire year extensiveness, climate regulation, and the occurrence of consecutive fire years. Results: The resulting tree-ring record covers 1240–2005 AD, with 296 trees recording 125 replicated fire years during the analysis period 1601–1902 AD. Mean fire intervals for all events recorded on two or more trees ranged from 4.7 to 13.6 years in individual valles, and a mean of 2.4 ± 1.7 (SD) years at the landscape scale. Between 1660 and 1902, extensive fires occurring in six or more valles occurred 15 times, on average at ~ 17-year intervals; 29 moderately widespread fires (3–5 valles) occurred during this period, at 8.7 year intervals on average. Widespread events occurred in years with a significantly lower Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) preceded by years of significantly positive PDSI, indicating conditions favorable for fine fuel production. Spatial reconstruction of fire extent revealed multiple occurrences of consecutive-year fires burning non-overlapping areas, associated with persistent low PDSI anomalies preceded by positive conditions in antecedent years. Conclusions: A landscape spatiotemporal approach to reconstructing fire regimes of montane forest-grassland complexes provides a valuable baseline for guiding prescribed and natural fire management at large spatial scales. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Contingent causation; Dendroecology; Fire scars; Fire-climate; Forest-grassland ecotone; Fuel dynamics; Landscape fire; Spatial reconstruction; Top-down/bottom-up regulation","ecotone; fire history; fire management; forest ecosystem; grassland; landscape ecology; montane forest; New Mexico; United States; Valles Caldera; Valles Caldera National Preserve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100320504

However, it is not yet elucidated clearly how to detect the parameter rapidly and reliably in the rice straw feeding reactor. Co-inoculated with ruminal digesta and anaerobic sludge, the digestion performance was studied at three different organic loading rates (OLRs). The excitation emission matrix–parallel factor analysis (EEM–PARAFAC) was used to detect dynamic changes in the characteristic of fluorescence components. Our results revealed that CH4 productivity reached 280.90 mL/g volatile solid (VS) with a 54.39% CH4 content under the OLR of 2.26 g/(L⋅d), which amount to 80.29% of its theoretical value. At the OLR of 2.47 g/(L⋅d), the average accumulated NH4+ concentration was 1082.63 mg/L, which resulted in the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales decreasing from 1.70 × 109 to 1.04 × 106 copies/g in the solid residues, whereas the acetotrophic Methanosarcinales increased from 7.89 × 106 to 9.44 × 106 copies/g. The dynamics of the methanogenic community consequently influenced the bioconversion efficiency of rice straw, and CH4 productivity was reduced to 256.54 mL/g VS. The three fluorescent components, at the excitation/emission wavelength of 420 nm/470 nm, 340 nm/430 nm, and 280 nm/340 nm, were decomposed by PARAFAC model in the digestate. Fluorescence intensities of coenzyme F420 and NADH reflected the dynamic changes of CH4-producing activity and anaerobic digestion efficiency, respectively. The coenzyme F420, unique to hydrogenotrophic methanogens, was correlated with methane yield, suggesting they played a dominant role in the anaerobic reactor. This study demonstrates that the EEM–PARAFAC combined with Q-PCR can be used to characterize methanogenic activity variation during the high-solid anaerobic digestion of rice straw with 15% total solid (TS). © Copyright © 2021 Deng, Li, Ruan and Huang.","anaerobic digestion; coenzyme F420; excitation emission matrix; methanogenic activity; rice straw","biogas; anaerobic digestion; Article; biotransformation; chemical oxygen demand; DNA extraction; elemental analysis; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence intensity; hydrogenotrophic methanogen; hydrolysis; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; parallel factor analysis; physical chemistry; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; spectrofluorometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101669368

The Paris Agreement states that to stabilise temperatures we must reach a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the second half of this century. Consequently, many countries have adopted overall GHG reduction targets (e.g. EU, at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990). However, using conventional metric-equivalent emissions (CO2-e GWP100) as the basis to account for emissions does not result in capturing the effect on atmospheric warming of changing emission rates from short-lived GHG (e.g. methane: CH4), which are the main source of GHG emissions by small ruminants. This shortcoming could be solved by using warming-equivalent emissions (CO2-we, GWP*), which can accurately link annual GHG emission rates to its warming effect in the atmosphere. In our study, using this GWP∗ methodology and different modelling approaches, we first examined the historical (1990-2018) contribution of European dairy small ruminant systems to additional atmosphere warming levels and then studied different emission target scenarios for 2100. These scenarios allow us to envision the necessary reduction of GHG emissions from Europe's dairy small ruminants to achieve a stable impact on global temperatures, i.e. to be climatically neutral. Our analysis showed that, using this type of approach, the whole European sheep and goat dairy sector seems not to have contributed to additional warming in the period 1990-2018. Considering each subsector separately, increases in dairy goat production has led to some level of additional warming into the atmosphere, but these have been compensated by larger emission reductions in the dairy sheep sector. The estimations of warming for future scenarios suggest that to achieve climate neutrality, understood as not adding additional warming to the atmosphere, modest GHG reductions of sheep and goat GHG would be required (e.g. via feed additives). This reduction would be even lower if potential soil organic carbon (SOC) from associated pastures is considered. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Primarily of local origin, biogenic VOCs exhibited notable seasonal and interannual variations, related to temperature and solar radiation. Anthropogenic compounds showed increased concentrations in winter (JFM months) followed by a decrease in spring/summer (AMJ/JAS months) and higher winter concentration levels in 2013 than in 2014 by up to 0.3 μg m-3 in the cases of propane, acetylene and benzene. OVOC concentrations were generally high in summertime, mainly due to secondary anthropogenic/biogenic and primary biogenic sources, whereas their lower concentrations during autumn and winter were potentially more influenced by primary/secondary anthropogenic sources. Moreover, an apportionment factorial analysis was applied to a database comprising a selection of 14 individual or grouped VOCs by means of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) technique. A PMF five-factor solution was taken on. It includes an anthropogenic factor (which contributed 39 % to the total concentration of the VOCs selected in the PMF analysis) connected to the regional background pollution, three other anthropogenic factors (namely short-lived anthropogenic sources, evaporative sources, and long-lived combustion sources, which together accounted for 57 %) originating from either nearby or more distant emission areas (such as Italy and south of France), and a local biogenic source (4 %). Variations in these main sources impacting VOC concentrations observed at the Ersa station were also investigated at seasonal and interannual scales. In spring and summer, VOC concentrations observed at Ersa were the lowest in the 2-year period, despite higher biogenic source contributions. During these seasons, anthropogenic sources advected to Ersa were largely influenced by chemical transformations and vertical dispersion phenomena and were mainly of regional origins. During autumn and winter, anthropogenic sources showed higher contributions when European air masses were advected to Ersa and could be associated with potential emission areas located in Italy and possibly more distant ones in central Europe. Higher VOC winter concentrations in 2013 than in 2014 could be related to contribution variations in anthropogenic sources probably governed by their emission strength with external parameters, i.e. weaker dispersion phenomena and the pollutant depletion. High-frequency observations collected during several intensive field campaigns conducted at Ersa during the three summers 2012-2014 confirmed findings drawn from bi-weekly samples of the 2-year period in terms of summer concentration levels and source apportionment. However, they also suggested that higher sampling frequency and temporal resolution, in particular to observe VOC concentration variations during the daily cycle, would have been necessary to confirm the deconvolution of the different anthropogenic sources identified following the PMF approach. Finally, comparisons of the 25 months of Ersa observations with VOC measurements conducted at 17 other European monitoring stations highlighted the representativeness of the Ersa station for monitoring seasonal variations in VOC regional pollution impacting continental Europe. Nevertheless, VOC winter concentration levels can significantly vary between sites, pointing out spatial variations in anthropogenic source contributions. As a result, Ersa concentration variations in winter were more representative of VOC regional pollution impacting central Europe. Moreover, interannual and spatial variations in VOC winter concentration levels were significantly impacted by synoptic phenomena influencing meteorological conditions observed in continental Europe, suggesting that short observation periods may reflect the variability of the identified parameters under the specific meteorological conditions of the study period. © Author(s) 2021.",,"annual variation; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); seasonal variation; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; volatile organic compound; Corse; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100671873

The use of a dynamic unobserved component approach and a time-varying parameter model enable estimation of the short run dynamics of energy convergence over the extended period 1960–2017. To date, this type of analysis has not received enough attention in the literature. The results reveal the existence of cross-state links in the fluctuations of CO2 emissions, although the degree to which a good part of the states are co-moving is weak. We also find that cyclical convergence patterns differ considerably in both the level and trajectories across the US states. The difficulties in increasing synchronization of the US CO2 emissions highlight the importance of the states to lead climate change mitigation actions.

World electricity generation is still largely based on the burning of fossil fuels. However, Brazil has already a very low electricity carbon intensity due to the country’s large hydropower capacity. In countries with low grid carbon intensities such as Brazil, the investment in photovoltaic solar systems (PVSS) even if it is cost-effective, might become challenging as any new generation competes essentially against other renewable generation and the carbon offset is not a key driver for investment anymore. This study builds further upon that case to examine if national renewable energy incentives could actually lead to an increase of global net carbon emissions from the installation of PVSS in countries with a low grid carbon intensity. The study presents a life cycle analysis (LCA) of ten photovoltaic systems representative of the different operational conditions in regions across Brazil. It was found that the average energy payback time of the studied PV plants is between 3 and 5 years of operation. This result shows the feasibility and viability of such investments in the Brazilian context. When the LCA was integrated into the analysis though, the results showed that the “local” direct emissions avoidance from two out of ten studied PV plants would not manage to offset their “global” life cycle emissions due to the 2020 projected Brazilian grid emission factor which is already low. It is important to recognize that public policies of unrestricted, unconditional stimulus to photovoltaic systems investment might not help towards reducing global net emissions when the PV systems are installed at countries with a low carbon emission electric matrix. That is also something to consider for other countries as the carbon intensity of their grids will start reducing at levels similar to Brazil’s. It is likely that in the near future, the real net carbon offset achieved by PV systems at the global level will be largely defined by the manufacture procedures and the production’s carbon intensity at the country of origin of the PV panels. © 2021 by the authors.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action, and pose a challenge for HEIs as for the efforts made to fulfill them and knowing how to assess their performance. However, the metric management system implemented by HEIs quickly led to rankings emerging, which compare HEIs to metrics not related to the sustainability dimensions of the 17 SDGs. The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of reporting and alignment of SDG achievements with the overall the Times Higher Education (THE)ranking score. For this purpose, our study (i) models and quantifies the impact of HEIs’ disclosure of SDG information on HEIs’ overall THE Impact Rankings score, (ii) analyzes whether the best ranked universities are indeed significantly related to different SDGs than other not-so-well-ranked ones, and (iii) models the differences in the overall score and its alignment with distinct SDGs by dimensions, subjects, and geographical regions. In order to do so, a descriptive analysis, non-parametric tests, and linear and logistic regression analyses were performed. Our results reveal that the overall ranking is related to the reporting of HEIs’ SDG achievements. Moreover, the more positive actions related to health, education, industry, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and partnerships there were, the higher the position of HEIs in the general ranking was. However, we found differences between top-ranking universities and others in geographical location, disclosed information, and impact. Thus, the best-ranked universities are more committed to transferring knowledge to industry to satisfy its needs (SDG9), support strong institutions in their countries, and promote peace and justice (SDG16). Finally, SDG9 and SDG17 are the most relevant and constant SDGs when modeling the alignment of SDGs with HEIs’ dimensions (teaching, research, citations, industry income, international outlook) and subjects (technological and social sciences and humanities). HEIs integrating SDG actions into the strategic management of universities and, consequently, reporting their SDG performance to promote sustainability and contribute to sustainable development, is advisable. © 2021 by the authors.

The increased structural flexibility of these aircraft has reignited concerns related to aeroelastic instabilities, such as flutter. Improving the techniques and methods used in aircraft certification flights is an important concern of the aeronautical community, because current standards and procedures do not provide recommendations and guidelines for aircraft with a high degree of flexibility. The techniques traditionally used in commercial airplanes cannot be used in this new aircraft concept, because they have a high degree of non-linearity in their flight dynamics. Current research indicates an increasing awareness about the importance of vision in the monitoring of UAV structural health. This work presents a new methodology to measure natural frequencies of aeronautical structures using a computer vision system. We also discusses new approaches to sense and acquire vibration data on aeroelastic certification flights test. These new approaches aim to reduce both the time required to identify the aeroelastic phenomenon and the size of the hardware that must be boarded on the aircraft, thus minimizing the risks and costs of the vibration tests. The advance of computer vision systems enables the use of cameras as a motion tracker sensor with millimeter precision and accuracy. Non-contact sensors are suitable for flutter analysis because they do not interfere with the dynamics of the aircraft. Therefore, this new methodology is able to process the obtained images and provide the user with the data about movements in a ready to use vector, at a reasonable cost. Using the data provided by this methodology the natural frequencies of the first bending modes were identified. This new methodology can be a user-friendly tool to support the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency - ANAC program called iBR 2020, which aims to certify small aircraft. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.","Aeroelastic certification; Aeroelastic testing; Computer Vision; Flexible aircraft; Image Processing; Laser; Modal testing; Operational Modal Analysis; Vibration Sensing Method; Vibration sensor","Aeroelasticity; Air transportation; Aircraft; Energy utilization; Flight dynamics; Flutter (aerodynamics); Motion tracking; NASA; Natural frequencies; Structural health monitoring; Aeroelastic instabilities; Aeroelastic phenomenon; Aeronautical structures; Computer vision system; Computer vision techniques; Degree of non-linearity; Reduce energy consumption; Structural flexibilities; Computer vision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090845921

To identify factors that control the strength of this benthic-pelagic coupling we measured sediment characteristics, solute fluxes, and porewater nutrient profiles in spring along a south - north transect in the North Sea crossing distinct regions: the shallow Oyster Grounds closest to the Dutch shore, the shallow Dogger Bank, the 80-m deep central North Sea, and the 150-m deep Fladen Grounds between the north of Scotland and Norway. The data were used to constrain rates of different mineralization processes with the 1-D diagenetic model (OMEXDIA). Surprisingly, we found no major differences in the biogeochemical signature along the 670 km long North Sea transect, despite sediments ranging in median grainsize from 25 to 217 μm, and a permeability range &gt;3 orders of magnitude. Total carbon mineralization ranged between 4 and 13.5 mmol C m−2 d−1, and decreased significantly northward. Oxic mineralization was the dominant mineralization process in all studied sites. Finest, least permeable sediments were found in the Fladen Grounds where highest denitrification rates were recorded, linked to high nitrate concentrations in the overlying water. The coarsest, most permeable sediments of the shallow Dogger Bank represented a transition area between the Oyster Grounds, where oxic mineralization was highest (75–90%), and the central North Sea samples, where anoxic mineralization increased relative to oxic mineralization due to higher bioturbation rates (oxic: 59–72%, anoxic: 27–39%). Overall, denitrification rates increased, while phosphorus removal tended to decrease northward. This contrasting behaviour in nitrogen and phosphorus removal was identified as a possible cause for decreasing DIN:DIP ratios in the water column towards the north. © 2020 The Authors","Diagenetic modelling; North sea; Nutrient exchange; Sediment biogeochemistry; Shelf sea","benthic-pelagic coupling; biogeochemistry; bioturbation; concentration (composition); denitrification; nitrate; nitrogen; numerical model; organic matter; pollutant removal; Atlantic Ocean; Dogger Bank; North Sea; Scotland; United Kingdom; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098157661

CO2 was injected 3 m deep into the seafloor at 120 m depth. With increasing mass flow an increasing number of vents were observed, distributed over an area of approximately 3 m. In situ profiling with microsensors for pH, T, O2 and ORP showed the geochemical effects are localized in a small area around the vents and highly variable. In measurements remote from the vent, the pH reached a value of 7.6 at a depth of 0.06 m. In a CO2 venting channel, pH reduced to below 5. Steep temperature profiles were indicative of a heat source inside the sediment. Elevated total alkalinity and Ca2+ levels showed calcite dissolution. Venting decreased sulfate reduction rates, but not aerobic respiration. A transport-reaction model confirmed that a large fraction of the injected CO2 is transported laterally into the sediment and that the reactions between CO2 and sediment generate enough heat to elevate the temperature significantly.

Research has shown that N2O emissions from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cropping systems can be reduced with the use of fertilisers coated with nitrification inhibitors, or by sowing legume crops in the fallows between sugarcane crop cycles. However, the efficacy of these two N management strategies across different climatic zones is still unclear, as results from field studies have been contradictory. The objectives of this study were therefore to use the DayCent model to assess the long-term effects of the two strategies (separately or in combination) on N2O emissions, N losses and yields. The model was parameterised using data from eight field experiments (39 treatments) conducted across four of the five main districts of the Australian sugarcane industry. A series of long-term scenarios embracing a range of N fertiliser rates (0−160 kg N ha−1 applied as urea), climatic regions (Tropics and Subtropics), soil textures (fine- and coarse-textured soils) and N-loss risk scenarios (crop fertilised well before or close to the on-set of the wet season) were tested for both N management strategies. Simulations identified that the combined use of soybean (Glycine max L.) fallows and N fertiliser coated with the 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) nitrification inhibitor was the most effective strategy to maintain or even increase current yields while significantly reducing N2O and cumulative N (mainly due to nitrate) losses. When used alone, the soybean fallow strategy on average reduced N losses over the entire crop cycle by 29 % compared with current industry best practice. However, this strategy showed a limited capacity to reduce N2O emissions over the entire cane crop cycle (median: -3% compared with current industry best practice), or even increased them in scenarios at high-risk of N losses in the Tropics. The use of urea coated with DMPP alone allowed current fertiliser N rates to be reduced by 30 % without any substantial yield penalty. In environments prone to high N losses, DMPP urea abated overall N losses and N2O emissions by 41 % and 30 %, respectively.

Colombo, Sri Lanka was recently declared as one of the eighteen global Ramsar wetland cities. The current study represents the first attempt to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks held by the urban freshwater wetlands in Colombo. The study focused on the extensive urban wetland ecosystems of Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park. SOC stocks were determined using three parameters: depth of soil, bulk density, and SOC concentration. Loss on ignition method was used in quantifying SOC concentrations. Average SOC stocks, up to a depth of 60 cm at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park were estimated at 504 ± 14 t C/ha and 550 ± 23 t C/ha, respectively. Furthermore, the total SOC stock at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park were estimated at 198,408 ± 5564 t CO2eq and 66,313 ± 2764 t CO2eq, respectively. When considering global estimates, it was found that freshwater wetlands in Colombo hold a higher SOC stock than tropical wet forests and tropical dry forests. The current study highlights the importance of urban ecosystems in mitigating the ever increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. © 2021, The Author(s).","Histosols; Soil organic carbon stock; Tropical urban wetlands","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; estimation method; forest ecosystem; organic carbon; soil carbon; wetland; Colombo [Western Province]; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101678479

To this end, a kharkhona was designed, built and evaluated in an open urban space. Physiological equivalent temperature index, which has been shown to be highly associated with the sensation of thermal comfort, was used as the indicator for evaluation of outdoor thermal condition. The findings showed that kharkhona can reduce the PET index by 9.34 °C in the space inside kharkhona compared to the environment outside the construct and moderate the “hot” and “very hot” heat sensation of the space outside kharkhona to “warm” and “slightly warm” in the inner space of the construct.

Worldwide, communities in areas prone to wildfires may suffer from annual smoke exposure events lasting from days to weeks. In addition, there are many areas of the world where high pollution events are common and where methods employed to reduce exposure to pollution may have relevance to wildfire smoke pollution episodes and vice versa. This article summarizes a recent virtual meeting held by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to share research, experiences, and other information that can inform best practices for creating clean air spaces during wildland fire smoke events. The meeting included presentations on the public health impacts of wildland fire smoke; public health agencies' experiences and resilience efforts; and methods to improve indoor air quality, including the effectiveness of air filtration methods [e.g., building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and portable, free-standing air filtration systems]. These presentations and related research indicate that filtration has been demonstrated to effectively improve indoor air quality during high ambient air pollution events; however, several research questions remain regarding the longevity and maintenance of filtration equipment during and after smoke events, effects on the pollution mixture, and degree to which adverse health effects are reduced. © Copyright © 2021 Davison, Barkjohn, Hagler, Holder, Coefield, Noonan and Hassett-Sipple.","indoor air filtration; particulate matter; portable air purifier; smoke; wildfire","adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; indoor air pollution; smoke; United States; wildfire; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Smoke; United States; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101899400

The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is one of the world's largest continuous peatland regions and a significant source of methane. We present here, using a novel proxy-based approach, Holocene methane fluxes for the HBL. Paleo-methane fluxes were quantified based on water table depth (WTD), inferred from testate amoeba assemblages in nine peat records. WTDs were reconstructed using a North American transfer function and were used to estimate paleo-methane flux through a linear regression model of contemporary growing season methane fluxes and WTDs from 88 sites across the region. Following HBL peatland initiation in the Middle Holocene, total methane flux is closely related to the increasing area of land emerging from below sea level, controlled by rapid rates of glacial isostatic adjustment. In the Late Holocene, rates of uplift slowed, but methane fluxes remained high due to lower evapotranspiration in a wetter and cooler climate. We estimate that 4.8 ± 1.6 Pg C has been released from HBL peatlands to the atmosphere as CH4 over the last 8,000 years, with an average annual methane emission of 1.1 Tg CH4 yr−1 in the Late Holocene. The values estimated here are broadly consistent with those calculated from other independent methods, on modern and Holocene timescales, demonstrating that testate amoeba records provide an effective approach for scaling local processes to regional paleo-methane emissions. © 2021.

Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are essential tools that can help us better understand carbon cycling in different ecosystems. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the performance of these models in drylands partly due to characterizing the heterogeneity of the vegetation and hydrometeorological conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a DGVM for drylands to facilitate improved understanding of gross primary production (GPP) as one of the important components of the carbon cycle. We performed a sensitivity analysis and calibrated the Ecosystem Demography (EDv2.2) DGVM to simulate GPP in a dryland watershed (Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho) in the western US for the years 2000-2017. GPP capacity and activity were investigated by comparing model simulations with GPP estimated from eddy covariance data (available from 2015-2017) and remote sensing products (2000-2017). Our results show good performance of EDv2.2 at daily timesteps (RMSE≈0.38[kgC/m2/year])between simulated and measured GPP in lower elevations of the watershed. Moreover, remote sensing analysis show that EDv2.2 captures the long-term trends in this ecosystem and performs relatively well in capturing phenometrics (start/end of the season). The performance of the model degrades in more productive sites with greater GPP (located at higher elevations in the watershed). To improve model performance, future studies will need to introduce additional plant functional types for drylands such as our study area, and modify plant processes (e.g., plant hydraulics and phenology) in the model. © 2020","Drylands; Ecosystem demography model; GPP","calibration; carbon cycle; demography; eddy covariance; heterogeneity; performance assessment; primary production; remote sensing; sensitivity analysis; Idaho; Reynolds Creek; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097739681

India is amongst a select group of countries that have experimented with intergovernmental fiscal transfers to support forest conservation. Well-designed transfers have important implications for the achievement of national and international commitments for forest conservation, the well-being of communities and climate mitigation. A substantial amount, USD 51 billion was allocated for devolution from the Union (Government of India) to the subnational (state) governments against the forest cover criteria for the period 2015–2019. Evidence indicates that this substantial devolution did not guarantee fund flows to the forestry sector nor result in an appreciable increase in conservation outcomes in states that benefited the most from the transfers. We conduct an in-depth empirical analysis which demonstrates that the design of the transfer is crucial in determining outcomes. Findings indicate that conservation and afforestation outcomes are likely to be better when the ecological values, the bulk of which are carbon values, are incorporated upfront in financial allocation decisions. Indirectly incentivizing subnational entities by compensating them for maintaining land under forests is a much weaker approach that may not lead to the desired outcomes.

This paper assessed the diversity and carbon storage of trees in Zaria metropolis, North-western Nigeria through fieldwork and allometric equations. A total of 200 assessment plots were randomly generated using Idrisi Terrset software. Quadrats of 30 × 30 m dimension were established and all trees, ≥5 cm diameter were identified and enumerated. Diameter was measured at breast height while tree height was measured with Suunto clinometer. The study recorded 836 stems, belonging to 51 species in 21 families. Species diversity and evenness were considerably high (H’ = 3.30, J = 0.8) with more exotic than native stems. The trees stored 657.05t carbon with the highest proportion contributed by Azadirachta indica, Mangifera indica and Khaya senegalensis. One-way ANOVA revealed significant difference in tree diameter (p < 0.020), basal area (p < 0.008) and height (p < 0.001) across the different land use/cover types but no significant difference in carbon stock (p > 0.657). This study demonstrates the contribution of urban trees in reducing global atmospheric carbon which largely varies with tree species and diameter. © 2021","Aboveground biomass; Carbon stock; Diversity; Exotic species; Native species","aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; equation; fieldwork; native species; species diversity; tree; urban area; Kaduna [Nigeria]; Nigeria; Zaria; Azadirachta indica; Khaya senegalensis; Mangifera indica; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099316354

Land use change alters surface runoff and affects basin-wide hydrological processes and water consumption, while climate change modifies precipitation and temperature patterns and consequently evapotranspiration and water supply. In this study, water yield, supply and consumption are simulated in a watershed draining into the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, using the water yield model in the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Service and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool. The novelty of this study is found in the combined modelling of the impacts of climate and land use change scenarios on water security, translating these results into a water stress indicator, and estimating the associated economic costs of reduced future water supply. The results show substantial spatial variation of the negative impacts of water supply and future water security across the watershed, further increasing the pressure on its inhabitants, their economic activities and ecological values.

With reference to the previous version, a new NOx model has been implemented to improve robustness in terms of NOx prediction. The experimental tests have confirmed the basic functionality of the controller in transient conditions, over different load ramps at fixed engine speeds, over which the average RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values for the control of NOx emissions were of the order of 55-90 ppm, while the average RMSE values for the control of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) were of the order of 0.25-0.39 bar. However, the test results also highlighted the need for further improvements, especially concerning the effect of the engine thermal state on the NOx emissions in transient operation.

Our purpose is to provide a monitoring tool that enables world news to be detected in an SDG-oriented manner, by considering multilingual as well as wide geographic coverage. The association of the goals with news basis the World Bank Group Topical Taxonomy, from which the selection of search words approximates the 17 development goals. News is extracted from The GDELT Project (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) which gathers both printed as well as online news from around the world. 60 851 572 relevant news stories were identified in 2019. The intertwining of world news with SDGs as well as connections between countries are interpreted and highlight that even in the most SDG-sensitive countries, only 2.5% of the news can be attributed to the goals. Most of the news about sustainability appears in Africa as well as East and Southeast Asia, moreover typically the most negative tone of news can be observed in Africa. In the case of climate change (SDG 13), the United States plays a key role in both the share of news and the negative tone. Using the tools of network science, it can be verified that SDGs can be characterized on the basis of world news. This news-centred network analysis of SDGs identifies global partnerships as well as national stages of implementation towards a sustainable socio-environmental ecosystem. In the field of sustainability, it is vital to form the attitudes and environmental awareness of people, which strategic plans cannot address but can be measured well through the news. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate sensitivity; Network analysis; News analysis; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100399560

However, the most important problem of EVs is still range anxiety. The one pedal driving (OPD), which uses only accelerator pedal to accelerate and decelerate the vehicle, is an alternative solution to further increase the energy efficiency by managing the regenerative braking operation of EVs. In this study, OPD algorithms are developed for an electric bus (E-Bus), which is equipped with a 100 kW electric motor. Algorithms manage the vehicle traction torque without compromising the comfort of the passengers in the vehicle. To evaluate the performance of the developed OPD algorithms for the heavy vehicle, experimental studies have been conducted. The energy efficiency performance of OPD has been tested under different speed profiles as urban traffic, constant speed and stop-and-go traffic. The energy recovery potential of OPD algorithms for different experience levels and driving characteristics of drivers, the adaptability of drivers to OPD driving have been examined for heavy electric vehicles first time. The results show that the OPD performs a precise energy efficiency by managing the regenerative braking operation. © 2021 Karabuk University","Electric bus; Energy efficiency; One pedal driving; Regenerative braking; Traction torque management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099441404

As the second largest carbon emission source in the world, the agricultural carbon emission and the environmental improvement value of agricultural carbon reduction (EIVACR) should not be ignored. Based on the theory of resource economic value, the current study divided 31 provincial-level administrative units of China into three major regions. The Super-Efficiency Slacks-Based Measurement (SBM) model, Moran's I index and Markov chain transfer probability matrix method have been employed to examine EIVACR and it's spatial-temporal dynamic evolution characteristics by adopting panel data of 31 provinces from 1997 to 2017. The result indicated that: (i) during the study period, China's average EIVACR showed significant regional differences, accompanied by the gradually strengthening spatial pattern of the “central > western > eastern”; (ii) the average EIVACR increased from 0.970 Million Yuan in 1997 to 1.164 Million Yuan in 2017, increasing by 20% in 21 years; (iii) no spatial correlation or obvious dependence exist between adjacent provinces, but present a negative impact of “high-low” agglomeration in individual years; (iv) the influencing effects of technology adoption and factor allocation have spatial heterogeneity, and the influencing effect of policy orientation has temporal heterogeneity. Therefore, differentiated carbon reduction policies should be formulated according to regional and temporal differences. Meanwhile, carbon reduction market trading mechanism and compensation policy should be established.

To enhance the biological activity and substrate biodegradability, this study applied the synergistic regulation of sucrose (carbon source) and increasing levels of urea (nitrogen source) during the ensiling process of WMS. Compared with the application of only sucrose, a higher organic acid content (lactic acid (85 g/kg-DM) and acetic acid (14 g/kg-DM)) and higher degradation ratios for lignocellulose (hemicellulose (28%), cellulose (22%), and lignin (17%)) were observed with urea applications of 1.7% (DM) and 3.9% (DM), respectively. This was caused by the enhanced activities of the hetero-fermenter (Weissella) and cellulolytic bacteria (Cellulosimicrobium). A simultaneous addition of urea and sucrose during the ensiling of WMS increased the specific methane yield by 11.2%–21.1% in comparison to raw WMS.

Different from previous studies, this article assigns carbon emission allowances to 30 provinces according to the principles of equality, efficiency, and sustainability rather than just using the principles of equality and efficiency. We first apply the entropy method to initially distribute emission allowances to 30 provinces. Then, a zero-sum gains data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model is used to test the efficiency of quota allocation and redistribute the carbon quotas across 30 provinces continuously until the quotas are optimally distributed. The results show that in 2030, Guangxi, Hainan and Shandong have the most emission quotas, while Heilongjiang, Jilin and Qinghai have the least emission quotas. By comparing the quota share of each province in 2017 with 2030, it is found that Hainan, Guangxi and Qinghai located in western China have small emission reduction challenges, while there are great difficulties for provinces Jiangsu, Shanxi and Shandong situated in the central and eastern China to cut down the emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission quota allocation; China's power sector; Sustainability principle; ZSG-DEA","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Emission control; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emissions; Eastern China; Emission allowances; Emission quota; Emission reduction; Entropy methods; Western China; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094565262

In addition to the catalytic converters wear and tear, it is necessary to control air pollutants emitted from LPG vehicles. Therefore, an LPG catalytic converter replacement programme (CCRP) was fulfilled from October 2013 to April 2014 by the Hong Kong government. Roadside volatile compounds (VOCs) were measured by on-line measurement techniques before and after the programme to evaluate the effectiveness of the LPG CCRP. The mixing ratios of total measured VOCs were found decreased from 69.3 ± 12.6 ppbv to 43.9 ± 6.5 ppbv after the LPG CCRP with the decreasing percentage of 36.7%. In addition, the total mixing ratio of LPG tracers, namely propane, i-butane, and n-butane, accounted for 49% of total measured VOCs before the LPG CCRP and the weighting percentage decreased to 34% after the programme. Moreover, the source apportionment of roadside VOCs also reflects the large decreasing trend of LPG vehicular emissions after the air pollution control measure. Due to the application of PTR-MS on measuring real-time VOCs and oxygenated volatile compounds (OVOCs) in this study, the emission ratios of individual OVOCs were investigated and being utilized to differentiate primary and secondary/biogenic sources of roadside OVOCs in Hong Kong. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention programme, and are helpful to further implementation of air pollution control strategies in Hong Kong. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emission ratio; LPG emission; PTR-MS; Secondary source; VOCs","Air pollution control; Air quality; Butane; Catalytic converters; Mixing; Roadsides; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutants; Emission ratio; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Measuring real time; On-line measurement technique; Source apportionment; Vehicular emission; Volatile compounds; Liquefied petroleum gas; butane; liquefied petroleum gas; propane; volatile agent; air quality; engine; liquefied petroleum gas; mass spectrometry; roadside environment; source apportionment; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; air pollution; Article; calibration; catalytic converter replacement programme; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric field; government; Hong Kong; information processing; intervention study; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; priority journal; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097102065

With increase TD temperature, the amount of volatile components gradually decreased. While at &gt; 250 °C, most organic substances and inorganic matter, whose contribution to light absorption was approximately 34%—had been volatilized. In the summer of 2014, the average BC absorption enhancement factor (Eabs) was 1.52 ± 0.57, at Jiangxinzhou site, which may have been significantly affected by locally sourced pollutants. Changes in wind direction and air mass source were found to influence the BC Eabs. Concentration of nitrate and BC, mixing ratio of NOx were found to play important roles in BC absorption enhancement, implying the impact from traffic emissions. The photochemical aging (PCA) has not a certain effect on the light absorption of BC. During the period of the strict emission reduction measures, human activity including vehicle emissions and cooking source contributed to enhance BC absorption. Through the analyses and calculations, it was found that the contributions at 405 nm made by BC, coatings and brown carbon, were 62.7%, 32.0% and 5.3%, respectively. Their contribution may be affected by the emission reduction measures.

Incineration is popularly used in waste treatment worldwide due to its ability to minimize waste volume and generate electricity. Despite its advantages, incineration of waste can still generate large amounts of flue gas, which can be harmful if not handled properly. Therefore, the present study seeks to examine the environmental consequences of incineration in Africa. The study used the most accurate secondary data on the municipal solid waste incineration in 56 African countries from literature for the analysis. Due to data availability, the years 2012 and 2025 are considered for the study. The environmental analysis was based on global warming, acidification, and dioxin emission potentials. The emission of greenhouse gases from the incineration plant was estimated based on the method from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The acid gases and dioxins emissions were evaluated based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors” (Acidification Potential-42). Key findings show that the global warming potential of Seychelles is expected to decline from 200.10 kton CO2eq to 196.18 kton CO2eq in 2025, while that of Saint Helena will be constant at 7.85 kton CO2eq. The study found that except for Seychelles and Saint Helena, the global warming potential of incineration projects in all the countries is expected to increase in 2025 compared to 2012. It was realized that the acidification potential of the project in 2012 ranges from 740.56 kg SO2eq to 4,297,839.96 kg SO2eq, and that of 2025 is expected to be from 740.56 kg SO2eq to 9,449,175.32 kg SO2eq. The results further indicate that South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Nigeria have higher dioxin emission potential in 2012 and 2025 compared to other countries in this study.

The main objective of this work was to study how variegation, pigment composition or reflective features modifies leaves' photophysical behavior. For this purpose, green leaves (Ficus benjamina), purple leaves (Tradescantia pallida), green leaves covered by white trichomes (Cineraria maritima) and variegated leaves (Codiaeum aucubifolium) were analyzed. Firstly, foliar surface morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. UV-vis and near-IR reflectance and transmittance spectra were obtained to calculate absorption (k) and scattering (s) coefficients. The theoretical approaches of Pile of Plates and Kubelka–Munk's theory resulted still valid for nonstandard leaves with differing surface conditions. However, frequently used spectral indices were not reliable for predicting water content, when leaves differed from conventional ones. The proportionality between the absorption factor and chromophore/pigment concentration was also lost for hairy leaves. A simplified model to describe these facts was presented here. Fluorescence spectra were recorded and corrected, due to light re-absorption. Water-optical parameter connection and pigment-optical parameter connection were thoroughly discussed. Leaf surface morphology and pigmentation have not only influenced the optical features of leaves but also played a role in the effect that particulate matter could cause on leaf photosynthesis. © 2020 American Society for Photobiology",,"classification; fluorescence; light; particulate matter; physiology; pigmentation; plant; plant leaf; species difference; surface property; Fluorescence; Light; Particulate Matter; Pigmentation; Plant Leaves; Plants; Species Specificity; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085355180

We estimate emissions of SO2, NOX, and particulate matter 2.5 μm (PM2.5) for each plant and use a chemical transport model to estimate the impact of power plant emissions on ambient PM2.5. Concentration-response functions from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) are used to project the impacts of changes in PM2.5 on mortality. Current plus planned plants will contribute, on average, 13% of ambient PM2.5 in India. This reflects large absolute contributions to PM2.5 in central India and parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain (up to 20 μg/m3). In the south of India, coal-fired power plants account for 20–25% of ambient PM2.5. We estimate 112,000 deaths are attributable annually to current plus planned coal-fired power plants. Not building planned plants would avoid at least 844,000 premature deaths over the life of these plants.

However, these aerosols and their effects remain poorly understood, in part due to the remoteness and limited observations over these regions. In this study, we seek to understand factors that shape marine aerosol size distributions and composition in the northwest Atlantic Ocean region. We use the GEOS-Chem model with the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithm model to interpret measurements collected from ship and aircraft during the four seasonal campaigns of the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) conducted between 2015 and 2018. Observations from the NAAMES campaigns show enhancements in the campaign-median number of aerosols with diameters larger than 3 nm in the lower troposphere (below 6 km), most pronounced during the phytoplankton bloom maxima (May/June) below 2 km in the free troposphere. Our simulations, combined with NAAMES ship and aircraft measurements, suggest several key factors that contribute to aerosol number and size in the northwest Atlantic lower troposphere, with significant regional-mean (40-60-N and 20-50-W) cloud-Albedo aerosol indirect effect (AIE) and direct radiative effect (DRE) processes during the phytoplankton bloom. These key factors and their associated simulated radiative effects in the region include the following: (1) particle formation near and above the marine boundary layer (MBL) top (AIE:-3.37Wm-2, DRE:-0.62Wm-2); (2) particle growth due to marine secondary organic aerosol (MSOA) as the nascent particles subside into the MBL, enabling them to become cloud-condensation-nuclei-sized particles (AIE:-2.27Wm-2, DRE:-0.10Wm-2); (3) particle formation and growth due to the products of dimethyl sulfide, above and within the MBL (-1.29Wm-2, DRE:-0.06Wm-2); (4) ship emissions (AIE:-0.62Wm-2, DRE:-0.05Wm-2); and (5) primary sea spray emissions (AIE: C0.04Wm-2, DRE:-0.79Wm-2). Our results suggest that a synergy of particle formation in the lower troposphere (particularly near and above the MBL top) and growth by MSOA contributes strongly to cloudcondensation-nuclei-sized particles with significant regional radiative effects in the northwest Atlantic.

While literature on ES valuation has grown in recent years, its application to urban contexts is still limited. Twenty-five papers, which include 29 different case studies, carry out an economic valuation and have undergone an in-depth analysis. The papers have been selected out of 80 papers detected through keywords. Six different valuation methodologies have been employed in the case studies. The most common ESs valued at the urban level are air quality regulation, local climate regulation, carbon sequestration and storage, and aesthetic appreciation and inspiration for culture, art, and design. The methodologies recur with different frequencies in the valuation of ESs at the urban level. Choice modeling and contingent valuation methodologies are used to value a variety of ESs, including regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Other methodologies are used to value only specific ESs. The replacement cost and damage cost avoided methodologies are used for the assessment of regulation services only; the travel cost method and contingent valuation are used for cultural services only. The results indicate that the considered valuation methodologies show different levels of appropriateness with respect to specific ES categories. Therefore, there is a need to expand the application of valuation methodologies to capture the value of all ESs provided by natural resources, in order to protect and enhance them. © 2021 by the authors.

Communities have a key role to play in the energy transformation, through the uptake of new technologies and changing how they engage with energy. However, they remain marginalised limiting the broader benefits of meaningful participation such as energy democracy, energy justice and energy citizenship, which may be achieved through transformation. Addressing this problem requires an understanding of how to facilitate empowerment. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this paper synthesises the literature on community empowerment for sustainable transformations. It outlines a conceptualisation of empowerment through its definition, drivers and outcomes. Community empowerment in the energy transformation should be about the community's own goals and transformative action. This view of empowerment can be enabled through a variety of different drivers. Empowerment is identified as a multifaceted concept associated with a range of different outcomes such as participation, agency, autonomy and power-shift. Whilst the four outcomes identified in this review are typically described in isolation; we suggest that they are instead a scale wherein each step is a form of empowerment in its own right and yet represents an overall trajectory of empowerment. Facilitating community empowerment within the energy transformation requires a shift in both research and practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Community energy; Empowerment; Energy democracy; Energy transformation; Sustainable transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098148824

Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions—approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change experiments; Environmental justice; Nature-based solutions; Urban sustainability; Values","academic research; biodiversity; decision making; environmental degradation; environmental justice; governance approach; literature review; sustainability; urban development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092723812

The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate–disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate–disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; disease projections; Ixodes pacificus; Ixodes scapularis; least squares dummy variables; Lyme disease","climate change; disease incidence; disease spread; disease transmission; disease vector; infectious disease; public health; United States; Ixodes pacificus; Ixodes scapularis; Spirochaetales; animal; climate change; forecasting; incidence; Ixodes; Lyme disease; United States; Animals; Climate Change; Forecasting; Incidence; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097026808

However, few empirical studies provide quantitative evidence of how the supply of ecosystem services change along secondary forest succession. The need for such information is particularly pressing for tropical dry forests because of their extensive global coverage and a high degree of disturbance. Here we examine the changes in the potential supply of ecosystem services and the interactions among them along secondary tropical dry forest succession for a site on the Mexican Pacific coast. Using data from a chronosequence of twelve sites followed over ten years, we characterized changes in five ecosystem services along a successional gradient from abandoned farmland to old-growth forests: forage, multiple forest resources, microclimate regulation, carbon storage and carbon sequestration. The long-term recovery trajectory for each service was modelled using linear and non-linear mixed models. Interactions among them were examined over different timeframes using Spearman correlations. The results showed rapid non-linear recovery of multiple forest resources provision, microclimate regulation and carbon storage within the first two decades of succession. Carbon sequestration increased slightly over time, while the supply of forage showed no clear trend. The strength of the interactions among pairs of services changed through successional time, being particularly higher in farmlands and old-growth forests. Our findings suggest that adaptive forest management practices that foster the natural regeneration of tropical dry forests are cost-effective mechanisms to recover the supply of critical ecosystem services for local actors by meeting their livelihood needs as well as those for the global community through climate change mitigation. Maintaining tropical dry forest resilience will highly depend on the maintenance of diversity in terms of species and ecosystem services. © 2020 The Authors","Chronosequence; Climate regulation; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem service indicator; Natural regeneration; Resilience","Carbon capture; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Farms; Natural resources; Recovery; Reforestation; Storage as a service (STaaS); Tropics; Abandoned farmland; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Forest management practices; Natural regeneration; Secondary forest succession; Spearman correlation; Tropical dry forest; Ecosystems; carbon storage; chronosequence; climate change; dry forest; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; forest management; old-growth forest; regeneration; secondary forest; succession; tropical forest; Cost Effectiveness; Natural Reforestation; Natural Resources; Recovery; Tropics; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097545563

LCA approach is used to evaluate and analyse the environmental performance at the power plant global level. A more in-depth study is developed, at the power plant components level, through EEvA. The analysis employs existing published data with a realignment of the inventory to the latest data resource and compares the life cycle impacts of three methods (ILCD 2011 Midpoint, ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint-Endpoint, and CML-IA Baseline) for two different scenarios. In scenario 1, any emission abatement system is considered. In scenario 2, re-injection of CO2 and H2S is accounted for. The analysis identifies some major hot spots for the environmental power plant impacts, like acidification, particulate matter formation, ecosystem, and human toxicity, mainly caused by some specific sources. Finally, an exergo-environmental analysis allows indicating the wells as significant contributors of the environmental impact rate associated with the construction, Operation & Maintenance, and end of life stages and the HP condenser as the component with the highest environmental cost rate. © 2021 by the authors.

Until now, most research carried out has focused on ordinary drivers applying eco-driving techniques on their usual routes. However, there is little research on professional driver couriers. This research is aimed at analyzing the effects that eco-driving has on fuel consumption and GHG emissions on courier deliveries in small cities such as Caceres (Spain). For this purpose, a real-life experiment was performed with professional drivers with Spanish post vans from the public sector company Correos. In the first period, driving was under normal conditions (non-eco), and after a theoretical training eco-driving course, there was a second driving period (eco). Driving parameters (speeds, accelerations, rpm, and consumptions) were recorded on all trips to analyze how effective the eco-driving was. The research concluded that eco-driving training does not correlate with more sustainable driving for professional drivers under pressure with the need to deliver packages on time. However, there is a trend in fuel savings when using higher capacity routes. © 2021 by the authors.

The majority of citizens agrees that scientists should advocate for climate-related policies and work closely with policymakers but refrain from endorsing climate protests.

This work aims to selectively assess the maximum impact that total traffic blocking measures can have on NO2. For this reason, three megacities (London, Milan and Paris) were chosen which had similar characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, population, policies of urban traffic management and lockdown measures. 52 air quality control units have been used to compare data measured in lockdown and in the same periods of previous years, highlighting a significant decrease in NO2 concentration due to traffic (London: 71.1 % - 80.8 %; Milan: 8.6 % - 42.4 %; Paris: 65.7 % - 79.8 %). In 2020 the contribution of traffic in London, Milan and Paris dropped to 3.3 ± 1.3 μg m−3, 6.1 ± 0.8 μg m−3, and 13.4 ± 1.5 μg m−3, respectively. Despite the significant reduction in the NO2 concentration, in UT stations average NO2 concentrations higher than 40 μg m−3 were registered for several days.

Both are complex and urgent problems that demand collective action in the light of their global and trans-boundary scope. In this article we use a geopolitical framework to examine some of the tensions and contradictions in global governance and cooperation that are revealed by the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We argue that the pandemic provides an early warning of the dangers inherent in weakened international cooperation. The world’s states, with their distinct national territories, are reacting individually rather than collectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries have introduced extraordinary measures that have closed, rather than opened up, international partnership and cooperation. Border closures, restrictions on social mixing, domestic purchase of public health supplies and subsidies for local industry and commerce may offer solutions at the national level but they do not address the global strategic issues. For the poorest countries of the world, pandemics join a list of other challenges that are exacerbated by pressures of scarce resources, population density and climate disruption. COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on those living with environmental stresses, such as poor air quality, should guide more holistic approaches to the geopolitical intersection of public health and climate change. By discussing unhealthy geopolitics, we highlight the urgent need for a coordinated global response to addressing challenges that cannot be approached unilaterally. © 2021, World Health Organization.

Despite their global importance, microeukaryote physiology, nutrient metabolism and contributions to carbon cycling across offshore ecosystems are poorly characterized. Here, we observed the prevalence of dinoflagellates along a 4,600-km meridional transect extending across the central Pacific Ocean, where oligotrophic gyres meet equatorial upwelling waters rich in macronutrients yet low in dissolved iron. A combined multi-omics and geochemical analysis provided a window into dinoflagellate metabolism across the transect, indicating a continuous taxonomic dinoflagellate community that shifted its functional transcriptome and proteome as it extended from the euphotic to the mesopelagic zone. In euphotic waters, multi-omics data suggested that a combination of trophic modes were utilized, while mesopelagic metabolism was marked by cytoskeletal investments and nutrient recycling. Rearrangement in nutrient metabolism was evident in response to variable nitrogen and iron regimes across the gradient, with no associated change in community assemblage. Total dinoflagellate proteins scaled with particulate carbon export, with both elevated in equatorial waters, suggesting a link between dinoflagellate abundance and total carbon flux. Dinoflagellates employ numerous metabolic strategies that enable broad occupation of central Pacific ecosystems and play a dual role in carbon transformation through both photosynthetic fixation in the euphotic zone and remineralization in the mesopelagic zone. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Article; biogeochemistry; biomass; carbon cycling; carbon metabolism; chemical modification; dinoflagellate; ecosystem; macronutrient; metatranscriptomics; multiomics; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; nutrition; Pacific Ocean; photosynthesis; phylogeny; prevalence; priority journal; proteomics; seawater upwelling; sequence analysis; taxonomy; transcriptomics; carbon cycle; classification; dinoflagellate; metabolism; Pacific Ocean; parasitology; protozoal protein; sea water; Carbon Cycle; Dinoflagellida; Pacific Ocean; Phylogeny; Protozoan Proteins; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098796633

However, nature’s importance for different people may vary, for social, environmental, and economic rea-sons. In this paper, we explore such differences among people living in communities surrounding the Cunhambebe State Park (PEC), a large area of Atlantic Forest. We assess their perceptions re-garding the plural values of ecosystem services derived from the PEC and explore ways in which this could affect the management of this protected area. Our assumption is that analyzing the perceptions of people who live in the communities surrounding can be a key tool for the formula-tion of proposals to improve management models and address socio-environmental conflicts. Based on interviews, participant observation, and document analysis, our results show a direct link between culture and environment since relational values and cultural ecosystem services are closely related to local people’s valuation of the PEC. Therefore, we support management strategies which are based on local values for land and forest use in a sustainable way. Our findings may contribute to decision making by PEC managers, governments, local stakeholders, and researchers. © 2021 by the authors.

For nine regions covering nearly the whole globe, we collected inventory estimates of carbon-stock changes complemented by satellite estimates of biomass changes where inventory data are missing. The net land-atmospheric carbon exchange (NEE) was calculated by taking the sum of the carbon-stock change and lateral carbon fluxes from crop and wood trade, and riverine-carbon export to the ocean. Summing up NEE from all regions, we obtained a global 'bottom-up' NEE for net land anthropogenic CO2 uptake of -2.2 ± 0.6 PgC yr-1 consistent with the independent top-down NEE from the global atmospheric carbon budget during 2000-2009. This estimate is so far the most comprehensive global bottom-up carbon budget accounting, which set up an important milestone for global carbon-cycle studies. By decomposing NEE into component fluxes, we found that global soil heterotrophic respiration amounts to a source of CO2 of 39 PgC yr-1 with an interquartile of 33-46 PgC yr-1 - a much smaller portion of net primary productivity than previously reported. © 2021 The Author(s).","Carbon budget; human appropriation of ecosystems; soil carbon","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Atmospheric carbon; Carbon budgets; Empirical estimate; Global carbon cycle; Heterotrophic respiration; Inventory data; Mitigation policies; Net primary productivity; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106721167

Its spectral and photophysical properties were studied experimentally and modeled with several relevant quantum-chemical approaches. Single banded, long-wavelength highly Stokes shifted fluorescence phototautomer emission was observed for the title compound in solvents of different polarity. Absence of its short-wavelength “normal” emission band was explained by the effect of ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) with participation of triplet nπ* levels of 4′-nitro group. Such behavior, absence of fluorescence emission below ∼500 nm is generally expected for nitro-aromatics. Thus, a rare example of excited state intramolecular proton transfer reaction (ESIPT) originated from the non-emissive “dark” excited state at conditions of its concurrence with ultrafast ISC should be considered for the title compound. Excited state proton transfer reaction plays in this case the role of an emission regulating factor: the higher is its rate, the more intensive phototautomer fluorescence is observed. Relatively long fluorescence lifetimes of 4′-nitroflavonol in solvents of intermediate polarity (∼ 4 ns) were attributed to low efficiency of radiationless processes in its phototautomer form. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3-hydroxy-chromone; Excited state intramolecular proton transfer reaction; Nitro group; NO2-group triplet nπ* levels; Spin-orbit coupling; Ultrafast intersystem crossing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095740454

Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (Køge Municipality), Germany (Kühlungsborn, Rügen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and Öland), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of ерleagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baltic Sea; Beach cast; Beach wrack; Management; Socio-economic value","Climate change; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economics; Land fill; Laws and legislation; Seawater; Shore protection; Soils; Anthropogenic components; Cleaning operations; Climate change mitigation; Coastal protection; Economic consequences; Economically viable; Sustainable products; Vegetation successions; Beaches",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096917544

This is also the case in Denmark where regulation largely relies on general measures for reducing N inputs. These measures have significantly reduced nitrogen emissions, but further reduction is needed to achieve sustainable low levels of N transport to freshwater and marine ecosystems in compliance with standards set by the EU Water Framework Directive. As an alternative to general regulation, we tested a watershedbased, collaborative planning approach, engaging stakeholders in solution identification. Six watersheds with substantial agricultural production were used as test areas. A collaborative planning process of two stakeholder workshops embedded within a scenario formulation process was executed. Stakeholder inputs about possible, desirable and sustainable futures were used to formulate scenarios, for which N reduction effects were calculated. Upon conclusion of this process, results were assessed using a structured evaluation method. Results indicate that the process we tested was successful in terms of (1) engaging relevant stakeholders, (2) providing relevant data, (3) achieving processual flexibility, (4) including local knowledge and (5) facilitating a creative and explorative process. On this basis, suggestions for improving collaborative planning processes are provided. © 2021 by the authors.

When different plant mutualists are using the same type of cues, such as volatile compounds, attraction of parasitoids and pollinators may trade off. To explore this, we compared volatile emission of Brassica nigra plants in response to single or dual attack on their inflorescences. Additionally, we recorded flower visitation by pollinators and the attraction of parasitoids in the greenhouse and/or field. Brassica nigra were exposed in the flowering stage to one or two of the following three attackers: Brevicoryne brassicae aphids, Pieris brassicae caterpillars, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. raphani bacteria. We found that single attack by caterpillars, and dual attack by caterpillars plus aphids, induced the strongest changes in plant volatile emission. The caterpillars’ parasitoid C. glomerata did not exhibit preference for plants exposed to caterpillars only vs. plants exposed to caterpillars plus aphids or plus bacteria. However, the composition of the pollinator community associated with flowers of B. nigra was affected by plant exposure to the attackers, but the total number of pollinators visiting the plants did not change upon attack. We conclude that, when B. nigra were exposed to single or dual attack on their inflorescences, the plants maintained interactions with natural enemies of the insect attackers and with pollinators. We discuss how chemical diversity may contribute to plant resilience upon attack. © 2021, The Author(s).","Brassica nigra (Brassicaceae); Flowering plants; Indirect resistance; Multiple attack; Plant volatiles; Pollination","annual plant; aphid; caterpillar; dicotyledon; parasitoid; plant-pollinator interaction; pollinator; reproduction; Aphididae; Brassica nigra; Brassicaceae; Brevicoryne brassicae; Hexapoda; Magnoliophyta; Pieris brassicae; Xanthomonas campestris pv. raphani; volatile organic compound; animal; aphid; butterfly; chemistry; egg laying; female; growth, development and aging; herbivory; host parasite interaction; larva; mustard; parasitology; physiology; plant seed; pollination; reproductive fitness; wasp; Animals; Aphids; Butterflies; Female; Genetic Fitness; Herbivory; Host-Parasite Interactions; Larva; Mustard Plant; Oviposition; Pollination; Seeds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wasps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099978712

Bangladesh recently formulated some policies and initiatives for reducing GHG emissions that have been increasing at an alarming rate lately, which are driven largely by economic growth, energy security, and local environmental concerns. However, little is known about the impacts of the existing policies and initiatives on curbing GHG emissions and promoting environmental sustainability, especially from the agriculture and energy sectors that contribute 44% and 39% to the country’s net emissions, respectively. This study, therefore, reviews the extent of GHG emissions in the country and analyzes the country’s key policies and initiatives for mitigating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability. The key finding is that despite the existence of a national energy policy and initiatives such as RE development, rational and efficient use of energy, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, clean development mechanism, international and private sector collaboration, GHG emissions are projected to continue to grow at high rates due to population growth, industrialization, energy consumption growth that outpace government initiatives to reduce emission levels. The paper concludes that good governance, behavioral transformation, and public awareness about climate change are vital steps for reducing GHG emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon trading; Clean development mechanism; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy; Solar home systems","alternative energy; climate change; energy policy; government; greenhouse gas; population growth; private sector; sustainability; Bangladesh",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079215347

We use satellite observations and analyses of the atmospheric state to simulate surface broadband and spectrally resolved direct normal irradiance (DNI). Over Wuhan, the first city placed under lockdown, we show how the atmospheric changes not only lead to a 19.8% increase in broadband DNI but also induce a significant blue-shift in the DNI spectrum. Feeding these changes into a solar cell simulator results in a 29.7% increase in the power output for a typical triple-junction photovoltaic cell, with around one-third of the increase arising from enhanced cell efficiency due to improved spectral matching. Our estimates imply that these increases in power and cell efficiency would have been realised over many parts of China during the lockdown period. This study thus demonstrates how a cleaner atmosphere may enable more efficient large scale solar energy generation. We conclude by setting our results in the context of future climate change mitigation and air pollution policies. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aerosol; Air quality; COVID-19 lockdown; Earth observation; Multi-junction; Nitrogen dioxide; Solar energy","Air cleaners; Air quality; Blue shift; Climate change; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Atmospheric changes; Cell efficiency; Concentrator photovoltaics; Direct normal irradiances; Energy generations; Satellite observations; Spectral matchings; Triple junction; Solar cells; air quality; COVID-19; energy planning; photovoltaic system; power generation; regulatory approach; solar power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100793863

Phenology data was gathered from 2011 to 2014 in 42 uniformly managed research orchards which span a range in climate, latitude, and elevation. We used linear models and spatially explicit forecasts to study apple phenology under climate change scenarios. Given dry winters and complex terrain in South Korea, we hypothesized that, in addition to temperature, precipitation and geo-topographic factors influence apple phenology. We also expected responses to climate variation to be similar between (spatial) and within (temporal) orchards, given the controlled conditions and the use of apple clones in this study. With other factors held constant, phenological sensitivity ranged from − 3.2 to − 3.4 days °C−1 for air temperature and − 0.5 to − 0.6 days cm−1 for March precipitation in a combined model. When modeled without temperature, phenology changed by up to 10 days over the full range in March precipitation. Spring temperatures and precipitation in March had very little cross-correlation (r &lt; 0.05), suggesting these patterns are independent; however, in a combined model including temperature, predicted changes in precipitation over the next 80 years have only a small impact on future apple phenology. Combining the best models with climate forecasts for South Korea, spring phenology continues to occur earlier over the next 80 years, mostly due to warming temperatures but with strong variation between regions.

Based on the data of energy and building materials consumption of the construction industry in China and 30 provinces from 2008 to 2018, this paper constructs a model for measuring provincial CO2 emissions of China’s construction industry and establishes a Kuznets curve and elastic decoupling model of the industry’s CO2 emissions. The analysis based on the models shows that: (1) the CO2 emissions of China’s construction industry show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing; (2) in terms of the decoupling effects, most provinces are in a weak decoupling status of CO2 emissions; and (3) the Kuznets curve of the provincial construction industry shows an inverted “U” shape in recent years, and it is predicted that the CO2 emissions of the construction industry will reach the peak in 2034. It is possible for the construction industry to achieve “carbon neutrality”, but long-term efforts must be made for strategic planning, policies and regulations, industry standards, etc. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we discovered an operando generated stable Ni-In kinetic phase that selectively converts CO2 to methanol (CTM) at low pressure compared to the state-of-the-art materials. The catalytic nature of a well-known methanation catalyst, nickel, has been tuned with the introduction of inactive indium, which enhances the CTM process. The remarkable change in the mechanistic pathways toward methanol production has been mapped by operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy analysis, corroborated by first-principles calculations. The ordered arrangement and pronounced electronegativity difference between metals are attributed to the complete shift in mechanism.

Based on the experimental observations, flow analysis and chemical calculations, a new criterion is proposed to identify the occurrence of nonpremixed MILD combustion using local heat release rate (HRR) particularly for CFD simulations. Importantly, unlike the case of CH4, the nonpremixed MILD combustion of C3H8 exhibits a negative HRR (HRR−) region that departs distantly from the positive HRR (HRR+) region, due to complex pyrolysis. This is distinct from the conventional flame where the HRR− region is adjecent to the HRR+ one. The new criterion notably improves the mode identification of nonpremixed combustion operating in various furnaces at different conditions. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of local HRR in linking the experimental observation, CFD simulation and chemical calculation of MILD combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion mode; Flameless combustion; Heat release rate; MILD combustion criterion; Nonpremixed","Chemical analysis; Computational fluid dynamics; Furnaces; CFD simulations; Chemical calculations; Combustion mode; Equivalence ratios; MILD combustion; Mode identification; Nonpremixed combustion; Thermal inputs; Combustion; combustion; equipment; experimental study; flow measurement; identification method; laboratory method; pyrolysis; separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096874118

Using panel data of 30 provinces for 1995–2017, we revisit China's energy-growth nexus that considers the likely cross-section dependence among the provinces within each of China's three regions. Our key finding is a bidirectional causal relationship of energy (natural log of per capita energy consumption) and income (natural log of per capita real GDP) for the Eastern and Central regions and a unidirectional causal relationship from income to energy for the Western region. The Eastern and Central regions’ bidirectional relationship suggests caution in China's energy conservation policy which may decelerate these regions’ economic growth. The Western region's unidirectional relationship suggests promoting energy conservation without adversely affecting this region's economic growth. Hence, the East and Central regions’ conservation effort should be accompanied by cost-effective development of emissions-free renewable resources like hydro, solar and wind for displacing China's fossil-fuel consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China's energy policy; Intra-region cross-section dependence; Regional causality; Regional energy-growth nexus","Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Causal relationships; Cross section dependence; Economic growths; Energy conservation policy; Energy-growth nexus; Renewable resource; Solar and winds; Western region; Energy conservation; economic growth; energy conservation; energy policy; panel data; renewable resource; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097559126

Interestingly, the catalytic selectivity of 1 can be adjusted and even completely switched in a facile manner between the photochemical reductions of CO2 to CO and of protons to H2 simply by adding different amounts of triethanolamine to the catalytic system.

Yields of char, biocrude, water soluble products, and gas were measured at 300 °C and 1 hour for both the parent oxides (CeZrOx, ZrO2, and CeO2) and the Ni-impregnated versions. Using Ni-based catalysts reduced the carbon-weighted char yield from 16-24% to <10% and decreased the energy recovery of char from 39-47% to <21%, as compared with control tests. In particular, using Ni/ZrO2 resulted in the greatest biocrude yield, greatest reduction of char yield, and greatest energy recovered as biocrude (39.2%). After factoring in all forms of usable energy produced from food waste, the total energy recovery obtained for the catalysts studied here was >60%. Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/CeO2 show the greatest potential for controlling char growth and maximizing energy recovered from food waste. The crystalline structures of all three oxides were hydrothermally stable. Catalyst reuse tests indicate that the biocrude and char yields remained the same for the first and second use (within uncertainty) and that the catalyst retains its initial crystallinity and 93% of its initial Ni content. Molecular composition of biocrudes analyzed by the state-of-the-art analytical platforms (including GC-MS, GC × GC, FT-ICR MS, and 1H NMR) revealed minor differences in the chemical constituents of biocrudes obtained using different catalysts and provided some insight regarding reaction mechanism. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalysts; Cerium oxide; Chemical analysis; Crystallinity; Food waste; Liquefaction; Mass spectrometry; Metals; Zirconia; Bi-functional catalysts; Chemical constituents; Crystalline structure; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Metal oxide catalysts; Molecular compositions; Reaction mechanism; Total energy recoveries; Metal recovery; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; concentration (composition); food waste; growth; hydrothermal system; inorganic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101685449

Taking the Pan-Yangtze River Delta region for example and based on the input–output model, this paper explored the relationship between inter-industry economic spillover and embodied carbon productivity in trade from 2007 to 2012. Results indicated that the intra-regional multiplier effect presented a slow downward trend during the studied period, while the trend in the inter-regional integration was intensifying. Moreover, the multiplier effect of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was relatively lower than that of the middle reaches. Owing to the geographical location and industrial structure, the industries in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were strongly correlated. In addition, the regional multiplier effect was mostly concentrated in industries with high carbon emission intensity. The economic spillovers between regions showed a growing trend from 2007 to 2012, indicating that regional economic integration was further strengthened, and the economic spillovers in the Yangtze River Delta region were significantly higher than those in the middle reaches. Furthermore, from the perspective of embodied carbon productivity in trade, most of Shanghai’s carbon productivity to other regions was mostly less than 10,000 Yuan per ton, which means Shanghai had little demand for intermediate products of other regions, and inter-regional trade between Shanghai and other regions brought less total output and more environmental pollution to other regions, while Shanghai obtained more total output through trade. As embodied carbon productivity in trade in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was more than 10,000 Yuan per ton, Jiangsu and Zhejiang had played an important role in realizing the coordinated development of low carbon in the Pan-Yangtze River Delta. In particular, for Anhui and Jiangxi, embodied carbon productivity in the Yangtze River Delta region was relatively low. Therefore, in order to achieve green, coordinated, and high-quality economic development in the Pan-Yangtze River Delta region, Anhui and Jiangxi should not only strengthen regional cooperation with Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, but also they should avoid regional zero-sum game competition in regional climate policy. In other words, for policy-makers in the Pan-Yangtze River Delta, promoting the deep integration of industrial chain and regional coordinated development, and thus, improving carbon productivity during the regional development process, should receive more attention. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon productivity embodied in trade; Coordinated development; Regional spillover effects","carbon; climate change; economic development; empirical analysis; environmental policy; input-output analysis; regional development; spillover effect; China; Yangtze Delta; carbon; China; industry; pollution; river; Carbon; China; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092256401

In order to evaluate the changes of airway inflammation and pulmonary functions in the elderly in response to individual exposure of particles (PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10), we analyzed 43 elderly subjects with either asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO) and 40 age-matched subjects without asthma nor COPD in an urban community in Shanghai, China. Data were collected at the baseline and in 6 follow-ups from August 2016 to December 2018, once every 3 months except for the last twice with a 6-month interval. In each follow-up, pulmonary functions, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), 7-day continuous personal exposure to airborne particles were measured. Multivariate linear mixed effect regression models were applied to investigate the quantitative changes of pulmonary functions and FeNO in two respective groups. The results showed that on average 4.7 follow-up visits were completed in each participant. In subjects with CRDs, an inter-quartile range (IQR) increase of personal exposure to PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 was significantly associated with an average increase of FeNO(Lag1) of 6.7 ppb (95%CI 1.2, 9.9 ppb), 6.2 ppb (95%CI 1.5, 12.0 ppb) and 5.6 ppb (95%CI 1.5, 11.0 ppb), respectively, and an average decrease of FEV1(Lag2) of −3.6 L (95%CI -6.0, −1.1 L), −3.6 L (95%CI -6.4, −0.8 L) and −3.2 L (95%CI -5.8, −0.6 L), respectively, in the single-pollutant model. These associations remained consistent in the two-pollutant models adjusting for gaseous air pollutants. Stratified analysis showed that subjects with lower BMI, females and non-allergies were more sensitive to particle exposure. No robust significant effects were observed in the subjects without CRDs.

Herein, ""diamond necklace""-like N-coordinated cobalt phosphate nanocrystals coupled with carbon nanotubes (CoPiC-DP/CNTs) are synthesized through the facile hydrothermal-carbonization approach and employed as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. The CNTs act like the ""chain""as support, the ""diamond""-like N-coordinated cobalt phosphate nanocrystals serve as catalytic active sites, and the N-doped carbon derived from the phosphonate ligand-like ""linker""can not only protect the ""diamond""from leaching but also promote the mass transfer. Such advanced structure and composition features endow CoPiC-DP/CNTs with impressive ORR and OER electrochemical activities. To probe the active contribution of CoPiC-DP/CNTs toward ORR, a series of cobalt phosphate-carbon hybrids are prepared by adjusting the types of phosphonate ligands of the cobalt phosphonate precursor to rationally control their active components. The comprehensive investigation from structural characterizations and electrochemical measurements of these cobalt phosphate-carbon hybrids verifies that both N-coordinated cobalt sites and the suitable carbon substrate are essential for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the liquid- and solid-state zinc-air batteries with these fabricated CoPiC-DP/CNTs employed as the air cathode exhibit decreased charge-discharge potential gaps, high power density, and considerable cycling durability, which are beneficial for the potential development of flexible/portable electronic devices. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

This paper takes China’s eight major economic regions as the entry point. First, carbon emissions are measured according to United Nations’ baseline methodologies. Second, the stochastic nonparametric data envelope analysis (StoNED) model is used to measure energy efficiency to improve the accuracy of the measurement. Finally, considering the temporal and spatial nonstationarity of carbon emission data, this paper constructs geographically and temporally weighted regression-stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (GTWR-STIRPAT) model, which can accurately analyze the impact of each driving factor of carbon emissions. This paper also explores efficient emission reduction paths in conjunction with the forcing mechanism. According to the study, China’s carbon emissions show a decreasing trend from coastal areas to inland areas. In addition, there are significant problems with carbon emissions in China: some regions focus on improving energy efficiency but neglect increasing energy consumption; some regions focus on industrial development but neglect long-term emission reductions. Among the driving factors, energy efficiency, foreign trade, environmental regulations, and industrial structure have the effects of spatiotemporal heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and time lag on carbon emissions, respectively.

Based on long-term laboratory batch tests in conjunction with 16 s rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics, this study provides the first detailed assessment of the variable sediment CH4 production in response to different pollution source-associated sewer sediment types and hydrological patterns, while addressing the role of the sediment microbiome. The high CH4-production capability of sanitary sewer sediment is shaped by enriched biologically active substrate and dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis (genus Methanosaeta). Moreover, it involves syntrophic interactions among fermentation bacteria, hydrogen-producing acetogens and methanogens. Distinct source-associated microbial species, denitrifying bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria occur in storm sewer and illicit discharge-associated (IDA) storm sewer sediments. This reveals their insufficient microbial function capabilities to support efficient methanogenesis. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (genus Methanobacterium) prevails in both these sediments. In this context, storm sewer sediment has an extremely low CH4-production capability, while IDA storm sewer sediment still shows significant carbon emission through a possibly unique mechanism. Hydrological connections promote the sewer sediment biodegradability and CH4-production capability. In contrast, hydrological disconnection facilitates the prevalence of acetoclastic methanogenesis, sulfate-reducing enzymes, denitrification enzymes and the sulfur-utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier, which drastically decreases CH4 production. Turbulent suspension of sediments results in relative stagnation of methanogenesis. This work bridges the knowledge gap and will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of ‘bottom-up’ system-scale carbon budgets and GHG sources, as well as the target CH4 abatement interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Enzyme; Hydrological pattern; Methane production; Microbiome; Sewer sediment type","Bacteria; Biodegradability; Budget control; Carbon; Denitrification; Enzymes; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Pollution control; RNA; Storm sewers; Storms; Substrates; Sulfur compounds; Chemolithoautotrophic; Denitrifying bacteria; Fermentation bacteria; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Hydrological patterns; Production capabilities; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Syntrophic interactions; Suspended sediments; methane; methane; sulfate; anthropogenic source; carbon emission; denitrification; discharge; fermentation; methane; methanogenesis; sediment chemistry; sewage; sulfate-reducing bacterium; turbulence; Article; biodegradability; hydrology; methanogenesis; Methanosaeta; microbiome; nonhuman; priority journal; sediment; sewer; bacterium; genetics; microflora; sewage; Methanobacterium; Methanosaeta; Bacteria; Methane; Microbiota; Sewage; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097378208

We find the statistically significant and negative effect of environmental regulation on exports at the city level. Moreover, we find that the potential mechanism is the change in export values caused by firm entry and exit, especially by exiters, rather than the change in the number of exporting firms in the city caused by firm entry and exit. In addition, we find the heterogeneous effects of environmental regulation based on the differences of environmental policy across cities and the Broad Economic Categories classification. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, this study explores the three major mediating effects of the process, namely the energy-substitution effect, economic effect, and technology effect. The empirical results indicate that the improvement in trade openness has a significantly positive effect on CO2 emissions, and it also shows that the impact varies with different levels of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the indirect effect of trade openness on CO2 emissions via the economic effect is positive, while the indirect effect via the energy-substitution and the technology effect is negative.

To quantify the negative effects of river dust on regional air quality, this study selected the estuary areas located in central Taiwan as a case study and proposed an integrated framework to measure the fugitive emission of dust from riverbeds with the aid of satellite remote sensing and wind tunnel test, together with the concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of &lt;10 μm (PM10) around the river system by using The Air Pollution Model. Additionally, the effects of 25 types of meteorological conditions on the health risk due to exposure to dust were evaluated near the estuary areas. The results reveal landscape changes in the downstream areas of Da'an and Dajia rivers, with an increase of 370,820 m2 and 1,554,850 m2 of bare land areas in the dry season compared with the wet season in Da'an and Dajia rivers, respectively. On the basis of the maximum emission of river dust, PM10 concentration increases considerably during both wet and dry seasons near the two rivers. Among 25 different types of weather conditions, frontal surface transit, outer-region circulation from tropical depression system, weak northeast monsoons, and anticyclonic outflow have considerable influence on PM10 diffusion. In particular, weak northeast monsoons cause the highest health risk in the areas between Da'an and Dajia rivers, which is the densely populated Taichung City. Future studies should attempt to elucidate the environmental impact of dust in different weather conditions and understand the spatial risks to human health due to PM10 concentration. Facing the increasing threat of climate and landscape changes, governments are strongly encouraged to begin multimedia assessments in environmental management and propose a long-term and systematic framework in resources planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Exposure risk; Landscape change; PM10; Remote sensing; TAPM","Air quality; Arid regions; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Drought; Dust; Environmental management; Geomorphology; Health; Health risks; Multimedia systems; Remote sensing; Rivers; Storms; Wind tunnels; Air Pollution Modeling; Air quality modeling; Arid and semi-arid regions; Integrated frameworks; Meteorological condition; Regional air quality; Satellite remote sensing; Systematic framework; River pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; dust; landscape change; modeling; particulate matter; remote sensing; air pollution; air quality; Article; case study; climate change; dust exposure; environmental impact; estuary; fuzzy system; health hazard; particulate matter 10; population density; priority journal; remote sensing; riparian ecosystem; risk assessment; seasonal variation; simulation; spatial analysis; supervised machine learning; Taiwan; urban area; Daan River; Dajia River; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092071887

The average D14CPOC values in the spring, MP and DP were −325‰, −123‰ and −158‰, respectively, which are all lower than these of the DIC in each reservoir. The lower D14C values of the POC may be caused by older soil carbon from surface runoff and dust fall. More aquatic algae were formed through photosynthesis in the stream ponds, especially in summer, shown by strongly increased D14CPOC and evidence of growth in EDS/SEM analyses. Furthermore, the D14C values of the submerged aquatic plants range from −153‰ to −26‰, reflecting that the aquatic plants used DIC for photosynthesis. The D14C value of an emergent plant which uses atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis is 52.5 ± 0.3‰, equivalent to the atmospheric D14C. Seasonal variations of D14CDIC and δ13CDIC are influenced by soil CO2 input, primary productivity in the ponds, and CO2 exchange; hydrochemical condition show lower D14C values but higher δ13C values in cold/dry season, and vice versa in summer rainy season. A simple mass balance calculation indicates ~90% of carbon for the spring DIC is from biogenic CO2, with higher contribution in summer due to higher productivity. Although this simple calculation may overestimate the biogenic CO2, it indicates that organic decomposition is a major carbon source for DIC in the karst hydrological system. The results of the present study have implications for 14C dating on aquatic plant remains, regional and perhaps global carbon budgets, and the different behaviors of 13C and 14C in karst systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic photosynthesis; DIC; Karst surface water; POC; Radiocarbon; Stable carbon isotope","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Lakes; Landforms; Lime; Limestone; Photosynthesis; Reservoirs (water); Springs (water); Aquatic photosynthesis; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Hydrochemical conditions; Hydrological system; Mass-balance calculations; Organic decomposition; Particulate organic carbon; Primary productivity; Organic carbon; aquatic plant; carbon isotope; carbon sink; decomposition; dissolved inorganic carbon; karst; limestone; mass balance; particulate organic carbon; photosynthesis; runoff; seasonal variation; soil carbon; China; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097709955

PC 123, Muscat, Oman","Although the Gulf Cooperation Council is the beating heart of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves, it remains behind the curve on a critical issue facing the industry—the nature and extent of methane (CH4) emissions and how to mitigate the same. This article uses Oman as a representative example of the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC) to uncover the CH4 emission from the oil and gas industry, explore potential reduction policies, and discuss the viability of these policies in the current volatile and falling environment prices. The present study uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines and methodology of 2006 to assess CH4 emission from the oil and gas supply chain. This paper contributes considerably to reducing knowledge gaps about Oman’s CH4 emissions through a detailed accounting of CH4 emissions from the supply chain for oil and gas. Overall, CH4 emission in Oman increased 1.86-fold from 288 Gg in 2000 to 825 Gg in 2015, while the CH4 emission from oil and gas operations rose 1.7-fold from 234.4 Gg in 2000 to 634.4 Gg in 2015. CH4 emissions from the supply chain of oil and gas are projected to add up to 30% to current emissions (2015) in the third decade of the 21st without a mitigation strategy. Curbing CH4 emissions calls for a robust abatement policy in tandem with a robust monitoring system to ensure accuracy and transparency. Policymakers’ efforts in Oman and other developing countries with similar hydrocarbon-based economies would be hampered by market mechanisms and fluctuations of oil and gas prices in enforcing CH4 reduction policies. Enforcing tangible reductions of CH4 from the oil and gas industry are a global dimension problem that cannot be addressed nationally. The UN Convention on Climate Change is an ideal frame of engagement for countries in negotiations to bridge the CH4 emission gap from petroleum and gas industries and to agree on a roadmap for deep and continuous oil and gas CH4 cuts. The United Nations agreement on reducing CH4 from oil and gas seems unavoidable in achieving climate neutrality by the second half of this century and staying below two degrees as decided in the Paris Agreement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Abatement policy; CH4; Oil and natural gas supply chain; Oman; Trend emission","cutting (process); energy market; environmental economics; gas industry; gas supply; hydrocarbon reserve; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; methane; price dynamics; supply chain management; viability; Oman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103356879

This creates high thermal stress in the turbines, and possible creep of turbine inducer blades, and can reduce turbines’ reliability. With the ever-stringent engine emission regulations and the continuous drive for engine power density, turbine inlet temperature is significantly increased recently and the risk of thermo-mechanical failure of turbine rotor is heightened. To solve this problem, an innovative turbine cooling method is proposed by injecting a small amount of compressor or intercooler discharge air onto the upper backdisc region of turbine rotor to cool the disc and the inducer blades. A conjugate heat transfer simulation was carried out to investigate the effects of this cooling method with a turbocharger turbine. Flow conditions and geometric configurations were investigated for their influences on the cooling effectiveness of the method. The results show that using the compressor discharger air after intercooler with only 0.5–2.0% of turbine mass flow, the averaged cooling efficiency of the turbine backdisc is promoted by 23–43%; only four to six jets may be needed to cool the entire backdisc; and turbine efficiency is reduced by less than 1% point. © IMechE 2020.","conjugate heat transfer; impingement cooling; micro-turbines; Turbine cooling; turbochargers","Cooling; Efficiency; Engines; Failure (mechanical); Turbomachine blades; Conjugate heat transfer; Cooling effectiveness; Cooling efficiency; Geometric configurations; Thermo mechanical failures; Turbine efficiency; Turbine inlet temperature; Turbocharger turbines; Turbine components",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089391355

Studied plasma perturbations include local plasma cooling, plasma shrinkage due to thermal pinching, and changes in plasma impedance. The local cooling effect caused by a vaporizing aerosol droplet was found to be similar between H2O and D2O. This finding is likely a result of the similar heat capacities and vaporization rates of H2O and D2O droplets and of the comparable thermal conductivities and dissociation kinetics of H2O and D2O vapor. In contrast, a clear isotope effect was observed for plasma shrinkage and impedance change, with H2O causing a considerably stronger effect. Plasma shrinkage, gauged by the reduction in Ar emission at the edge of the plasma, was detected at all observation heights within the load-coil region, with D2O droplets causing as much as 30% less of an effect than H2O. Likewise, D2O droplets induce significantly less change in plasma impedance than H2O droplets. Depending on experimental conditions and the probing method, changes in plasma impedance caused by monodisperse D2O droplets were only 52%–80% that of H2O. The lower influence on plasma shrinkage and impedance change for D2O droplets is believed to be related to the much lower thermal conductivity of atomic deuterium, around 70% that of atomic hydrogen (protium). The time required for the plasma impedance to return to its original steady-state value was comparatively long (~10 ms) and similar for H2O and D2O droplets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol perturbation; Heavy water; Inductively coupled plasma; Monodisperse droplets; Plasma impedance; Plasma pinch","Aerosols; Drops; Hydrogen; Inductively coupled plasma; Isotopes; Shrinkage; Thermal conductivity; Atomic deuterium; Dissociation kinetics; Effect of hydrogen; Experimental conditions; Hydrogen isotope; Plasma impedance; Steady-state values; Vaporization rate; Wave plasma interactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100405431

In this paper, the Land Use Regression (LUR) technique was used to model the relationship between the daily PM2.5 concentration and various predictor variables using data from the entire year of 2019. The results confirmed strong seasonal effects on PM2.5 and substantial effects of time-variant predictors, including open biomass burning and meteorological conditions. However, time-invariant variables, including traffic, transportation, and land use characteristics were generally weaker predictors in the LUR models. The results of the model based on data for the entire year showed better statistical fit and robustness than the seasonal models. The relatively low adjusted R2 of the models developed in this study compared with previous LUR studies suggests that more detailed data, especially the traffic volume on roads nearby monitoring sites, might be necessary to improve the model's performance. Finally, the large buffer size of the open biomass burning predictor implied that the measures to reduce PM2.5 by limiting open biomass burning would require international cooperation as some fires within the buffer area occurred in neighboring countries outside the borders of Thailand. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Bangkok; Land use regression; Open biomass burning; PM2.5; Traffic-related factors","Air quality; Biomass; International cooperation; Bangkok , Thailand; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Land use regression; Land-use regression models; Meteorological condition; PM2.5 concentration; Predictor variables; Land use; biomass burning; concentration (composition); land use change; particulate matter; prediction; seasonality; traffic emission; air quality; Article; biomass; environmental monitoring; fire; government; humidity; international cooperation; land use; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; predictor variable; priority journal; rainy season; regression analysis; seasonal variation; Thailand; time; traffic; traffic pollution; wind speed; winter; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097749878

In order to assess their biocompatibility, the nature of interactions between Human Hemoglobin (HHb) and GO/RGO are monitored since a comparative spectroscopic approach towards understanding their nature of interactions has not been investigated previously. UV–vis spectroscopy reveals hyperchromicity for HHb-GO system and hypochromicity for HHb-RGO system in the region of absorption of tryptophan/tyrosine residues. Notably, although steady-state fluorescence static quenching of HHb for GO and enhancement of fluorescence for RGO is noticed, but average fluorescence-lifetime is remaining unchanged in presence of GO/RGO. Calorimetric data illustrates three-site and five-site binding model to be the best-fit model for GO and RGO respectively. Also, synchronous fluorescence quenching corresponding to alterations in microenvironment of tryptophan/ tyrosine residues is observed only in presence of GO. Likewise FTIR spectroscopy elucidates involvement of both amide I and amide II bond of HHb backbone through H-bonding interaction only for GO. Furthermore RLS spectra demonstrate an increase and a decrease in signal for GO and RGO respectively. Surprisingly, secondary structure of HHb is maintained upon interaction with both GO/RGO, as revealed by CD spectroscopy, thus supporting their potential application in biological microenvironment. Thus it appears that the spectroscopic properties of HHb upon interaction with GO is altered upon its reduction to RGO. Furthermore the role of HHb as good candidate for bimolecular interaction has been highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drug-delivery system; Fluorescence enhancement; Fluorescence quenching; Graphene oxides; HumanHemoglobin; Native secondary structure","Amides; Amino acids; Biocompatibility; Calorimetry; Carbon Quantum Dots; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Graphene; Hemoglobin; Quenching; Semiconductor quantum dots; Bimolecular interactions; Fluorescence lifetimes; H-bonding interaction; Secondary structures; Spectroscopic property; Spectroscopic response; Steady state fluorescences; Synchronous fluorescence; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; carbon; graphene oxide; graphite; hemoglobin; oxide; quantum dot; human; Carbon; Graphite; Hemoglobins; Humans; Oxides; Quantum Dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093690495

This paper studies the direct carbon emissions of households (DCEH) in the Ebinur Lake Basin, and based on the extended STIRPAT model, using the 1987–2017 annual time series data of the Ebinur Lake Basin in Xinjiang to analyze the driving factors. The results indicate that DCEH in the Ebinur Lake Basin during the 31 years from 1987 to 2017 has generally increased and the energy structure of DCEH has undergone tremendous changes. The proportion of coal continues to decline, while the proportion of natural gas, gasoline and diesel is growing rapidly. The main positive driving factors affecting its carbon emissions are urbanization, vehicle ownership and GDP per capita, while the secondary driving factor is residents’ year-end savings. Population, carbon intensity and energy consumption structure have negative effects on carbon emissions, of which energy consumption structure is the main factor. In addition, there is an environmental Kuznets curve between DCEH and economic development, but it has not yet reached the inflection point. © 2021 by the authors.

To be able to assess the effects of overuse of the Zeban groundwater, it is necessary to understand the origin of the recharge and determine its path out of the recharge zones. This study aims to better understand the flow path and replenishment areas using hydrology. For this purpose, 145 water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of major ions and isotopes (18O, 2H and 3H). The isotope analysis of hydrogen, oxygen and tritium allowed a certain distinction between the origin and the mixture of water. The study area is located in the fault corridor of the South Atlas, a network of migration and folding defects that leads to a complex structure characterized by the subdivision of the formations and the variety of facies. The regional flow pattern is mainly influenced by the topography, and this is through the distribution of supply and flow, which is produced by transport at many depths and levels of distribution (local or regional). The rocky nature and the severe fractures are responsible for the division of the hydrogeological units and play an important role in the dynamics and transport of the groundwater. The hydrodynamic analysis shows the dominance of regional hydrogeology in terms of geological nature and structure. This is supported by a hydrochemical signal showing the distribution and evolution of the elements according to the structural and geological scheme (evolution from calcium bicarbonate facies to calcium sulphate medium facies). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aurès; Leakage; Oxygene-18; Recharge; Saharian Atlas and tritium","Aquifers; Flow patterns; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Lime; Sulfur compounds; Topography; Calcium bicarbonate; Calcium sulphate; Complex structure; Conceptual frameworks; Folding defects; Hydrodynamic analysis; Isotope analysis; Regional hydrogeology; Recharging (underground waters); aquifer; conceptual framework; groundwater; hydrodynamics; oxygen isotope; recharge; water flow; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096547938

Moreover, additional natural sources frequently impact this region, particularly Saharan dust intrusions. This study focuses on the combined effect of wildfires and Saharan dust on the air quality of the central Mediterranean Basin (CMB) during 2017, an exceptional year for forested burned areas in southern Italy. The annual behaviors of PM2.5, PM10, CO, benzene, and benzo(a)pirene measurements that were recorded at a rural regional-background station located in southern Italy, highlighted a concentration increase during summer. Both Saharan dust and wildfire events were identified while using Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) model maps, together with high-resolution Weather Research and Forecast—Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (WRF-HYSPLIT) back-trajectories. Additionally, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite detections were considered to establish the enrichment of air masses by wildfire emissions. Finally, the occurrence of these natural sources, and their influence on particulate matter, were examined. In this case study, both PM2.5 and PM10 exceedances occurred predominantly in conjunction with wildfire events, while Saharan dust events mainly increased PM10 concentration when overlapping with wildfire effects. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we synthesize the current state of research (including empirical, paleo, and modeling studies), discuss the implications on forest growth and carbon storage in Pacific Northwest forests, and identify key knowledge gaps and future research opportunities based on a combination of published studies and expert opinion. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the expected effects of climate change on moist and dry forest ecology and carbon storage. In response to these impacts, we highlight a number of appropriate regional forest restoration and management adaptation strategies.

In order to offer solutions to eradicate this global pandemic, the scientific community has published hundreds of articles covering a wide range of areas of knowledge. With the aim of synthesizing these publications, academics are resorting to bibliometric analyses from the perspectives of the disciplines such as biology, medicine, socioeconomics and tourism. Yet no bibliometric analysis has explored the diffuse and little-known growth of COVID-19 scientific publications in the field of environmental studies. The current study is the first of this type to fill this research gap. It has resorted to SciMAT software to evaluate the main topics, authors and journals of publications on the subject of COVID-19 combined with environmental studies spanning the period between 1 December 2019 and 6 September 2020. The search yielded a collection of 440 articles published in scientific journals indexed on by Web of Science and Scopus databases. These publications can be broken down into six main themes: (i) a sharp reduction in air pollution and an improvement of the level of water pollution; (ii) the relationship of wind speed (positive), ultraviolet radiation (positive) and humidity (negative) with the rate of infections; (iii) the effect of the pandemic on the food supply chain and waste habits; (iv) wastewater monitoring offers a great potential as an early warning sign of COVID-19 transmission; (v) artificial intelligence and smart devices can be of great use in monitoring citizen mobilization; and (vi) the lessons gleaned from the pandemic that help define actions to mitigate climate change. The results of the current study therefore offer an agenda for future research and constitute a starting point for academics in the field of environmental studies to evaluate the effects of COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bibliometric analysis; Communication; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Environmental studies; Journalism; Mass media; Pandemic; SciMAT","artificial intelligence; atmospheric pollution; climate change; detection method; disease transmission; literature review; spatiotemporal analysis; ultraviolet radiation; virus; wind velocity; agriculture; air pollution; air quality; artificial intelligence; bibliometrics; climate change; coronavirus disease 2019; ecosystem; environmental health; habit; humidity; mass medium; meteorological phenomena; priority journal; scientific literature; ultraviolet radiation; water pollution; wind speed; bibliometrics; human; Coronavirus; Scopus; Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometrics; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095754508

A key step in increasing the effectiveness of such expansion is understanding how novel threats to biodiversity from climate change alter concepts such as rewilding, which have underpinned many proposals for large interconnected reserves. We reviewed potential challenges that climate change poses to rewilding and found that the conservation value of large protected areas persists under climate change. Nevertheless, more attention should be given to protection of microrefugia, macrorefugia, complete environmental gradients, and areas that connect current and future suitable climates and to maintaining ecosystem processes and stabilizing feedbacks via conservation strategies that are resilient to uncertainty regarding climate trends. Because a major element of the threat from climate change stems from its novel geographic patterns, we examined, as an example, the implications for climate-adaptation planning of latitudinal, longitudinal (continental to maritime), and elevational gradients in climate-change exposure across the Yellowstone-to-Yukon region, the locus of an iconic conservation proposal initially designed to conserve wide-ranging carnivore species. In addition to a continued emphasis on conserving intact landscapes, restoration of degraded low-elevation areas within the region is needed to capture sites important for landscape-level climate resilience. Extreme climate exposure projected for boreal North America suggests the need for ambitious goals for expansion of the protected-area network there to include refugia created by topography and ecological features, such as peatlands, whose conservation can also reduce emissions from carbon stored in soil. Qualitative understanding of underlying reserve design rules and the geography of climate-change exposure can strengthen the outcomes of inclusive regional planning processes that identify specific sites for protection. © 2020 The Authors.

Novel technologies integrating waste gasification with reversible Solid-Oxide Cell systems have been proposed to provide flexible grid balancing services. The rSOC system operated in electrolysis mode uses excess power from vRES to generate hydrogen (H2), which is combined with syngas derived from waste gasification to produce methane (CH4). The rSOC system can also be operated in fuel cell mode by oxidising syngas to produce electricity. This paper presents a well-defined case study which aimed to estimate the potential deployment of a novel rSOC technology in a future power system dominated by intermittent renewables. The hourly power grid residual loads (i.e., the difference between load and vRES power generation) and the availability of low-grade organic waste and residues are quantified and matched for the southern Italian peninsula in 2030. The results show that the theoretical grid flexibility needs approximately 10 TW h of overproduction and 5 TW h of underproduction in 2030 to ensure the complete disposal of the municipal organic waste generated in 2030 (6.7 Mt) and that production of renewable CH4 will need to be 1.4–2.4 Mt, pointing to an intriguing perspective for the deployment of rSOC systems at a large scale. The multifunctionality of the system proposed is an added value that can make it a convenient and efficient piece of the puzzle of technologies required in a climate-neutral and circular economy. The results and methods here presented are intended to form the basis for estimations of future potential deployment and economic and environmental assessments of competing technologies. © Copyright © 2021 Carbone, Gracceva, Pierro, Motola, Zong, You, Pérez-Fortes, Wang and Agostini.","biomethane production; grid adequacy; hydrogen; renewable energy recources; solid oxide electrolysis cell; solid oxide fuel cell; waste valorization","Economics; Electric energy storage; Environmental technology; Gasification; Methane; Solar power plants; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Synthesis gas; Waste disposal; Wastes; Competing technologies; Economic and environmental assessments; Energy storage capacity; Intermittent renewables; Market penetration; Multifunctionality; Reversible solid oxide cells; Waste gasification; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101965294

It is therefore necessary to measure the environmental and health impacts between different regions involved in emissions trading scheme (ETS). This study proposed a unifying framework that incorporated a number of models and databases to explore the spatial changes in CO2 emissions due to ETS in Hubei, one of China's ETS pilots, simulate the distribution of atmospheric co-pollutants on a 3 km × 3 km resolution, and compare the cause-specific mortality attributable to co-pollutants varying in time and cross regions between with and without the ETS. The simulation shows that in general the ETS improved air quality in large parts of Hubei, as indicated by the notable decline in both PM2.5 concentrations and the proportion of heavily polluted areas throughout Hubei. However, an increase in PM2.5 concentrations after the implementation of ETS was observed in some areas of major cities, such as Wuhan, Xiaogan, Ezhou, Huangshi and Yichang, resulting in negative impacts on human health locally. The findings could assist policymakers in better understanding the complex impacts of ETS on environmental and human health, therefore serving as a useful reference for interregional efforts to speed up the development of China's ETS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions trading scheme (ETS); Environmental impact; Hubei; Human health; Premature mortality; Simulation","Air quality; Climate change; Commerce; Distributed database systems; Emission control; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric CO; Carbon emissions; Emissions Trading Scheme; Health impact; Hubei Province; PM2.5 concentration; Polluted area; Spatial changes; Health; carbon emission; climate change; complexity; emissions trading; environmental impact; health impact; mortality; nitrate; particulate matter; spatial variation; sulfur dioxide; China; Huangshi; Hubei; Wuhan; Yichang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097392369

Methods: We observed the composition and diversity of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in apple root region (non-rhizosphere, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane) soils amended with apple wood biochar using the Illumina sequencing methods. We used quantitative PCR to quantify the abundance of nitrogen-transforming functional marker genes involved in microbial nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (archaeal amoA and bacterial amoA), and denitrification (nirK, nirS, and nosZ). Results: Biochar amendment altered bacterial, fungal, and archaeal community compositions in apple root region soil. When compared to control, biochar additions dramatically increased the α-diversity of bacteria in the rhizoplane soil, whereas amendment significantly decreased the α-diversity of fungi and archaea in the rhizosphere soil. Moreover, the driving factors varied in non-rhizosphere, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane soils. The abundance of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and microbial N2O reduction were enhanced by biochar amendment in rhizosphere and rhizoplane soils, which was associated with an observed reduction in N2O concentrations by 13.7 and 35.1% in the 15- and 20-cm soil layer. However, wood biochar amendment had insignificant effect on nifH and amoA gene abundances in non-rhizosphere soil. Network analysis revealed that nitrogen-transforming functional genes had an intensive potential link to multiple microbial phyla. Conclusions: The soil microbial community was altered in biochar-amended soil by changing soil properties, thereby regulating nitrogen transformation processes and N2O concentrations in apple root region soil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Apple wood biochar; Microbial diversity; N2O; Rhizoplane soil; Rhizosphere soil; Soil nitrogen transformation","biochar; community structure; denitrification; fruit; genetic marker; microbial community; nitrogen fixation; orchard; rhizosphere; soil amendment; soil property; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098600201

Recruiting the air quality index (AQI) as a measure of overall air quality in Chinese cities, we find that industrial production, financial development, and economic integration lead to higher overall air pollution. Nevertheless, efficiency in urban planning through public transportation and population density alleviates this environmental degradation. A closer look into the two main air pollutants in China, sulphur dioxide and dust, further highlights the complexity of the issue. We find that trade openness reduces both sulphur dioxide and dust emissions, whereas financial development reduces sulphur dioxide emissions but increases dust in Chinese cities.

Therefore, the study of technologies that can facilitate the deployment of sewage treatment systems becomes essential. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the energy potential and the economic viability of the operation efficiency of biogas from anaerobic digestion of sewage and sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Economic analysis was considered for the local legislation that establishes a system of energy compensation for distributed generation. The potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) with the application of the methane recovery system was always estimated. For the biogas production calculations, real data on the volume of treated sewage and the population served with sanitary sewage were presented in a report by the local authority. The results indicated that the methane recovery system is feasible in most cities above 50,000 inhabitants, 86% of the municipalities with a population between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants, 67% of the municipalities with a population between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants and 100% of the municipalities with a population exceeding 250,000 inhabitants; these showed positive NPV and IRR, greater than the rate of attractiveness (8%). The time needed for return on investment (payback) in municipalities where the investment was feasible was 1.25 years for cities with a population of more than 250,000 inhabitants, 4.49 years for cities with a population between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants, 2.08 years for cities with a population between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants and 7.97 years for cities with a population of less than 50,000 inhabitants. In addition, a potential for electricity generation in the state of Minas Gerais of approximately 47,140 MWh per year and a potential reduction in emissions of GHG close to 325,800 tCO2eq/year with the deployment of the system was identified. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Anaerobic treatment of sewage; Biogas plants; Methane energy recovery; Sludge","anaerobic digestion; biogas; compensation system; developing world; economic analysis; electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; investment; legislation; sanitation; sewage; sludge; wastewater treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083170789

In collaboration with Turtle Lodge, the Prairie Climate Centre was invited to support the documentation and communication of knowledge shared at the Summit. This process of Indigenous-led community-based research took an inter-epistemological approach, using roundtable discussions within a ceremonial context and collaborative written and video methods. The Summit brought forward an understanding of climate change as a symptom of a much larger problem with how colonialism has altered the human condition. The Knowledge Keepers suggested that, in order to effectively address climate change, humanity needs a shift in values and behaviours that ground our collective existence in a balanced relationship with the natural world and its laws. They emphasized that their diverse knowledges and traditions can provide inspiration and guidance for this cultural shift. This underscores the need for a new approach to engaging with Indigenous knowledge in climate research, which acknowledges it not only as a source of environmental observations, but a wealth of values, philosophies, and worldviews which can inform and guide action and research more broadly. In this light, Onjisay Aki makes significant contributions to the literature on Indigenous knowledge on climate change in Canada and internationally, as well as the ways in which this knowledge is gathered, documented, and shared through the leadership of the Knowledge Keepers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Canada; Climate change; Indigenous knowledge; Indigenous-settler relationships","Philosophical aspects; Climate research; Community based research; Cultural shift; Environmental observation; Human conditions; Indigenous knowledge; Natural world; New approaches; Climate change; climate change; colonialism; indigenous knowledge; leadership; literature review; symptom; Canada; Testudines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100922376

The reduction of rainfall in this region, indicated by numerous climate models, may reduce aquifer recharge and, consequently, groundwater availability and sustainable development of the Cerrado biome. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of global climate change on groundwater recharge in a Brazilian Savannah watershed. Rainfall and water table depth data were recorded between 2007 and 2015. Based on these data, equations were developed relating the average monthly depth of the water table with the accumulated average monthly rainfall. From these equations, monthly average recharges considering the future climate estimates made by climate models (Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) were calculated. In a pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5), the average monthly groundwater recharge is decreasing in the beginning and in the end of the rainy season, indicating that there may be an increase in the dry season and, consequently, a reduction in water availability in the Cerrado biome region. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"cerrado; climate change; climate effect; groundwater flow; rainfall; recharge; water availability; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099099164

Plants secrete extrafloral nectar, a carbohydrate-rich food that attracts ants, which in return protect plants against herbivores. This ant–plant mutualism is subjected to temporal variation, in which abiotic factors can drive the establishment and frequency of such mutualistic interaction. However, studies investigating how abiotic factors (e.g. climate) directly and indirectly influence ant–plant–herbivore interactions are incipient. In this study, we investigated direct and indirect (via plant phenology) effects of temperature and rainfall on ant–plant–herbivore interactions. To address these goals, each month we estimated six plant phenophases (newly flushed leaves, fully expanded leaves, deciduousness, floral buds, flowers and fruits), the activity of EFNs and abundance of ants and herbivores in 18 EFN-bearing plant species growing in a markedly seasonal region (the Brazilian Cerrado) during a complete growing season. Our results showed that (a) there were marked seasonal patterns in all plant phenophases, EFN activity and the abundance of ants and herbivores; (b) the peak of EFN activity and ant and herbivore abundance simultaneously occurred at the beginning of the rainy season, when new leaves flushed and (c) rainfall directly and indirectly (via changes in the production of new leaves) influenced EFN activity and this in turn provoked changes in ant abundance (but not on herbivores). Synthesis. Overall, our results build towards a better understanding of how climate drives seasonal patterns in ant–plant–herbivore interactions, explicitly considering plant phenology over time. © 2020 British Ecological Society","ant–plant interactions; biotic defence; Brazilian Cerrado; herbivory; indirect defence; mutualism; phenophases; seasonal environment","abiotic factor; ant; cerrado; growing season; mutualism; Neotropical Region; phenology; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; seasonal variation; seasonality; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090936184

A dynamic simulation model based on TRNSYS is developed to evaluate the different energy efficiency options, which includes different buildings of conceived districts. The TRNSYS model is integrated with the plug-in Google SketchUp TRNSYS3d to estimate the thermal load of the buildings and the temporal variation. The model considers the unsteady state energy balance and includes all the features of the building’s envelope. For the considered climatic zones and for the different energy efficiency measures, primary energy savings, pay back periods and reduced CO2 emissions are evaluated. The proposed energy efficiency options include a district heating system for hot water supply, air-to-air conventional heat pumps for both cooling and space heating of the buildings and the integration of photovoltaic and solar thermal systems. The energy actions are compared to baseline scenarios, where the hot water and space heating demand is satisfied by conventional natural gas boilers, the cooling demand is met by conventional air-to-air vapor compression heat pumps and the electric energy demand is satisfied by the power grid. The simulation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the optimal designs and system configurations, as well as suggest guidelines to policymakers to define decarbonization targets in different scenarios. The scenario of Fayoum offers a savings of 67% in primary energy, but the associated payback period extends to 23 years due to the lower cost of energy in comparison to Naples. © 2021 by the authors.

The development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease have been documented in children and young adults residing in Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) exhibiting hyperphosphorylated tau and beta amyloid in 202/203 consecutive forensic autopsies in subjects ≤40y of age. Young MMC residents exhibit progressive cognitive deterioration, brainstem auditory evoked potentials abnormalities, olfaction deficits and cerebrospinal fluid changes in seemingly healthy individuals. Alzheimer’s disease defined as a biologic construct starts in childhood under conditions of sustained fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) above the current USEPA standards and ultrafine particulate matter (UFP). Its development and progression are the result of complex interactions of genetic, nutritional, lifestyle, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, cognitive reserve and cultural factors promoting and protecting exposed individuals. Evidence that Alzheimer’s disease starts in childhood is critical and means that 99.5% of the exposed population ≤ 40y can be staged for Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, it is advisable to execute preventive measures early and control PM2.5 and UFP, particularly combustion and friction-associated nanoparticle emissions, including those from non-regulated diesel vehicles. In this Chapter, we discuss Alzheimer’s disease defined by its underlying pathologic processes and the impact of highly oxidative and ubiquitous combustion and friction-derived nanoparticles (CFDNPs). Specifically we explore their portals of entry, particle sizes, surface charge, biomolecular corona, biodistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, cellular toxicity, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport, and brain dysfunction associated with early and progressive damage to the neurovascular unit and key neuronal, glial and endothelial cellular organelles. The reader should be aware there is a myriad of proteins able to coat nanoparticles (NPs) and their ultimate fate depends in part on the corona composition and stability, their magnetic capabilities, the portal of entry and the target cell. Effects of PM2.5 and nanoparticles on the human brain are multifactorial, thus comparing brain effects across different populations and different air pollution profiles ought to be done with caution. CFDNPs play a major role in the early development and/or acceleration of Alzheimer’s disease.

Thus, the development of technical and management strategies to optimize the yield and the quality of the fruit requires crop phenology studies. Meteorological variables (air temper-ature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation) and morphological characteristics (plant height, leaf emission rate, and leaf area) were recorded throughout the crop cycle. All the leaves and fruits were labeled in their anthesis week to calculate the source–sink ratio and to study the development and quality of the fruits. Data were collected in three commercial orchards representing two different types of systems, greenhouse and screenhouse, and two different re-gions: two plastic cover greenhouses located in the south (SP) and in the north (NP) of Tenerife, and one 40-mesh net screenhouse in the north of the island (NN). The selection of these cultivation systems and locations was made deliberately, so that the ambient variables within these crop protection structures were different throughout the cultivation cycle in order to better fit the model construction. The results suggested that in order to maintain good fruit quality, better environmental control is necessary inside the greenhouses and the screenhouse. Monitoring variables such as the growing degree days, the photosynthetically active radiation, and the number of fruits per plant leaf area ratio provided useful information for papaya production management in the Canary Islands and other subtropical areas, allowing farmers to predict harvest and fruit quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The growing energy demand and depletion of deposits around the globe make the production of oil in the Arctic region a more and more attractive option. However, heavy and high-viscosity oils (HVO), typical for the Arctic region, require considerable amount of energy to be extracted. This, in turn, could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions producing more sever negative environmental impact than the production of non-renewable resources in other regions of the world. This research presents an approach designed to reduce carbon footprint related to hydrocarbons production in the Arctic region. The proposed method is based on the technology used to produce synthetic oil from associated petroleum gas and mixing it with the extracted crude oil. It allows decreasing the viscosity of produced oil, which facilitates oilfield exploitation,limits costly use ofpetroleum gas, and diminishes heat consumption needed for the transport of oil. The performed simulation using ASPEN Hysys shows that the carbon footprint of the proposed process will be lower by up to 24 % than the results obtained for the technology that is being currently used at the oilfields in the Arctic region. © 2020 The Authors","Associated petroleum gas; Oil and gas production in the Arctic region; Oil production carbon footprint","Crude oil; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Oil fields; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Viscosity; Arctic regions; Associated petroleum gas; Field transport; Global economies; Heat consumption; High-viscosity oil; Non-renewable resource; Oilfield exploitation; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095858040

Structure and function studies of OGC may facilitate adaptation of the rTCA cycle to increase the level of carbon fixation for biofuel production. Here we compare the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus OGC with the well-studied mesophilic homologues to identify features that may contribute to thermal stability and activity. We report three OGC BC X-ray structures, each bound to bicarbonate, ADP, or ADP-Mg2+, and propose that substrate binding at high temperatures is facilitated by interactions that stabilize the flexible subdomain B in a partially closed conformation. Kinetic measurements with varying ATP and biotin concentrations distinguish two temperature-dependent steps, consistent with biotin's rate-limiting role in organizing the active site. Transition state thermodynamic values derived from the Eyring equation indicate a larger positive ΔH± and a less negative Δ+ compared to those of a previously reported mesophilic homologue. These thermodynamic values are explained by partially rate limiting product release. Phylogenetic analysis of BC domains suggests that OGC diverged prior to Aquificales evolution. The phylogenetic tree identifies mis-annotations of the Aquificales BC sequences, including the Aquifex aeolicus pyruvate carboxylase structure. Notably, our structural data reveal that the OGC BC dimer comprises a ""wet""dimerization interface that is dominated by hydrophilic interactions and structural water molecules common to all BC domains and likely facilitates the conformational changes associated with the catalytic cycle. Mutations in the dimerization domain demonstrate that dimerization contributes to thermal stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Conformations; Dimerization; Dimers; Hydrophilicity; Molecules; Thermodynamic stability; Conformational change; Hydrogenobacter thermophilus; Hydrophilic interaction; Phylogenetic analysis; Pyruvate carboxylase; Temperature dependent; Thermodynamic values; Tricarboxylic acids; Coenzymes; 2 oxoglutarate carboxylase; adenosine diphosphate; bicarbonate; biotin; carboxylase; dimer; magnesium ion; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; biotin carboxylase; ligase; Aquificae; Article; catalysis; conformational transition; dimerization; enzyme active site; enzyme structure; high temperature; Hydrogenobacter thermophilus; kinetics; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; temperature dependence; thermodynamics; thermostability; X ray; bacterium; chemistry; enzyme stability; enzymology; heat; protein domain; structure activity relation; X ray crystallography; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enzyme Stability; Hot Temperature; Protein Domains; Structure-Activity Relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100199527

Yet, input values for wood product C LCAs frequently rely on potentially outdated generic datasets for wood product outputs and mill efficiencies. Assumptions regarding sawmill efficiencies and sawmill-specific wood product outputs have a direct and significant impact on wood product C LCAs because these variables affect the net carbon footprint of the finished product. The goal of this analysis was to evaluate how well standard wood product C LCA inputs and assumptions for the two initial wood products LCA steps (i) forest operations and (ii) wood processing represent the current state of the wood processing industry in California. We found that sawmill efficiencies and wood product outputs both support and deviate from lookup tables currently used in publications supporting the climate-forest policy dialogue. We recommend further analysis to resolve the major discrepancies in the carbon fraction stored in durable wood products and production-related emissions to improve C LCA metrics and advance forest-related climate policy discussions in California and elsewhere. © 2021 by the authors.

Large disparities among provinces in private vehicle ownership, sufficiency of public transport infrastructure, affordability of clean fuel vehicles, etc. highlight the importance of regionally tailored mitigation strategies to fully exploit carbon reduction potentials. We classify 31 provinces in mainland China into three regional clusters based on their passenger transport development level, then establish a provincial level bottom-up model to project energy demand and CO2 emissions of China's passenger transport sector by 2050. Mitigation effects of improving vehicle energy efficiency, shifting to alternative clean fuels, and promoting public transport are compared, and regionally tailored policy priorities are then proposed. The results show that CO2 emissions of China's passenger transport sector will peak around 2045 at 647 MtCO2 and slightly declined to 642 MtCO2 in 2050 in the Current Policies Scenario. If fully implemented, regionally tailor mitigation strategies that maximize techno-economic carbon reduction potentials could cut CO2 emissions substantially to net-zero in 2050. Mitigation effects of different policy options vary among time periods and regions. Improving vehicle fuel efficiency contributes the most in carbon mitigation over short time scales especially in less developed provinces, where private vehicle ownerships are projected to increase rapidly.

Prior to the installation of a HPHE, the effect of the heat exchanger within the system requires modelling to simulate the overall impact. From this, potential savings and emission reductions can be determined, and the utilisation of the waste heat can be optimised. One such simulation software is TRNSYS. Currently available heat exchanger simulation components in TRNSYS use averaged values such as a constant effectiveness, constant heat transfer coefficient or conductance for the inputs, which are fixed during the entire simulation. These predictions are useful in a steady-state controlled temperature environment such as a heat treatment facility, but not optimal for the majority of energy recovery applications which operate with fluctuating conditions. A transient TRNSYS HPHE component has been developed using the Effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units (ɛ-NTU) method and validated against experimental results. The model predicts outlet temperatures and energy recovery well within an accuracy of 15% and an average of 4.4% error when compared to existing experimental results, which is acceptable for engineering applications. © 2020 The Author(s)","Heat pipe heat exchanger; System simulation; Transient modelling; TRNSYS; Waste heat recovery","Computer software; Emission control; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Heat treatment; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Controlled temperature; Effectiveness number of transfer units; Energy intensive industries; Engineering applications; Heat pipe heat exchangers; Low-grade waste heat; Simulation components; Simulation software; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097395714

This 85-yearold company is committed to energy, refrigerant, and logistics management to reduce the company's carbon footprint intensity, not only because it makes business sense, but because it is the right thing to do. Meijer operates 248 superstores and grocery stores in six states with associated greenhouse gas emissions from lighting, heating, cooling, refrigeration, and logistics. Through a combination of focused engineering, and proactive lifecycle management throughout its operations, Meijer has been able to reduce the carbon intensity of its operations as the company continues to grow. Meijer's dedicated energy and engineering team is well on the way to reducing electricity use in stores by 20% by 2020, based on a 2010 baseline. Implementing energy efficiency projects to meet this goal, along with proactive management of refrigerant systems, has enabled this team to continue to drive down greenhouse gas emissions intensity in the retail area. Meijer's distribution and logistics teams are also contributing to this reduction through replacement of older tractor trailers with clean diesel and hybrid models in addition to innovations in logistics planning to minimize truck miles traveled. Looking to the future, Meijer sees the next frontier of decarbonizing its operations in proactive lifecycle management, technology, and systems innovation. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Carbon emissions; Energy management; Refrigeration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089653234

However, the call to expand those studies, in terms of geographical units of analysis to produce more accurate estimates of the burden of disease in the different countries has been made. Studies of the specific environment-health relationship concerning air pollution in Portugal are scarce and rather descriptive. Therefore, this work assesses the trends both in atmospheric levels of pollutants including particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), and in mortality rates for diabetes, malignant neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory, digestive and circulatory systems, and explores the links between exposure to air pollutants and mortality, following proposed biological pathways and using inferential statistics methods, for the period 2010 to 2017 in Portugal. The following major conclusions were drawn: (i) despite a somewhat initial downward trend in PM10 and a peak in O3 levels, fairly constant air pollution levels were mostly observed; (ii) concomitantly, increases in age-adjusted mortality rates were significant for all diseases except diabetes; (iii) lower atmospheric levels of pollutants were observed in rural areas, when compared to urban areas, except for ozone; (iv) age-adjusted mortality rates were higher in rural regions, for diabetes, and in urban regions, for malignant neoplasms; (v) for a 10 μg/m3 increase in atmospheric levels of PM10, regression analysis estimated an increase of 0.30% in the mortality rate for diseases of the respiratory, digestive and circulatory systems, and malignant neoplasms combined. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric pollutants; Disease burden; Environmental health; Environmental risks; Quantitative methods","Air pollution; Cardiovascular system; Disease control; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Tumors; Atmospheric levels; Biological pathways; Circulatory systems; Environmental risk factor; Geographical units; Inferential statistics; Long term exposure; Particulate Matter; Air pollution control; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; biological product; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; environmental conditions; environmental risk; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; quantitative analysis; trend analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; diabetes mellitus; gastrointestinal disease; human; ischemia; malignant neoplasm; morbidity; mortality; mortality rate; particulate matter; pollutant; Portugal; priority journal; regression analysis; respiratory tract disease; rural area; statistics; urban area; air pollutant; environmental exposure; epidemiology; mortality; time factor; Portugal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biological Products; Environmental Exposure; Mortality; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Portugal; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092082938

In large areas of the Region, the sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) accounts with a reduced amount of water that might not be enough to keep the plant functioning at desirable levels. In this study the use of a reflective clay, kaolin, was evaluated in order to alleviate the negative summer stress effects on olive trees (cv. Cobrançosa) under an SDI system. Kaolin reduced the stomatal and the non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis at high light intensity, improved plant water status, and decreased the oxidative damages. The amelioration of physiological and metabolic functions and the lower allocation of resources to summer stress tolerance mechanisms, allowed the KL-sprayed trees to increase crop yield, the oil yield and its oxidative stability, with the reduction of peroxide index and K232. Thus, the application of kaolin had a positive synergistic effect with SDI, especially important for semi-arid areas where water available for irrigation do not cover all the necessities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaptation strategies; Crop yield; Olea europaea; Olive oil; Particle film; Photosynthesis","climate change; crop yield; metabolism; oxidation; resource allocation; seasonal variation; semiarid region; spray; sustainability; tree; Mediterranean Region; Olea europaea; Osa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093122590

In the biodiverse Madrean Sky Islands, P. ponderosa forests exist on insular mountains separated by arid lands. How do EM fungi in these isolated ranges respond to fire, and can data from individual ranges predict community shifts after fire at a regional scale? By comparing areas in two ranges that experienced moderate fires 12–16 y earlier, and proximate areas in each range without recent fire, we reveal pervasive effects on diversity and composition of EM communities more than a decade after moderate fires occurred. Post-fire differences in EM communities in different ranges highlight the challenge of predicting fungal community shifts in these isolated forests, despite similarities of climate, plant communities, and fire severity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society","Basidiomycota; Cenooccum; Climate change; Pinaceae; Russula",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096193302

To effectively reduce these emissions, a good knowledge of source locations and strengths is required. Airborne remote sensing instruments such as the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) with meter-scale imaging capabilities are able to yield information about the locations and magnitudes of methane sources. In this study, we successfully applied the weighting function modified differential optical absorption spectroscopy (WFMDOAS) algorithm to AVIRIS-NG data measured in Canada and the Four Corners region. The WFM-DOAS retrieval is conceptually located between the statistical matched filter (MF) and the optimal-estimation-based iterative maximum a posteriori DOAS (IMAP-DOAS) retrieval algorithm, both of which were already applied successfully to AVIRIS-NG data. The WFM-DOAS algorithm is based on a first order Taylor series approximation of the Lambert-Beer law using only one precalculated radiative transfer calculation per scene. This yields the fast quantitative processing of large data sets. We detected several methane plumes in the AVIRIS-NG images recorded during the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Airborne Campaign and successfully retrieved a coal mine ventilation shaft plume observed during the Four Corners measurement campaign. The comparison between IMAP-DOAS, MF, and WFMDOAS showed good agreement for the coal mine ventilation shaft plume. An additional comparison between MF and WFM-DOAS for a subset of plumes showed good agreement for one plume and some differences for the others. For five plumes, the emissions were estimated using a simple cross-sectional flux method. The retrieved fluxes originated from well pads, cold vents, and a coal mine ventilation shaft and ranged between (155 ± 71) kg (CH4) h-1 and (1220 ± 450) kg (CH4) h-1. The wind velocity was a significant source of uncertainty in all plumes, followed by the single pixel retrieval noise and the uncertainty due to atmospheric variability. The noise of the retrieved CH4 imagery over bright surfaces (> 1 μW cm-2 nm-1 sr-1 at 2140 nm) was typically ±2:3 % of the background total column of CH4 when fitting strong absorption lines around 2300 nm but could reach over ±5 % for darker surfaces (> 0.3 μW cm-2 nm-1 sr-1 at 2140 nm).

Most previous research and review articles on this topic focused on a single ecosystem service and did not integrate all essential soil ecosystem services. This overview paper (1) synthesizes the impacts of biochar on water and wind erosion, C sequestration, soil water, nutrient leaching, soil fertility, crop yields, and other soil ecosystem services based on published literature and (2) highlights remaining research areas. Literature indicates that, in addition to sequestering C, biochar can reduce N2O emissions, nitrate leaching, and runoff; increase soil microbial biomass, plant available water, and crop yields (particularly in tropical regions), and CO2 emissions; and have small or no effects on water and wind erosion. Biochar benefits can be in this order: C sequestration &gt; N2O emissions &gt; Nitrate leaching &gt; Available water &gt; Soil biology &gt; Soil fertility &gt; Crop yields &gt; Runoff. However, literature also indicates that biochar does not always improve all ecosystem services. Its benefits depend on biochar feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, application rate, biochar properties, soil properties, climate, and other factors. For example, biochar can enhance crop yields more in degraded and low fertility soils than in highly fertile and fine-textured soils. Long-term (&gt;3 years) field-scale studies under different soil types, management conditions, and climates are needed for a determination of optimum levels of application, comprehensive life-cycle analysis, and assessment of agronomic and environmental tradeoffs. Overall, biochar can improve most soil ecosystem services, but the extent of such improvement is highly dependent on biochar properties and soil and climatic conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

In particular, we examined the peculiar composition-dependent electronic structure of copper doped CdZnSe quantum dots. It is shown that the nature and density of electronic states involved with the emission process is a function of copper inclusion level, providing a very direct handle for controlling the spontaneous lifetimes. The spontaneous emission lifetimes are estimated by examining the ratios of emission lifetimes to absolute quantum yields and also measured directly by ultrafast luminescence upconversion experiments. We find excellent agreement between these classes of experiments. This scheme enables us to tune spontaneous emission lifetimes by three orders of magnitude from 15 ns to over 7 μs, which is unprecedented in existing lumophores. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Cadmium alloys; Chromophores; Copper; Electronic states; Electronic structure; Nanocrystals; Photonic devices; Semiconductor alloys; Spontaneous emission; Zinc alloys; Absolute quantum yields; Density of electronic state; Emission lifetime; Emission process; Radiative emissions; Radiative lifetime; Spontaneous emission lifetime; Three orders of magnitude; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100937492

Indoor plants can phytoremediate a wide variety of indoor contaminants. Nonetheless, few experiments have demonstrated their efficacy in real-time environments. Therefore, the present study aims to experimentally assess the efficiency of Areca palm potted plants in phytoremediation of primary indoor air pollutant viz. total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) levels from real-world indoor spaces, for the first time. Four discrete naturally ventilated experimental sites (I-IV) situated at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT) were used. For over a period of 4 months, the sites were monitored using zero plants as a control (1–4 week), three plants (5–8 week), six plants (9–12 week), and nine plants (13–16 week), respectively. Present results indicate that Areca palm potted plants can effectively reduce the TVOCs, CO2, and CO levels by 88.16% in site IV, 52.33% and 95.70% in site III, respectively. The current study concluded that Areca palm potted plants offer an efficient, cost-effective, self-regulating, sustainable solution for improving indoor air quality and thereby human well-being and productivity in closed and confined spaces. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Areca palm; CO; CO2; Indoor air pollution; Phytoremediation; TVOCs","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; experimental study; indoor air; mitigation; phytoremediation; pollution exposure; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; Areca; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; plant; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Areca; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092767312

In this paper we examine the effects of three sequenced federal policies on the share of new housing construction by type in the U.S., and estimate the cumulative influence of those policies on the composition of the 2015 housing stock. In a counterfactual 2015 housing stock without the policy effects, 14 million housing units exist as multifamily rather than single-family, equal to 14.1% of urban housing. Accompanied by floor area reductions of 0-50%, the switch from single- to multifamily housing reduces energy demand by 27-47% per household, and total urban residential energy by 4.6-8.3%. This paper is the first to link federal policies to housing outcomes by type and estimate associated effects on residential energy and GHG emissions. Removing policy barriers and disincentives to multifamily housing can unlock a large potential for reducing residential energy demand and GHG emissions in the coming decades. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

On-farm trials were conducted at three study sites/districts (Ziway, Halaba and Loka-Abaya) during the 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. The experiment compared five climate smart treatments against existing recommended practice. Three farms were selected at each site. Each farm hosted one full experimental repetition, thus functioning as an experimental block. The average data of the two seasons were taken from each farm and means were calculated per site and over the study sites as well. The on-farm trails were established to identify a CSA technology that can improve yields and economic returns, while simultaneously reduce GHG emissions at the farm level. Averaged over the three sites, a combined application of seed priming with micro-dosing (0.5 g of fertilizer per pocket) was identified as the best-fit technology in terms of farm productivity and farm income. Results show that this technology increased maize grain yield by up to 45% (compared to the recommended practice). A model CSA farm was then created using this technology which was compared with the performance of the farmers' current system (conventional farm). It generated surplus production of both grain (more than three times higher) and fodder. The CSA farm produced 84% of dry matter fodder (DM) requirements and 60% of livestock crude protein (CP) needs respectively, while the conventional farm produced 30% DM and 48% of CP needs. Furthermore, the CSA farm demonstrated reduced GHG emissions compared to the conventional farm which grows maize without the use of mineral fertilizers. Our estimates indicate that due to the establishment of multipurpose trees on the CSA farm, the total on-farm C stock was about 29 Mg ha−1, that is 24% higher than the conventional farm. In conclusion, we recommend the combined application of seed priming and micro-dosing as a strategy for improving economic returns and an approach to enhance the sustainability of maize-based mixed systems in southern Ethiopia. Planting multipurpose trees will give additional benefits in terms of fodder and carbon sequestration. © 2020 The Authors","Climate-smart agriculture; Conventional farm; Economic returns; Farm productivity; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low-cost technologies","cropping practice; dry matter; experiment; fodder; greenhouse gas; growing season; maize; protein; smallholder; sustainability; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098118985

Optimization algorithms explored so far in the literature, like dynamic programming (DP) or equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), have systematically analyzed the potential CO2 reduction for different topologies and degree of hybridization. However, the management of engine and electric machine (EM) neglects that the catalyst material in the aftertreatment system needs to reach a certain temperature to properly convert pollutant emissions. In this study, the thermal management of the catalyst in a gasoline HEV has been investigated, and two algorithms have been proposed. Two strategies based on the ECMS are presented: the first one explicitly considers the catalyst temperature; the second one keeps the underlying structure of ECMS, but it adds a high-level rule to indirectly encompass catalyst management. To have a reliable catalyst temperature, a monodimensional model for the three-way catalyst (TWC), incorporating chemical kinetics, has been implemented. Finally, both strategies have been assessed via numerical simulations on two different driving cycles: the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) and the Transport for London cycle (TfL), an urban driving cycle that is selected as a worst-case scenario for the thermal management of the aftertreatment system. On the WLTC both strategies show a 2% increase in fuel consumption with a potential 60% NOx reduction. On the urban cycle, only the second strategy is able to ensure the catalyst heating in a reasonable timespan. However general trends are still confirmed: when the catalyst thermal management is incorporated into the energy management strategy, since the first ignition, the engine produces extra power and charges the battery so that the TWC reaches the light-off temperature over a time-lapse comparable with a conventional vehicle. The stored energy is exploited at higher power demands to reduce the fuel consumption. The average engine load is hence shifted upwards in comparison to a fuel economy-oriented strategy. © 2021 SAE International.","Hybrid vehicles; Optimal control strategy; Three-way catalyst thermal control; Vehicle efficiency; Vehicle emissions","Automobile testing; Catalysts; Dynamic programming; Electric tools; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Urban transportation; Degree of hybridization; Energy management strategies; Equivalent consumption minimization strategies (ECMS); Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Light-off temperatures; Optimal control theory; Optimization algorithms; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114684404

The analysis thus offers an overview of the current state of knowledge on the environmental sustainability of GBM production. Possible future development pathways and knowledge gaps are identified and explained to provide guidance for the future development of GBMs. Methods: Comparable scopes, aggregation levels, and impact assessment methods are used to analyse diverse GBMs with three different functional units for graphene oxide, pristine graphene, and other GBMs with different carbon/oxygen ratios or thickness. The ecoinvent v3.4 cut-off database is used for background data in all models to provide a common basis of comparison. Furthermore, uncertainty calculations are carried out to give insights on the current level of knowledge and to check if GBM production methods can be differentiated. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the energy inputs with a detailed description of three future scenarios for the European electricity mix. Results and discussion: The general analysis of all results highlights three key strategies to improve the environmental sustainability of GBM production. (1) The use of decarbonised energy sources reduces substantially the impacts of GBMs. This benefit is decreased, however, when conservative forecasts of the future European electricity mix are considered. (2) Increased energy efficiency of production is useful mainly for the processes of electrochemical exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition. (3) The principles of green chemistry provide relevant ideas to reduce the impacts of GBMs mainly for the processes of chemical and thermal reduction and for the production of graphene oxide. Furthermore, the analysis of new data on ball milling production reveals that transforming GBM solutions into dry-mass can substantially increase the environmental impacts because of the energy-intensive nature of this conversion. The uncertainty analysis then shows that it is still difficult to differentiate all production methods with the current knowledge on this emerging technology. Conclusions: With our current level of knowledge on GBMs, it is clear that more accurate data is needed on different production methods to identify frontrunners. Nevertheless, it seems that unknowns, like the state of future electricity mixes, might not often hinder such comparisons because conservative forecasts bring similar changes on many production options. Additionally, functional properties and toxicity for GBMs will require further attention to improve our confidence in the comparison of production methods in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","Eco-design suggestions; Graphene; Harmonised comparison; Life cycle assessment; Prospective model","carbon; graphene; graphene oxide; oxygen; pristine graphene; unclassified drug; Article; calculation; chemexfoliation; chemical vapor deposition; comparative study; dry mass; electricity; energy; energy conversion; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; European; green chemistry; knowledge; life cycle assessment; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); sensitivity analysis; thickness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100896420

Yet deliberate policy efforts to incentivise BECCS—whether through amending existing climate policies or introducing entirely new ones—remain rare. In this paper, we contend that BECCS must be incentivised responsibly, through policy-making processes which account for diverse and geographically varying societal values and interests. More specifically, we make the case for responsible incentivisation by undertaking a comparative analysis of stakeholder attitudes to four idealised policy scenarios for BECCS, including representatives of government, business, nongovernmental and academic communities, in the UK and Sweden. The scenarios were: business as usual; international policy reform; national BECCS policy; and national policy for negative emissions technologies. Based on our findings, we recommend that policymakers 1) recognise the need to develop new incentives and make enabling reforms to existing policy instruments; 2) consider the risk of mitigation deterrence in their real world (and not abstracted) contexts; 3) employ multi-instrument approaches to incentivisation that do not overly rely on carbon pricing or 4) force a choice between technology specific or technology neutral policies; and 5) attend to the diversity of stakeholder and wider public perspectives that will ultimately determine the success—or failure—of their policy designs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate policy; Greenhouse gas removal; Negative emissions; Stakeholder attitudes","carbon dioxide; Article; attitude; bioenergy; bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon footprint; carbon storage; commercial phenomena; government; human; non-governmental organization; policy; priority journal; Sweden; technology; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096390113

Here we pay attention to sliding layers. Sliding layers are formed in the ionosphere, on separatrix surfaces, at the magnetopauses and boundaries of stellar astrospheres, and at the Alfvén radius in the equatorial magnetosphere of rapidly rotating strongly magnetized giant planets. Although sliding contacts usually occur in thin local layers, their influence on the global structure of the surrounding space is very great. Therefore, they are associated with non-local processes that play a key role on a large scale. There can be an exchange between different forms of energy, a generation of strong field-aligned currents and emissions, and an amplification of magnetic fields. Depending on the conditions in the magnetosphere of the planet/exoplanet and in the flow of magnetized plasma passing it, different numbers of sliding layers with different configurations appear. Some are associated with regions of auroras and possible radio emissions. The search for planetary radio emissions is a current task in the detection of exoplanets. © 2021 by the authors.

Depending on the load of the vehicle, there exist multiple emission-minimal arcs for traveling between two locations. To solve the vehicle routing problem efficiently, a column generation approach is presented. At the core of the procedure an emission-oriented elementary shortest path problem on a multigraph is solved by a backward labeling algorithm. It is shown that the labeling algorithm can be sped up by adjusting the dual master program and by restricting the number of labels propagated in the sub-problem. The column generation technique is used to setup a fast heuristic as well as a branch-and-price algorithm. Both procedures are evaluated based on test instances with up to 100 customers. It turns out that the heuristic approach is very effective and generates near-optimal solutions with gaps below 0.1% on average while only requiring a fraction of the runtime of the exact approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Branch-and-price algorithm; Column generation; Emission minimization; Green logistics; Multigraph; Routing","Directed graphs; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Linear programming; Vehicles; Branch-and-price algorithms; Column generation approach; Heterogeneous vehicles; Heuristic approach; Labeling algorithms; Near-optimal solutions; Shortest path problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087982185

Although national government has implemented various policies and systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it would only remain in industrial and public areas. Thus, in order to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions, local governments should play a major role as a leading management entity and it is necessary to adopt efficient and systematic management of the non-industrial sector, which accounted for a significant portion of the country’s emissions. However, the policy of the local governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has not been effective due to lacking in connectivity to the central government’s plan or presenting it in a simple listing format. The characteristics of inventory building such as main purpose, boundary setting, emission source, policy setting, range, organizing body, relevant law of inventory building between national government, and local governments are quite different from the start. In order to reflect the actual greenhouse gas reduction activities of the local governments, this study reconstructs the categories that are considered to have management authority in the local governments such as home, commercial, and road transportation among the scope 1 of the local governments inventory and scope 2 for establishing effective policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in local governments. This study also proposes reduced inventory by reorganizing categories that local governments deem to have managerial authority among direct and indirect emission of greenhouse gas inventory. © The Author(s) 2020.","emission coefficients; emission inventory reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions; greenhouse gas inventories","Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Public policy; Central government; Emission coefficient; Emission inventories; Greenhouse gas inventory; Greenhouse gas reductions; National governments; Road transportation; Systematic management; Gas emissions; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; local government; pollution policy; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081535149

Measures need to be taken to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming and climate change, and to prove that they will benefit from the research. The global success of these measures was achieved through the Kyoto Protocol. According to this protocol, countries are responsible for emissions, and they should take measures and try to minimize them. These oscillations must be calculated in order not to exceed the emission limits specified by the protocol. The carbon footprint, which is a measure of the damage to the environment, is an indicator of greenhouse gas emissions and the unit is expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent. While determining the carbon footprint, IPCC, GHG Protocol, UNFCCC, ISO 14064 STANDARD are taken into account. In this study, the number of automobiles in Izmir was taken from Turkey Statistics Institution (TUIK) data, and their carbon footprints were classified according to the type of fuel they used. IPCC Tier-1 method was used in the calculations and IPCC 2006 guide was used for the values based on fuels. As a result of the calculations, the total CO2 emissions of 821.391 cars in Izmir, in terms of gasoline, diesel and LPG CO2 emissions were also calculated. It was found 1.857.845 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied petroleum gas; Sustainable development; Agenda items; CO2 emissions; Emission limits; Global warming and climate changes; KYOTO protocol; Carbon footprint",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101707463

Direct measurement of forest carbon flux improves quantification for trading but has not been applied to forest carbon research projects with more than 600 site installations worldwide. In this study, we apply carbon accounting methods, scaling hours to decades to 28-years of scientific CO2 eddy covariance data for the Harvard Forest (US-Ha1), located in central Massachusetts, USA and estab-lishing commercial carbon trading protocols and applications for similar sites. We illustrate and explain transactions of high-frequency direct measurement for CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE, gC m−2 year−1 ) that track and monetize ecosystem carbon dynamics in contrast to approaches that rely on forest mensuration and growth models. NEE, based on eddy covariance methodology, quantifies loss of CO2 by ecosystem respiration accounted for as an unavoidable debit to net carbon sequestration. Retrospective analysis of the US-Ha1 NEE times series including carbon pricing, interval analysis, and ton-year exit accounting and revenue scenarios inform entrepreneur, investor, and landowner forest carbon commercialization strategies. CO2 efflux accounts for ~45% of the US-Ha1 NEE, an error of ~466% if excluded; however, the decades-old coupled human and natural system remains a financially viable net carbon sink. We introduce isoflux NEE for t13 C16 O2 and t12 C18 O16 O to directly partition and quantify daytime ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis, creating new soil carbon commerce applications and derivative products in contrast to undifferenti-ated bulk soil carbon pool approaches.

Uncertainty on specific actions and strategies remains, leading to a research-implementation gap. For Ecuador, one of the key challenges to local adaptation are the institutional capacities of the decentralized autonomous governments (GAD, Spanish acronym). Therefore, the objective of this study is firstly to apply a capacity development strategy developed by GIZ (2013a) in the context of limited knowledge and resources and secondly gain a deeper understanding of climate action in Ecuador on a provincial level. The case study is based on an experimental participatory workshop in the coastal province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. The applied methodology has three components: firstly, semi-structured expert interviews on climate action in Ecuador; secondly, the participatory workshops with technicians and employees of the provincial government, its analysis together with a pre-, post- and two-months-after the workshop follow-up survey; thirdly, the analysis of the workshop is complemented by a peer validation of the co-facilitators. The analysis of the workshop suggests that in a context of limited institutional capacity, an understanding of climate change terminology, vulnerability and adaptive capacity is crucial to interpret predictions and to motivate action. Additionally, results indicate that pairing the content of the seminar with elements of project management might also strengthen local planning and longevity of rural development measures. Overall, the methodology of GIZ might therefore not be suitable in the local context due to its fast pace and difficult terminology. A more promising approach to foster local climate action is the Design-Thinking (DT) methodology due to its easier accessibility. Based on the insights of the case study a capacity development strategy incorporating DT offers lessons learnt for practitioners aiming to promote local climate action in comparable institutional contexts of limited knowledge and resources. As limited knowledge and resources are often main barriers to climate action, developing capacity building strategies will in turn foster climate action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Design-thinking; Ecuador; Institutional capacity development; Local climate action; Street level bureaucracy","Developing countries; Project management; Regional planning; Strategic planning; Terminology; Adaptive capacity; Capacity building; Capacity development; Decentralized government; Institutional capacities; Institutional contexts; Participatory workshops; Rural development; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097709945

Transport is also crucial to connect remote areas to central or urban areas. Yet, sustainable and flexible transport is among the greatest challenges for rural areas and rural-urban regions. Innovative transport concepts and approaches are urgently needed to foster sustainable and integrated regional development. This article addresses challenges of sustainability, accessibility, and connectivity through examining complementary systems to existing public transport, including demand-responsive transport and multimodal mobility. We draw upon case studies from the Metropolitan Area of Styria, Ljubljana Urban Region and ruralWales (GUSTmobil, REGIOtim, EURBAN, Bicikelj, Bwcabus, Grass Routes). In-depth analysis through a mixed-methods case study design captures the complexity behind these chosen examples, which form a basis for analysing the effects of services on accessibility for different groups, connectivity to public transport and usability as a ""first and last mile” feeder. We further explore the weaknesses of complementary transport systems, including legal, organisational and financial barriers, and offer potential solutions to structure and communicate complementary transport systems to improve access and use. Looking ahead, we use the case studies to anticipate innovative, sustainable ""mobility as a service” (MaaS) solutions within and between urban and rural areas and consider how future public policy orientations and arrangements can enable positive change. A main concern of our article and the contribution to scientific literature is through exploring the benefit of well-established multi-level governance arrangements when introducing smaller-scale mobility solutions to improve rural-urban accessibility. It becomes clear that not a one-size-fits-all model but placed-based and tailored approaches lead to successful and sustainable concepts. © 2021 by the authors.

In this regard, national and local governments are setting goals and actions to tackle this issue. The municipality of Barcelona has set an intervention for the academic year 2020–21: introducing low-carbon meals in public schools. This study assesses the environmental and nutritional benefits of this intervention by applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, with an energy and nutritional functional unit; and combined it with the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus approach, by considering three WEF resources-based impacts (Blue Water Footprint (BWF), Primary Energy Demand (PED) and Land Use (LU)) and the Global Warming Potential (GWP). The transition to a low-carbon meal would reduce between 46 and 60% the environmental impacts. These benefits could even be higher when extra interventions within the school boundaries are applied.

A regional latest Aptian extensional pulse in the Southern Tethyan margin is here envisaged as being responsible for different events of sedimentation and erosion in the Panormide carbonate platform as highlighted by the outcropping sections studied from the NW Sicilian fold and thrust belt. Integrating facies and stratal pattern analysis with backstripping methods has permitted to define the interaction between tectonics and sedimentary factors of the Lower Cretaceous shallow-water carbonates. Based on geometric configuration, lateral facies relationships, and thicknesses variations of the Lower Cretaceous Requienid limestone, is here envisaged a paleophysiography characterised by banks separated by deep channels. The margins of the isolated carbonate platform were oriented towards both the present-day west, where originally the Cala Rossa intraplatform basin developed driven by transtensional movements, and to the present-day east, where the continental slope was spreading. Including subsidence analysis and significance of the top-unconformity of the Requienid limestone a tectonic event at the end of the Aptian was detected as responsible for the fragmentation of the platform in various rotating fault-blocks and reworking of shallow-water carbonates towards the slope. The variable subsidence rates correspond to the different responses, both emersion and drowning, of the various platform-blocks to the extensional tectonics. Paleoceanographic changes, detected around the world during the Aptian-Albian, are well recorded also from the Sicilian sections, where continental clays – as the product of weathering of crystalline rocks – metallic crusts (hardgrounds) and condensed phosphatized pelagic deposits – as the product of sediment starvation, condensation and drowning – cover the Lower Cretaceous shallow-water carbonates respectively in the different faulted blocks of the segmented carbonate platform. Chemical and mineralogical analyses confirm for these deposits an influence in their formation caused by variations in oceanographic and environmental conditions, as increasing of metal ions in the surficial sea-water and high rates of groundwater precipitation. Paleoclimate evaluation reveals changes from the greenhouse arid conditions, developed during the lower Cretaceous and permitting the sedimentation of the shallow-water carbonates, to warm-humid climate condition during the latest Aptian-lower Albian boundary. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aptian-albian boundary; Extensional synsedimentary tectonics; Kaolinitic clays; Metallic crusts; NW Sicily; Phosphatized condensed pelagites; Shallow carbonate banks and deep channels","Accidents; Carbonates; Carbonation; Chemical analysis; Crystalline rocks; Deposits; Groundwater; Lime; Limestone; Metal ions; Metals; Seawater; Sedimentology; Subsidence; Weathering; Carbonate platforms; Environmental conditions; Extensional tectonics; Fold-and-thrust belts; Geometric configurations; Mineralogical analysis; Sediment starvation; Shallow water carbonates; Tectonics; Albian; Aptian; carbonate platform; climate variation; crust; kaolinite; paleoclimate; pelagic deposit; sedimentation; shallow water; synsedimentary tectonics; Tethys; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095993037

Therefore, both the control and reduction of CO2 emissions have become environmental issues of major concern and big challenges for the international scientific community. Among the proposed strategies to achieve these goals, conversion of CO2 by its reduction into high added value products, such as methane or syngas, has been widely agreed to be the most attractive from the environmental and economic points of view. In the present work, thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2 was studied over a nanostructured ceria-supported nickel catalyst. Ceria nanocubes were employed as support, while the nickel phase was supported by means a surfactant-free controlled chemical precipitation method. The resulting nanocatalyst was characterized in terms of its physicochemical properties, with special attention paid to both surface basicity and reducibility. The nanocatalyst was studied during CO2 reduction by means of Near Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (NAP-XPS). Two different catalytic behaviors were observed depending on the reaction temperature. At low temperature, with both Ce and Ni in an oxidized state, CH4 formation was observed, whereas at high temperature above 500◦C, the reverse water gas shift reaction became dominant, with CO and H2O being the main products. NAP-XPS was revealed as a powerful tool to study the behavior of this nanostructured catalyst under reaction conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we address the regeneration of a Caatinga dry forest in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture and chronic anthropogenic disturbance by examining forest regeneration mechanisms and a comprehensive set of community-level plant diversity measures (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) in regenerating (4 to 70-yr old) and old-growth forest stands. Resprouting from root suckers was the predominant regeneration mechanism across recently abandoned crop fields. Overall, regenerating forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of taxonomic and functional composition, and functional and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, except for the taxonomic diversity, community-level plant diversity measures were not related to forest age or soil properties. Our results suggest that Caatinga dry forest covering sandy soils is particularly resilient due to regeneration driven by resprouting. The same set of plant species dominates the entire regeneration process, including old-growth forest stands. Accordingly, Caatinga dry forest regeneration may follow an initial composition model, rather than following a directional and deterministic trajectory associated with species replacements. This initial composition model probably results from a combination of three factors: (1) early regeneration driven by resprouting rather than seed arrival and seedling recruitment; (2) biomass accumulation mostly due to growth by early colonizers and by those species able to resprout after chronic anthropogenic disturbance and during forest regeneration; and (3) the co-occurrence of functionally distinct plant species. Accordingly, resprouting can guarantee some level of resilience, and hence, the services provided by secondary forests. Nevertheless, forest dynamics in landscapes inhabited by forest-dependent people are affected to a great extent by the nature of the imposed pressures and the ecological profile of the remaining flora. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chronic anthropogenic disturbance; Community assembly; Mechanisms of regeneration; Seasonally dry tropical forest; Secondary succession; Taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity measures; Woody plant assemblages","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Carbon capture; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Seed; Storage as a service (STaaS); Anthropogenic disturbance; Biomass accumulation; Carbon sequestration; Functional compositions; Phylogenetic diversity; Regeneration mechanisms; Seedling recruitment; Slash-and-burn agriculture; Reforestation; biodiversity; caatinga; carbon sequestration; dry forest; ecosystem resilience; forest dynamics; old-growth forest; regeneration; resprouting; seedling establishment; stand structure; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forests; Growth; Plants; Reforestation; Set; Catostomidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098718300

They can decrease the urban heat island (UHI), reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fix environmental pollutants, manage urban stormwater runoff, attenuate noise, and enhance biodiversity. This paper aims to analyse green roofs and walls in the possible mitigation of urban climate change and compare it by continent. Green roofs and walls might decrease the air temperature in a city up to 11.3◦ C and lower the thermal transmittance into buildings up to 0.27 W/m2 K. Urban greening might sequester up to 375 g C·m−2 per two growing seasons and increase stormwater retention up to 100%. Urban greening might attenuate city noise up to 9.5 dB. The results found green roofs and walls of varied effectiveness in ameliorating climate extremes present in host continents. Results show urban planners might focus on green roofs and walls exposure to attenuate temperatures in hotter Asian cities and advise greening in cities in Africa and Asia. European and American designers might optimise runoff water capacity of green roofs and walls systems and use greening in old buildings to improve insulation. Recommendations are made based on the study to concentrate certain designs to have greater impact on priority climate challenges, whether UHI or stormwater related.

The acoustic emission (AE) approach is one of the powerful NDT techniques that can be suitable for damage detection due to its high sensitivity to localized damage. In this paper, an improved method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Shannon entropy (E) is proposed to localize the structural damage using AE sensors without considering any manual feature extraction of standalone AE parameters. EMD is first applied to eliminate the noise from the measured AE data and extract the key AE components, and then the E value of each AE component is estimated and used to identify the potential location of a crack in structural elements. The proposed method is validated using a suite of experimental studies and AE data obtained from a full-scale concrete dam located in Ontario, Canada. The results show the capability of the proposed method for identifying the approximate location of the damages and prove that the proposed method can be suitable for robust damage or crack localization. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Acoustic sensor; AE; Damage localization; EMD; NDT; Shannon entropy; SHM","Acoustic equipment; Damage detection; Safety testing; Signal processing; Structural analysis; Acoustic Sensors; Crack localization; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Large scale structures; Structural condition; Structural damages; Structural elements; Time-frequency decomposition; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100341771

The guiding effect of the blower guide vanes on the airflow is weak, and the back pressure effect of the guide vanes mounting body is significant, which reduces the primary air volume and prolongs the combustion history in the central region of the flame; The temperature field is evenly distributed and the combustion is well distributed; CH4 and CO in the furnace chamber are basically burned out and the NO concentration in the furnace chamber is about 800 ppm, which basically meets the emission standard and the combustion effect is good. This paper has certain guiding significance for the study of burner structure. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2021.",,"Atmospheric structure; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Heat treating furnaces; Planning; Pressure effects; Sustainable development; Atmospheric pollutants; Combustion history; Emission standard; Energy saving and emission reductions; Geometric modeling; Guiding significances; Mixed combustions; NO concentration; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100740030

Household-level quantitative energy analyses enable better understanding regarding interconnections between the level and composition of energy use, and SDG achievement. This study examines the household-level energy footprints in Nepal, Vietnam, and Zambia. We calculate the footprints using multi-regional input-output with energy extensions based on International Energy Agency data. We propose an original perspective on the links between household final energy use and well-being, measured through access to safe water, health, education, sustenance, and modern fuels. In all three countries, households with high well-being show much lower housing energy use, due to a transition from inefficient biomass-based traditional fuels to efficient modern fuels, such as gas and electricity. We find that households achieving well-being have 60%-80% lower energy footprint of residential fuel use compared to average across the countries. We observe that collective provisioning systems in form of access to health centers, public transport, markets, and garbage disposal and characteristics linked to having solid shelter, access to sanitation, and minimum floor area are more important for the attainment of well-being than changes in income or total energy consumption. This is an important finding, contradicting the narrative that basic well-being outcomes require increased income and individual consumption of energy. Substantial synergies exist between the achievement of well-being at a low level of energy use and other SDGs linked to poverty reduction (encompassed in SDG1), health (SDG3), sanitation (SDG6), gender equality (SDG5), climate action and reduced deforestation (SDG 13 and SDG15) and inequalities (SDG10). © 2021 The Author(s).","Consumer expenditure surveys; Developing countries; Household energy footprint; Logistic regression; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Well-being","Deforestation; Fuels; Health; Housing; Sanitation; Sustainable development; Consumption of energy; Household level; International energy agency; Poverty reduction; Public transport; Social and environmental; Total energy consumption; Traditional fuels; Energy utilization; energy conservation; energy planning; energy use; equity; fuel consumption; residential energy; Sustainable Development Goal; Nepal; Viet Nam; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100731234

As a result, gravitational potential energy is not efficiently exploited and braking at down-slopes (which wastes energy) becomes unavoidable. Thus, there is still significant scope to improve fuel saving behavior on slopes. To address this opportunity, in this paper, we present a dynamic eco-driving system (EDS) for a (host) vehicle based on model predictive control (MPC) with fuzzy-tuned weights, which helps efficiently utilize the gravitational potential energy. In the proposed EDS, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem with an appropriate prediction horizon and an objective function based on the factors affecting vehicle fuel consumption. The objective function's weight is tuned via fuzzy inference techniques using information of the vehicle's instantaneous velocity and the road slope angle. By considering the vehicle longitudinal dynamics, preceding vehicle's state, and road slope information (obtained from the digital road map), the optimization generates velocity trajectories for the host vehicle that minimizes fuel consumption and CO2 emission. We also investigate the traffic flow performance of following vehicles (behind the host vehicle) in dense traffic; this was not considered in existing works on hilly roads. The effectiveness of the proposed EDS is evaluated using microscopic traffic simulations on a real road stretch in Fukuoka City, Japan, and the results demonstrate that the fuzzy-tuned MPC EDS significantly reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the host vehicle compared to the traditional driving (human-based) system (TDS) for the same travel time. In dense traffic, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission of following vehicles are noticeably reduced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-driving; Fuzzy inference; Model predictive control; Nonlinear optimization; Road slopes","Carbon dioxide; Cost functions; Fuel economy; Fuels; Fuzzy inference; Gravitation; Man machine systems; Model predictive control; Molecular physics; Nonlinear programming; Optimal control systems; Potential energy; Predictive control systems; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Travel time; Fuzzy inference techniques; Gravitational potential energy; Longitudinal dynamics; Microscopic traffic simulation; Non-linear optimization problems; Objective functions; Prediction horizon; Velocity trajectories; Road vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096003165

Such direct impacts on government budgetary allocation have been analyzed in the developed countries and very little research is available considering highly vulnerable and exposed developing countries which are facing huge threats of climate change. The current study is designed to bridge this information gap by examining the effects of climate change adaptation on public expenditures in Pakistan employing provincial level data over the period of 1990–2016. Adaptation expenditures included both overall government expenditures and expenditures on communal amenities and housing. In addition to a fixed effects estimation, we employed long difference model to analyze the impact in the long run. Results indicated that variations in temperature and rainfall were significantly related with public expenditures. Short run and long run scenarios showed that rising temperature caused an increase in public expenditures. The effect of rainfall on total public expenditure was positive and statistically significant while rainfall and expenditure incurred on communal amenities and housing were negatively related in the long run.

Current mapping approaches however may present coarse spatial resolutions, and often fail to consider how UES flows serve resident demand at the appropriate micro-scale. In addition, prohibitive costs involved in collecting primary data to validate UES model parameters to local conditions may enforce the use of proxy methods, thereby inferring ambiguity in parameterisation and uncertainty in mapping outputs. This study examines both issues through the implementation of a high-spatial resolution approach to map multiple urban regulating ecosystem service (temperature regulation, stormwater absorption, and carbon storage) deprivation in Manchester, UK. Poorly performing UES areas are defined as the lowest 10% combined ecosystem service indicator values (‘coldspots’) at 100m grid resolution. Coldspots are compared to population demand levels, disaggregated from weighted population estimates, indicating neighbourhoods deprived of UES. Ambiguity in proxy method implementation is examined using combinations of UES parameter settings (n = 16) within various demand measures (n = 3) to measure changes in relationships between UES, and variation in final map outputs across the study area. Uncertainty is therefore quantified as an interactive process, whereby input parameter ambiguity affects local uncertainty in map outputs, due to varying landcover composition. As explicit sensitivity analysis in current UES mapping studies is limited, the study demonstrates how ambiguity in method parameterisation may impact UES mapping exercises. Complex interactions governing spatial variance in map uncertainty may therefore be addressed through identification of consistent areas of interest (e.g. hotspots, coldspots) by contrasting outputs realised from different parameterisations. As such, the study demonstrates the mapping approach as a transferable city-wide visualisation tool, using accessible data and methods, to investigate regulating UES deprivation at practical scales required to retrofit existing urban infrastructure with green-blue infrastructure investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deprivation; Environmental risk; Mapping; Regulating ecosystem services; Uncertainty analysis; Urban","Digital storage; Image resolution; Investments; Mapping; Parameterization; Sensitivity analysis; Storage as a service (STaaS); Environmental hazards; High spatial resolution; Infrastructure investment; Interactive process; Method implementations; Population estimate; Temperature regulations; Urban infrastructure; Ecosystems; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095574544

In recent times, there is a more proactive approach with the private sector increasingly engaging in activities to promote Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a part of their business strategies. Despite significant strides being made by the private sector in this regard, the strategies that are good for the business, environment, and sustainability are yet to take off at a large-scale. Many private organizations are still facing the challenge of identifying the right target sector and stakeholders for fulfilling their sustainability requirements. However, the greatest strength of the private sector is its ability to innovate. As part of this innovative design, the concept of thematic incubation for corporate sustainability is explored. The products and services developed through these thematic incubators are envisaged to result in the achievement of global development agendas and promotion of sustainability performance for multiple stakeholders including government, academia, private sector, and the community at large. This concept allows a win-win situation with the culmination of long-lasting social and environmental goals along-with achieving profit-with-purpose. The paper identifies the concept of sustainability with respect to the interest of the stakeholders, as well as its alignment with that of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. The paper presents an exploratory case of the thematic incubation for disaster risk reduction, climate change, and sustainable development as a possible approach to corporate sustainability. The paper details the process of thematic incubation along with possible challenges and advantages of the same. In all, thematic incubation has been identified as a lynchpin to ensure the effective utilization of resources and setting in motion a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, use of science, and sustainability at the local level. © 2021 by the authors.","Co-producing knowledge; Disaster risk reduction; Social innovation; Sustainable development; Thematic incubation","climate change; disaster management; knowledge; private sector; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101190800

The economy and emission performance of the diesel engines are influenced by the fuel injection stability of the high pressure common rail system. In this work, a high pressure common rail injector numerical model based on bond graph theory has been proposed. The comparisons between experimental results and numerical simulations show that the numerical model could reasonably predict the injection characteristics of the system. In order to reveal the essential rules and inherent characteristics of the fuel injection stability for high pressure common rail system, the rank variations of the state matrix at different injection pulse widths during fuel injection are obtained by means of a linear analysis. In addition, the distributions of eigenvalues for the state matrix in complex plane are investigated using Lyapunov method. The results show that the rank is influenced mainly by the movements of control valve and needle. Furthermore, the variation rule of the rank is independent of the injection pulse width before the needle is opened. The needle channel orifice of the injector plays a dominant role in transformation of the system from strong damping oscillation to underdamping oscillation. The opening and closing of control valve have significant effect on the stability of the system because its movement breaks the stability, and the movement of needle has remarkable effect on the oscillating characteristics of the system. High pressure common rail system is a complicated time-variant system with unstable pressure relief and strong oscillation injection. © IMechE 2019.","bond graph; Diesel engine; fuel injection stability; high pressure common rail system; state matrix","Diesel engines; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Emission control; Fuel injection; Fuels; Graph theory; Lyapunov methods; Needles; Numerical models; Safety valves; Stability; Bond graph; Energy conservation and emission reductions; High pressure common rail; High pressure common rail system; Inherent characteristics; Injection pulse width; State matrices; State-of-the-art technology; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068061904

Chrysophyte stomatocysts, siliceous resting stages of golden-brown algae, are widely distributed in acidic and oligotrophic environments of peatlands. Presently, little knowledge is available on the composition and distribution of stomatocysts in subtropical peatlands. This study investigated the communities of moss-inhabiting stomatocysts in three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in central China, and their association with environmental variables. Fifty-nine stomatocyst morphotypes with two additional formae were identified according to the International Statospore Working Group guidelines, and stomatocyst assemblages were significantly different among the three peatlands. In addition, these stomatocyst morphotypes were classified into eight morphology-based functional groups according to morphological traits, such as types of collar and ornamentation. Redundancy analyses revealed that stomatocyst assemblages at both morphotype- and functional group-level were significantly correlated with depth to water table, oxidation reduction potential, and morphotype-level composition was further related to electronic conductivity and potassium. Generally, cysts with a complex collar preferred dry hummocks, while large cysts with long spines mainly occurred in wet hollows.

Changing relationships and distribution patterns of sealed and vegetated surfaces as well as building geometry across different scales in urban environments influence surface temperatures. Cities comprise different urban forms, which, depending on their surface characteristics, enhance the heating process, increasing the emergence of urban heat islands (UHIs). Detecting priority areas to introduce multi-beneficial climate change adaptation measures is set to be a key task for the cities long-term strategies to improve climatic conditions across different urban structures and scales. We introduce a simple and fast spatial modelling approach to carry out fine-scale simulations for land surface temperature (LST), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in a 2D environment. Capabilities of our modelling approach are demonstrated in evaluating urban thermal comfort in the alpine city of Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol in western Austria. Results show a major contrast between sealed and vegetated surfaces reflected in the distributional patterns and values of LST, MRT and UTCI, correlating with the appearance and frequency of specific surface classes. We found the Sky View Factor to have a substantial impact on calculations for bioclimatic conditions and see high-albedo surfaces decrease LST but increase the apparent temperature (MRT and UTCI values) effecting human thermal comfort.

Agriculture releases significant emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), but also offers low-cost opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions. This paper assesses agricultural GHG emissions in Aragon, one important and representative region for agriculture in Spain. The Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) approach is used to analyze the abatement potential and cost-efficiency of mitigation measures under several scenarios, with and without taking into account the interaction among measures and their transaction costs. The assessment identifies the environmental and economic outcomes of different combinations of measures, including crop, livestock and forest measures. Some of these measures are win-win, with pollution abatement at negative costs to farmers. Moreover, we develop future mitigation scenarios for agriculture toward the year 2050. Results highlight the trade-offs and synergies between the economic and environmental outcomes of mitigation measures. The biophysical processes underlying mitigation efforts are assessed taking into account the significant effects of interactions between measures. Interactions reduce the abatement potential and worsen the cost-efficiency of measures. The inclusion of transaction costs provides a better ranking of measures and a more accurate estimation of implementation costs. The scenario analysis shows how the combinations of measures could reduce emissions by up to 75% and promote sustainable agriculture in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the ways for Malaysia to reduce its GHG emission is to diversify its energy mix and to include hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) in its energy mix. Since Malaysia does not have any legal framework for HFCs, it is best to see how other countries are doing and how can it be replicated in Malaysia. This paper reviews the HFC legal framework in the United States, Germany and South Korea as these countries are among those that have advanced themselves in this technology. The researchers conducted a library-based research and obtained the related materials from online databases and public domain. Based on the reviews, the researchers find that these countries have a proper legal framework in place for HFC. With these legal frameworks, funds will be available to support research and development, as well as demonstration of HFC. Thus, it is recommended that Malaysia to have a proper HFC legal framework in place in order to support the development of the HFC industry. © 2021 by the authors.

It has been indicated that biochar application could strengthen soil fertility benefits, such as improvement in soil microbial activity, abatement of bulk density, amelioration of nutrient and water-holding capacity and immutability of soil organic matter. Additionally, biochar amendment could also improve nutrient availability such as phosphorus and nitrogen in different types of soil. Most interestingly, the locally available wastes are pyrolyzed to biochar to improve the relationship among plants, soil and the environment. This can also be of higher importance to small-scale farming, and the biochar produced can be utilized in farms for the improvement of crop productivity. Thus, biochar could be a potential amendment to a soil that could help in achieving sustainable agriculture and environment. However, before mainstream formulation and renowned biochar use, several challenges must be taken into consideration, as the beneficial impacts and potential use of biochar seem highly appealing. This review is based on confined knowledge taken from different field-, laboratory-and greenhouse-based studies. It is well known that the properties of biochar vary with feedstock, pyrolysis temperature (300, 350, 400, 500, and 600◦C) and methodology of preparation. It is of high concern to further investigate the negative consequences: hydrophobicity; large scale application in farmland; production cost, primarily energy demand; and environmental threat, as well as affordability of feedstock. Nonetheless, the current literature reflects that biochar could be a significant amendment to the agroecosystem in order to tackle the challenges and threats observed in sustainable agriculture (crop production and soil fertility) and the environment (reducing greenhouse gas emission). © 2021 by the authors.

This inclusive study elaborates the impact of nanofluids on thermo-hydraulic performance of thermal devices in order to ensure the appropriate selection and implementation of nanofluids in various engineering thermal devices. Inclusion of nanofluid as heat transfer fluid in various systems requiring high heat transfer rate e.g. solar thermal conversion systems, HVAC systems, electronic equipment, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors have imparted greater role in reducing negative impacts of climate change. The influence of size, concentration, type and shape of nanoparticles, working temperature, compound passive techniques and magnetic field effect on heat transfer and pressure drop performance of nanofluids are extensively discussed along with the drawbacks of nanofluids such as formation of fouling on heat transfer surfaces.

Many understory species have green young stems that may assimilate CO2 and contribute to whole-plant carbon balance. Cacao commonly grows in the shaded understory and recent emphasis has been placed on diversifying the types of trees used to shade cacao plants to achieve additional ecosystem services. We studied three agricultural cacao cultivars growing in the shade of four timber species (Cedrela odorata L., Cordia thaisiana Agostini, Swietenia macrophylla King and Tabebuia rosea (Bertol) A.D.C.) in an agroforestry system to (i) evaluate the timber species for their effect on the physiological performance of three cacao cultivars; (ii) assess the role of green stems on the carbon economy of cacao; and (iii) examine coordination between stem hydraulic conductivity and stem photosynthesis in cacao. Green young stem photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate was positive and double leaf CO2 assimilation rate, indicating a positive contribution of green stems to the carbon economy of cacao; however, green stem area is smaller than leaf area and its relative contribution is low. Timber species showed a significant effect on leaf gas exchange traits and on stomatal conductance of cacao, and stem water-use efficiency varied among cultivars. There were no significant differences in leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity among cacao cultivars, but sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity varied significantly among cultivars and there was an interactive effect of cacao cultivar × timber species. Hydraulic efficiency was coordinated with stem-stomatal conductance, but not with leaf-stomatal conductance or any measure of photosynthesis. We conclude that different shade regimes determined by timber species and the interaction with cacao cultivar had an important effect on most of the physiological traits and growth variables of three cacao cultivars growing in an agroforestry system. Results suggested that C. odorata is the best timber species to provide partial shade for cacao cultivars in the Barlovento region in Venezuela, regardless of cultivar origin. © The Author(s) 2020.

With a growing fleet of commercial vehicles in the UK, biomethane can provide significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil diesel. Methane is a potent GHG with a global warming potential (GWP) of 23–36, therefore reducing levels in the atmosphere can have a significant impact on climate change. There are a range of anthropogenic sources of methane that could be collected and processed to provide sustainable energy (upcycled), e.g., agricultural waste and the waste water system. This paper explores the impact of using upcycled methane in transport in South East England, evaluating local sources of anthropogenic methane and the environmental and economic impact of its use for a heavy-duty truck compared to fossil and battery electric alternatives. Analysis concludes that the use of upcycled methane in transport can provide significant reductions in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to diesel, fossil natural gas or battery electric trucks, and give net negative GHG emissions where avoided environmental methane emissions are considered. Furthermore, upcycling solutions can offer a lower cost route to GHG reduction compared to electrification. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The global interest in achieving an end-of-waste scenario encourages the recovery of useful products/secondary raw materials from locally available waste materials. Sugarcane bagasse ash is an abundantly available waste (44,200 tonnes day–1) from sugar plants in India which has the potential to be used as a partial replacement to cement in ready-mix concrete plants. Although pozzolanic performance of sugarcane bagasse ash and its ability in reducing the carbon emissions associated with concrete production have been reported in earlier research studies, its use in concrete is hindered due to the lack of availability and accessibility data. In this study, the geographical distribution of sugar plants and the available quantity of sugarcane bagasse ash in India have been determined. In addition, a detailed network analysis using a geographic information system was conducted to quantify the geographic proximity of bagasse ash, fly ash and slag sources to ready-mix concrete plants.

These compounds play important but often compound-specific roles in community and ecosystem processes by affecting herbivore and decomposer activity. However, our understanding of what drives community-level CBSCs among ecosystems or across environmental gradients is limited. We measured concentrations and compositions of CBSCs for all dominant vascular plant and lichen species present across a 500-m alpine elevational gradient. These measurements were combined with data on species composition and abundance to obtain whole-community measures of plant and lichen CBSCs across the gradient. At the whole community level, plant CBSCs had the lowest concentrations while lichen CBSCs had the highest concentrations at the highest elevations. Further, plant CBCSs shifted from those associated with herbivore defence towards those protecting against light and oxidative stress as elevation increased, while lichen CBSCs showed the opposite pattern. Synthesis. Our findings that individual compounds show contrasting responses to the same environmental gradient highlight the importance of studying qualitative as well as quantitative changes in CBSCs. Further, the divergent responses between vascular plants and lichens reveal that in systems where both groups are abundant, they need to be considered simultaneously to better understand how future environmental changes may impact on ecosystem-level processes.

This paper aims to provide a brief commentary on an application of the PRT to pitch an environmental finance research topic with a personal reflection on the pitch exercise discussed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies the PRT developed by Faff (2015, 2019) to a research project on estimating the strength of carbon pricing signals under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Findings: The PRT is found to be a valuable tool to refine broad ideas into impactful and novel research contributions. The PRT is recommended for use by all academics regardless of field and particularly PhD students to structure and communicate their research ideas. The PRT is found to be particularly well suited to pitch replication studies, as it effectively summarizes both the “idea” and proposed “twist” of a replication study. Originality/value: This letter is a reflection on a research teams experience with applying the PRT to pitch a replication study at the 2020 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand event. This event focused on replicable research and was a unique opportunity for research teams to pitch their replication research ideas. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emissions trading scheme; Pitching research; Real options; State space methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097419033

These targets will require a transition of a historically inelastic energy system within a closing window of time. Our paper presents a whole system approach which argues that decentralized and distributed energy resources operating at grid-edge need an agile trial framework with multi-perspective and experienced stakeholders to develop balanced and well-supported network flexibility services. Incubating these new grid-edge network services require innovative market, operators and digital infrastructure, particularly at local scales. Based on preliminary findings from a UK perspective, Project LEO, we propose a framework around the restructuring of local energy systems which reduce uncertainty through an innovative 'ecosystem' that gives room to failure while minimizing risk to extract value and learnings. © 2021 IEEE.","Demand side response (DSR); Distribution network operator (DNO); Energy transition; Flexibility services; Smart local energy system(s) (SLES)","Agile manufacturing systems; Climate change; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Digital infrastructures; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy systems; Local energy systems; Multi-perspective; Network flexibility; System approach; Zero energies; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103450237

This intervention matches the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of affordable clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) and climate action (SDG 13) of the United Nations General Assembly Agenda 2030 (Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Local authorities can align interventions with SDGs according to needs. The purpose of this paper is to consider whether Dundee’s EV strategy represents the most viable and equitable intervention that could be adopted given the city’s context. We adopt a positive review and value argumentation approach to determine the extent to which the strategy satisfies the criteria of “level of urgency”, “systemic impact” and “policy gaps”, which have been employed in the extant literature as the basis for a multi-criteria analysis (MCA). We eclectically review elements of the strategy against the city’s peculiar physical and socio-economic environment, as well as argue their fit against these criteria. We interpret these criteria based on the complementarity and benefits of the strategy from the lenses of SDG 7, SDG 11 and SDG 13. Additionally, we consider the alignment of the EV strategy with the other SDGs. The criteria also allow us to evaluate the strategy based on the localisation principles of equity, acceptability and affordability of the intervention. Our review shows that the EV strategy represents a sustainable and community life-enhancing intervention that aligns with some key SDGs. However, the outcome raises concerns about the equitability of the strategy. Smaller, similar or bigger cities could utilise this approach. However, we recommend the evaluation of local priorities to improve alignment with the SDGs and the provision of clear justifications for selecting an intervention from a range of responses. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to investigate these emissions, a 1-month multi-instrument field campaign was undertaken at an industrial site in Grande-Synthe, Dunkirk (France), in May and June 2012. One of the main objectives of the study was to provide new information on the chemical composition of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the vicinity of metalworking facilities. An aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) was deployed to provide size-resolved chemical mixing state measurements of ambient single particles at high temporal resolution. This mixing state information was then used to apportion PM2.5 to local metalworking facilities influencing the receptor site. Periods when the site was influenced by metalworking sources were characterised by a pronounced increase in particles containing toxic metals (manganese, iron, lead) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a variety of chemical mixing states. The association of specific particle classes with a nearby ferromanganese alloy manufacturing plant was confirmed through comparison with previous analysis of raw materials (ores) and chimney filter particle samples collected at the facility. Particles associated with emissions from a nearby steelworks were also identified. The contribution of local metalworking activities to PM2.5 at the receptor site for the period when the ATOFMS was deployed ranged from 1 to 65% with an average contribution of 17%, while the remaining mass was attributed to other local and regional sources. These findings demonstrate the impact of metalworking facilities on air quality downwind and provide useful single particle signatures for future source apportionment studies in communities impacted by metalworking emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Industrial emissions; Mass spectrometry; Metalworking; Particulate matter; Source apportionment","Air quality; Ferroalloys; Heavy metals; Industrial emissions; Mass spectrometers; Metal working; Mineral oils; Mixing; Particle size analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Aerodynamic diameters; Aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometers; Chemical compositions; High temporal resolution; Manufacturing plant; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Source apportionment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; alloy; ferromanganese alloy; iron; lead; manganese; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; source apportionment; volatile organic compound; aerodynamic diameter; air pollution; air quality; chemical composition; chemical parameters; controlled study; France; industrial emission; iron and steel industry; mass spectrometry; metalworking activity; particle size; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; source apportionment; temporal analysis; time of flight mass spectrometry; aerosol; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; France; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097098180

Supermarkets equipped with a CO2 refrigeration system and a geothermal storage offer a larger heating capacity, compared to traditional solutions. While district heat could benefit from this higher heat recovery availability, supermarkets could generate an income from a capacity that would be otherwise unused. For the first time, this study applies a detailed modelling approach considering both sides of such a synergy. The objective is to assess the techno-economic and environmental impact of a coordinated control strategy. Since the heat recovery from the supermarket consumes additional electricity, power-to-heat is implemented as a solution to reduce the overall CO2 emissions. This is demonstrated by scenarios simulated for a district in Stockholm. Hourly electricity CO2 intensity and prices are implemented as signals to prioritize either the district heating central supply or heat recovery. By boosting the use of electricity when cleaner, a CO2 intensity-driven control show the potential of reducing the carbon footprint of the district (−9.4%). A control based on prices, instead, is more convenient economically both for the district (−1.4% heat cost) and for the supermarket (−32% operational cost). © 2020 The Author(s)","4GDH; CO2 emissions; CO2 refrigeration; Geothermal storage; Heat pumps; Heat recovery; Integrated energy systems; Low temperature district heating; Techno-economic","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; District heating; Emission control; Refrigeration; Retail stores; Waste heat; CO2 emissions; Coordinated control strategy; District heating networks; Heating capacity; Local resources; Refrigeration system; Scenario analysis; Techno-economics; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099660671

The system consists of novel renewable sources: Photovoltaic energy, hydrokinetic turbines and a biomass gasifier, which increases the reliability of the system and reduces CO2 emissions. In addition, a proton exchange fuel cell and a super capacitor thatsupply the necessary power for the tramway, as well as, a hydrogen tank that stores the excess energy. Energy management is done through renewable sources that recharge the super capacitor and the fuel cell at the charging stations along the tramway route.

As a response to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change call for National Adaptation Plans, Peru has developed a national and decentralized regional adaptation plans. The purpose of this article is to understand the role and priority status of health within the adaptation planning and process. Peru was used as a case study to analyse the policy process in the creation of adaptation plans, encompassing the need to address climate change impacts on health with a particular focus on marginalized people. An actor, content and context policy analyses were conducted to analyse 17 out of 25 regional adaptation plans, which are available. The national adaptation plans (2002, 2015) do not include health as a priority or health adaptation strategies. In a decentralized health care system, regional plans demonstrate an increased improvement of complexity, systematization and structure over time (2009-17). In general, health has not been identified as a priority but as another area of impact. There is no cohesiveness between plans in format, content, planning and execution and only a limited consideration for marginalized populations. In conclusion, the regional departments of Peru stand on unequal footing regarding adapting the health sector to climate change. Findings in the strategies call into question how mitigation and adaption to climate change may be achieved. The lack of local research on health impacts due to climate change and a particular focus on marginalized people creates a policy vacuum. The Peruvian case study resembles global challenges to put health in the centre of national and regional adaptation plans. In-depth cross-country analysis is still missing but urgently needed to learn from other experiences. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

In this study, trends of top height growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) were analysed using permanent sample plot data from more than 300 long-term experimental sites distributed from temperate zones to the boreal forest conditions in Sweden. By regression analyses, the effects of temperature-sum and precipitation-sum on top height growth were assessed in the period 1986–2018. A significant upward temporal trend in height growth was observed for both species, with the trend more pronounced after the millennium shift. The magnitude of the annual relative height growth after the millennium was about 16.92% and 9.54% higher than expected, respectively for Scots pine and Norway spruce. A potential climate response on height growth was found for both species with temperature-sum positively correlated with top height growth. No significant effect of precipitation-sum on height growth was observed for either species. Our results suggest improved growing conditions and forest sites became more productive in response to increasing temperature in the northern temperate and boreal regions. The increasing growth trends may offer shorter rotation periods and increased forest value for Norway spruce and Scots pine, coupled with contributions of boreal forests to the emerging bio-economy and the regulation of global atmospheric carbon. © 2020 The Author(s)","Boreal forest; Growth-climate relationships; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Rotation period; Site productivity","Plants (botany); Regression analysis; Temperature; Atmospheric carbon; Ecosystem process; Effects of temperature; Environmental conditions; Growing conditions; Increasing temperatures; Permanent sample plots; Picea Abies (L.)

Molecule 1 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis. Their quantum yields in acetonitrile solutions are generally suitable (Φ = 0.30 for 1, Φ = 0.06 for 2 and Φ = 0.08 for 3) and they display fluorescence turn-on sensitivity towards chromium(III). The selectivity features of fluorophores 2 and 3 for Cr(III) are remarkable. The blue-shift of emission bands coupled with the emission turn-on after introduction of Cr(III) confirms that the ESIPT capability of the fluorophores contributes to the low emission properties of the molecules and that emission turn-on during fluorescence detection succeeds by elimination of the ESIPT possibility. Therefore, it could be concluded that the ESIPT feature is a vital tool to utilize for fluorescent sensor designs. Job plot analysis indicates a 2 : 1 stoichiometry of metal : sensor. Results of interference studies also favours potential application of the ESIPT dye 3 for detection of chromium(III).

This study addressed this gap by identifying the coping practices for short-term climate variations and the adaptation measures used by smallholder farmers to address future climate change in northeast Ghana. The paper used a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Data were collected from 555 households located in six communities across three districts in northeast Ghana. Results indicated that smallholder farmers were employing a host of practices to address the threats posed by climate change. Key adaptation practices included the planting of drought-tolerant crop varieties, the use of indigenous knowledge, intensification of irrigation, migration, adjusting the planting calendar, crop diversification, mixed farming, and sustainable land management practices. On the contrary, short-term coping practices reported by the study participants included the sale of non-farm assets, complementing agriculture with non-farm jobs, selling livestock, engaging in wage labor, charcoal burning and reliance on social networks. The results further revealed that barriers to climate change adaptation and coping practices differed by gender. The paper recommends that capacities of smallholder farmers in vulnerability hotspots should be enhanced to address immediate climate variations, as well as future climate changes. Ghana’s climate change and agricultural policies should prioritize adaptations by smallholder farmers in addressing threats posed by climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

The climate finance phenomenon has also generated significant discursive focus on matters of regulation. Yet despite this salience, there has been little critical examination of regulatory material-discursive practices surrounding energy infrastructure and its financing. In responding to this gap, the paper utilizes an important Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective, postcolonial science studies, to unpack opaque material-discursive practices surrounding renewable energy and climate finance regulation in Fiji. Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic data, the paper argues that knowledge, relational and material practices surrounding renewable energy regulation and climate finance are opaquely shaping potentially unequal futures in Fiji. The paper highlights material effects of such regulatory practice in Fiji including the sourcing of labour, expertise and agency externally; poor compliance by international financial institutions exhibiting with regulation aimed at supporting local economies and energy transitions; and conditions of under electrification in rural communities. Beneath dominant regulatory discourses and practices, however, are also important contestations for certain socio-technical futures emerging in Fiji. The application of critical perspectives to renewable energy and climate finance regulatory practices is vital in making these lived material consequences, and emerging, contested futures in Fiji visible, to allow for their clearer, and more equitable navigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate finance; Fiji; Postcolonial; Renewable energy; Science and technology studies (STS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096828173

In this study, a range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to 2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created. Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation cost using an optimized location–allocation model. Simulation results suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014%. This can also reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these eight cultivars only make up 19.76% of the total rice production in South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014% of total revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated to increase the efficiency of the model performance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climatesensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective of this study is to critically assess geothermal energy prospects in terms of number of proven geothermal reservoirs, thermal energy capacities, and potential areas of utilization across thirteen Middle East countries (MECs). The findings from this study show that most oil-rich MECs have not adequately explored/exploited their geothermal resources as evidenced by lack of research and exploration activities. It was found that the current geothermal reservoirs/resources across all the MECs are mostly medium (100–150 °C) and low (&lt; 100 °C) enthalpy reservoirs, except Turkey, Iran, and Yemen which have exhibited some high (&gt;150 °C) enthalpy geothermal fields. For low/depleted oil and gas reserves countries, full exploitation of geothermal energy is deemed as one of the options to meet their energy demands. In order to fully optimize the geothermal energy productions, it is imperative for these countries to employ advanced geothermal energy production technologies (GEPTs). MECs could learn the experiences of Europe and US to develop their own GEPTs including national and regional strategies and policy frameworks to help fully harness these valuable geothermal resources. These targets are possible through research, trainings, and international collaborations. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Geothermal energy; Middle-East countries; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; enthalpy; exploitation; geothermal energy; power generation; sustainable development; Europe; Iran; Turkey; United States; Yemen; Meleagris gallopavo",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100576663

Dependence on fossil fuels for seawa-ter desalination results in a high carbon footprint for municipal water production and treatment. Yet, quantification of how much energy is used is lacking. This paper aims to quantify the electricity consumption in the municipal water sector in Bahrain and investigate how water conserva-tion contributes to electricity saving and climate change mitigation. Results revealed that around 8% of total electricity consumption in Bahrain is water-related, of which 89% is consumed in water desalination. A comparison of electricity-use performance indicators with existing global prac-tices revealed the potential for energy efficiency improvements. Future scenarios demonstrate an increase of 27% in water demand in 2040 compared to 2019. Reducing the water demand can result in cumulative savings of 6,200 GWh of electricity, 1,800 million normal m3 of natural gas, and 4,300 Gg of CO2 e emissions. Electricity demand should be considered in informing technology choices when planning new desalination and wastewater treatment plants. For existing plants, mandatory adoption of an energy system and raising awareness on the water-energy nexus are critical. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

This work aims at investigating their stratigraphic associations at Dohuk area of NE Iraq. Both Formations are well exposed in three sections examined from Dohuk area including Spindar (Gara Mt.), Birkyat (Khair Mt.) for Khurmala Formation, and Barbuhar (Bekhair Mt.) for Sinjar Formation. The thickness of the Khurmala Formation varies from 90.7 m at Spindar and 81 m at Birkyat. The thickness of the Sinjar Formation is 36.5 m at Barbuhar section. The focus of this study is to determine the carbonate microfacies in order to construct their sedimentary facies model and to interpret the depositional environment. Lithologically, Khurmala Formation in Spindar and Birkyat sections is closely similar and consisting of buff to gray, medium to thick, well-bedded microbialites dolostone, alternating with thin beds of soft shale and marlstone interlayer. The Barbuhar section consists mainly of three reefal limestone horizons alternating with siliciclastic interlayers. Four intensively dolomitized microfacies were recorded from Khurmala Formaton sections. These are dolo-mudstone, microbial dolo-mudstone, foraminiferal algal dolo-packstone, and foraminiferal dolo-wackestone, whereas Sinjar Formation shows eight carbonate microfacies, which are coraline framestone, bioclastic coralgal rudstone, coralgal foraminiferal bioclastic packstone, foraminifera bioclastic algal packstone, bioclastic forminiferal packstone, dolomitic microbial bindstone, dolomitic microbial laminite, and bioclastic sandy limestone. Field observations, along with microscopic investigations, have resulted in identifying facies types of the two formations. The Khurmala Formation in Spindar and Birkyat seems to be deposited in a shallow shelf setting of supratidal, intertidal, and semi-restricted lagoonal facies with siliciclastic-dominated coastal plain. The section of Barbuhar represents the Sinjar Formation which is deposited at further seaward position of the shelf as a patch reef limestone which is intermixed with the Kolosh Formation sandstone in a further deeper position. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Facies; Iraq; Khurmala; Microfacies; Sinjar","carbonate; coastal plain; depositional environment; Eocene; facies; limestone; microbialite; microfacies; mudstone; Iraq; Kurdistan [Iraq]; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099847117

Two series of concrete mixes were prepared with two different resistance classes. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) and self-compacting high-performance concrete (SCHPC) were evaluated on the basis of mechanical resistance at different times, capillary water absorption, permeability to oxygen, water-accessible porosity, chloride migration, accelerated carbonation and ammonium nitrate leaching. The results of the tests showed that the incorporation of GP and GS improves the mechanical strength of concretes and reduces capillary water absorption, chloride ion diffusion, gas permeability and leaching kinetics compared to LF. However, the GP does not appear to improve the strength of concrete to carbonation, unlike the GS, which has not carbonated. The study also highlighted the enhanced effect of the combination of silica fume (SF), and in particular with the LF and the GP, for their best resistance with the action of carbon dioxide. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accelerated carbonation; Capillary water absorption; Chloride migration; Glass powder; Granulated slag; Leaching; Permeability to gas","Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chlorine compounds; Concrete additives; Durability; Gas permeability; Glass; Glass bottles; Glass industry; High performance concrete; Leaching; Lime; Silica fume; Slags; Steelmaking; Water absorption; Accelerated carbonation; Capillary water absorption; Chloride ion diffusions; Chloride migrations; Leaching kinetics; Mechanical resistance; Self-compacting high-performance concretes; Strength of concrete; Self compacting concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098982061

Existing research insists that multiple external pressures push organizations to navigate towards sustainable internal practices leading to low carbon performance. Rooted in the theoretical concepts of institutional and contingency theory, this study explores the impact of uncertainties of external business environment on complexities of business internal environment. Hypothesis developed is tested by taking data from 134 manufacturing organizations based on their size and sector, and sustainability practices. The data is analyzed using correlation and multiple linear regression analysis (MLR). Chi-square, Cramer's V and MLR is used for regression analysis and correlation whereas ANN is applied for validating the robustness of the MLR model. Comparison of results of MLR and ANN provide similar outcomes. Results rule out the impact of size of organizations on carbon performance. ‘Environmental regulations activities’ and ‘political and legal regulations’ along with efficient implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)/Sustainability activities backed by top management are the main contributors of low carbon performance. The study identified the ‘interest of foreign investors’ in the region as one of areas requiring further exploration for improved carbon performance. Mode of technology came as major roadblock for low carbon performance and requires top management to ponder over for improved results.

This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%–58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution.

In this work, the performance of Mo2C/TiO2 blends in the continuous photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol is evaluated in a micro-optofluidic reactor illuminated with UV and visible LED lights (5 mW cm-2). The photo-responsive Mo2C/TiO2 surfaces applied are manufactured by airbrushing a photocatalytic ink containing different weight percent (2-10%) of Mo2C nanoparticles (synthesized by a carbothermal method) and TiO2 (P25) onto porous carbon paper. Doping TiO2 with Mo2C makes the composite material active in the visible region compared with bare TiO2, while it does not bring performance enhancement when the photoactive surfaces are illuminated with UV light. A 4% Mo2C weight percent led to enhanced stable production of methanol under visible light (r = 11.8 μmol g-1 h-1, AQY = 0.21%, SCH3OH/HCOOH = 12.1), which is ascribed to the presence of Mo2C, able to extend the spectral response as well as reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes occurring in TiO2.

While there is a wealth of guidance on scenario-based climate adaptation planning, this guidance typically assumes the selection and use of decadal to century-long time segments of downscaled climate model projections, rather than the creation of a customized scenario depicting a specific extreme event. We address this gap by synthesizing a variety of data sources and analytical techniques for constructing climate scenarios for stress tests that are customized to address specific end-users’ needs. We then illustrate the development and application of climate scenarios with a case study that explores water sustainability under changing climate in the Truckee and Carson River basins of California and Nevada. Finally, we assess the potential advantages and disadvantages of the different data sources and analytical techniques described to provide guidance on which are best suited for an intended application based on the system of study, the stakeholders involved, and the resources available.

In this study, the sustainability analysis of the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incineration plant in Baltimore city was performed to determine its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The city’s major waste-to-energy generation plant has benefitted the city of Baltimore since inception till date in terms of waste processing, resulting in electricity and steam production for more than 40,000 homes and over 200 businesses. The life cycle impact of the incineration plant was analyzed using the Simapro life cycle assessment (LCA) software with the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) database for correlation. The results obtained upon analysis show larger values of Global Warming Potential and eutrophication potential as 6.46 × 108 Gg of CO2 equivalence and 2.27 × 106 Gg N equivalence, respectively. These values resulted from the higher amount of fossil CO2 and NOx emitted from the plant. The acidification potential of 1.66 × 1017 H+ mmole eq resulted from the SO2 emitted by the incineration plant. The incineration plant exceeded the limitations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on NOx (150 ppm), which is detrimental to the well-being of people as shown by this study. Installing an improved processing technology such as a Selected Catalytic Reactor (SCR) can drastically reduce the NOx emission to 45 ppm.

By comparing CuO reactivity to iron (α-Fe2O3) and cobalt (Co3O4) oxides using a continuous flow through system and complementary thermogravimetric analysis, we reveal a link between the solid-state reduction mechanism of CLC oxygen carriers and their size-dependent reactivity toward methane. Reactivity of CuO and Co3O4 is independent of the particle size, with reduction following the nucleation and nuclei growth (NNG) model, whereas α-Fe2O3 shows increased reactivity with decreasing particle size and reduction follows the unreacted shrinking core (USC) model. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing relative energies of formation for surface and bulk oxygen defects, we propose a conceptual framework for the size-dependence of metal oxide oxygen carriers for CLC. For oxygen carriers that reduce via the NNG model, where reduction initiates within the particle core, there will be no size dependence. For reduction via the USC model, where reduction initiates on the particle surface, reactivity will increase for smaller particles. These findings can guide development of metal oxide oxygen carriers for CLC by establishing trends in size-dependent behavior. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Auger electron spectroscopy (AES); chemical looping combustion (CLC); density functional theory (DFT); metal oxide oxygen carriers; nucleation and nuclei growth model; thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); unreacted shrinking core model; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)","Combustion; Copper oxides; Density functional theory; Hematite; Metals; Methane; Oxygen; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Reduction; Thermogravimetric analysis; Chemical-looping combustion; Combustion pro-cess; Conceptual frameworks; Particle surface; Relative energies; Size dependent behaviors; Size-dependent reactivity; Solid state reduction; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100276506

Reforested hectares could be used for intercropping oilseed crops such as carinata (Brassica carinata) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). The oil obtained from these crops could be used for bio-jet fuel production to reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation sector. This study determines the profitability for three scenarios: loblolly pine with no intercropping (baseline), loblolly pine with carinata (once every three years), and loblolly pine with carinata and white lupin rotated annually. We ascertained the land expectation value (LEV) for three site indices of 15.3 m, 18.3 m, and 21.3 m. Carinata and white lupin were planted during the initial eight, seven, and six years for site indices 15.3 m, 18.3 m, and 21.3 m, respectively. Sensitivity and risk analyses were undertaken for determining the influence of input variables on LEVs and the probability of loss for intercropping production systems relative to a baseline production system, respectively. For site index 21.3 m, the LEV of loblolly pine with no intercropping was $2816/ha at a 21-years rotation period. Intercropping with carinata only and both carinata and white lupin yielded LEVs of $3346/ha and $3607/ha at a 21-years rotation period, respectively. The LEVs of production systems were sensitive to interest rate, price, and yield of carinata seeds. The intercropping approach had > 50% probability of being less profitable than loblolly pine alone in over half of the scenarios considered. Future research should focus on the impacts of intercropping on loblolly pine yield and adoption behavior of forest landowners. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Aviation sector; Climate change; Forest management; Sustainability","agricultural economics; biofuel; canola; carbon footprint; coniferous tree; crop production; crop yield; intercropping; profitability; United States; Brassica carinata; Lupinus albus; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098953337

Climatic variables include precipitation, temperature, dry/wet spell lengths, hot/cold spell lengths, wet/dry spell ratio along with climatic oscillations, and satellite-based vegetation index for the months of January to April (Rabi season). During Rabi season, temperature increase rate was 0.14 °C decade−1, whereas precipitation trends were spatially inhomogeneous and varied between – 2.7 mm decade−1 and + 5.4 mm decade−1. The precipitation, temperature, cold spell length, smoothed NDVI (ND), and standard deviation of ND (SDND) displayed significant correlations (0.31–0.96) with wheat yield at varying time scales. The inter-annual wheat yield variability displayed a gain of 415.7 kg ha−1 under present climatic conditions for all CCAs.

In recent years, ICT penetration has considerably increased in the ASEAN-6 countries and the leaders of ASEAN are willing to bring a digital revolution by increasing ICT infrastructure and reducing trade barriers in the region under the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity-2025. Hence, this paper explores the effect of ICT and the recently developed trade globalization index on CO2 emissions in ASEAN-6 countries. The study relies on advanced panel econometric approaches, including Westerlund (2007, 2008) and Pedroni cointegration tests, CUP-FM long-run method, and panel DH causality approach. The results suggest cointegration among variables. The results of CUP-FM indicate that ICT contributes to improving environmental quality by mitigating CO2 emissions. Similarly, trade globalization is also sustainable in the region as it reduces emissions. The results are also confirmed by using the CUP-BC estimator. The findings from the DH causality test unfold causality from ICT and trade globalization index to CO2 emissions. Besides, the long-run estimates reveal the detrimental effect of energy consumption on emissions and the U-shaped association between GDP and emissions.

Switching from one redox state of PLY to another leads to a slight structural change owing to its low energy of disproportionation making the electron addition or removal process facile. To date, mono-reduced PLY based radicals have been extensively studied. However, the reactivity and application of doubly reduced PLY species have not been explored so far. In this work, we report the synthesis of the doubly reduced PLY species (14π e−) and its application towards the development of redox catalysisviaswitching with the mono-reduced form (13π e−) for aryl halide activation and functionalization under transition metal free conditions without any external stimuli such as heat, light or cathodic current supply. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Metal halides; Molecular orbitals; Transition metals; Cathodic currents; Closed-shell anion; Disproportionations; External stimulus; Functionalizations; ITS applications; Metal-free conditions; Redox catalysts; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102087336

These include the climate emergency, COVID-19 and the threat of widespread hunger, and the accelerating loss of biodiversity. All of these threats point to an urgent need to restore and sustainably manage land and forests. Studies are pointing to the critical role of tenure reform, and in particular strengthening collective forest tenure, as an effective means to reduce deforestation, mitigate climate change, restore ecosystem services and maintain biodiversity. Since the 1970s, countries worldwide have attempted to better recognize the customary rights of local communities. Yet despite over 40 years of effort, collective forest tenure reforms have yielded only moderate results. This article draws on recent assessments conducted in 23 countries by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on community-based forestry and associated forest tenure regimes based on the internationally endorsed Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (the VGGT). The findings suggest that governments are increasingly giving legal recognition to community rights to use both timber and non-timber forest products for commercial purposes. Yet, the tenure provided to collective forestry is less robust than that held by companies and smallholders in a number of ways. These include fewer legal protections, more barriers to the use of these rights, inadequate access to justice, and less administrative support in documenting rights. Furthermore, in many cases the existing community forestry legal provisions are not implemented. The relatively successful cases suggest that with robust tenure, communities and smallholders can be potent vehicles for moving towards sustainable forest management and mitigating climate change, improving local livelihoods, contributing to timber and non-timber product economies, and achieving several of the Sustainable Development Goals. But for this, governments will need to strengthen community and local rights within their legal frameworks and mainstream implementation in government policies and practices. Non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, donors, research institutions and academia can provide important support through policy implementation, research, and ensuring inclusive policy formulation processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Collective forests; Community forestry; Legal reform; Policy; Tenure rights; VGGT",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097539258

Among these challenges are the reduced availability and quality of drinking water, and greenhouse gases that give rise to change in climate by entrapping heat, which result in respirational illness from smog and air pollution. Globally, the rate of demand for the use of freshwater has outgrown the rate of population increase; as the rapid growth in town and cities place a huge pressure on neighbouring water resources. Besides, the rapid growth in anthropogenic activities, such as the generation of energy and its conveyance, release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, warming the planet. Polymer nanocomposite has played a significant role in finding solutions to current environmental problems. It has found interest due to its high potential for the reduction of gas emission, and elimination of pollutants, heavy metals, dyes, and oil in wastewater. The revolution of integrating developed novel nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, nanofibers and activated carbon, in polymers, have instigated revitalizing and favourable inventive nanotechnologies for the treatment of wastewater and gas separation. This review discusses the effective employment of polymer nanocomposites for environmental utilizations. Polymer nanocomposite membranes for wastewater treatment and gas separation were reviewed together with their mechanisms. The use of polymer nanocomposites as an adsorbent for toxic metals ions removal and an adsorbent for dye removal were also discussed, together with the mechanism of the adsorption process.

Therefore, stand-alone studies are reviewed to provide information on air pollutant levels, sources, spatial and seasonal variation across the continent. Air quality studies are limited in Africa. Available data show that vehicular traffics, industries, wildfire and biomass burning are significant sources of PM, CO, NO2, SO2 and VOCs in the continent. Sahara Desert is an important source of PM in the region especially during harmattan periods. The air levels of pollutants exhibit seasonality and is inversely impacted by increased precipitation rate and wind speed. Exceedances of WHO AQG are common in both season. The reported annual and 24-h mean concentrations of ambient PM are respectively lower than the relevant WHO AQG in only 10 and 13% for PM2.5, and 0% and 12% for PM10. Only a third of the towns have ambient CO concentrations below the 24-h WHO (7 mg/m³) AQG. Benzene levels at nearly all (96%) sites are a factor 2–920 times larger than 0.17 μg/m³ associated with an excess lifetime risk 1/1000 000. The mean concentrations of indoor PM, CO, NO2 and SO2 exceed the relevant WHO AQG and much more in firewood-fueled poorly-ventilated kitchens in the rural areas, implying a potentially high exposure to women and children in Africa. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Africa; Ambient; Indoor air; NO2; O3; Pollution PM; SO2; VOCs",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096824048

Closing the achievement gap for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) involves prioritization and coordination across multiple sectors. With an application to the country of Saint Lucia, this paper develops a stakeholder-driven analysis framework integrating four interdependent infrastructure sectors (electricity, water, wastewater, and solid waste). Drawing on extensive consultation with decision-makers in-country—134 stakeholders from 18 government ministries, agencies, academia, or the private sector—the analysis identifies specific interventions that could be implemented over the next decades to meet future needs for sustainable infrastructure services. These interventions are congruent with the government's development plans. Long-term, cross-sectoral portfolios of investments and policies (“strategies”) are developed which demonstrably reach the targets of the SDGs and Saint Lucia's emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. The sequencing of these investments or policies is designed to optimize their efficiency and impact over time, identifying “quick wins” while ensuring that there is sufficient action to provide services in the long-term sustainably. A comparison of costs associated with each strategy suggests that accounting for interdependencies and taking a long-term perspective can save costs over the life of infrastructure investments. This process of infrastructure assessment is applicable beyond the small island context, allowing practitioners a means to undertake systematic assessment of a country's future infrastructure needs and to develop appropriate solutions aligned with its national objectives and international commitments. © 2021.

However, low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India with exponential ageing populations have inadequate UGS. This qualitative study examined the relationships between UGS and healthy ageing in two megacities in In-dia. Participants were recruited using snowball sampling in New Delhi and Chennai and semi-structured interviews were conducted with consenting participants (N = 60, female = 51%; age > 60 years; fluent in English, Hindi, or Tamil). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analysed using inductive and thematic analysis. Benefits of UGS included community building and social capital, improved health and social resilience, physical activity promotion, reduced exposure to noise, air pollution, and heat. Poorly maintained UGS and lack of safe, age-friendly pedestrian infrastructure were identified as barriers to health promotion in later life. Neighbourhood disorder and crime constrained older adults’ use of UGS in low-income neighbourhoods. This study under-scores the role of UGS in the design of age-friendly communities in India. The findings highlight the benefits of UGS for older adults, particularly those living in socially disadvantaged or under-served communities, which often have least access to high-quality parks and green areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Current building codes and standards focus on minimum performance criteria for individual buildings exposed to severe hazard events to ensure occupant safety. However, they do not consider the resilience of buildings and building portfolios, which are key factors in determining whether a community can respond to and recover from a severe natural hazard event. Light-frame wood residential buildings dominate the residential market in the US, represent a significant percentage of the investment in the built environment, and are especially vulnerable to hurricane winds and storm surge in coastal areas. Our study of the impact of various hurricane and climate change scenarios on the performance of coastal residential communities reveals that decision-making at the community level is needed to develop rational engineering and urban planning policies, to mitigate the impact of hurricane wind and storm surge, and to adapt to climate change. The results suggest that fundamental changes in the current building regulatory process may be necessary. © Copyright © 2021 Adhikari, Abdelhafez, Dong, Guo, Mahmoud and Ellingwood.","expected loss; fragility; residential buildings; resilience; storm surge; tropical cyclones",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102316276

It is, therefore, essential to understanding the various strategies used by farmers to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and the factors that influence maize farmers' adoption and intensity of climate change adaptation strategies among smallholder maize farmers in South-west Nigeria. In all, a sample of three hundred and thirty (311) smallholder maize farmers were interviewed. A double-hurdle count data model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies while accounting for selection bias with the plugging of inverse mill ratio (IMR) as a regressor. Significant variables such as household size, depreciation ratio, frequency of extension visits, access to extension, and non-farm income were factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among maize farmers. Age of the respondent, age square, household size, farm-based organization (FBO), non-farm income, climate information, access to credit, farmers residing in Osun State (location_Osun), distance to market significantly influenced the intensity of climate change adaptation strategies. This study, therefore, concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers’ membership in FBO, increase the visits of extension agents, encourage non-farm income and access to climate change information, particularly during the off-cropping season. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting improved extension service, providing on-farm demonstration training, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in Nigeria. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Coping strategy; Double-hurdle count model; Socio-ecological system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101045602

The outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic and consequent global economic shutdown, for the first time, provided a base for the real-time experiment of the effect of reduced emissions across the globe in abetting the air pollution issue. The present study dealt with the changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), a marker of air pollution, because of global economic shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The study considered the countries in south and south-east Asia (SSEA), Europe and the USA for their extended period of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropospheric column density of NO2 and SO2 from Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) sensors, including meteorological data such as wind speed (WS) and relative humidity (RH) were analyzed during the pre-lockdown (2017–2019) and lockdown periods (2020). The average AOD, NO2 and SO2 during the lockdown period were statistically compared with their pre-lockdown average using Wilcoxon-signed-paired-rank test. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived AOD, including the changing pattern of AOD due to lockdown was estimated using AERONET data. The weekly anomaly of AOD, NO2 and SO2 was used for analyzing the space-time variation of aerosol load as restrictions were imposed by the concerned countries at the different points of time. Additionally, a random forest-based regression (RF) model was used to examine the effects of meteorological and emission parameters on the spatial variation of AOD. A significant reduction of AOD (−20%) was obtained for majority of the areas in SSEA, Europe and USA during the lockdown period. Yet, the clusters of increased AOD (30–60%) was obtained in the south-east part of SSEA, the western part of Europe and US regions. NO2 reductions were measured up to 20–40%, while SO2 emission increased up to 30% for a majority of areas in these regions. A notable space-time variation was observed in weekly anomaly. We found the evidence of the formation of new particles for causing high AOD under high RH and low WS, aided by the downward vertical wind flow. The RF model showed a distinguishable relative importance of emission and meteorological factors among these regions to account for the spatial variability of AOD. Our findings suggest that the continued lockdown might provide a temporary solution to air pollution; however, to combat persistent air quality issues, it needs switching over to the cleaner mode of production and energy. The findings of this study, thus, advocated for alternative energy policy at the global scale. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","AOD; COVID-19; MODIS; NO2; OMI; SO2","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; AERONET; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; MODIS; observational method; optical depth; relative humidity; satellite data; spatial variation; virus; wind velocity; aerosol; air pollution; Article; communicable disease control; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; density; economic evaluation; Europe; exhaust gas; humidity; meteorological phenomena; optical depth; pandemic; priority journal; random forest; Southeast Asia; time; troposphere; United States; wind speed; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; Thailand; Europe; Southeast Asia; United States; Coronavirus; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia, Southeastern; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097425636

We apply our integrated framework to understand the technological implications, particularly greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, of future energy policies surrounding the practice of hydraulic fracturing in Texas, and the implications of potential adaptive responses to climate change.

Countries are setting rules and targets to govern this issue and electrification of transportation is spreading. One of the motivations for people use electric vehicles may be the availability of rapid charging stations which function similarly to the conventional fuel stations (forecourts). The UK's first solar EV charging forecourt is being built and commissioned with a 5 MWh on-site battery to store energy from a solar farm and to enable arbitrage for grid services. To enable optimum site operation, predicting the arrival of electric vehicles at different times of the day and hence the load demand, determines the availability of the battery for bulk power supply or fast-frequency response to the grid. This paper presents the outline of a stochastic model for the electric vehicle arrival and charging at the site using the concept of vehicle population-types. The model considers the stochastic nature of different parameters controlling the charging process e.g. the charging start time and the state of charge (SoC) at start of the charging session. © 2021 IEEE.","Electric forecourt; Electric vehicle; EV charging infrastructure; EV charging station; Stochastic model","Battery management systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Frequency response; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Charging process; Combustion pro-cess; Conventional fuel; Electric vehicle charging; Energy generations; Site operations; Stochastic nature; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103447240

Changes in wind speeds at regional and global levels are signals of global warming. A concern about climate change has been a major driving force for the speedy expansion experienced in wind energy projects. Yearly investigation of wind speed disguises seasonal variation in predictive planning. At times, these changes fluctuate across seasons in some zones. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) gave a proponent for long-term changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. In effect, observed changes such as poleward shifts and reinforcement of westerly winds will likely be promoted. Projected changes to annual wind speed display altitudinal variability compared to seasonal and annual mean wind speed. An evaluation of wind changes at specific locations is therefore necessary for site-specific application. This paper presents experience at Ikogosi warm spring site with varying return periods, analysedfor identificationof the behaviour of its wind using several statisticsprobability distribution.

These plans are accompanied in driving down the cost of biomass distributed generation units (BDGs). This paper proposes an optimal allocation procedure of BDGs to enhance the performance of the distribution systems and to reduce the related environmental emissions. The proposed procedure aims to maximize the power utilities' benefits in terms of power loss reduction, energy sales excess, and pollutant emission reduction. It also takes into consideration the minimization of the annual operational and maintenance costs of the BDGs. The load growth with several loading levels over the BDGs planning period is presented. For achieving this target, an adaptive equilibrium optimizer (EO) technique is developed which is characterized by simple structure and dynamic control parameters. The proposed procedure is applied to IEEE 33-bus and practical large-scale 141-bus system of AES-Venezuela in the metropolitan area of Caracas. The simulation results declare the effectiveness and capability of the employed EO technique in achieving great benefits in terms of energy sales and environmental emissions with a high improvement of the voltage profile and minimizing power losses.

Supplying sufficient electrical energy, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is one of the major concerns of policymakers and scientists all over the world. In Saudi Arabia, local authorities are increasingly aware of the necessity of reducing the environmental impact of nonrenewable energy by exploring alternative sustainable energy sources and improving buildings’ energy efficiency. Recently, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology has been regarded as a promising technology for generating instantaneous sustainable energy for buildings. To achieve a substantial contribution regarding zero energy buildings, solar energy should be widely used in residential buildings within the urban context. This paper examines how to achieve an appropriate model for integrating photovoltaics on the rooftop of residential buildings in Hail city to provide alternative energy sources. The estimated rooftop areas in Hail city, utilizable for PV application were calculated. Using PV*SOL simulation software, the performance ratio and the system efficiency, as well as the annual energy output in several tilt angles, were determined and presented. The amount of energy expected when using all effective roof area in the city was also calculated. The amount of CO2 emissions that could be reduced as a result of using a PV system was estimated. The results show a significant area of rooftop suitable for PV system in residential buildings in Hail city, which exceeds 9 million square meters. On the other hand, the performance ratio and the system efficiency are affected by the tilt angle of the PV module, where the efficiency increases with higher tilt angle, this is due to the PV module temperature, where, with the decrease in the PV module temperature its efficiency increases. The results indicate that the 30◦ tilt PV produced the highest amount of energy, whereas the 75◦ tilt PV records the smallest one although it achieves the best possible efficiency. There is a significant amount of energy produced from the use of all residential rooftops in Hail, and there is also a significant reduction in the amount of CO2 emissions. It is expected that this research would develop innovative building design strategies and specifications allowing for better climate and energy efficiency as well. © 2021 by the authors.

Continuous degradation results from reduced Nile water flow, poor management of groundwater extraction, and human activities throughout the Nile’s course and drainage channels. Contamination of this water with heavy metals and dissolved organic solids reduces the quality of this water, which increases the price of treatment. River Bank Filtration (RBF) is a water treatment technology used for improving the quality of drinking water taken from polluted rivers where abstraction wells are installed on the banks. This study was applied to the RBF site at Embaba, Nile Delta, Egypt using the numerical code MT3D. The study was simulated and calibrated for the current situation and number of scenarios to investigate the effect of climatic changes on RBF sustainability. Four scenarios were simulated to identify and estimate the RBF portion and the total water travel time from the river to the wells. The first scenario involves a reduction in river stages, the second a decrease in aquifer recharge, the third a combination of the first two scenarios, and the fourth scenario combines scenarios 1, 2, and 3. The results indicate that the RBF portion decreased from 67.42% in the base case to 35.46% and 64.99% with a reduction in river stage by 75% from the base case and a decrease in aquifer recharge from 182.50 (base case) to 50 mm per year, respectively. Moreover, the RBF portion increased to reach 87.75% with a reduction in the General Head Boundary of 75% from the base case, while the combination of the three scenarios decreased the RBF portion to 67.24%. Finally, the water supply systems in arid and semi-arid regions should be extended by installing and operating RBF facilities to manage the negative effects of climatic change through reduction in river stages and aquifer recharge, and increasing abstraction due to overpopulation. © 2021 by the authors.

Although the life cycle environmental performance of resource recovery systems has been widely studied, the impacts of their resultant waste processing byproducts remain unassessed. Depending on their management techniques and destinations, such large waste streams, such as non-recovered recyclables and anaerobic digestate, may significantly alter the overall environmental footprint of the integrated solid waste management (ISWM) strategy. This research aimed to assess the life cycle impacts of various ISWM strategies incorporating material recovery and waste-to-energy (WTE) systems. The examined strategies were based on combinations of incineration (INC) and anaerobic digestion (AD) plants, in addition to material recovery facilities (MRFs) and landfills. The study used eighteen scenarios to explore the effect of the potential pathways of waste processing byproducts on the overall carbon footprint of the strategies. The proposed lifecycle assessment framework was applied to an emerging metropolis. The highest energy recovery was achieved in the dual AD and INC scenarios, particularly when the digestate was incinerated, followed by the mono INC scenario. The highest material recovery, specifically recycled materials and digestate, was accomplished in the MRF+AD and MRF +AD+INC scenarios, in which digestate was marketed and non-recovered recyclables were incinerated. It was found that alternative pathways of waste-processing byproducts can reduce the overall global warming potential (GWP) of the base scenarios. Combining MRF and INC as well as MRF, AD, and INC while incinerating non-recovered recyclables, disposing ash, and marketing digestate (if any) were the optimum environmental options in terms of GWP. Incineration of non-recovered recyclables reduced carbon emissions by 29% compared to disposal, whereas marketing and incinerating the digestate positively impacted GWP compared to landfilling (83 and 77%, respectively). A breakdown of the sub-processes revealed that the energy recovery, recycling, and landfilling processes had the highest contributions to the total GWP (up to 88, 92, and 98%, respectively); the collection and transportation processes had the least impacts (2 and 13%, respectively). The more waste-processing byproducts were incinerated, the greater GWP contribution of energy recovery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestate; Byproducts management; Dubai; Lifecycle assessment; Material recovery rejects; Waste valorization","carbon; fossil fuel; glass; metal; plastic; anaerobic digestion; Article; ash; carbon footprint; conceptual framework; controlled study; Dubai; energy recovery; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; life cycle assessment; marketing; practice guideline; recycling; risk reduction; solid waste management; traffic and transport; waste site; waste-to-energy; carbon footprint; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; waste management; Carbon Footprint; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098222431

This paper assessed which of 451 990 Alberta oil and gas wells should have been (or will be) tested for SCVF and/or GM according to regulations, and compared the results with the provincial GM testing database. As of 2017, GM testing was required on 3.5%, and reported for 0.75%, of Alberta’s energy wells. Similarly, SCVF testing was required on 58.2%, and reported for 6.2%, of all wells. An estimated 14.5% of all wells were legally abandoned before GM and SCVF testing regulations existed. All of the remaining wells will require SCVF testing prior to legal abandonment, and an estimated 32.9% to 75.5% of the total will not require GM testing before abandonment based on current regulations. The cumulative number of ‘serious’ GM reports that have remained open since submission has continuously been increasing each year, which contradicts the requirement for repair within 90 days, suggesting regulations are not enforced. The GM testing procedure is inadequate for quantitative testing. We conclude that fugitive methane emissions, and in particular gas migration, are not well constrained in Alberta. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","emissions; gas migration; GHGs; greenhouse gas; oil and gas; surface casing vent flow","Abandoned wells; Chemical industry; Gas emissions; Groundwater; Laws and legislation; Methane; Oil wells; Water quality; Cumulative number; Methane emissions; Methane reduction; Oil and gas well; Petroleum wells; Quantitative testing; Surface casings; Testing procedure; Well testing; emission inventory; gas flow; gas well; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; hydrocarbon migration; methane; petroleum hydrocarbon; pollution incidence; risk assessment; venting; water quality; Alberta; Canada; Alberta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092102079

A collective effort of institutional governance, energy resources utilization, foreign inclusion, and regional collaboration is required for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) of achieving a clean environment. In reaching this objective, this study investigates the sustainably of Regulatory Quality (RQ), Energy Consumption per capita (ECpc), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and their interaction in reducing the Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) Emissions. This study considered 27 Asian econ-omies, covering the more extensively undertaken regional investigation, in the time period from 2001 to 2018. The results of the two‐step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) show that RQ has a strong positive significant impact on GHGs emissions reduction. It further indicates that FDI inflows support the institutions to enhance their institutional capacities. Simultaneously, ECpc has negative impacts on GHGs emissions. Furthermore, RQ interaction with ECpc and FDI also have a strong significant positive impact on GHGs emissions reduction in Asia. The study concludes that the Asia region has been implementing aggressive and prudent policies towards environmental up‐gradation to achieve sustainability. However, FDI inflows should be more allocated to environmental quality and energy efficacy to clean the climate and promote regional collaboration. © 2021 by the authors.

Building on a 2014 survey experiment, we conducted thirty qualitative interviews with car-owners in Oslo, Norway, to investigate the ways in which institutional context and political-value orientation affect public attitudes towards emissions policies. One context (presented as a text treatment) highlighted individual rationality, emphasising the ways in which local pollution impacts the individual citizen; the other highlighted social rationality, emphasising the wider significance of carbon emissions and global responsibility for climate change. We analysed the effects of these contexts on attitudes, finding that institutional context influenced individuals’ perspectives as well as their attitudes towards climate policies. Groups with different value orientations differed in terms of their evaluations but not their interpretations of these contexts. © 2020 The White Horse Press.","Climate policies; Institutional contexts; Public attitudes; Social dilemmas; Values","carbon emission; climate change; data interpretation; environmental policy; experimental study; institutional framework; public attitude; questionnaire survey; Norway; Oslo [Norway]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099600880
