Soil respiration is driven by proximal factors (e.g., soil temperature and soil moisture), which affect soil respiration by regulating microbial and root activity, and distal factors (e.g., topography), which affect soil respiration by influencing proximal factors. The objectives of this study were: (1) to relate measured carbon dioxide flux from forest soils to proximal and distal factors; and (2) to develop predictive soil-landscape models of soil respiration across a forested watershed. Carbon dioxide flux from the soil surface was measured monthly for 12 months at sampling points selected using a random stratified approach, with strata established based on slope aspect (NE and SW), slope shape (concave and convex), and slope position (upper, middle, and lower backslope). We generated empirical models using robust linear regression techniques to examine relationships between soil respiration and both proximal (soil physical and chemical properties) and distal factors (terrain attributes calculated from a 30-m digital elevation model). In situ soil respiration rates were greater on the NE-facing slopes than the SW-facing slopes. The models that we developed and validated explain up to 66% of variability in measured soil respiration, although seasonal model relationships varied. Soil temperature was the most consistent proximal factor for predicting soil respiration rates, while slope aspect was the most consistent distal factor among the models. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Forest soils; Predictive modeling; Soil chemical properties; Soil respiration; Terrain attributes","Atmospherics; Carbon dioxide; Mathematical models; Soils; Watersheds; Forest soils; Predictive modeling; Soil chemical properties; Soil respiration; Terrain attributes; Forestry; forested catchment; in situ measurement; landscape; soil respiration; watershed; article; calculation; forest soil; landscape ecology; linear regression analysis; microbial activity; physical chemistry; soil chemistry; soil respiration; soil temperature; stratification; validation process; watershed management; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Mathematical Models; Soil; Water Sheds; Kentucky; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544516023

Successful hydrocarbon development will require careful management of the associated natural gas, H2S, and CO2 products. Some form of sulfur emission reduction is essential to meet regulatory requirements and satisfy public expectations on sulfur emission. Key elements of a sulfur management strategy are based on the minimization of the production of waste sulfur at sources; conversion of H2S into a resource for increasing oil recovery by enhancing the efficiency of the sweep; and minimizing the risk to people's health, damage to the environment, and maintaining the integrity of the safety of operations. Acid gas injection for improved oil recovery is a superior strategy that is more economical than other sulfur management options. The technology is consistent with the ideals of sustainable development and demonstrates how H2S management can add value as a driver for improved recovery factor and better oil sweep in the reservoir. The risks, strengths, and disadvantages of acid gas injection for EOR are elucidated. Risk profiles for H2S management options and solid disposal by injection were also discussed.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888979442

When burning low sulphur fuel oils in preliminary burner tests a tendency towards metal dusting of flame tubes and headpieces of low-NOx burners has been observed. A series of low sulphur fuel oils originating from different raffineries were burned in blue and yellow flame burners. In these experiments the recirculation tubes and burner head pieces were attacked by metal dusting. The tubes are made of the Ni-base alloy Alloy 601. On the inner surface of the tubes pits and holes formed which is the typical form of metal dusting attack for this material. Corrosion rates of 1 mm/500 h were observed which is extraordinarily high compared to the data reported in literature for metal dusting in CO-H2-H2O atmospheres. In that case the highest rates are about 0.7 mm/year at temperatures between 600 °C and 650 °C [1]. The concentration of the gas components O2, CO, CO2, CxHy and H2 close to the inner surface of the recirculation tubes and burner head pieces were measured during burner operation. Non equilibrium gas concentrations were detected. The carbon activity for CO-reduction by H2 and for the Boudouard reaction of the gas is significantly less than 1. On the other hand in the region were the tubes are attacked the concentration of hydrocarbons is very high giving a carbon activity far beyond 1. In this critical region temperatures of the tube of about 700 °C were measured. In a standardized experiment with a low-NOx yellow flame burner ten low sulphur fuel oils were tested. Metal dusting attack was observed for seven of the ten fuel oils. Sulphur content of the fuel oils was between 5 and 72 mg sulphur per kg. Within these limits sulphur content did not influence metal dusting. The fuel with lowest sulphur content did not cause any corrosion attack under given experimental conditions. The role of sulphur was investigated by analyzing the amount of sulphur adsorbed on the surface of burner head pieces after operation. The sulphur was detected by auger electron spectroscopy AES and electron probe microanalysis EPMA. With these data a mean coverage of sulphur in the significant location is calculated. A fuel oil containing 1700 mg sulphur/kg and low sulphur fuel oils were used. After 5 min of operation an S-coverage of 1.7 1015 atoms/cm2 was detected for the fuel with 1700 mg sulphur/kg and 1.1 1015 atoms/cm2 for fuel with 15 mg sulphur/kg. After about 4500 min of operation - when the alloy has build an oxid layer of about 1 μm thickness - the S-coverage was 0.9 1015 atoms/cm2 for the fuel with 1700 mg sulphur/kg and 0.6 1015 atoms/cm2 for fuel oils with 36 mg sulphur/kg and 15 mg sulphur/kg. For elementary sulphur 1.1 10 15 atoms/cm2 corresponds to a monolayer of sulphur atoms. As there is no significant difference in the amount of adsorbed sulphur it is concluded that an inhibiting effect of adsorbed sulphur on metal dusting should be equaly effective for low sulphur fuel oil as for standard fuel oil. Furthermore the effect of other parameters specific to fuel oil and of temperature on metal dusting in low-NOx burners is discussed.","Fuel oil; Metal dusting; Ni-base alloy; Recirculation burner; Sulphur","A-carbon; Burner head; Co-reduction; Corrosion attack; Critical region; Experimental conditions; Flame burners; Flame tube; Gas component; Gas concentration; Inhibiting effect; Inner surfaces; Low-NOx burners; Metal dusting; Ni-base alloys; Non equilibrium; Recirculation burners; Recirculations; Sulphur atoms; Sulphur content; Alloys; Auger electron spectroscopy; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Corrosion rate; Electron probe microanalysis; Experiments; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Metals; Monolayers; Nickel; Sulfur; Sulfur determination; Surfaces; Tubes (components); Fuel oils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889943218

Climatologists say the world cannot wait 20 years for alternative fuels to start reversing the global warming trend-line, since by then considerable climate alteration and coastal damage will be manifest. The point is to dramatically reduce CO2, a by-product of internal combustion engine operations, as quickly as feasible to overcome the half-century lead-time of CO2 buildup already in the atmosphere. Since CO2 production correlates directly with vehicle mass, this paper makes the case for quickly reducing vehicle size. It also argues for re-introducing electric vehicles on a large scale, and altering the conventional highway configuration to achieve greater productivity. Fuel cells, even when fully accepted, will not improve important aspects of modern urban transport such as safety and traffic flow.","Alternative fuels; CO2 reduction; Electric vehicles; Highway configuration; Right-of-way productivity","Byproducts; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Internal combustion engines; Productivity; Synthetic fuels; Traffic control; Transportation; CO2 reduction; Highway configuration; Right-of-way productivity; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342574830

However, the level of acidic deposition remaining is still unlikely to promote widespread recovery of aquatic ecosystems. The First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model has been applied to south-central Ontario (285 lakes in the Muskoka River Catchment) to evaluate the need for further reductions in emissions. As a result of the past decline in deposition, the proportion of lakes with critical loads exceedance has dropped substantially; however, further reductions in sulphur and nitrogen emissions are required to eliminate critical loads exceedance. Based on bulk deposition of sulphate and nitrogen (41.1 mmolc m-2 yr-1 and 62.5 mmolc m-2 yr-1, respectively) for the period 1995-1999, 166 lakes (58.3%) exceed critical loads.

The transmission leverages the advantages of an output power-split configuration for low-speed operation and a compound power-split configuration for high-speed operation. It is capable of being operated in a number of operating modes including an eVT only mode and a hybrid mode when equipped with on-board energy storage devices. The transmission provides a compact, highly efficient and potentially low cost driveline solution for both conventional vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. A virtual transmission prototype was built in EASY51. A base vehicle model was also constructed in EASY5 environment with Ricardo Powertrain Library components. Performance of the proposed transmission was evaluated in context of the base vehicle for driveline efficiency, vehicle acceleration, vehicle fuel consumption and emissions under various driving cycles. Comparison with a conventional four-speed automatic transmission was made. Results of the evaluation have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed eVT over conventional automatic transmissions. The eVT has a high efficiency of 92% over most of the speed conversion range. The infinite conversion range of the eVT enhances the vehicle's tractive effort, improving vehicle acceleration. It shortens the acceleration time by 7.5% from 0 to 60 mph, and 9.5% from 30 to 50 mph. The infinitely variable speed ratio along with the rapid speed-ratio-change capability of the electric system allows the transmission to significantly improve vehicle's fuel economy and reduce vehicle's emissions. Even under eVT only operation mode (for conventional vehicle application), 11% fuel savings for urban driving and 9% on highway driving are easily achievable. The reduction in Nox emission is predicted to be about 12% under urban drive cycles and 5% on highway.

Often times, at the discovery of a new field or extension of an existing field, there are uncertainties associated with quantifying the amount of hydrocarbons in place. These uncertainties may be related to the structure, aerial extent of the accumulation, unseen fluid contacts to delineate the vertical extent, internal architecture of the reservoir and the characteristics of the resident fluid(s). In some cases, companies may complete and produce discovery wells before they can fully appraise the structure or may be forced by other considerations such as community disturbances to abandon appraisal drilling and continue to produce from existing well(s). All these and much more, have an impact on the evaluation of in-place hydrocarbon resources and consequently recoverable hydrocarbons. In Field Development Planning, it is routine to identify and quantify the impact of major subsurface uncertainties such as the in-place volumes and their distribution. This paper presents the methodology and results of an integrated disciplinary effort at translating uncertainties into a range of static (in-place) volumes for the purpose of field development. Erratic sand development, paucity of biostratigraphic control coupled with a complex structure make the G1.0 complex of the EGBM field one of the least understood hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Northern depobelt - Onshore, Niger Delta, Nigeria. Lack of PVT samples and analyses also add to the uncertainty in fluid properties. The erratic distribution of the petrophysical parameters especially from the G sand core also contributes to the petrophysical uncertainties. The construction of 3-D static reservoir models based on the understanding of facies and their relationships, through the integration of all available data have been used to enhance the understanding and quantification of the uncertainties. Standard evaluation of uncertainties in the spread of petrophysical parameters like porosity, hydrocarbon saturation and Net-to-Gross ratio was carried out and compared with the multiscenario concepts incorporated in the geological models. PVT parameters were derived for the reservoir based on analogy and correlations constrained with production and test data. Efforts were also made to comply with definitions of proved reserves by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) while still evaluating expectation volumes for internal purposes. An attempt has also been made in comparing results from the probabilistic volumetric evaluation of this reservoir and the deterministic (best estimate) method. © 2004 Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.",,"Abandoned wells; Antennas; Discovery wells; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Petrophysics; Uncertainty analysis; Hydrocarbon in places; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Hydrocarbon saturation; In-place hydrocarbons; Internal architecture; Managing uncertainty; Petrophysical parameters; Securities and Exchange Commissions; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088774754

Three vehicles were fueled with CARB specification diesel fuel and no emission control devices (current technology), and three vehicles were fueled with GTL fuel and retrofit with Johnson Matthey's CCRT™ diesel particulate filter. No engine modifications were made. Bench scale fuel-engine compatibility testing showed the GTL fuel had cold flow properties suitable for year-round use in southern California and was additized to meet current lubricity standards. Bench scale elastomer compatibility testing returned results similar to those of CARB specification diesel fuel. The GTL fuel met or exceeded ASTM D975 fuel properties. Researchers used a chassis dynamometer to test emissions over the City Suburban Heavy Vehicle Route (CSHVR) and New York City Bus (NYCB) cycles. The GTL- fueled vehicles were tested with and without the CDPFs to isolate fuel and aftertreatment effects. All emission changes are compared to the CARB specification diesel baseline. Over the CSHVR cycle, GTL fuel (no filter) reduced all regulated emissions, with oxides of nitrogen (NOx) reductions of 8% and particulate matter (PM) reductions of 33%. Over the NYCB cycle, GTL fuel (no filter) reduced NOx and PM by 16% and 23%, respectively. Combining GTL and CDPF further reduced all regulated emissions, with NOx and PM reductions of 14% and 99%, respectively, on the CSHVR cycle.

The time-series of nutrient uptake and atmospheric deposition needed were created using the MAKEDEP model and the future scenarios were based on the 1999 Gothenburg protocol. The version of MAKEDEP used included nutrient content elasticity, and the modelled biomass nutrient content thus varies between regions as well as over time. The results were analysed by dividing the sites into three different regions (southwest, central and north) as well as nationally. It was shown that acidification remains a severe environmental problem in the southwest region even after implementation of the 1999 Gothenburg protocol, whereas in the north the problem is far less pronounced. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Acidification; Critical loads; MAKEDEP; Modelling; Recovery","acidification; critical load; forest soil; remediation; soil pollution; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Asta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344561526

An adequate emissions inventory and a description of the meteorology and chemistry involved are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of methodologies that reduce the effect of vehicle emissions on ozone formation. During the period 10-12 August 1999, concentrations of ozone in the SPMA and the impact of the official emissions inventory were simulated through application of an urban-scale Eulerian model.

A real world test cycle was used, based on an urban drive cycle that was similar to the ECE urban drive cycle. It was based on four laps of a street circuit and an emissions sample bag was taken for each lap. The bag for the first lap was for the cold start emissions. An in-vehicle direct exhaust dual bag sampling technique was used to simultaneously collect exhaust samples upstream and downstream of the three-way catalyst (TWC). The cold start tests were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from - 2°C to 32°C. The exhaust system was instrumented with thermocouples so that the catalyst light off temperature could be determined. The results showed that CO emissions for the cold start were reduced by a factor of 8 downstream of catalyst when ambient temperature rose from -2°C to 32°C, the corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by a factor of 4. There was no clear relationship between NOx emissions and ambient temperature. For subsequent laps of the test circuit the reduction of CO and HC emissions as a function of ambient temperature was lower. The time for catalyst light off increased by 50% as the ambient temperature was reduced. The results show that the vehicle used is unlikely to meet the new - 7°C cold start CO emission regulations.

International treaties like the Kyoto Protocol are supposed to contribute to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Underground sequestration has the potential to play an important role in keeping large volumes of CO 2 from escaping into the atmosphere in the short term. The first case of industrial scale CO 2 storage in the world (close to one million tonnes per year since 1996) is taking place at the Sleipner underground CO 2 storage site in the North Sea offshore Norway. Careful monitoring of the behaviour of the storage facility is required to establish its safety. To this end, two time-lapse seismic surveys have been acquired; the first repeat survey was completed in October 1999 and the second in October 2001. The presence of CO 2 beneath thin intra-shale layers within the reservoir has caused significant changes both in reflection amplitudes (up to a factor 10) and in travel time (more than 40ms) through the CO 2 plume (the velocity push-down effect). Some aspects of the interpretation of these time-lapse seismic surveys will be presented here. © The Geological Society of London 2004.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; monitoring; seismic method; underground storage; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; oceanic regions; Sleipner Field; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044230083

In addition, in many strategic documents on sustainable development (e.g., EU documents) the importance of the development and use of indicators is pointed out. In this context indicators are meant to be used to support political decision making as well as to evaluate measurements towards sustainable development. In this article the development and use of indicators is questioned considering their contextualisation and, hence, their relationship to existing institutions. Incorporating some of the main results from an analysis of a regeneration programme in the London Borough of Southwark and from the analysis of the Climate Protection Programme in the city of Vienna, which are two of the case studies examined during an EU funded project called PASTILLE (Promoting Action for Sustainability through Indicators at the Local Level in Europe), indicators are seen as dynamic sites of conflict and co-operation between policy actors. Different groups of actors have diverse expectations or objections to this instrument. Indicators are, for example, tools to augment transparency. Concerning certain institutional traditions this characteristic could explain opposition to them. Indicators are meant to be another opportunity for shaping the network of relationships, forging new relationships or reinforcing old ones. They are perceived as a means by which actors seek to exercise power, retain status and strive towards policy goals. The stability and fluidity of existing structures of governance will, therefore, be central factors in determining the history and future of indicators promoting actions towards sustainable development. To put it differently, the central question of our paper is how the nature of institutions of governance is shaping the use and development of indicators. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Indicators; Institutions; Local policy processes; Sustainability; Urban governance","institutional framework; planning process; sustainability; urban planning; Austria; Central Europe; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; Southwark; United Kingdom; Vienna; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042501712

But, no standards, guidelines and regulations exist for control of odor problems in this legislation of Turkey. Moreover, there are odor complaints in the residential and industrial areas as well as at the tourist sites of Turkey. It was recorded by the national and local environmental authorities that most of the complaints from environmental pollution is based on ""malodorous"" water bodies, wastewater discharges, solid wastes or emissions. But specific legislative procedure for their handling, management and treatment does not exist. Therefore, this problem should be adequately addressed.The basic goal of the project mentioned in this presentation is to develop a management policy in Turkey for odorous emissions and immissions which is in line with the specific objective of the Life Third Countries Program. This necessitates preparing the Turkish Guidelines for odor measurements. Building an infrastructure in Turkey to have a sustainable application and enforcement of the new ""National Odor Control Regulation"" is also included among the objectives of the project.As an outcome of this project, Clean Air Act of Turkey will include a new ""Regulation"" concerning odorous emissions and immissions.

The most crucial parameter and state, respectively, are widely believed to be the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and the relative oxygen level (ROL) of the TWC. The TWC's performance decreases with a diminishing OSC. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the OSC can be used for OBD. Keeping the ROL at an optimal level by means of control enhances the TWC's performance significantly, even during transients of the air/fuel ratio imposed by the driver. In order to monitor both the ROL and the OSC, an observer has been derived from a complex TWC model. The observer consists of an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which estimates the ROL of the TWC from the exhaust gas mass flow, the temperature and the lambda-sensor signal upstream of the TWC. Additionally, the gas composition and the signal of a sensor downstream are estimated in order to close the loop for the EKF. The EKF also estimates the OSC by means of online estimation.

The largest simulated variations in carbon fluxes occurred in the Midwest, where large fire events (1937, 1988) decreased vegetation biomass and soil carbon pools. The Southeast showed decadal-type trends and alternated between a carbon source (1920s, 1940s, 1970s) and a sink (1910s, 1930s, 1950s) in response to climate variations. The drought of the 1930s was most obvious in the creation of a large carbon source in the Midwest and the Great Plains, depleting soil carbon reserves. The Northeast shows the smallest amplitudes in the variation of its carbon stocks. Western regions release large annual carbon fluxes from their naturally fire-prone grassland- and shrubland-dominated areas, which respond quickly to chronic fire disturbance, thus reducing temporal variations in carbon stocks. However, their carbon dynamics reflect the impacts of prolonged drought periods as well as regional increases in rainfall from ocean-atmosphere climate regime shifts, most evident in the 1970s. Projections into the future by using the warm CGCM1 climate scenario show the Northeast becoming mostly a carbon source, the Southeast becoming the largest carbon source in the 21st century, and the two western-most regions becoming carbon sinks in the second half of the 21st century. Similar if more moderate trends are observed by using the more moderately warm HADCM2SUL scenario. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.",,"Atmospherics; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Drought; Environmental impact; Gas dynamics; Ocean currents; Vegetation; Carbon fluxes; Carbon source; Natural vegetation; Shurblands; Ecosystems; carbon; rain; carbon flux; carbon sink; regional pattern; soil carbon; vegetation dynamics; article; biomass; carbon source; climate; climate change; ecosystem; fire; forest; gas exchange; grassland; rangeland; reduction; scrub; soil; United States; vegetation; Air Pollution; Carbon; Ecosystems; Oceanography; Plants; Simulation; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544433629

Recognizing the challenge imposed by the potential for climate change, recent initiatives by various governments and by energy producers target a significant reduction in the intensity of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. A major mitigation strategy for reducing the intensity and amount of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere is CO2 capture and sequestration, of which geological sequestration is a major component. Although enhanced oil recovery operations have the lowest capacity of all options for geological CO2 sequestration, they are most likely to be implemented first because of the additional economic benefit that will help offset the cost of CO2 sequestration. Assuming that the pore space previously occupied by the produced oil can be backfilled with CO2, a methodology has been developed for the identification and screening of oil reservoirs that are suitable for CO2 flooding and for estimating their CO2 sequestration capacity at depletion, as well as under enhanced oil recovery. The methodology has been applied to close to 11,000 oil pools in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that are recorded in provincial reserves databases. Of these, 4, 767 oil pools are technically suitable for CO2 flooding, with an estimated incremental oil production and total CO2 sequestration capacity of 350×106 m3 (2, 200 MMbbl) and 988 Mt CO2, respectively. However, only 110 oil pools have individual CO2 sequestration capacity greater than 1 Mt CO2 each, but together they account for ∼61% of the total. The incremental oil production from these 110 oil pools is estimated to be 150×106 m3 (930 MMbbl) oil, and these oil pools should be considered first in detailed studies of CO2 EOR and sequestration. To account for the effect of underlying aquifer influx that reduces CO2 storage capacity, analysis of the production history of these 110 oil pools shows that the water-oil and gasoil ratios are indicative of the strength of the underlying aquifers, but the recovery factor is not. The underlying aquifer is considered strong if cumulative net WOR&gt;0.25, and weak if WOR&lt;0.15. For WOR between 0.15 and 0.25, strong aquifer support is indicated by cumulative GOR&lt;1,000 m3/m3 (5, 600 scf/bbl), otherwise the aquifer support is weak. Material balance analysis on 19 of these oil pools with active aquifers indicated that, if the reservoir pressure is only allowed to increase back to the initial pressure, the CO2 sequestration capacity is reduced on average only by ∼3%, if the underlying aquifer is weak, and by ∼50% if the underlying aquifer is strong. © 2004, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.",,"Air pollution; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Floods; Fossil fuels; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Proven reserves; Reservoirs (water); Atmospheric concentration; Enhanced oil recovery; Fossil fuel combustion; Geological sequestration; Industrial activities; Industrial revolutions; Mitigation strategy; Western canada sedimentary basins; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055860011

Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are emitted by many mobile and stationary sources and secondary aldehydes are intermediates in the photo-oxidation of organic compounds in the atmosphere. These aldehydes are emitted indoors by many materials such as furniture, carpets, heating and cooling systems, and by smoking. Carbonyls, mainly formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have been studied because of their adverse health effects. In addition, formaldehyde is a suspected carcinogen. Therefore, the concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were determined to assess the inhalation exposure doses to carbonyls for people who work in a 13-story building and in order to evaluate the cancer hazard. Methods. Carbonyl compounds in indoor and outdoor air were measured at a 13-story building located in Mexico City. The mezzanine, fifth and tenth floors, and the third level-parking garage were selected for sampling. Samples were collected in two sampling periods, the first from April 20 to 29, 1998 and the second from December 1 to 20, 1998. Carbonyls were sampled by means of DNHP-coated cartridges at a flow rate of 1 l min -1 from 9:00 to 19:00 hours, during 2-hour time intervals and analyzed by HPLC with UV/VIS detection. Results. Mean carbonyl concentrations were highest in the 3rd level-parking garage, with the formaldehyde concentration being the highest ranging from 108 to 418 μg m-3. In working areas, the highest carbonyl arithmetic mean concentrations (AM) were observed on the 5th floor. Acetone and formaldehyde concentrations were highest in April ranging from 161 to 348 μg m-3 (AM = 226) and from 157 to 270 μg m-3 (AM= 221), respectively. Propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde were present in smaller concentrations ranging from 2 to 25 and 1 to 28 μg m-3, respectively, considering all the samples. Mean indoor/outdoor ratios of carbonyls ranged from 1.8 to 9.6. A reduction of inhalation exposure doses of 41% and 45% was observed in the fifth floor air after the air conditioning systems had been repaired. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were higher in smoking environments. Conclusion. Indoor carbonyl concentrations were significantly greater than outdoor concentrations. Tobacco smoke seems to be the main indoor source of formaldehyde. After the air conditioning system was maintained and repaired (as was recommended), an important reduction in the emission of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde was achieved on all floors, except for the 3rd level parking garage, thereby reducing the inhalation exposure doses. Recommendation. The results obtained in this research demonstrated that maintenance of air conditioning systems must be carried out regularly in order to avoid possible adverse effects on health. Additionally, it is mandatory that isolated smoking areas, with air extraction systems, be installed in every public building.","13-story building; Acetaldehyde; Butyraldehyde; Carbonyl compounds, measurements; Exposure factors; Formaldehyde; Indoor pollutants; Propionaldehyde","acetaldehyde; disinfectant agent; formaldehyde; carbonyl compound; indoor air; air conditioning; article; exposure; human; indoor air pollution; Mexico; neoplasm; risk assessment; Acetaldehyde; Air Pollution, Indoor; Disinfectants; Formaldehyde; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Mexico; Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Ventilation; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9244230098

A Wetland Reservoir Subirrigation System (WRSIS) is comprised of three interconnected components, a wetland, a water storage reservoir and cropland containing an underground pipe system for drainage or subirrigation depending on crop needs. Three test sites are in the Ohio portion of the Maumee River drainage basin and are located in Defiance, Fulton, and Van Wert counties. Average corn yields, through 6 or 7 years of operation, increased 591 kg ha-1, 3,790 kg ha-1, and 679 kg ha-1 at Defiance, Fulton and Van Wert, respectively. Average soybean yields, through 6 or 7 years of operation, increased 755 kg ha-1, 755 kg ha-1 and 391 kg ha -1 at Defiance, Fulton and Van Wert, respectively. Comparison of the water quality entering the wetland and water exiting the wetland at the Defiance County site showed an average reduction of total filterable solids of 74%, a reduction in nitrates of 51%, and a reduction in organic carbon of 62%. Similar results were found at the Fulton County location. In addition to monitoring wetland water quality we have an extensive shallow ground water monitoring program at the Defiance county site.

Increasing concern over climate change projections has prompted numerous crop-based studies on the possible agricultural implications. It is not possible to evaluate sustainability without understanding the interactions between the influence of climatic trends, host resistance, cultural interventions and fungicide efficacy in relation to late blight risk. The objectives of this case study were to report the potential impact of climate change on late blight epidemiology in potatoes. Analysis of historical data from 1948 - 1999 indicated that late blight risk over a standardized growing season from 1 May - 30 Sep increased in the Upper Great Lakes region of the US. Predominant genotypes of P. in f e s ta n s (e.g. US8) in the US appear more tolerant of temperatures close to 0°C and their survival in warming conditions may explain their supremacy. As conditions become increasingly favorable for late blight development it is essential to reduce sources of initial inoculum through integrated approaches that include prediction of conditions conducive to late blight development and appropriate application of controls.","Fungicides; Phytophthora infestans; Solanum tuberosum; Sustainability; Varieties",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845448396

The widespread adoption of particulate filters for diesel buses in European cities has been due to their high effectiveness in emissions reduction, but has depended on the relative simplicity of fitting a device that does not usually need interconnection with the engine controls. In conditions giving good passive regeneration (particulate oxidation by NO2 under the normal exhaust conditions), the inherent durability is excellent. Almost all failures have been due too much soot accumulating in the traps, few of which yet have active regeneration systems. Such failures are usually spasmodic, and often due to high smoke from faulty engines, but a few bus fleets have suffered serious failure frequencies. These problems have been investigated and cured. Prevention being better than cure, engineering methods have been developed to predict passive regeneration performance in any application. Satisfactory trap durability requires adequate vehicle and trap maintenance. Recent developments in on-board filter condition monitoring and off-vehicle filter cleaning have reduced failure rates and extended the range of operation where passive regeneration is satisfactory.

The analytical methods used include energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence with polarizing secondary targets, total reflection X-ray fluorescence, direct in-situ X-ray fluorescence, and micro-beam X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. These methods were applied to analysis of different samples including soil, water, plant material and airborne particulate matter collected on polycarbonate filters. The performance and achieved detection limits of elements for different techniques, established by measuring appropriate reference standards, are presented. Also described is the utilization of micro-beam X-ray fluorescence technique for studying element distribution in heterogeneous samples and investigating the 2D- and 3D-morphology of minute samples by means of computerized X-ray absorption and X-ray fluorescence tomography. The different X-ray techniques have their unique advantages. The micro-beam X-ray fluorescence set-up has an advantage of producing very well collimated primary X-ray beam (about 15 μm in diameter), in front of which the analyzed sample can be precisely positioned, providing local information about the sample composition. The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence with secondary targets offers rapid analysis of broad range of elements (Na-U) combined with a simple sample preparation method. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence technique, characterized by the lowest detection limits of elements, has its leading edge in analysis of liquid samples, and dealing with particle size effects in air particulates collected on filter papers. In-situ X-ray fluorescence spectrometers are truly portable and enable on the spot, in field analysis.

However, the discrimination between mineralised and unmineralised sequences is not straightforward. Komatiite chemistry i s influenced by a variety of primary magmatic variables, overprinted to various degrees for various elements by the effects of metasomatic alteration. Once highly metasomatised samples have been filtered, primary magmatic signatures are largely retained for the elements Mg, Fe, Si, Al, Ti and Cr, even in cases of extensive CO2 metasomatism and talc-carbonate alteration. Incompatible trace elements such as Zr and REE are modified to some degree by alteration, particularly in cumulate rocks, but there is evidence for some retention of primary signatures. Favourable volcani c environments, i.e. those containing large-volume lava pathways, can be identified on the basis of their distribution and ratios of whole rock Mg, Fe, Ni, Cr and Ti. Nickel depletion can be recognised in some cases of large mineralised systems where large volumes of sulfide formed at low silicate:sulfide (R) ratios, but is not effective in finding small high-grade ore shoots. PGE in low-S rocks do not appear to be an effective discriminant, owing to the local scale of S-saturation. Crustal contamination is indicated in some mineralised suites on the basis of enriched ratios of strongly to weakly incompatible lithophile elements in fractionated lavas, but the effects of alteration are significant and may be misleading. On the whole, mineralised sequences tend to have more enriched signatures than unmineralised ones, but there may be many false positives and negatives, and if the most CO2-metasomatised suites are discounted the contrast largely disappears. Overall, the presence of Ni-enriched sulfides is by far the best lithogeochemical indicator there is, and it may be the only really effective one. © Springer-Verlag/Wien 2004.",,"carbon dioxide; crustal structure; cumulate; igneous geochemistry; komatiite; metasomatism; nickel; rare earth element; silicate mineral; sulfide (organic); zircon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444254015

Agricultural intensification, brought about by application of synthetic N fertilizers and industrial-scale animal feeding operations, is another land use change that increases N emissions. The Colorado Front Range region experienced rapid population growth from 1980 (1.9 million) to 2000 (2.9 million). Emissions from point (power plants and industry) and mobile (highway and off road vehicles) sources were responsible for most of the increase in emissions since 1980. Agriculture (cropped and grazed land and livestock) was the other important source of N emissions. Soil emissions from cropped and grazed lands remained stable while livestock emissions increased slightly due to more cattle and hogs in feedlots. Although cause and effect relationships between increased N emissions and eutrophication of particular ecosystems are difficult to establish, higher N deposition has been observed at alpine sites near the headwaters of the South Platte River commensurate with the rise in emissions. The ecosystem responses of alpine systems to N deposition are likely to be the result, albeit an indirect one, of land use change. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548202853

The effects of different configurations of interregional spillovers of learning in ERIS and the impact of the emission trading mechanism under those different circumstances are analysed. Including spatial spillovers of learning allows capturing the possibility that the imposition of greenhouse gas emission constraints in a given region may induce technological change in other regions, such as developing countries, even if the latter regions do not face emission constraints.

These systems can be managed to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks in vegetation and soil. The scope for soil organic carbon gains from improved management and restoration within degraded and non-degraded croplands and grasslands in Africa is estimated at 20-43 Tg C year-1, assuming that 'best' management practices can be introduced on 20% of croplands and 10% of grasslands. Under the assumption that new steady state levels will be reached after 25 years of sustained management, this would correspond with a mitigation potential of 4-9% of annual CO2 emissions in Africa. The mechanisms that are being put in place to implement the Kyoto Protocol - through C emission trading - and prevailing agricultural policies will largely determine whether farmers can engage in activities that enhance C sequestration in Africa. Mitigation of climate change by increased carbon sequestration in the soil appears particularly useful when addressed in combination with other pressing regional challenges that affect the livelihood of the people, such as combating land degradation and ensuring food security, while at the same time curtailing global anthropogenic emissions.","Africa; Carbon sequestration; Croplands; Grasslands; Soil degradation; Soil management; Soil organic matter","carbon sequestration; grassland; soil carbon; soil management; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842309051

TPO spectra of spent equilibrium catalysts from cracking of sour imported heavy gas oil (SIHGO) were deconvoluted into four peaks (Peak K, L, M and N). The four peaks were assigned to different types of coke on the catalyst. Peak L in the TPO spectrum was assigned to the 'contaminant' coke in the vicinity of metals. The amount of contaminant coke (Peak L) correlates with metal-contaminant concentration. The size of Peak L which is related to amount of contaminant coke decreased significantly for the spent highly contaminated catalyst pretreated with hydrogen and methane prior to cracking reactions as compared to the non-pretreated catalysts. Since both hydrogen and methane pretreatment can reduce oxidation state of the vanadium that present at high concentrations on the equilibrium catalysts the decrease in the amount of contaminant-coke represented by Peak L was explained by the reduction of the oxidation state of vanadium. Less contaminant coke was produced after the equilibrium catalysts were pretreated using hydrogen and methane gases since reduced vanadium has lower dehydrogenation activity compared to oxidized vanadium.","Coke characterization; FCC catalysts; Pretreatment; Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO); Vanadium","Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Fluid catalytic cracking; Methane; Oxidation; Phase equilibria; Temperature programmed desorption; Coke formation; Sour imported heavy gas oil; Temperature programmed oxidation; Metallurgical coke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842563129

We found that emission of CO2 from Swedish reservoirs was low and, at corresponding dissolved organic carbon concentration, similar to the CO2-emission from natural oligotrophic lakes. The total annual CO2-emission due to regulation for the seven rivers included in this study (which collectively represents 87% of the total hydroelectricity production in Sweden) was 50,000 tonnes of CO2. This emission represents 1.5% of the yearly CO 2-emission from Swedish electricity combustion plants. Thus, the CO2-emission from Swedish hydropower is much lower per unit of electricity produced than the emission from Swedish combustion plants. Emission of CO2 from Swedish reservoirs was lower than from most reservoirs in other boreal regions of the world. This difference is probably due to that a majority of the Swedish reservoirs are constructed by damming of natural lakes in alpine and upland boreal forest areas, which results in flooding of comparatively small areas with thin layers of soil organic carbon.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Hydropower","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; hydroelectric power; reservoir; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242298930

Further quantitative and qualitative analyses of these NAPs lead to the conclusions that - unless the review process by the EC leads to significant modifications - (i) the EU ETS is unlikely to result in any major emission reductions in this first period; (ii) many MS allow for a generous allocation to the emissions trading sector at the cost of other sectors and the general taxpayer; (iii) competitive distortions are likely to arise from the different national interpretations of the installations to be covered by the EU ETS and from the partial-system character of the EU ETS; (iv) barriers to economic efficiency will arise from a probable EU-wide ban on banking and ex-post adjustments of allocated quantities for newcomer installations.

Such a determination is presently hampered by our inability to accurately measure the geoid, especially over the open ocean. In anticipation of a future mean dynamic topography (MDT) provided by combining altimetry and a GOCE geoid, this paper compares the MDTs of several ocean models in the important North Atlantic and Nordic Seas region (focus area of the EU GOCINA project). Each of the models used in this study assimilates hydrography, which is an essential requirement for a model to accurately interpolate the data and provide a realistic MDT. The available MDTs differ in resolution and time period; both these issues are addressed. A composite MDT is formed from the individual MDTs, and we assess the uncertainty in the composite MDT, and in the associated geostrophic surface currents. We find a remarkable level of agreement between this suite of model MDTs. The uncertainty in the composite MDT is less than 4cm over most of the study region, and the uncertainty in the associated geostrophic surface velocities is of the order 2cm/s.

Carbon in forest ecosystems and wood products cannot be measured directly. Ongoing forest monitoring programs provide a statistical basis for estimating carbon stocks and stock changes, based on data already collected, with a temporal resolution of about 5 years. Improvements in inventories will shorten the reporting cycle and add some variables that enhance the content with respect to carbon estimation, but it will take about a decade for full implementation.

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether variable exhaust valve opening (EVO) and exhaust valve closing (EVC) can be used to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. An automotive gasoline engine was tested with different EVO and EVC timings under steady-state and start-up conditions. The first strategy that was evaluated uses early EVO with standard EVC. Although exhaust gas temperature is increased and catalyst light-off time is reduced, the rapid drop in cylinder temperature increases cylinder-out hydrocarbons to such a degree that a net increase in hydrocarbon emissions results. The second strategy that was evaluated uses early EVO with early EVC. Early EVO reduces catalyst light-off time by increasing exhaust gas temperature and early EVC keeps the hydrocarbon-rich exhaust gas from the piston crevice from leaving the cylinder. The net result is that start-up hydrocarbon emissions are reduced by 27%.

The total energy demand of electrical consumers in passenger cars is rising almost exponentially together with an increasing ratio of the peak to average current level. Such conditions can stimulate severe interactions between the various systems on the one hand, while on the other hand the battery charging state varies over a wide range. Recent field problems of high end cars from various vehicle manufacturers demonstrate the importance for an improved interaction analysis of the complete electrical system during the design phase and before the introduction of new functions. An efficient battery management is essential for modern vehicles to ensure a minimum state of charge and a proper lifetime of the battery. The electrical energy storage in hybrid vehicles which use the battery to buffer the combustion engine is even more important. An efficient energy management is mandatory in this context and affects directly both the gasoline consumption and the emissions. In order to address these concerns in the development and construction of the car electronics, detailed over-all simulations are necessary, which cover short-term high current dynamics as well as long-term time scales. The battery is the most important element in these systems, being the central energy storage device. For this reason, a new battery model was developed, which is able to simulate both the long-term and the high dynamic behavior of diverse battery technologies with high accuracy.

The data indicate that a substantial majority of the US public wants the government to do more about the problem of global warming, and they do not support key elements of the Bush administration policies. In particular, they would like the USA to participate in the Kyoto Protocol. Further, a majority prefers mandatory, rather than voluntary, emission reductions by industry; and a majority supports US economic assistance for mitigation projects in developing countries. The level of US public concern has been nearly as high as among European publics. Gaps between US public opinion and US leaders' opinions had been evident in earlier years, with the public exhibiting more concern and more support for new policies; but evidence from 2004 suggests that support among US leaders for the Kyoto Protocol may have risen to approximate the level of public support. Yet, there is also evidence that many US leaders remain unaware of the extent of public support for more action, and of public opposition to recent US administration policies. Altogether, these findings and others reported in the article indicate that there is already a public consensus. However, the national administration during 2001–2004 and many members of Congress have not only been outside that public consensus but are perhaps not even aware of it. The consensus-building process for support for climate change mitigation thus appears to have progressed more than is commonly recognized. A more widespread recognition of the state of public opinion, especially by members of Congress and their staff as well as business leaders, would fundamentally alter the political dynamics of climate change policymaking in the USA. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Policies; Public opinion; USA","climate change; environmental policy; Kyoto Protocol; policy making; public attitude; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644451822

The study was a random sample of 204 households with children less than 18 months in a rural village in the western highlands of Guatemala. Socio-economic and household information was obtained by interview and observation. Twenty-four hour carbon monoxide (CO) was used as the primary measure of kitchen pollution and child exposure in all homes, using Gastec diffusion tubes. Twenty-four hour kitchen PM3.5 was measured in a random sub-sample (n = 29) of kitchens with co-located CO tubes. Almost 50% of the homes still used open fires, around 30% used chimney stoves (planchas) mostly from a large donor-funded programme, and the remainder of homes used various combinations including bottled gas and open fires. The 24-h kitchen CO was lowest for homes with self-purchased planchas: mean (95% CI) CO of 3.09 ppm (1.87-4.30) vs. 12.4 ppm (10.2-14.5) for open fires. The same ranking was found for child CO exposure, but with proportionately smaller differentials (P &lt; 0.0001). The 24-h kitchen PM 3.5 in the sub-sample showed similar differences (n = 24, P &lt; 0.05). The predicted child PM for all 203 children (based on a regression model from the sub-sample) was 375 μg/m3 (270-480) for self-purchased planchas and 536 μg/m3 (488-584) for open fires. Multivariate analysis showed that stove/fuel type was the most important determinant of kitchen CO, with some effect of kitchen volume and eaves. Stove/fuel type was also the key determinant of child CO, with some effect of child position during cooking. The improved stoves in this community have been effective in reducing indoor air pollution and child exposure, although both measures were still high by international standards. Large donor-funded stove programmes need to aim for wider acceptance and uptake by the local families. Better stove maintenance is also required.","Biomass fuels; Children; Developing countries; Improved stoves; Indoor air pollution","carbon monoxide; air conditioning; conference paper; construction work; controlled study; Guatemala; household; human; indoor air pollution; infant; interview; kitchen; major clinical study; multivariate analysis; population exposure; position; preschool child; rural area; socioeconomics; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Cookery; Environmental Exposure; Facility Design and Construction; Female; Guatemala; Health Surveys; Household Articles; Housing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Movement; Social Class; Ventilation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542462113

The obvious reason lies in the necessity for them to continue the development process, which is characterised by pressing needs other than emission control. For developing countries, the real problem is thus not emissions but economic growth. Therefore, the key question is whether or not the Kyoto Protocol provides an opportunity for growth and, thus, their economic development. The only way to accelerate the participation of developing countries in climate agreements - and, therefore, come closer to the goal of a global climate control - is to design strategies which enable their economic development. The dilemma of reducing emissions on a global scale while ensuring growth in the poorer regions can only be solved if there are possibilities embedded in the agreements which can contribute to the sustainable development of those regions. As a consequence, greater emphasis must be placed on the economic development dimension of the Kyoto Protocol as far as the impact on developing countries is concerned.","International climate policy; Sustainable development; Technical change","developing world; economic growth; environmental policy; Kyoto Protocol; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9944260035

Diesel engines are generally more efficient than gasoline engines but improvements in the latter can be achieved by operating under lean-burn conditions. With both diesel and lean-burn gasoline engines, the nitrogen oxides are emissted under oxidising conditions. It is scientifically very challenging to reduce nitrogen oxides under oxidising conditions. After a short survey of conventional three-way catalysts, and the associated fundamental aspects of NOx reduction under stoichoimetric conditions, this review focuses on the knowledge and know-how that has been developed for lean engine emission control. Early research on hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction on zeolite, oxide, and metal-based systems is examined, and some of the key mechanistic models are described. Since none of these systems are of sufficient activity and stability to satisfy current legislation attention has turned to NOx storage and reduction systems. The basic principles of these are described, and the present state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of storage and regeneration are discussed. The many apparent discrepancies are highlighted and an attempt is made to rationalise the current state of knowledge by taking into account the varying experimental conditions reported nit he literature. For diesel engines, NOx storage and reduction is not an ideal solution and so the final section of this review is concerned with silver-based catalysts and especially with the dramatic effect of small amounts of hydrogen on the efficiency of these catalysts for hydrocarbons selective catalytic reduction.

In a positive development, recent high crude oil prices have significantly improved the economics of GTL projects making it easier to justify developing these projects. However, the uncertain world situation, including recent global economic weakness, slowing energy demand and political uncertainty in the Middle East, has increased the perceived risks associated with GTL projects. On the other hand, high natural gas prices in key consuming markets such as the United States and environmental drivers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have promoted a dramatic increase in development and implementation of LNG facilities. Not only do these LNG plants compete for the same natural gas reserves and limited corporate resources, they have the advantage of a simpler and more proven technology over GTL projects that produce liquid transportation fuels. This paper reviews the current environment and provides an independent outlook for the future.

Key terms used to describe aging were hay/straw aroma, cardboard flavor, and apple/wine flavor. The panel was employed to detect the merits of adding sulfur dioxide (SO2) at levels that would be permissible without labeling in the United States. Although some benefit was observed, few of the differences were robust statistically. The observations made by the panel were compared with the observed impact of SO2 on total levels of carbonyl substances measured in the same beers. The reduction in carbonyls was similar irrespective of whether SO2 was added before or after accelerated aging regimes, whereas the limited benefits seen via sensory evaluation were only observed for sulfite addition prior to aging. It is inferred that the limited protective action of SO2 is as an antioxidant rather than as a binder of carbonyls through adduct formation. The taste panel was also used to demonstrate that the partial removal of polyphenols by polyvinylpolypyrrolidone was without any significant effect on the flavor stability of the beers studied.","Carbonyl; Descriptive analysis; Polyphenol; Trained taste panel","Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345759563

Directly north to the park, traffic-congestion is a growing problem on Highways US-411 and US-441 in Sevier County, especially between the towns, Sevierville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. A new four-lane connecting highway and the widening of four existing two-lane roadways into a four-lane divided highway are being considered. The proposed corridor would pass through five counties and parallel the existing federal interstate highway. For passenger cars, light trucks and sport utility vehicles using gasoline as fuel, the highest emissions of NOx and VOC occur at very low vehicle speeds. However at faster vehicle speeds, these vehicle emissions are effectively much lower. This study applied the computer models MOB1LE6 and SMOKE to simulate emissions for two reasonable conditions: (1) the effect of high, on-road light-duty gasoline vehicle and truck emissions caused by traffic-congestion on the existing highway system and (2) the effect of lowering, on-road light-duty gasoline vehicle and truck emissions by increasing vehicle speed resulting from lane widening improvements to the highway system. The CMAQ model was used to evaluate the photochemical effects on the air quality in the GSMNP as simulated by the two different conditions: traffic-congestion versus free-flow traffic. In conclusion, it was found that there was a slight emission reduction benefit from modifications to the existing roadway system. However, the emission reduction did not contribute to air quality improvements in the GSMNP. The net emission reduction and benefit to the air quality may be ambiguous because the consequence of higher vehicular speeds is an increase in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). The results also demonstrated that a new roadway corridor cannot be used as an effective pollution control strategy to improve regional air quality.","CMAQ; GSMNP; Transportation Emission Modeling","Anthropogenic emissions; CMAQ; GSMNP; Sport utility vehicles; Traffic congestion; Transportation emission modeling; Vehicle miles traveled (VMT); Air pollution control; Concentration (process); Gasoline; Highway systems; Light weight vehicles; Ozone; Passenger cars; Photolysis; Speed control; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944400438

The analysed variable in LDAS is soil moisture, only, and there is a need to account for vegetation biomass to monitor the biosphere vegetation-atmosphere CO 2 exchange. The geoland Integrated Project (2004-2007) co-funded by the European Commission, aims at addressing European and global environment issues, based on the use of remote sensing data. The carbon observatory of geoland, hereinafter referred to as ""geoland/ Carbon"", will provide a pre-operational global carbon accounting system, dealing with the impact of weather and climate variability on ecosystems fluxes and carbon stocks, on daily to seasonal and inter-annual time scales. The solution chosen in geoland/Carbon is to merge the LDAS approach and the interactive vegetation models, by making two communities work together: the meteorologists involved in ELDAS and the carbon modellers. In particular, we will investigate the relationship between weather and climate variability and terrestrial CO 2 fluxes. The integration of in situ meteorological measurements and different satellite remote sensing sources of information will be made by using assimilation techniques. In order to integrate the existing approaches and to deliver an assessment based on independent modelling results, two land surface models will be used: 1) an operational scheme (ECMWF) used in numerical weather forecast models, modified to describe an interactive vegetation (based on ISBA-A-gs, Météo-France); 2) a carbon-water-energy land surface scheme, fitted with carbon dynamics in biomass and soil pools, and with ecosystem dynamics (LSCE). The assimilation system will be run at the global scale with both carbon models. The assimilated output fields will be checked against global observations of different nature, such as eddy covariance networks, long term ecological time series (e.g. IGBP transects), forest and soil carbon inventories, or satellite products that were not used at first in the assimilation procedure. At the end of this project, ECMWF will be able to propose a single near-operational system based on components of the two approaches.",,"Carbon cycle; Land data assimilation systems (LDAS); Land surface models; Spatial resolution; Atmospheric humidity; Carbon; Climatology; Ecosystems; Mathematical models; Moisture; Monitoring; Observatories; Precipitation (meteorology); Soils; Vegetation; Weather forecasting; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15944422172

Carbonates of pre-Tertiary, Palaeogene and Neogene age all show a strong diagenetic overprint in which dolomite occurs as both cementing and replacive phases associated with variable reservoir quality. This paper reviews published data on the occurrence and types of dolomites in SE Asian carbonates, and considers the models that have been used to explain the distribution and origin of dolomite within these rocks. Pre-Tertiary carbonates form part of the economic basement, and are little studied and poorly understood. Although some, such as in the Manusela Formation of Seram, may form possible hydrocarbon reservoirs, most are not considered to form economic prospects. They are best known from the platform carbonates of the Ratburi and Saraburi groups, in Thailand, and the oolitic grainstones of the Manusela Formation of Seram. The Ratburi Group shows extensive dolomitization with dolomite developed as an early replacive phase and as a late-stage cement. Palae ogene carbonates are widely developed in the region and are most commonly developed as extensive foraminifera-dominated carbonate shelfal systems around the margins of Sundaland (e.g. Tampur Formation, North Sumatra Basin and Tonasa Formation, Sulawesi) and the northern margins of Australia and the Birds Head microcontinent (e.g. Faumai Formation, Salawati Basin). Locally, carbonates of this age may form hydrocarbon reservoirs. Dolomite is variably recorded in these carbonates and the Tampur Formation, for example, contains extensive xenotopic dolomite. N eogene carbonates (e.g. Peutu Formation, North Sumatra) are commonly areally restricted, reef-dominated and developed in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems. They most typically show a strong diagenetic overprint with leaching, recrystallization, cementation and dolomitization all widespread. Hydrocarbon reservoirs are highly productive and common in carbonates of this age. Dolomite is variably distributed and its occurrence has been related to facies, karstification, proximity to carbonate margins and faults. The distribution and origin of the dolomite has been attributed to mixing-zone dolomitization (commonly in association with karstic processes), sulphate reduction via organic matter oxidation, and dewatering from the marine mudstones that commonly envelop the carbonate build-up. Dolomite has a variable association with reservoir quality in the region, and when developed as a replacive phase tends to be associated with improved porosity and permeability characteristics. This is particularly the case where it is developed as an early fabric-retentive phase. Cementing dolomite is detrimental to reservoir quality, although the extent of this degradation generally reflects the abundance and distribution of this dolomite. Dolomitization is also inferred to have influenced the distribution of non- hydrocarbon gases. This is best documented in North Sumatra where carbon dioxide occurs in quantities ranging from 0 to 85%. There are a number of possible mechanisms for generating this CO 2 (e.g. mantle degassing), although the most likely source is considered to be the widely dolomitized Eocene Tampur Formation that forms effective basement for much of the basin. High heat flows are suggested to have resulted in the thermogenic decomposition of dolomite with CO 2 produced as a by-product. © The Geological Society of London 2004.",,"dolomite; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; petrogenesis; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; World; Aves; Foraminifera; Raja",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12944331133

Modeled processes include fluid flow, combustion reactions, radiative heat transfer, turbulence, and NOx formation. This model is used to identify the NOx formation mechanisms and to analyse potential NOx control strategies. The model successfully predicts the NOx emission trends. NOx formation is primarily due to N2 from air ingress through the slag door or roof ring gap, flowing into the high temperature regions near the burners. N2 in the oxygen supply is also important. NOx levels correlate with N2 and O 2 levels in the furnace. Reducing N2 and excess O 2 in the furnace is recommended for NOx abatement, Unlike many combustion devices, controlling temperature is not recommended for reducing NOx emissions. Large reductions in NOx emissions are predicted by (in order of importance, from highest to lowest): controlling exhaust flows to limit air ingress, closing the slag door and increasing the purity of the oxygen supply.","CFD; EAF; Modeling; NOx; Pollution control","Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Electric arcs; Electric furnaces; Flow of fluids; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; High temperature effects; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Pollution control; EAF; Modeling; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942506017

Motivated by this, we obtain the exact solution for the vector potential for a wire of finite length and of arbitrary form. Closed form solutions can then be deduced describing the electromagnetic waves propagating from the wire. This allows us to investigate design parameters, so that we may produce spiral wire shapes which, when injected with oscillatory currents, produce effects similar to conventional magnetic mirrors, except at the submicron and nanometre scale. Nanoscale devices present an added complication: very closely placed surfaces can exchange heat through the tunneling of evanescent radiation modes. This can augment, the local heating effect when compared to blackbody emission, so any fabrication defects on the surface of the wire spirals could be problematic. We show that the evanescent contributions scale as a function of separation and dominate the heat exchange process when the spacing is much less than the characteristic wavelength of a given temperature. We expect that excess material might be deposited erroneously during fabrication of the spiral wires, so the transfer of heat from one wire coil to the defect will be higher than the rate due to uniform blackbody radiation. In the case of tungsten, for our typical spiral geometry, the heating rate is enhanced by a factor of 15. In the case of a carbon or other high conductivity composite material this rate can be raised by as much as 106, which is evidently not appropriate.","Evanescent Modes; Magnetic Mirrors; Radiative Heat Transfer; Vector Potential","Charged particles; Electromagnetic waves; Heat transfer; Ions; Parameter estimation; Plasmas; Vectors; Evanescent modes; Magnetic mirrors; Radiative heat transfer; Vector potential; Nanotechnology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244273421

The present state of understanding the mechanism is reviewed for the catalyzed NOx reduction with ammonia or alkanes; reduction with acetaldehyde is also sketched, but will be described in detail in a separate paper. A decisive step is the interaction of two reaction intermediates containing N atoms in different oxidation states. A favorable reaction path uses an organic molecule to reduce part of the NOx to ammonia, this product then reacts with NO + NO2 to give N 2. Isotopic labeling shows that each N2 molecule has one N atom from the NH3 intermediate, the other from NOx. N2 is formed at room temperature, if an 1:1 mixture of NO and NO 2 is in contact with an Fe/MFI catalyst covered with NH3. During NOx reduction with CH4 over Pd/zeolite catalysts, H/D exchange of methane has been observed, indicating that methane is dissociatively adsorbed on Pd0 clusters that are present in the steady-state of surface oxidation and reduction steps. BaNaY catalysts, containing negligible impurities of TM elements, catalyze NOx reduction with acetaldehyde at 200°C. In the prevailing mechanism acetaldehyde is transformed via acetate ions and nitromethane to isocyanic acid, which is hydrolyzed to NH3. Again, N2 is ultimately produced from NH3 and N2O3 via ammonium nitrite. © Published by Elsevier B.V.","Reduction; Transition metal ions; Zeolite-based catalysts","Adsorption; Ammonia; Catalysts; Chemical vapor deposition; Dissociation; Hydrolysis; Oxidation; Oxygen; Paraffins; Reduction; Transition metals; Zeolites; Isocyanic acid; Selective catalytic reduction (SCR); Transition metal ions; Zeolite-based catalysts; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544268827

Air regulations over the past 10 years have driven much of the new recordkeeping requirements. The regulations are typically implemented at the State level through new permitting activities, the MACT implementations and Title V compliance assurance monitoring. The amount of data being collected and archived has been expanding exponentially thus creating a tremendous workload on environmental managers. Some of the workload can be alleviated or better managed by a centralized data acquisition and storage system that is both flexible and easy to use. This is particularly the case when the system simplifies the identification of compliance issues, quickly identifies missing data and can be used across many reporting programs. The various data items originating from sources such as, plant operating systems, Continuous Emission Monitoring systems (CEMs), Parametric Emission Monitoring systems (PEMs), remote devices and other manual entry sources, requires the integration of hardware and software in an innovative and systematic approach. One method at an industrial site uses several data gathering systems and methodologies to ultimately deposit the data to a single commercially available database server, thus providing security, accessibility, expandability and flexibility that is needed to achieve and exceed compliance requirements for record keeping and reporting, without exorbitant costs The purpose of this paper is to describe a data retrieval system that integrates a plant operating environment, and the company data network with a system designed for environmental compliance, which has virtually unlimited expansion and flexibility.",,"Continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS); Environmental recordkeeping; Parametric emission monitoring systems (PEMS); Remote devices; Air pollution; Data acquisition; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Industrial plants; Monitoring; Regulatory compliance; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944368830

These evaluations are in comparison with conventional operation. Simulation results reveal that CCB charging and/or cold oxygen blast lead to low temperature level in the shaft region, which retards the reduction of CCB. On the other hand, injection of waste plastics enriches hydrogen gas in the furnace. And top gas (after CO2 removal) recycling tremendously enhances the concentrations of H2 and CO in the whole furnace, which greatly promote the indirect reduction of sinter in shaft despite lower temperature. Under the innovative operations, the efficiency of blast furnace shows evident improvement, especially in the case with simultaneous injections of treated top gas through shaft and tuyere. The model computations predicted that total heat input decreases while the productivity increases under the operation with top gas recycling. Additionally, top gas recycling and waste plastics injection also contribute to considerably reduce carbon dioxide emission. It is expectable to develop high efficiency blast furnace with improved productivity and lowered environment load through exploiting the processes presented in this study. If scrubbing and fixing of CO2 and manufacturing of process oxygen are commercially available, these innovative processes will possess broad applying potential.","All oxygen blast; Blast furnace; Carbon composite agglomerates; Mathematical model; Simulation; Top gas recycling; Waste plastics injection","Agglomeration; Blast furnace practice; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon monoxide; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Oxygen; Plastics; Recycling; All oxygen blast; Carbon composite agglomerates; Top gas recycling; Waste plastic injection; Blast furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444269680

Two similar intensive livestock production facilities that only differed in manure storage practices were used. One facility used straw cover on the primary cell to reduce odour complaints, whereas the other left the manure storage uncovered. It was shown that the straw cover provided relief in odour emission by an average of 37.8%, but magnified CH4 emissions by an average of 247.2 %. Although a slight increase in N2O levels were observed, the straw cover did not have a statistically significant impact on overall CO2 and N2O emissions. Since CH4 is 21 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, a net negative effect of straw cover in terms of global warming capacity was observed. This reinforces the necessity for alternative approaches to control emissions from manure storages, despite the fact that straw covers might be a convenient and cost-effective practice to reduce odour complaints from communities neighboring livestock facilities. Further testing is being performed to confirm preliminary results presented in this article as well as determination of net annual greenhouse gas flux from similar systems.","Flux hood; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hog production; Intensive livestock production facilities; Lagoons; Odour emissions; Straw cover","Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Odor control; Sewage lagoons; Straw; Flux hood; Greenhouse gas emission; Hog production; Intensive livestock production facilities; Odor emissions; Straw cover; Manures; Greenhouse Gases; Lagoons; Manure; Odor Control; Straw",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044435628

Photonic and electronic band-structure engineering are combined to create a novel Quantum Cascade microcavity laser source. A high-index contrast two-dimensional photonic crystal forms a micro-resonator that provides feedback for laser action and diffracts light vertically from the surface of the semiconductor chip. A top metallic contact is used to form both a conductive path for current injection as well as to provide vertical optical confinement to the active region through a bound surface plasmon state at the metal-semiconductor interface. The device is miniaturized compared to standard Quantum Cascade technology, and the emission properties can in principle be engineered by design of the photonic crystal lattice. The combination of size reduction, vertical emission, and lithographic tailorability of the emission properties enabled by the use of a high-index contrast photonic crystal resonant cavity makes possible a number of active sensing applications in the mid- and far-infrared. In addition, the use of electrical pumping in these devices opens up another dimension of control for fundamental studies of photonic crystal and surface plasmon structures in linear, non-linear, and near-field optics.","Microlasers; Photonic band-gaps; Photonic crystals; Quantum cascade lasers; Vertically emitting lasers","Band structure; Cavity resonators; Crystal lattices; Electric fields; Light polarization; Light transmission; Lithography; Optical resonators; Quantum optics; Semiconductor materials; Microlasers; Photonic band-gaps; Photonic crystals; Quantum cascade (QC) lasers; Vertically emitting lasers; Lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543121759

The endless debate on the most appropriate solution for the Venice safety seems to have recently come to a final conclusion with the official approval of MOSE, an impressive engineering project consisting of 79 mobile barriers planned to close the lagoon inlets during the most severe storms, thus preventing the sea from flooding the city. However, MOSE has still many opponents who do not believe it can work effectively to preserve both the city and the lagoon ecosystem. We present here a new solution which has none of the environmental consequences charged to MOSE and can complement it in duration and safety. This is concerned with the injection of anthropogenic CO2 in a brackish sandy aquifer lying 600-800 m below the lagoon. Based on new recent hydrogeological and geomechanical information of the Northern Adriatic basin, a numerical study is performed with the aid of multiphase flow and geomechanical models showing that a set of vertical injection wells properly located in the lagoon area can uniformly raise Venice up to 12 cm over a 10 year time, with a partial mitigation of most of the high tides that threat the existence of the city. Moreover, CO2 sequestration in a safe geological formation can also contribute to meet the requirements of the 1997 Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed solution appears to be a promising strategy to be investigated with further analyses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051590378

The 2-yr air monitoring program included two interdependent components. One involved sampling PM2.5 and co-pollutants in the personal breathing space and homes of children and elderly volunteers. The other involved sampling PM2.5 and co-pollutants outside of the participants' homes, at a central urban site in Steubenville, OH, and at four remote outdoor sites located at the cardinal compass points around this central site. The mean 24-hr average PM2.5 concentration measured at Steubenville during SCAMP was 3.4 μg/cu m above the annual NAAQS, suggesting that a PM2.5 reduction strategy will likely be required for the city. PM2.5 concentrations exhibited a substantial amount of regional homogeneity in the Steubenville region. The overall average ionic composition of PM2.5 was similar at all five monitoring sites. At Steubenville, sulfate and organic material were the most prevalent components of PM2.5. Ambient concentrations of SO2, CO, and NOx at Steubenville were positively associated ambient concentrations of PM2.5. Increased photochemical activity or atmospheric stagnation likely contributed to summertime episodes of elevated PM2.5 concentrations in the region.

Overall, the system carries out the same job of a conventional combustor, with the fundamental advantage of segregating the oxidation products (CO2 and H 2O) into an output flow free of nitrogen and excess oxygen. The flow exiting the reduction reactor consists of water and CO2, the latter readily available for liquefaction, transport and long-term storage. The hot, vitiated air from the oxidation reactor is the means to produce power through a thermodynamic cycle. This paper reports of a study supported by the ENI group to assess the potential of the integration between CLC and combined gas-steam power cycles. More specifically, we focus on four issues: (i) optimization of plant configuration; (ii) prediction of overall efficiency; (iii) use of commercial gas turbines; (iv) preliminary economic estimates. The CLC system is based on iron oxides which, to maintain their physical characteristics, must operate below 900-1000°C. Given the crucial importance of the temperature of the vitiated air generated by CLC on the performance of the combined cycle, we consider two options: (i) ""unfired"" systems, where natural gas is fed only to the CLC system, (ii) ""fired"" systems, where the vitiated air is supplementary fired to reach gas turbine inlet temperatures ranging 1000-1200°C. Results show that unfired configurations with maximum process temperature 850-1050°C and zero emissions reach net LHV plant efficiencies ranging 43-48%. Fired cycles where temperature is raised from 850 to 1200°C by supplementary firing can achieve 52% net LHV efficiency with CO2 emission about one half of those of a state-of-the-art combined cycles. Fired configurations allow significant capital cost and fuel cost savings compared to unfired configurations; however, a carbon tax high enough to make them attractive (close to 50 €/ton) would undermine these advantages.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Liquefaction; MOS devices; Oxidation; Thermodynamic properties; Chemical-looping combustion (CLC); Endothermic reaction; Oxidation reactor; Reduction reactor; Fluidized bed combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244243779

Technologies for capturing CO2 from major stationary sources (power stations, industrial plants, etc) and storing that CO2 for long periods of time is one of few near term options for decreasing CO2 emissions. This transition to low carbon intensity energy and possibly the hydrogen economy through renewables and in the long-term technological developments such as artificial photosynthesis. Capture of CO2 from post combustion emissions can be done using a range of technologies though costs are currently high and dependent on the concentration of CO2 in the emissions. Techniques include solvents, pressure swing adsorption and the use of membranes. Options for decreasing capture costs by increasing the concentration of CO2 in the emission stream include the use of oxyfuels (in pulverized fuel types boilers) and by moving to integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) operations either simply for power generation or for poly-generation opportunities. Once the CO2 has been captured it can be stored using a variety of methods. Storage in the ocean has been suggested but is considered an unlikely option because of environmental uncertainties and political opposition. Mineral storage is a niche opportunity. The greatest potential lies in geological storage of CO 2 and this option is commanding increased attention from the Australian and international community. In Australia, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) is an important new initiative that will support energy companies and energy intensive industries in meeting challenges posed by greenhouse gas issues and assist them in their efforts to reduce their emissions profile.

SABER sounds the MLTI (the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere/Ionosphere) region of the earth's atmosphere by measuring infrared limb emission. The instrument measures accurate values of atmospheric limb radiance that are ground processed to retrieve temperature, ozone, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and key parameters describing the energetics of the high atmosphere. SABER results are being used to study the chemistry and dynamics of the mesosphere and the effects on the atmosphere due to major solar storm events. The temperature data from SABER measurements is plotted against temperature measurements collected from several ground based instruments for the purpose of verifying the SABER data. These ground based instruments are located all over the world, including e.g. Boulder, Colorado; Mauna Loa, Hawaii; and parts of Russia. The ground based instruments used for validation of SABER temperatures have already undergone scrutiny and error analyses, and are used as a benchmark to validate data collected from SABER. Furthermore, nitric oxide measurements collected during a period of heightened solar activity is used to create global plots to illustrate the changing atmosphere as the Sun's radiation interacts with the Earth's atmosphere.

Heat recovery and up-grade using industrial heat pumps offers an outstanding way for achieving remarkable results. The most common electric driven compression heat pumps represent in this context a reasonable choice where power is produced by environmentally friendly means and where the already existing peak demand does not affect the power plant network. Nonetheless, the issue of ozone-depleting and greenhouse-enhancing refrigerants has not been solved yet. Heat pump devices based on absorption technology represent a valid alternative, using waste heat as driving force and natural refrigerants like water or ammonia as working fluids. The thermodynamic principles of absorption heat pumps are presented along with a review of the basic working schemes for heat pumps, cooling machines and heat transformers. Advanced absorption cycles like double effect and double lift, which allow for higher efficiency or higher temperature up-grades, are presented. These cycles can be sometimes economically more advantageous than basic cycles or permit the heat recovery in out-of-range cases for basic devices. Finally, possible implementation schemes in pulp and paper processes are illustrated.","Absorption; Ammonia; District heating; Heat pump; Heat recovery; Heat transformer; Kraft process; Lithium bromide; Trigeneration","Absorption heat pump (AHP); Coefficient of performance (COP); Heat transformers; Lithium bromide; Trigeneration; Absorption; Ammonia; District heating; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Heat pump systems; Heat transfer; Kraft process; Refrigerants; Waste heat utilization; Paper and pulp industry; Absorption; Greenhouse Effect; Heat Transfer; Paper Industry; Refrigerants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862364402

On the contrary, the analysis and study of other life stages and environmental aspects appear to be more complicated and slower. The most recent international assessment and eco-design tools of building sustainability use a Life Cycle Approach (LCA): from raw materials acquirement, to product manufacture, delivery, construction, installation and assembly into work, use, disassembly, disposal, recycling or reuse. Starting from the analysis of environmental effects (air, soil and water emissions, waste production, energy consumptions, etc) impacts and damages caused by the adoption of particular materials, techniques and typologies - but also by building production and management processes- can be calculated. The work focuses on the environmental analysis of some building techniques which are commonly used in residential buildings. The paper will show the developed methodology of sustainable assessment, which includes a LCA of building elements by taking into account likely functional quality through time (durability). Environmental damage categories are distinguished by: damages to human health, ecosystem quality and resources depletion. Such a methodology can be used for: eco-design, rehabilitation and renewal of building heritage, environmental integration of urban building codes.","Architecture technology; Building durability; Construction elements; LCA; Materials and components",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644256160

The measurement approach and instrument specifications were determined through an analysis of existing carbon cycle data and a series of observing system simulation experiments. During its 2-year mission, OCO will fly in a 1:15 PM sun-synchronous orbit with a 16-day ground-track repeat time, just ahead of the EOS Aqua platform. It will carry a single instrument that incorporates three bore-sighted high-resolution spectrometers designed to measure reflected sunlight in the 0.76-μm O 2 A-band and in the CO 2 bands at 1.61 and 2.06 μm. Soundings recorded in these three bands will be used to retrieve the column-averaged CO 2 dry air mole fraction (X CO2 ). A comprehensive validation program was included in the mission to ensure that the space-based X CO2 measurements have precisions of ∼0.3% (1 ppm) on regional scales. OCO measurements will be used in global synthesis inversion and data assimilation models to quantify CO 2 sources and sinks. While OCO will have a nominal lifetime of only 2 years, it will serve as a pathfinder for future long-term CO 2 monitoring missions. © 2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The key concept in this approach is swarm behavior. By applying the three properties of the swarm behavior: separation, cohesion and alignment, our approach can ensure the agent group attains dynamically stable ad-hoc connectivity and fast target convergence. Using a grid map to represent the unknown environment, an ad-hoc network for wireless communication and our biasing expansion algorithm for path planning, each agent simultaneously considers all concentration values collected by other swarm members and determines the positive gradient direction of the whole coverage area of the swarm. This will make the swarm immune to the random sensor errors, local aerosol accumulations and other local interference effects during their search.

Based on 30 relevés of 16 m2 that include vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens, two new associations could be described belonging to the class Loiseleurio-Vaccinietea (order Rhododendro-Vaccinietalia): Rubo-Empetretum nigri and Carici-Empetretum nigri. The wind-sheltered Rubo-Empetretum nigri (alliance Phyllodoco-Vaccinion) mainly occurs in the lowlands on level terrain or sloping sites at lower foot slopes of mountains on deeper, mesic soil; this association is the zonal vegetation of the lowlands. Boreal, widespread and amphi-Beringian species are prominent in the distribution-type spectrum of the vascular plants. Two variants of Rubo-Empetretum nigri are described. A Geranium erianthum variant occurs on south-facing slopes and is rich in vascular plants species. A Plagiothecium undulatum variant is restricted to northern exposures and is rich in bryophytes and lichens. A Carici-Empetretum nigri (alliance Loiseleurio-Diapension) occurs on shallow soil on wind exposed sites at higher elevations in the mountains. It is very rich in lichen species of arctic-alpine distribution. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggests that altitude, nutrient content of the soil and exposition are the most important differential ecological factors. Soil depth, total carbon and nitrogen content, plant available phosphorus and all other measured cation contents are higher in Rubo-Empetretum than in Carici-Empetretum. Literature comparisons confirm the occurrence of both associations in other areas on the Southwest Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. Presumably both associations have an amphi-Beringian distribution.

The Australian State and federal governments have agreed to provide sufficient river flows to maintain and, in some cases, restore aquatic ecological health. In recent times the governments have also agreed to triple forestry plantings for commercial timbers, and are currently considering policies that will lead to additional tree plantings for greenhouse mitigation and dryland salinity control. Each of these policies has been developed independently and for laudable reasons, but their combined effect on river flows has not previously been estimated. In this paper we model the likely flow effects of these policies in the Macquarie River in central NSW in the light of climate change due to global warming. The results are presented in terms of their effects on security of supply to the irrigated cotton industry and for environmental flows in the downstream part of the catchment. For example, for a 10% increase in the area planted to trees in the upper catchment, a 25% reduction in streamflow is predicted, with further reductions of up to 10% from global warming.

Thus, a great deal of R&amp;D effort has been focused on reducing emissions of these compounds. Different ways were proposed for the formation and the oxidation of the first aromatic compounds, involving the reactions of C2 (acetylene), C3 or C4 unsaturated species. As the determinant role of propargyl radicals in forming benzene, the first aromatic ring, is now well accepted, it is important to well understand their reactions. In that purpose, the oxidation of propadiene and propyne have been already studied in several oxidation conditions as shock tubes, jet-stirred reactor, flow reactor and premixed H2 and C2H2 flames doped with propadiene. The structure of a premixed CH4/O2/Ar flame containing propadiene was studied. The premixed laminar flame structure under low pressure (50 torr) was examined. The apparatus allowed to make a flat flame with one-dimensional structure. The profiles of stable species presented here were obtained with a propadiene, methane, oxygen and argon flame with an equivalent ratio of 1.23.

GICC Puertollano, Carretera de Calzada de Calatrava a Puertollano, Puertollano, Ciudad Real, Spain","The ELCOGAS power plant in Puertollano (Spain), with 335 MWe (ISO conditions), is an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant built to demonstrate both the technical and economic feasibility of this alternative for clean generation of electricity from coal. IGCC technology is based on a coal gasification process, namely the conversion of coal into combustible gas, which is then subjected to an exhaustive cleaning process. The result is a synthetic gas, virtually free of pollutants that can be burned with a high efficiency in a combinedcycle electricity-generating unit. Basically, the ELCOGAS plant consists of three islands jointly designed and integrated into the process: gasification island, air separation island and combined cycle island. In the gasification island, the gas from the gasifier is cleaned (dedusted and washed) and desulphurised before being sent to the combined cycle island. The washing system consists of a Venturi scrubber with a separator where halogens and alkalis (NH 3, HCl, HF) are removed from the previously dedusted gas by means of the wash water. The halogens and alkalis removed are then stripped from the wash water as stripped gas, which is a sour gas. The coal-gas coming from the separator proceeds to sulphur removal in a MDEA system and then, the clean gas (mainly CO, H 2) is sent to the combined cycle plant. As COS is a significant part of the sulphur containing gases in the coalgas, hydrolysis of the COS to H 2S takes place before the desulphurisation stage, since MDEA is a selective amine for H 2S. There are many important areas related to materials corrosion within the gas cleaning system. In the ELCOGAS plant carbon steels, austenitic stainless steels and nickel based alloys, such as AISI 316Ti, AISI 904L and Hastelloy C276, are used in the Venturi, the water separator and the strippers. AISI 316Ti is used for the gas piping from the separator to the COS hydrolysis system. Laboratory tests to evaluate the resistance of these materials to generalised and localised corrosion, in simulated sour environments (containing chlorides, fluorides, sulphides, formates, etc.. and acid gas formed by H 2S and CO 2) and reproducing power plant conditions have been carried out at CIEMAT. Alloys tested were the in-service alloys and other materials considered as alternative to the existing ones: duplex stainless steel UR52N +, and nickel-based alloys A59 and 625. Tests were performed at 140°C using non-welded and welded flat specimens exposed to gas phase, interface and liquid phase. In addition, stress corrosion cracking tests using AISI 316Ti Cring specimens were performed. Nickel based alloys had the lowest corrosion rates and in all materials the corrosion resistance was better in the specimens located at the gaseous phase, the interface specimens having the poorest behaviour.","Coal gas; Corrosion resistant alloys; Gasification environment; Sour gas corrosion; Steels","Acid gas; Air separation; Clean gas; Cleaning process; Combined cycle; Combined cycle plant; Combustible gas; Corrosion behaviour; COS hydrolysis; Duplex stainless steel; Economic feasibilities; Flat specimen; Gas cleaning systems; Gas corrosion; Gas environment; Gaseous phase; Gasification process; Gasifiers; Gasphase; Hastelloy C-276; IGCC technology; Integrated gasification combined cycle plants; Laboratory test; Liquid Phase; Localised corrosion; Nickel based alloy; Sour environment; Synthetic gas; Venturi; Venturi scrubber; Wash water; Washing systems; Water separators; Austenitic stainless steel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon steel; Chlorine compounds; Coal; Coal gas; Coal gasification; Combined cycle power plants; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Desulfurization; Electric generators; Fluorine compounds; Fossil fuel power plants; Hydrolysis; Nickel; Separators; Sour gas; Steel; Stress corrosion cracking; Sulfur; Welding; Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867256152

The specific characteristics of UWB, such as ranging capability and severe power limitations, call however for innovative solutions not only at the physical layer, but also at MAC and network layers as well. In this paper an integrated strategy for MAC and routing in UWB networks is proposed, which combines the multiple access capabilities and the ranging information provided by this transmission technique. The strategy exploits the distance information for reducing the power emission in the network, leading to a longer network lifetime and low Multi User Interference (MUI), thanks to the combination of a distance-based routing metric with a location-aware routing protocol, enabled by the adoption of a distributed positioning protocol.

Method: Questionnaire responses were obtained from 2,208 employees of a large national retail chain in 21 different locations. Results: After controlling for demographic variables, three factors: environmental conditions, safety-related policies and programs, and general organizational climate, accounted for 55% of the variance in perceived safety climate. Interestingly, organizational climate made a significant contribution to safety climate, even after controlling for the other more safety-relevant variables. Partial correlations showed that safety policies and programs had the largest observed correlation with safety climate, followed by two of the dimensions of organizational climate (communication and organizational support). Using Baron and Kenny's (J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 51 (1986) 1173) procedures, the principal effects of the various work situation factors on perceived safety at work were found to be direct rather than mediated by safety climate. Safety climate influenced perceived safety at work, but its role as a mediator was limited. Impact on industry: These results are discussed in terms of other recent findings on safety climate and the growing interest in understanding management and organizational factors in the context of workplace safety. © 2004 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Results of over two years of continuous operation in five biotrickling filters are discussed. The biotrickling filters were usually operated at a gas contact time of 1.6 to 2.2 seconds (nominal gas contact time) or up to 10 seconds during specific experiments with various effects on odor removal. In all cases outlet concentrations of sulfur compounds (calculated as H 2S) were well below the emissions permit limits (24 h average of 1 ppm) while total odor exhaust concentrations depended on the particular biotrickling filter. The biotrickling filters were resilient to temporary changes in inlet gas composition, including a highly-fluctuated hydrogen sulfide concentration. Overall, the study results indicate that there is a significant benefit in converting chemical scrubbers to biotrickling filters for odor control. Improvement of the odor removal performance should focus on the treatment of residual total odor which, in many but not all cases, is believed to originate from trace reduced sulfur and organic compounds.","Biotrickling filters; Odor control; Wastewater treatment","Biotrickling filters; Centrifugal blowers; Ferric chlorides; Scrubber towers; Ammonia; Biofilters; Composition; Hydrogen sulfide; Iron compounds; Microorganisms; Odor control; Scrubbers; Wastewater treatment; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944372646

This is the case because of the advancement of science, because of user demand and because of the central role played by climate prediction in guiding adaptation policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This article reviews three key questions: (1) Why might we (not) need probabilities of climate change? (2) What are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) How are researchers estimating probabilities? These questions are analysed within the context of adaptation to climate change. Overall, we conclude that the jury is still out on whether probabilities are useful for climate adaptation policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals and motivation of the policy analysis, the unit of analysis, timescale and the training of the analyst. Probability assessment in the context of climate change is always subjective, conditional and provisional. There are various problems in estimating the probability of future climate change, but reflexive human behaviour (i.e. actions explicitly influenced by information) is largely intractable in the context of prediction. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope to develop novel methodologies that combine conditional probabilities with scenarios and which are relevant for climate decision-making. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate policy; Prediction; Probabilities; Scenarios; Uncertainty","climate change; environmental policy; future prospect; policy making; probability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644438513

The Great Lakes Regional Air Toxic Emission Inventory project has developed a multijurisdictional inventory of 213 substances from 699 source categories including point, area, and mobile sources of toxic air emissions that have the potential to impact environmental quality in the Great Lakes Basin. Evaluating which of these substances and source categories have the greatest impacts on human and natural systems is a challenge. Some prior ranking efforts have not adequately accounted for both the actual or estimated emission of a chemical and its potential threat. Others have not evaluated impacts through all exposure routes or taken account of the multi-media nature of many of these contaminants. In order to achieve a better understanding of which toxic air emissions are the most harmful to human and ecological health within the Great Lakes basin, there is a need for an evaluation method that incorporates the mass of substances emitted and their physio-chemical and toxicological properties. This paper will evaluate several possible methods for prioritizing air toxics and their sources in the Great Lakes region for emission reduction efforts. Among these are the U.S. EPA's Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical Impacts (TRACI) and the Universal System for Evaluating Substances (USES). We will apply these evaluation methods to the Great Lakes Regional Air Toxics Emissions Inventory and present the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, implications of the findings and recommendations for improvements.",,"Air emission regulation; Hazardous air pollutants (HAP); Persistent bioaccumulative toxics (PBT); Toxic emissions; Gas emissions; Health risks; Lakes; Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Toxic materials; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21044433132

On the arable field, 2 dm high ridges, drawn as seed-beds for potato, were exposed to mild, partly diurnal freezing-thawing. Substantially elevated N2O emission rates (6-750 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1) were observed throughout the investigation period which coincided with freezing-thawing events in the surface soil (0-5 cm). Soil temperatures in the densely vegetated fallow were more isothermal due to an insulating snow/ice cover, resulting in much lower N2O emission rates (0-57 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1). CH4 uptake rates were low in both habitats during soil frost (+2 to -7.5 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1) but increased markedly in the fallow after spring thaw. Our data suggest that N2O emission peaks may occur recurrently throughout the winter when soils are subjected to diurnal surface thawing. We concluded that microclimatic conditions strongly control N2O winter loss, thus overriding ecosystem-level differences in off-season nutrient cycling. To further characterize winter-time nutrient cycling and habitat functioning in our sites, we determined NO3 - and NH4+ contents, fumigation-extractable carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) and enumerated protozoa and nematoda throughout the investigation period. Cmic and microbial C:N ratios in the fallow were higher in winter than during the rest of the year as indicated by a 2-year study, reflecting favorable conditions for microbial C assimilation at low temperatures in the absence of freeze-thaw perturbation. In the arable soil, Cmic contents were significantly reduced during soil freezing but recovered quickly upon warming of the soil. Dynamics of C mic in the arable soil were paralleled by protozoan biomass and transient shifts in functional composition of the nematode community, indicating that microfaunal predation played an important role in nutrient cycling after freeze-thaw perturbation. Only minor microfaunal dynamics were observed in the climatically more stable fallow, essentially confirming the absence of perturbation at this site. Our findings provide strong evidence that overwinter N2O formation is regulated by both the physical freeze-thaw susceptibility of the soil and the ecological functioning of the habitat. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","CH4; Denitrification; Microbial biomass; N2O; Nematodes; Nitrogen cycling; Protozoa","agroecology; greenhouse gas; nutrient cycling; winter; Central Europe; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; World; Nematoda; Protozoa; Solanum tuberosum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21744458096

The effect of low temperature on the balance of N2O reduction vs. production ranged from no effect at all to a severe inhibition of N2O reduction activity at low N-oxide concentrations. This illustrates that indigenous soil denitrifying communities exert a crucial control on the relative amount of N2O produced under denitrifying conditions often encountered during the cold season.

There may be major changes in climate, especially temperature and precipitation, that will affect the growth and ecology of trees and forests: there will be substantial effects on the growth and ecology of trees and forests as a result of the direct effects of CO2 on the physiology of trees. To a considerable extent the consequences of an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration on climate are speculative, whereas many of the direct effects of an increase in CO2 concentration on the physiology and growth of plants have been established through experimentation and are quite well known and understood. There are several reasons for showing active concern about the consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration for trees and forests: to enhance knowledge, at a fundamental level, about the functioning of woodlands and forests; to assess the likely impact on their ecology, productivity and value; and to anticipate any significant downstream, socio-economic consequences. The consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration may be assessed at a range of temporal and spatial scales: from seconds to centuries, from cell to region. Biological information about the effects of CO2 on plants is generally available at short time scales and small spatial scales, whereas ecological and socio-economic concern is largely expressed with respect to the much larger scales of the stand and the forest over tens or hundreds of years. There are major problems with the data currently available. The environmental conditions pertaining in the majority of the experiments (e.g. soil type, temperature) differ significantly from forest conditions throughout the boreal and temperate regions. Secondly, the use of juvenile trees in growth cabinets and rooms makes extrapolation to the field situation difficult. Finally, the use to pot-grown plants with a limited soil volume, and all the problems of nutrient depletion that this entails, imposes severe constraints on the interpretations of changes in plant nutrient contents, assimilation rates and growth. Photosynthesis and Stomatal Action: The primary role of CO2 as a substrate for photosynthesis is well understood and there are no reasons to suppose that effects of CO2 concentration on the primary carboxylation are any different in trees from other plants with the C3 pathway. However, the role of CO2 as an effective activator and regulator of rubisco is only currently being unravelled. In general, photosynthesis increases substantially, but less than proportionately (up to 75%), in response to a doubling in ambient CO2 concentration, but a lack of response, or even a reduction in rate of photosynthesis, has been observed. There is increasing evidence that maintenance of active sinks for assimilate is necessary for the effective stimulation of photosynthesis by an increase in CO2 concentration. Constrained rooting of pot-grown trees and the lack of alternative sinks as a result of determinate growth, may be the reason why a strong, positive response has not always been seen and why the assimilation rate declines with time in many of the experiments. Closure of stomata in response to stress may also negate the increase from CO2 fertilization. When plants are grown for extended periods in elevated CO2 so that they may become acclimated, the increase in rate of photosynthesis is less than in short-term experiments. Analysis of A/Ci response functions indicates that this may result from a reduction in the activity of rubisco, although it is not clear whether the amount or the activation state of the enzyme is reduced, or from Pi limitation. Stomatal conductance generally declines with an increase in CO2 concentration to between 0 to 70% of the control. There is considerable variation in response and in some trees, particularly conifers, stomatal conductance is rather unresponsive to changes in ambient CO2 concentration. The lack of a mechanistic understanding of the role of CO2 in stomatal action prevents explanation at present. There is some evidence that a reduction in the number of stomata per unit area or per unit epidermal cell may also contribute to the reduction in stomatal conductance of plants grown at high CO2 concentrations, but both increases and decreases have been observed in trees. It is not clear whether these changes are the result of acclimation of developmental processes, ecological selection or genetic adaptation. There may be other presently unknown effects of CO2 concentration on growth processes at the cellular level. In particular, the effects of CO2 concentration on leaf growth may not be explicable solely in terms of substrate supply and there may be effects of CO2 on leaf initiation, development and expansion in other ways. Tree Growth: Growth of seedlings and young trees of both broadleaves and conifers is increased by a doubling of the ambient CO2 concentration. The observed magnitude of the response ranges from 20 to 120% with a median of ca 40%. Both root and shoot growth are increased. Young trees grow faster in high CO2 but normal ontogenetic processes occur. In general, the experiments suffer from a number of inadequacies and this may explain the variability of response. In particular nearly all the experiments have been short-term (less than 12 months) on very young trees, that are often pot-bound and with growth restricted by lack of sinks and in a nutrient-deficient condition. Very low relative growth rates indicate far from good growth conditions. Increases in growth in response to increase in CO2 concentration occur in stress conditions and can ameliorate to a large extent the influence of stresses (water, nutrient, low light) on growth. Nutrient deficiency enhances biomass partitioning to the roots, whereas with free nutrient supply, an increase in CO2 concentration leads to a relative enhancement of leaf growth. Acclimation to nutrient depletion, evident as increased nutrient use efficiency, may occur but its extent and long-term significance remains uncertain. Enhanced fine-root mass and increased mycorrhizal infection may be significant in this respect, in addition to changes in root uptake processes. The combination of enhanced assimilation and reduced stomatal condutance at elevated CO2 leads to an increase in water use efficiency at the leaf and seedling scales in controlled environments, but it is not known whether this occurs at the stand scale in the field. Because trees are perennial, a small increase in relative growth rate of 0.1% per day, at the prevailing low growth rates in many of the experiments, should lead to a large difference in individual tree size after a number of years. Whether CO2 fertilization will have this effect is however, uncertain. A major gap in our knowledge is related to the influence of elevated CO2 levels on yield quality (wood density, knottiness, etc.). Stand Processes and Production: The experimental approach is not practical with older trees, stands and forests. The effects of CO2 on assimilation, water use and other processes at the stand or larger scales, can only be assessed through models. Models of stand processes in relation to a doubling of CO2 concentration, taking into account acclimation to CO2 at the leaf scale, indicate a substantial increase in stand CO2-assimilation and in water use efficiency. However, the information available to parameterize such models may not be appropriate because it has been derived from seedlings that were only partially acclimated. Experimentation on mature trees is technically feasible but logistically and financially difficult. A more feasible approach available may be to use portions of mature trees, such as branches, in large cuvettes to obtain data required for the parameterization of stand-scale models that are used to make predictions of the likely consequences of the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration for stand functioning. Micro-meteorological changes within the cuvettes and changes in feedback loops between the enclosed portion and the atmosphere, must, of course, be taken into account as well as the physiological consequences of treating only part of the plant. Such models require to be carefully tested at the present CO2 concentration and in relation to other environmental variables, since they cannot be tested in a doubled CO2 environment in forests. Changes in tree canopy structure may also influence canopy functioning as well as understorey species composition and growth: changes in the pattern of branching and in internode length, as a result of enhanced CO2 concentrations, have been observed, for example. However, models that include feedbacks such as interactions between CO2 and crown structure, growth and respiration of trees, or leaf composition and rates of litter decomposition, are not presently available. Whether changes in harvest index and wood quality will ensue at the stand scale cannot be predicted at present.

Because soil microbes depend on plant-derived C and are often associated with specific plant species, elevated CO2 has the potential to alter structure and functioning of soil microbial communities. We investigated soil microbial community structure of a species-rich semi-natural calcareous grassland that had been exposed to elevated CO2 (600 μL L-1) for 6 growing seasons. We analysed microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and DNA fingerprints obtained by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA fragments amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PLFA profiles were not affected by CO2 enrichment and the ratio of fungal and bacterial PLFA did not change. Ordination analysis of DNA fingerprints revealed a significant relation between CO 2 enrichment and variation in DNA fingerprints in summer (P = 0.01), but not in spring. This variation was due to changes in low-intensity bands, while dominant bands did not differ between CO2 treatments. Diversity of the bacterial community, as assessed by number of bands in DNA fingerprints and calculation of Shannon diversity indices, was not affected by elevated CO2. Overall, only minor effects on microbial community structure were detected, corroborating earlier findings that soil carbon inputs did probably change much less than suggested by plant photosynthetic responses. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","16S rDNA; DGGE; Elevated CO2; Grassland; PLFA; Soil microbial community","carbon dioxide enrichment; community structure; grassland; microbial community; plant community; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18644365205

Two primary causes for the breakdown of RECLAIM are apparent. On the one hand, RECLAIM did not succeed because of a series of unpredictable events that included manipulation of the market by brokers and the California energy shortage. On the other hand, several potentially foreseeable program design flaws contributed to the failure. This study examines the structure of RECLAIM and concludes that there was sufficient resilience to endure the two unexpected crises. However, the problematic program design features created a market that was fatally flawed and, regardless of impinging circumstances, was ultimately bound to collapse. We also investigate the status of the rapidly developing international greenhouse gas market and identify several lessons from the RECLAIM experience: the need for a holistic approach to market design that includes the role of a bank, the interface with project-based credits, the similarities of the industries enrolled in the program, and need to carefully consider how to handle the problems caused by the end of the trading period. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change policy; Emission trading; Environmental markets; Kyoto mechanisms; Pollution credits","economic instrument; emissions trading; Kyoto Protocol; market conditions; California; Los Angeles; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644443285

Allowances not used in the year for which they are allocated can be carried over or banked for future use by the original owner or by any party to whom the banked allowance is sold. Allowances are allocated to owners of affected units free of charge for the next thirty years, generally in proportion to each unit's average annual heat input during the three-year baseline period, 1985-87. A small percentage (2.8 percent) of the allowances allocated to affected units are withheld for sale through an annual auction conducted by the EPA to encourage trading and to ensure the availability of allowances for new generating units. The revenues from this auction are returned on a pro rata basis to the owners from whose allocations the allowances were withheld. The U.S. SO2 cap-and-trade programme was established as a result of the enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (1990 CAAA) under the authority granted by Title IV, which included several measures to reduce precursor emissions of acid deposition.2 The SO2 component consisted of a two-phase, cap-and-trade programme for reducing SO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning power plants located in the continental forty-eight states of the United States. During Phase I, lasting from 1995 through 1999, electric generating units larger than 100 MWe in generating capacity with an annual average emission rate in 1985 greater than 2.5 pounds of SO2 per million Btu of heat input in 1985 (hereafter, #SO2/mmBtu) were required to reduce emissions to a level that would be, on average, no greater than 2.5 #SO2/mmBtu. In Phase II, beginning in 2000 and continuing indefinitely, the programme was expanded to include fossil-fuel electricity generating units greater than 25 MWe, or virtually all fossil-fuel power plants in the United States. Emissions from these affected units are limited, after accounting for any allowances banked from Phase I, to an annual cap of 8.9 million tons, or about half of total electric utility SO2 emissions in the early 1980s. The Phase II cap is equivalent to an average emission rate of 1.2 #SO2/mmBtu, when divided by the mid-1980s level of heat input at fossil-fuel burning power plants. The SO2 cap-and-trade programme also contained several provisions that allowed generating units not subject to the cap until Phase II to opt-in to Phase I and to receive allowances for the year in which the unit participated. These units were then subject to the same compliance requirements as the 263 units that were mandated to be part of Phase I, namely, that they must surrender allowances equal to emissions in that year. Also, SO2-emitting industrial sources not otherwise affected by Title IV could establish baselines and be allocated allowances and participate like any other unit in Phases I and II. © OECD 2004.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917521533

U.S. EPA required states to submit their proposed PM 2.5 attainment designations to the agency by February 2004 with the EPA intent on making all attainment designations by December 2004. EPA is also requiring states to submit their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for attaining the PM 2.5 NAAQS by December 2007 with attainment dates of between 2009 and 2014. In December 2003, EPA issued a notice with the proposed Intestate Air Quality Rule (IAQR) to address the PM 2.5 and ozone nonattainment problem and the regional haze problem. The proposed IAQR would require a 65% reduction from 2001 SO 2 Allowances for electric utility Affected Units in 29 states to a total of 2.7 million tons per year by 2015. It would also require a reduction in NO x Allowances for these same Affected Units to 1.3 million tons per year also by 2015. Interim emission reductions would be required by 2010.

Maximum reliance is placed on self-regulating agro-ecosystems, locally or farm-derived renewable resources and the management of ecological and biological processes and interactions. Dependence on external inputs, whether chemical or organic, is reduced as far as possible. Market demand for organic products has expanded rapidly over the past decade. This is maybe the highest quality of organic production systems, that will in the future benefit to everybody on earth. Organic farming encompasses a concept of a more sustainable approach to agricultural production. Organic farming is a way to protect the environment. In organic agriculture, the restricted use of mineral fertilizers reduces the use of non- renewable energy (fossil fuels) and reduces the emissions of agricultural greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, nitrous dioxide and methane). Moreover, mixed farming and soil building allow for increased biological activity by providing support for micro-organisms, earthworms, fungi and bacteria. It is concluded that the benefits of the basic standards are primarily related to environmentally friendly production and to the animal welfare issue while the issues of animal health and product quality are more influenced by the specific farm management than by the production method. In summary, the basic standards of organic farming provide suitable tools to minimize environmental pollution and nutrient losses on the farm level. These seem to be more effective than measures in conventional production. However, there is a high variability within organic farms in relation to their efforts and their nutrient efficiency.","Environment; Organic agriculture; Organic livestock; Organic standards","environmental impact; fertilizer application; organic farming; pollution incidence; standard (reference); Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Pheretima sieboldi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144225590

We measured organic C stored in southern Idaho soils having long-term cropping histories that supported native sagebrush vegetation (NSB), irrigated mold-board plowed crops (IMP), irrigated conservation-chisel-tilled crops (ICT), and irrigated pasture systems (IP). The CO2 emitted as a result of fertilizer production, farm operations, and CO2 lost via dissolved carbonate in irrigation water, over a 30-year period, was estimated and used to calculate net C fixation. Organic C in ecosystems decreased in the order IP&gt;ICT&gt;IMP&gt; NSB. In February 2001, active fungal, bacterial, and microbial biomass was greater in IP soils than all other soils. Active fungal, bacterial, and microbial biomass was least in ICT soils at the 15-30-cm depth than all other soils. In August 2001, active bacterial biomass was greater in IMP soils than IP, ICT, and NSB soils. Active fungal biomass was greater in IP soils than all other soils. Whole-soil fatty acid profiles differed among management regimes and sampling dates and, to a lesser extent, with soil depth. FAME profiles from the NSB soils were distinct from the agricultural treatments and contained greater amounts of total fatty acids than the other treatments. The IMP and ICT soils yielded fatty acid profiles that were similar to each other, although those at the 15-30-cm depth were distinct from all other treatment-depth combinations. The IP FAME profiles suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are more common in these soils than soils from the other treatments. Differences in carbon substrate utilization patterns (BIOLOG) among treatments were more variable and less pronounced that FAME results.

This paper reports on the progress which has been made towards validating the predictions of the climate forcing associated with air pollutants. Measurements have been taken over the last three years with a new technique which was developed to measure the greenhouse radiative fluxes from greenhouse gases beneath clouds. These measurements are valuable since there are large spatial and temporal variations in some gases which make it difficult to quantify their climate forcing. As a result of the poor state of knowledge of the radiative forcing associated with prime constituents of smog such as nitric acid or PAN are omitted in the Kyoto protocol for the reduction of greenhouse gases. In our technique, measurements of the surface radiative forcing from the gases below the cloud are taken against the cold black body background of the cloudy sky. Radiative fluxes from ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric acid and aerosols have been measured. This technique may have applications to battlefield remote sensing of gases. Our measurements have been made at 44N over all four seasons. In order to further decrease the uncertainty of the tropospheric forcing, many more measurements need to be made at different latitudes and climates.","Climate change; Climate models; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing","Air pollutants; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Radiative forcing; Air pollution; Climate change; Clouds; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Heat flux; Heat radiation; Nitric acid; Remote sensing; Infrared radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16644366187

Ocean Drilling Program Leg 189 (in the gateway), together with other geoscience information, has increased our understanding of the Late Cretaceous and younger tectonic and depositional history of the region. From the mid-Cretaceous until the latest Eocene, Australia and Antarctica faced each other across an ever-widening Australo-Australian Gulf, terminated to the east by a Tasmanian land bridge (Tasmania and South Tasman Rise [STR]). Siliciclastic sediments poured into the rifts from Antarctica, Australia and parts of the land bridge, forming deltas in a low-oxygen environment. Sedimentation kept up with subsidence, except on oceanic crust in the spreading Tasman Sea. Until the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (~55 Ma), Australia moved northwestward from Antarctica along a fracture west of the land bridge. Thereafter, Australia-Antarctic motion changed to N-S along the Tasman Fracture Zone west of STR, and an oceanic basin opened south of eastern STR. In the middle Eocene (~43 Ma), spreading rates increased between Australia and Antarctica, and Tasman Sea spreading ceased. By the latest Eocene, the STR had subsided until parts of it were current swept, and winnowing reduced sedimentation rates. Rapid subsidence marked the final (earliest Oligocene) separation of STR and Antarctica. In the Pacific Ocean (STR and East Tasman Plateau), strong currents eroded the shelves and opening straits, and a latest Eocene to early Oligocene hiatus was followed by deposition of bathyal carbonate oozes. The Indian Ocean was different. Along the southern margin of mainland Australia the siliciclastic-carbonate transition came largely in the late Eocene and early Oligocene. The west Tasmanian margin ODP site had gradual increases in carbonate content through the Oligocene. In nearby areas of Antarctica, nonmarine and shelfal siliciclastic sedimentation gave way to glacigene detrital or diatomaceous sedimentation at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77249127827

In South Asia, these vehicles account for about 60% of the motor vehicle fleet and contribute significantly to air pollution, resulting in adverse health effects, particularly for urban dwellers. They are a major contributor to particulate matter (PM) and hydrocarbon emissions, besides visible smoke. PM emissions from a typical 2-stroke engine used in South Asia are an order of magnitude higher compared to a 4-stroke engine of equivalent size. Poor vehicle maintenance, misuse of lubricants, and adulteration of gasoline exacerbate emissions from these vehicles. Emissions from existing 2-stroke gasoline engines can be reduced by using the correct type and quantity of lubricant, improving vehicle maintenance, and improving the quality of gasoline. For new vehicles, emissions can be reduced by redesigning 2-stroke engines to decrease scavenging losses, and installing catalytic converters to reduce tailpipe emissions. Some of these measures can be achieved through regulation, while others require mass education of drivers, vehicle owners, regulators, and the public at large. Other technical options include replacing the 2-stroke engine by 4-stroke gasoline engine and switching to cleaner alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, and electricity. This paper discusses various technical and supporting policy options for reducing emissions from 2-stroke engines.","East- and South Asia; Motorisation trends; Two-stroke engines; Vehicle emissions","Air pollution control; Gas emissions; Health hazards; Hydrocarbons; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Gasoline engines; Hydrocarbon emissions; Motor vehicle fleet; Two stroke engine vehicles; Automobile engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342266183

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Research includes studies of the causes of sewer solids deposition and development/evaluation of control methods that can prevent sewer-sediment accumulation. Discussions focus on the relationship of wastewater characteristics to flow carrying velocity, abatement of solids deposition and solids resuspension in sewers, and sewerline-flushing systems for removal of sewer sediment. During low-flow dry-weather periods, sanitary wastewater solids deposit in combined sewers. During a storm-flow event, resuspension of near-bed sediment which contains a high concentration of pollutants (150,000 mg/L of BOD5, 200,000 mg/L of COD, and 300 mg/L of NH3-N) are discharged directly into receiving waters causing degradation of water quality. In addition, these deposited solids contain organic matter that, due to the anoxic conditions generate toxic and corrosive gases, e.g., hydrogen sulfide and methane. Sulfates are reduced to hydrogen sulfide and then oxidized to sulfuric acid by biochemical transformation. Thus, control of sewer sediment not only protects urban receiving-water quality but also prevents hazardous conditions in sewers and protects sewer structural integrity. Methods for abating sewer sedimentation include steeper sewer slopeage and pipe bottom shapes that maintain high velocity during low-flow conditions, improving upstream sediment trapping, and periodic sewer flushing.

Visibility is an important attribute in locations such as the Grand Canyon. In 1977, the Clean Air Act was amended to designate the Grand Canyon as a visibility protected area with a lofty goal of restoring visibility to near ""natural"" levels by 2064. In this paper, we have examined the potential effects on visibility as a result of reducing SO 2 emissions by 90% from the Navajo Generating Station (NGS). Scrubbers were installed from November 1997 - August 1999. Thanks to the IMPROVE network, this database affords us an unique opportunity to examine trends in sulfate and extinction both pre- and post-scrubber. The NGS impacts the Grand Canyon primarily during the winter (December -February). During winter, at times, there are fogs, stratus and high relative humidity in the Grand Canyon. When the plume interacts with these fogs, rapid conversion of SO2 to sulfate can occur. A variety of analytical techniques were used including cumulative frequency plots of particulate sulfur, extinction and CMB and tracer source apportionment analysis. We also deployed P-value statistical analysis of ""extreme"" particulate S values. Before scrubbers were installed, occasional large values of sulfate approaching 5 μg/m3 were observed. Since scrubbers have been installed, these high levels of sulfate have been markedly reduced. Statistical P-value analysis suggests that these reductions were significant. Furthermore, we have also observed that sulfate has been reduced throughout the cumulative frequency curve during winter by about 0.2 μg/m3 or about 33% since scrubbers were installed. By contrast, during summer when the NGS impact on the Canyon is minimal, there has been only relatively small decreases in particulate sulfur.","CMB source apportionment; Extinction; Grand Canyon National Park; Navajo Generating Station; SO2 emissions; Sulfate; Transmissometer; Trends","CMB source apportionment; Extinction; Grand Canyon National Park; Navajo Generating Station; SO emissions; Transmissometer; Trends; Atmospheric humidity; Database systems; Fog; Laws and legislation; Particles (particulate matter); Statistical methods; Visibility; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944495285

Their popularity results in part from the limitations and frustrations of centralized command and control regulation. Well-designed emission trading programs can achieve the same or better environmental and health outcomes as command and control regulations but provide regulated industries with greater flexibility. This lowers costs and improves the process of negotiating environmental policy. We present key concepts and important applications of emission trading, focusing on health impacts. These programs generally are well-designed, speeding emission abatement; improving health outcomes; and reducing compliance costs. Flaws have stopped a few poorly designed emission trading programs.

These models are nitrogen based, that is to say that the variables are expressed in terms of their nitrogen content. Moreover models are calibrated using chlorophyll data sets. Therefore carbon to chlorophyll (C:Chl) and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios have to be assumed. This paper addresses the problem of the representation of these ratios. In a 1D framework ar the DYFAMED station (NW Mediterranean Sea) we propose a model which enables the estimation of the basic biogeochemical fluxes and in which the spatio-temporal variability of the C:Chl and C:N ratios is fully represented in a mechanical way. This is achieved through the introduction of new state variables coming from the embedding of a phytoplankton growth model in a more classical Redfieldian NNPZD-DOM model (in which the C:N ratio is assumed to be a constant). Following this modelling step, the parameters of the model are estimated using the adjoint data assimilation method which enables the assimilation of chlorophyll and nitrate data sets collected at DYFAMED in 1997. Comparing the predictions of the new Mechanistic model with those of the classical Redfieldian NNPZD-DOM model which was calibrated with the same data sets, we find that both models reproduce the reference data in a comparable manner. Both fluxes and stocks can be equally well predicted by either model. However if the models are coinciding on an average basis, they are diverging from a variability prediction point of view. In the Mechanistic model biology adapts much faster to its environment giving rise to higher short term variations. Moreover the seasonal variability in total production differs from the Redfieldian NNPZD-DOM model to the Mechanistic model. In summer the Mechanistic model predicts higher production values in carbon unit than the Redfieldian NNPZD-DOM model. In winter the contrary holds. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,"carbon balance; modeling; oceanography; primary production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644227718

To comply with reduced emissions targets, a significant effort was required to minimize light-off time and to improve steady state performance for the pollutants HC and NOx. The main challenges and the technical solutions are discussed in this present work. Among them are substantial catalyst improvements needed to accommodate the progressively more severe agings related to high-speed driving conditions in Europe, and the close-coupled location of the catalyst, with the introduction of the converter welded directly to the exhaust manifold. Vehicles equipped with Euro IV emissions systems have been running in the field for more than 2 years and have shown that only a systems approach, including optimized exhaust manifold and canning designs, robust engine calibration strategies and specifically developed washcoats, can lead to a cost effective emissions solution. To meet future European emissions targets, our paper discusses the major steps that need to be taken not only to meet these targets but also to minimize cost or optimize packaging. Thus, newly developed washcoats, named Flex-Metal Catalysts, are compared to those previously used to meet Euro IV and their advantages in terms of performance and cost effectiveness are presented. The particularly severe rapid aging procedures developed to mimic the European driving style are also discussed, as well as the trade-off between converter volume and PGM content when using ultra-thin wall substrates.

Retrofit programs have developed Diesel particulate filters approaches in order to limit the particulate emissions in the cities. To fit the particular duty driving cycle requirements, a new active Diesel particulate filter (DPF) system is proposed to control the filters regeneration. The DPF system consists of: several particulate filter units; an oxidation catalyst placed in front of the filters; valves and jacks actuators allowing thermal insulation of the filters; control valves actuators; temperature and pressure sensors; and an electronic control unit and monitoring of the DPF system. Furthermore, in order to fully control the filters regeneration, an additional heat injection strategy, based on Diesel fuel injection over the oxidation catalyst, heats up the filters individually, according to the position of the insulation valves. The electronic control and monitoring of the DPF system ensure the reliability and durability of the system in the duty driving conditions. This new active DPF System was evaluated by Renault Trucks as an original exhaust part, and validated by UTAC on EURO III Premium 320 DCI 11 for refuse trucks applications. In addition, the French Agency of Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) showed the efficiency, the reliability and the durability of DPF system on retrofitted EURO II Renault AGORA urban buses. High emission reductions were recorded with more than 90% for CO, hydrocarbons and particulates, over more than 12 months period of field evaluations. Details on the field experiences and maintenance of the DPF system are also described in the paper.

The amino acid alignment from various animal species revealed a highly conserved structure. SMP30 has an enzyme activity hydrolyzing sarin, soman, and tabun, known as lethal toxic nerve chemicals. We analyzed the organophosphatase activity of SMP30 using DFP as a substrate. This DFPase activity is revealed in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of magnesium ions. We investigated the intracellular localization of SMP30. It is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. To confirm the presence of SMP30 in the nucleus, we prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from isolated cultured hepatocytes. Western blotting showed that SMP30 was detected in both extracts. Because the expression is reduced by carbon tetrachloride, one can speculate that the expression is modulated by oxidative stress increased with aging.","Aging; Dfpase; SMP30","carbon tetrachloride; dyflos; enzyme; magnesium ion; organophosphatase; regucalcin; sarin; soman; tabun; unclassified drug; aging; amino acid sequence; cell culture; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; conference paper; cytoplasm; enzyme activity; hydrolysis; liver cell; molecular weight; nonhuman; protein localization; protein structure; Western blotting; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242716763

It is experimentally known that the growth of graphite can not be explained by the volume diffusion of carbon. Recent results obtained for the desaturation of the austenite in a SG cast iron confirmed the existence of a significant difference between the experiment and the theoretical predictions based on the volume diffusion of carbon. According to stress state calculations, one possible explanation for this discrepancy could rely on the existence of a strong hydrostatic component gradient close to the austenite / graphite interface that would act as a barrier for the carbon diffusion across this interface. However, this discrepancy seems not to be present in the case of the carbon diffusion to the free surface of the material when cycled under vacuum. In situ high temperature XRD has been used to follow the growth of the graphite layers on the free surface of the samples during cycling between 800 and 950°C. The results of these XRD tests are compared to previous results concerning the volume diffusion of carbon during graphitization.","Cast iron; Graphitization; Metals characterization; X-ray diffraction","Austenite; Diffusion; Graphite; Graphitization; Microstructure; Optical microscopy; Stresses; Thermal cycling; X ray diffraction analysis; Graphite nodules; Hydrostatic stresses; Metals characterization; Spheroidal graphite (SG); Cast iron",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142759346

Because of inter-organisational cooperation, which is arranged based on spatial proximity between the actors, costs and emissions can be reduced in the vision of the industrial symbiosis. On the basis of five general criteria and six ecological criteria we divide the possible industrial symbiosis applications into two categories, industrial supplier parks, and resource recovery networks. Furthermore, resource recovery networks will be divided into networks with and without common investments. The authors argue that the classification and the characterisation is important, because practice shows that even if ecological and economic benefits could be achieved simultaneously the successful implementation of industrial symbiosis and industrial ecosystems is a challenging task. A clear differentiation will help future research to analyse the barriers of industrial symbiosis and contribute to the development of measures for overcoming the barriers. © 2004 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","energy and material flows; energy cascading; industrial ecosystems; industrial supplier parks; industrial symbiosis; resource recovery networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244454693

The former type of evaluation is sometimes called soft evaluation (awareness of services offered, inquiries for information, etc.), and the latter is called hard evaluation (trip, vehicle miles of travel, and emission reduction). A large-scale demonstration program funded by the European Commission, called mobility strategies for the next decades (MOST), developed a standardized monitoring and evaluation toolkit (MET) to aid those implementing ""mobility management"" projects in evaluating all types of impacts and project results. This was achieved by enumerating assessment levels that ranged from awareness to system impacts.

A new approach to the problem of nanoparticle stabilization, matrix entrapment, was presented. Nano particles were synthesized and incorporated into a matrix of nanoporous carbon (NPC). Reduction at 800°C in flowing hydrogen did not lead to sintering of the particles. The catalysts were quite active even at 400°C for simple reactions, e.g., olefin hydrogenations. HRTEM imaging and XRD revealed that the NPC matrix stabilizes the particles by entrapment. This led to a state that was thermodynamically unstable but for all intent and purposes persistent even under forcing conditions, hence the particles behaved as if they were ""frozen"" in place because the were unable to locate pathways for transport and sintering since they were too large to move through the nanopores. Hence, the system was ""frustrated"" kinetically from attaining lower state of chemical potential.

Emissions measurements were performed during engine dynamometer testing of an International DT 466E heavy-duty diesel engine. Fuels tested in the study were Diesel Fuel 1 and 2, low sulfur diesel (150 ppm), two ultralow sulfur fuels (&lt;30 ppm), Fischer-Tropsch, Biodiesel, PuriNOx™ and two Ethanol-Diesel blends. Configurations tested were: engine out, and diesel oxidation catalyst, continuously regenerating diesel filter, and exhaust gas recirculation aftertreatment. In general, the use of more aggressive aftertreatment (ie. DOC vs engine out, CRDPF vs DOC, etc) had a much more significant effect on emissions of PM, NOx, NO, HC and CO than the use of non-standard fuels, including the blended fuels. EGR-DPF was the only after treatment technology that significantly affected NOx emissions, reducing them an average of 42% from the DOC case for all fuels. NOx was reduced 41% from the Engine Out case for EULSD, the only fuel that was tested with both configurations. The only exception to this general trend was that PNOx fuel produced similar NOx emissions in the DOC configuration to the use of EGR-DPF after treatment with the ultralow sulfur fuels.

The serpentinization of mantle material is a fundamental process that has significant geophysical, geochemical and biological importance for the global marine system and for subduction zone environments. Mineral assemblages and textures are typically complex and reflect multiple phases of alteration, deformation and veining during emplacement, hydrothermal alteration, and weathering. In this paper, we review mineralogical and geochemical consequences of serpentinization processes in oceanic upper mantle sequences in different tectonic environments and discuss the relationship between serpentinization and fluid chemistry. We present phase equilibria that provide models for interpreting mineral-fluid relationships in oceanic serpentinites and allow the simultaneous evaluation of the conditions for redox, hydration and carbonation processes. These models predict that serpentinization reactions are sensitive to Si content of ultramafic rocks and that serpentine phases have an upper stability limit of ~450°C, where H20-rich fluids will be dominant. More pervasive serpentinization commences with olivine breakdown reactions below ~425°C and leads to progressively more reduced fluids with decreasing temperature. Our calculations indicate that carbonates may have extensive stability fields in CELrrich fluids in Si-deficient systems and that they may be significant in generating reducing conditions. If methane formation driven by serpentinization is common, its contribution to the carbon cycle in submarine biogeochemical systems may be substantial. Serpentinization may thus be an important process in sustaining diverse microbial communities in subsurface and near-vent environments and has consequences for the existence of a deep biosphere. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009881457

The Damage-Function method is an efficient tool recently used in decision-making processes concerning environmental management. It is based on finding the relation between the origin of an environmental charge, and its impact on human health and the environment. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the positive impacts, also called benefits, of changes in environmental quality, and the economic viability of an industrial project on reduction of PCDD/F emissions. It has been developed with monetary criteria of two worldwide ambits: USA and European-Union countries. Methods. The current study is a continuation of a previous investigation in which Substance Flow Analysis and Control Analysis Techniques were used to identify and to analyze all main flow values of PCDD/Fs inside the system of Tarragona Province (Spain). In the present study, Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been employed. The benefits derived from a minimization in the incidence of cancer due to a reduction in the emission of PCDD/Fs have been evaluated considering the value of a statistically saved life (VSL). Statistical analysis about uncertainty has also been incorporated. Here, the Monte Carlo simulation technique has been used. Results. It is shown that CBS results depend firstly on the kind of VSL used. In fact, the differences between the decisions as a result of applying monetary criteria in USA and EU can be explained by differences between VSL values. Conclusion and Recommendation. It is concluded that, for prices estimated in Euros, the emission cleaning project in the industrial plant is not feasible under any circumstance. However, although CBA seems to be a good analytical method, the final decision corresponds to the managers, who must weigh up not only the monetary criteria, but factors such as social questions.","Cost-Benefit analysis; Damage-Function method; Human exposure; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzo-furans (PCDD/Fs); Tarragona Province, Spain","cost-benefit analysis; decision making; dioxin; emission control; health risk; PCDD; PCDF; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930484528

The first major application of EPIC was a national analysis performed in support of the 1985 Resources Conservation Act (RCA) assessment. The model has continuously evolved since that time and has been applied for a wide range of field, regional, and national studies both in the U.S. and in other countries. The range of EPIC applications has also expanded greatly over that time including studies of: (1) surface runoff and leaching estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus losses from fertilizer and manure applications, (2) leaching and runoff from simulated pesticide applications, (3) soil erosion losses from wind erosion, (4) climate change impacts on crop yield and erosion, and (5) soil carbon sequestration assessments. The EPIC acronym now stands for Erosion Policy Impact Climate, to reflect the greater diversity of problems that the model is currently applied to. The Agricultural Policy Extender (APEX) model is essentially a multi-field version of EPIC that was developed in the late 1990s to address environmental problems associated with livestock and other agricultural production systems on a whole farm or small watershed basis. The APEX model also continues to evolve and to be utilized for a wide variety of environmental assessments. The historical development will be presented for both models as well as example applications at several different scales.","APEX; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; EPIC; Modeling; Soil erosion; Water quality","APEX; Carbon sequestration; EPIC; Modeling; Soil erosion; Carbon; Climate change; Mathematical models; Runoff; Soils; Water quality; Erosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30144445881

They include the Early-Late Paleocene upper Dakhla Shale and the Tarawan Chalk, and the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene Esna Shale. There is no marked variation between the grain size distribution of the Dakhla and Esna shales. They are generally composed of medium and coarse silts with small amounts of sand and clay. XRD analysis revealed the dominance of smectite with relatively low contents of kaolinite and illite and sporadic occurrence of palygorskite. Smectite was formed under warm semi-arid climatic conditions. Kaolinite, on the other hand, was formed under tropical to subtropical humid conditions. The relative proportions of smectite to kaolinite are controlled by the hydraulic sorting which concentrates kaolinite in the nearshore and shallow areas and drifts the smectite to deeper settings. The non-clay minerals are dominant by calcite with lower contents of quartz and local occurrences of feldspars. The high calcite content is consistent with the abundant calcareous fossils in the studied sediments. Dakhla Shale contains high carbonate contents and this is attributed to the high carbonate productivity and reduction of the detritus influx during a period of sea level highstand. On the other hand, low carbonate contents of the Esna Shale was attributed to the dilution by high terrigenous influx during sea level lowstand. Petrographic examination of the Tarawan Chalk sediments and the interbedded limestones within the Dakhla Shale has led to the identification of four carbonate microfacies. These microfacies are: mudstone/wackestone, wackestone, wackestone/packstone and packstone. Dissolution of skeletal grains and infilling with iron oxides and neomorphic calcite are the dominant diagenetic features.","Clay minerals; Dakhla Shale; Esna Shale; Nile Valley Facies; Tarawan Chalk","clay mineral; limestone; microfacies; mineralogy; Paleogene; sedimentary sequence; shale; texture; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Egypt; Kharga; New Valley; North Africa; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444294938

The area has had intermittently high particle levels with the principal point source being a steel mill. Due to a labor dispute, the mill was shut down. The closure and reopening of the steel mill allowed for an examination of potential correlates between epidemiological observations and measures of the biological effect of PM with experimental cell and human exposure. Epidemiologic investigation demonstrated an association of both the closure of the steel mill and the reduction in exposure to air pollution particles with changes in morbidity and mortality. Changes in these parameters were not fully accounted for by variation in the mass of PM. Metal content, in vitro oxidative stress, and release of pro-inflammatory mediators by cultured respiratory epithelial cells were all elevated in those aqueous extracts collected from the Utah Valley while the steel mill was open. Similarly, inflammatory injury in the lower respiratory tract of humans after instillation of aqueous extracts of filter PM was increased in those volunteers exposed to particles collected while the mill was open. These results indicate that equal masses of PM can induce disparate lung injuries suggesting that particle components may be relevant in assessing health effects after their exposure.

Impaired prenatal or postnatal lung growth may result from exposure to environmental toxicants including tobacco smoke and ambient air pollutants. Reduced prenatal or postnatal growth rates result in lungs that do not reach their developmental potential, reaching a reduced level resulting in symptoms at an earlier age with normal age-related decline in function or acute respiratory conditions. In utero exposure to maternal smoking is associated with decreased lung function at birth, which persists into adolescence and adulthood. The effects of in utero exposure are largest in children who also develop childhood asthma. Smoking and ETS exposure are associated with a shorter plateau and an accelerated decline in susceptible smokers that may lead to an early onset of disability and death from chronic lung diseases. The acute effects of ozone on lung function, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation in humans and animal models have led to the hypothesis that living in regions with high levels of ambient ozone is associated with chronic deficits in lung function by reducing growth and speeding lung function decline. Diesel exhaust, a traffic-related pollutant that contains high levels of NO2, fine particles, and organic compounds, appears to have acute and chronic effects on lung function. Although it is accepted that combustion-related air pollution exacerbates asthma, there is little evidence to support a role for ambient air pollutants on prevalence or incidence of new onset asthma, and it is generally thought that air pollution does not cause new cases of asthma. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942257188

As a consequence, the trucks are idled for long periods of time to heat or cool the cabin, to keep the engine warm, to run electrical appliances, and to refrigerate or heat truck cargo. This idling results in gaseous and particulate emissions, wasted fuel and is costly. Various technologies can be used to replace truck idling, including heaters, auxiliary power units, parking space electrification, and heating and air conditioning units in the parking space. In this paper the results of a life cycle analysis are reported giving the associated emissions savings and ecological burdens of these four technologies compared to truck idling. In this analysis the savings related to reduced engine maintenance and increased engine life are included. The fuel consumed and emissions produced by a truck engine at idle was obtained from experiments performed at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC). These idle emissions were compared to the pony pack auxiliary power unit (APU), the Espar direct-fired heater (DFH), Truck Stop Electrification (TSE), and Advanced Truckstop Electrification (ATSE). Of the four evaluated technologies, the Truckstop Electrification showed the most benefits to the truck drivers and the state. At a current average fuel price of $1.50 per gallon, the results show that truck stop electrification is most economical for the purposes of this study. Truck Stop Electrification results in a payback period of 1.53 for the driver, and 1.16 for the rest area, at the current price of diesel fuel. Advanced Truck Stop Electrification has a payback period of 0.83 years for the driver and a payback period of 3.66 for the rest area, based on a fee of $1.25 per hour. The rest area could reduce the payback by charging a higher fee, which would result in a greater payback for the driver. In addition, truck stop electrification showed the most emissions savings and the least ecological burdens. The APU and DFH showed considerable emissions reduction but were less economical, showing approximately 5 kg and 4 kg emissions savings per dollar, respectively.

The solar wall studied was installed on the south-south-east wall of a 1,000 piglets space building located south of Québec city. Air characteristics and flow rates have been collected during 4 months. Assuming a propane cost of 0.39 CDN$/litre, the solar wall has allowed an economy ranging from 350 to 540 CDN$ during winter, corresponding respectively to 0.12 to 0.18 CDN$/piglets. A preliminary assessment showed that the reduction of the propane could represent an interesting greenhouse gas reduction. Consequently, for future works, the authors recommend to evaluate greenhouse gas emissions from a pig nursery using a solar wall and to compare the emissions from a similar nursery without a solar wall.","Greenhouse gas; Solar heating; Swine production","Climatology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Heating; Propane; Reduction; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Pig nurseries; Solar walls; Swine production; Solar heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044439309

Then, CFMFR was divided into ten different fractions for the study of the mechanism of inert gas dilution on smoke point. The mass flow rate of each different inert gas to achieve the smoke point condition was then determined in the same manner. Flame radiation and the visible flame height for all the diluted fuel flames were measured. The axial soot concentration profiles of nitrogen-diluted smoke point flames were also measured using the laser induced incandescence (LII) method for selective conditions.

The study shows the amount diluent needed to achieve smoke point was in the decreasing order of Ar, CO2, N2 and He on mass basis. The analysis of the results showed that the main reason for this phenomenon was the heat sink capability of the gas. Hence, the specific heat of the gas was an important parameter.

To test whether geochemical and mineralogical impacts from these power plants are detectable on the West Virginia landscape, we obtained reservoir cores, soils, and rocks from two separate sites in West Virginia, one in Harrison County (Hinkel and Deegan Reservoirs) and the other in Roane County (Miletree Run Reservoir). Both have small drainage basins that have the effect of maximizing atmospheric inputs relative to weathering inputs. Sediments from Hinkel Reservoir were dated using the 137Cs method, and by knowledge of the age of the base of the sedimentary section. Major elements in Hinkel Reservoir sediments do not vary systematically over time, suggesting that the depositional history of these sediments has been relatively constant. In contrast, minor elements and sulfur do show dramatic shifts. Zn, Pb, As, S, Cd, Ge, and Hg all peak during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons associated with combustion processes likewise show this same behavior. Coincident with these maxima is a peak in isothermal remnant magnetization (IRM), a parameter that is proportional to magnetite abundance. We separated the magnetic fraction of the sediments and examined this fraction petrographically. It is dominated by magnetite with a spherical morphology, which is characteristic of magnetite produced by combustion processes. Chemical analyses on local rocks showed that they were not the likely source for the trace element and magnetite enrichments. To compare soils and reservoir sediments, we normalized geochemical data to Ti; the underlying assumption is that Ti will track physical inputs of soil materials into the reservoir sediments. The normalized sediment data for the elements Zn, Pb, As, and S are all higher for sediments deposited during the late 1960s and early 1970s compared to normalized soil data, implying that soils are not the source for the element enrichments. We thus attribute the enrichment to atmospheric inputs. However, a coal-burning zinc smelter within 10 km of the reservoir site that operated until 1971 may have supplied some or all of the anomalous input: There are no nearby major atmospheric pollution sites near Miletree Run Reservoir. A core from this reservoir was dated based on knowledge of the time it was impounded. Like Hinkel Reservoir, there are no systematic shifts in major element contents over its depositional history. Like Hinkel Reservoir, there are also significant shifts in trace elements and IRM that cannot be explained by local soil sources. Magnetic separates from this reservoir are also dominated by spherical combustion-produced magnetite. Covariance over the period 1930-1980 between magnetite and sulfur with US SO2 production (which comes dominantly from coal combustion) is strongly suggestive of a significant atmospheric input into Miletree Run Reservoir sediments. The nearest upwind power plants are between 50 and 75 km distant.

Cross polarisation (CP) and Bloch decay (BD) experiments were used to determine the chemical composition of the samples. These experiments indicated that, although the natural organic matter is predominately terrestrial in origin, the proportion of carbon existing as aromatic carbon, distinctive of vascular plants, decreases towards the mouth of the estuaries. This suggests that the relative contribution of terrestrial and marine source material largely defines the character of estuarine organic matter. Substantial amounts of charcoal were identified in sedimentary organic matter close to recent bushfire activity. Proton-spin relaxation editing (PSRE) was used to probe the physical structure of the sedimentary organic matter at the sub-micron scale. This technique showed that the organic matter was heterogeneous, providing support for a popular model of sedimentary organic matter structure. However, detailed interpretation of the domain structure of the organic matter was hindered by the presence of multiple components from both terrestrial and marine sources.","Bloch decay; Cross polarisation; Proton-spin relaxation editing","carbon; estuarine sediment; organic matter; spectroscopy; Australasia; Australia; New South Wales; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942750237

The six toxic species considered are acrolein, benzene, butadiene, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene and ethylene oxide. The Houston region in Texas, which emits large amount of toxic species into the atmosphere, is considered in this paper as a case study. The emissions of major air toxic species were processed using the SMOKE air toxics processing tool. The point, area and mobile source emission values obtained from National Toxic Inventory and the Toxic Release Inventory were used as input to the tool. The processing tool was run for different days and the results obtained were used to analyze the emission of toxic species over a period of time. The analysis highlights the areas within the region that have higher emission of toxic species and also the sources, which have greater contribution for the total toxic emissions in the region.

Transit revenues are rarely self-sustaining and operational funding is often required from municipality coffers. Traditional transit models applicable for larger cities have often been employed in small communities with limited success. There are a number of communities in Atlantic Canada that sustain transit services and many have launched innovative alternatives to provide public transportation. The population in these communities ranges between 30,000 and 400,000 citizens. An overview of several of these programs is provided in this paper. In tandem to its commitment to the Kyoto Accord, the Federal Government of Canada has initiated a program to encourage communities to develop new and innovative ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through a mixture of technology applications, infrastructure enhancements and behavioural change. Among the communities involved in the Urban Transportation Showcase Program are three small cities in Atlantic Canada: Halifax, Moncton and Saint John. Proposals submitted by these communities for the program developed alternatives to maximize the passenger carrying capacity of existing corridors that provide access to their cities. Initiatives include shifting road infrastructure from the automobile for transit use, transportation and land use planning decisions, parking strategies and the integration of services with non-traditional transportation modes. Other communities have recently established trans-cab services by structuring their transit system around existing transportation service infrastructure. This paper provides a summary of experience gained through the development of several of these initiatives and discusses their potential impact on common themes faced by small urban communities when providing transit. © 2004 WIT Press.","Canada; Planning; Small communities; Strategies; Transit; Urban Transportation Showcase Program","Greenhouse gases; Mass transportation; Planning; Transportation routes; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Canada; Integration of services; Public transportation; Small community; Strategies; Technology application; Transit; Transportation services; Application programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903473214

This focus can be justified on the basis of the favorable cost-effectiveness, political acceptance, and ease of quantifying technological measures - at least in the short term - but unfortunately it often leads to the exclusion of demand-oriented measures. Further, air quality and pollution policy analysts often use assumptions of exogenously determined travel demand patterns, implicitly excluding many opportunities to look at policies oriented toward travel demand as an air pollution control strategy. The air quality impacts of policy measures to influence vehicle kilometers traveled and mode shares, such as bus rapid transit, are investigated. The approach involves developing coefficients with a stated preference (SP) survey that could be used to test policies with a conventional four-step urban transportation model. The main purpose of the SP survey in this study was to examine traveler trade-offs among time, cost, and reliability (measured as uncertainty in vehicle departure time). Some different methods of measuring reliability were tested during the pilot phase of the survey, as were the actual range of parameter values to be tested. Models were estimated using traveler cohorts based on levels of vehicle ownership. In comparing vehicle owners (cars and two-wheelers) with nonowners, owners were found to be substantially more sensitive to time and reliability while nonowners were more sensitive to price. All groups showed notable sensitivity to reliability. Policy implications of these results are discussed, with a notable conclusion being that demand-oriented measures appear to be a fruitful area for further investigation as air pollution control strategies, even when technological measures show strong effectiveness.",,"Air quality; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Pollution control; Transportation; Vehicles; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Integrated environmental strategies (IES); Transport networks; Vehicle emissions; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14044257164

Zinc roofs on new and renovated buildings are not permitted. Run off water from zinc roofs of existing buildings is allowed to contain a maximum of 200 μg/l zinc. For the zinc gutters of houses, Amsterdam will promote measures to reduce zinc emissions. To investigate the feasibility of measures, research has been carried out on the zinc emissions of gutters and the effect of covering gutters with an impermeable foil.

Activated carbon injection (ACI) is projected to be the most commonly employed technique for the removal of mercury from flue gas. However, a notable drawback in the use of activated carbon for mercury capture in power plant flue gas is the annual operating cost. Activated carbons are expensive, ranging in price from $500 to $3,000 per ton. The resulting annual cost of activated carbon for mercury clean-up at a typical 500-MW e coal-burning power plant is projected to be around five million dollars. The Thief Process is a radical variation to ACI. Partially combusted coal from the furnace is extracted by a lance and then re-injected into the ductwork downstream of the air preheater. Recent results at the National Energy Technology Laboratory's 500-lb/hr pilot-scale combustion facility show similar removals of mercury for both the Thief Process and ACI. Independent verification of the sorbent activity at a pilot-plant that uses a slipstream from a Wisconsin utility has been accomplished. A patent for the process was issued in February 2003. The Thief sorbents are cheaper than commercially-available activated carbons and exhibit excellent capacities for mercury. The Thief Process holds great potential for significantly reducing the cost of mercury removal from flue gas and the technology is available for licensing to interested parties.",,"Activated carbon injection (ACI); Coal-fired power plants; Mercury emissions; Mercury removal; Activated carbon; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Laws and legislation; Project management; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944400748

Consistent with several organizational theories (neoinstitutionalism, organizational ecology, and the resource dependence framework) that stress how regulatory policies are just one of several institutional forces that bear on organizations, our findings reveal that states' right-to-know programs have had no significant net effect on plants' toxic emissions.

The concept of whole ore leaching by using cyanide can result in unnecessary environmental and capital risk. Alternative, currently available technologies can be used to provide the desired level of gold recovery at a much lower installed cost and less impact on the environment. Gravity concentration, alone or in conjunction with flotation, can produce a gold bearing concentrate that can then be fed directly to a batch or continuous intensive cyanidation unit. The In-line Leach Reactor (ILR) is an intensive cyanidation unit developed by Gekko Systems of Australia. Advantages of this technology include significantly reduced capital outlays for greenfield plants or plant upgrades and increased investor returns. Reduction of onsite cyanide and carbon inventories improves plant safety, materials handling and site security. By using direct electrowinning to treat the gold bearing solutions produced by the ILR, the need for a conventional carbon stripping circuit is removed. Potential also exists to increase grind size - saving energy, further reducing capital and operating costs and decreasing the environmental impact of a mill. Detoxification of cyanide before the release of solution to the tailings dam can minimise tailings disposal and containment requirements. When used in the right application the proposed process will have little or no impact on gold recovery and may actually increase recovery for complex ores.

Large stationary sources such as coal-fired electric generating plants are likely to be the most cost-effective targets for carbon dioxide capture. At present, liquid amine-based scrubbing systems are the only processes available for this application. Processes based on regenerable solids that absorb carbon dioxide from flue gas and release it in concentrated form have the potential to be less expensive to operate. This paper summarises the results of studies conducted at RTI and Louisiana State University (LSU) to investigate the feasibility of using sodium or potassium carbonate as a sorbent. Upon reaction with carbon dioxide and water (also present in flue gas), this material is converted to sodium or potassium bicarbonate. Upon heating (ideally with low grade heat from the generating plant), carbon dioxide and water vapour are released and the solid carbonate can be reused. Work to date has focused on thermogravimetry (TG) and bench scale fluidised-bed testing, as well as characterisation of materials and thermodynamic and kinetic analyses. TG studies with sodium carbonate have indicated that the sorption reaction takes place rapidly at approximately 60°C and that the sorbent can be regenerated at temperatures less than 120°C. A five-cycle test conducted in a bench scale fluid bed reactor system indicated that the sorbent could be regenerated and reused. The process implications of compound salts and hydrates in the sodium carbonate system on the useful capacity of the sorbent and heat removal requirements were also investigated.","Alkalie carbonates; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Combustion; Flue gas; Fossil fuels; Thermogravimetry","Climate change; Combustion; Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Potassium compounds; Thermogravimetric analysis; Fluid bed reactors; Kinetic analysis; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242734105

In this study, the Global Triptych approach is put forward as an input for international decision-making concerning the differentiation of commitments by 2020. It is a sector- and technology-oriented approach, and we calculated quantitative emission limitation objectives and global emissions starting from bottomup information on long-term reduction opportunities. Central to the calculations were long-term sustainability targets for the year 2050, formulated for (1) energy efficiency in the energy-intensive industry, (2) greenhouse gas intensity of electricity production, and (3) per capita emissions in the domestic sectors. Calculated emission limitation objectives for 13 world regions ranged from about −30% to more than +200%. The ranking of world regions in the differentiation turned out to be independent of the levels chosen for the long-term sustainability targets. The objectives seem sufficient to maintain the long-term possibility of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at about 550 ppm CO2-eq, but will require severe emission reductions. These may be relaxed to a certain degree if stabilization at 650 ppm CO2-eq is aimed for. We conclude that the bottom-up character of the approach made it possible to examine important basic principles of the Climate Convention, including equity, the needs and circumstances of developing countries, cost-effectiveness and sustainable development. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Atmospheric stabilization; Bottom-up; Burden sharing; Equity; Sustainable development","bottom-up approach; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644448825

In the present study, the combustion and emissions characteristics of a light-duty direct injection (DI) diesel engine fueled with DME have been simulated using the CFD model based on the KIVA-3V code and a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism of DME for the ignition and combustion processes. This detailed chemical kinetics mechanism of DME consists of 291 reactions for 31 species. The results of ignition delay, engine cylinder pressure, heat release and species concentrations have also been compared with our previous experimental work and a good agreement has been demonstrated. It shows that the ignition delay of the DME is much shorter than the diesel fuel and it leads to a much lower peak pressure and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission due to less premixed combustion. The diffusive combustion of DME engine operation is faster than the diesel engine and it leads to the reduction of smoke, particulate matter (PM), unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. Furthermore, the low temperature oxidation and high temperature pyrolysis processes for DME including the two-stage ignition phenomena of DME combustion and negative temperature coefficient region have also been analyzed in this study. The present numerical study of DME provides insight to in-cylinder engine combustion and emissions formation process.

Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. Hydrogen addition could significantly enlarge the flammable region and extend the flammability limit to lower equivalence ratios. If the equivalence ratio was kept constant, the addition of hydrogen increased the emission of NO in a flame, due to the enhancement in the rate of the NNH or N2O intermediate NO formation routes. The addition of hydrogen caused a monotonous decrease in the formation of NO2 and N2O, except flames near the extinction limits, where the emission of NO2 and N2O first increased, and then decreased with the increase in the fraction of hydrogen.

It then discusses improvements in steam-generating technology where larger-capacity plants with higher thermal efficiencies and less NOx and SOx emissions that have more environmentally benign performance. It highlights how advanced combustion systems contribute to improvement in boiler efficiency, how sliding pressure operation of supercritical units improves plant efficiency during partial load operation, and the benefits of high-efficiency gas turbine/steam turbine combined cycle plants. It then reviews energy and environmental performance improvement programs that are targeted at reduction of internal energy used and expansion of energy production through conversion or thermal efficiency improvements.

Triplicate reactors with 10 grams of volatile solids were incubated at 55°C with 400 ml of inoculum from a thermophilic biogas plant and the methane production was followed over a 50-day period by regular measurements of methane on a gas chromatograph. The procedure involves blanks as well as cellulose controls. Methane potentials have been measured for source-separated organic household waste and for individual waste materials. The procedure has been evaluated regarding practicality, workload, detection limit, repeatability and reproducibility as well as quality control procedures. For the source-separated organic household waste a methane potential of 495 ml CH4/g VS was found. For fat and oil a lag-phase of several days was seen. The protein sample was clearly inhibited and the maximal methane potential was therefore not achieved. For paper bags, starch and glucose 63, 84 and 94% of the theoretical methane potential was achieved respectively. A detection limit of 72.5 ml CH4/g VS was calculated from the results. This is acceptable, since the methane potential of the tested waste materials was in the range of 200-500 ml CH4/g VS. The determination of methane potentials is a biological method subject to relatively large variation due to the use of non-standardized inoculum and waste heterogeneity. Therefore, procedures for addressing repeatability and reproducibility are suggested. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Begun in 1994 after a three-year development effort, the RECLAIM cap-and-trade programmes for nitrogen oxides (""NOX"") and sulfur dioxide (""SO2"") include participants from numerous sectors (in contrast to most other existing trading programmes, which focus on a single sector). Several project-based programmes that provide credits for reductions from mobile and area sources supplement the cap-and-trade programmes. Indeed, this basic structure is similar to that envisioned for other emissions trading programmes including those for greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions, in which trading under national or regional caps would be supplemented by project-based programmes (Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism). Notwithstanding important differences between RECLAIM and other potential programmes, the experience with RECLAIM promises to provide some insights into how other trading programmes might function. The NOXRECLAIM programme has had a tempestuous history. The significant developments include: • In the summer of 2000, the prices for NOX Reclaim Trading Credits (""RTCs,"" the basic unit of trade) increased dramatically. From a range of about $1,000-$4,000 per ton in 1994-99, the average RTC price increased to more than $45,000 in 2000 (with individual trades reported for more than $100,000 per ton). • This increase in RECLAIM NOX prices both was a reflection of the ""California electricity crisis"" of 2000-which involved dramatic increases in wholesale electricity spot prices-and was itself a significant contributing factor to the higher wholesale electricity spot prices. • As a result of the high NOX prices and the electricity circumstances, NOXemissions exceeded the RECLAIM cap for 2000 by about 6 percent (after taking advantage of limited banking/borrowing options). RECLAIM provisions call for these excess emissions to be reflected in reduced future RTC allocations. • In May 2001, the agency responsible for RECLAIM, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (""SCAQMD"") passed major changes to RECLAIM that have in effect suspended participation in it by electricity generators and returned the control of electricity generators' emissions at least temporarily to a command-and-control programme. Generators submit compliance plans for the installation of best available retrofit control technology (""BARCT"") and pay a mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) for excess emissions that is used by the SCAQMD to fund project-based emission reductions; generators' future RTC allocations are reduced if excess emissions are not made up for by the SCAQMD. • Electricity generators have complied with the May 2001 requirements by submitting compliance plans and paying mitigation fees for excess emissions in 2000 and 2001. The SCAQMD has contracted for emission reductions from marine and other sources. • RTC prices have declined considerably since their peaks in 2001, so that by the end of 2002, RTC prices for NOX 2003 RTCs were in the neighbourhood of $6,000 per ton. These experiences can suggest lessons for how emissions trading works ""in practice,"" particularly with regard the treatment of price volatility and the interaction of emissions trading and restructuring of electricity markets. In considering such lessons, however, it is important to compare RECLAIM's performance not only to an ""ideal"" emissions trading programme but also to the alternative ""command-and-control"" programme that otherwise would exist. The key conclusions regarding the recent RECLAIM performance are the following: 1. With regard to environmental performance, RECLAIM has generally been successful in achieving its emission goals; even for 2000, the net effect of the dramatic shifts in RTC prices was to shift a relatively small percentage (6 percent) of NOX emission reductions from 2000 to future years. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that a command-and-control alternative would have performed better under the circumstances. Indeed, since emission rates would have been regulated-rather than overall emissions-the command-and-control alternative would likely have resulted in the same or greater emissions increases without the compensating measures taken as a result of exceeding the NOX RECLAIM cap. 2. With regard to cost savings, the large number of RTC transactions suggests that trading has reduced the overall cost of meeting emissions targets; indeed, even in 2000, the RECLAIM market behaved as a market should. As the demand for NOX RTCs increased and their supply decreased in 2000, NOX prices increased as they should have. Moreover, the prices of an important product ""using"" NOX RTCs, wholesale electricity, also increased. This should have provided signals to affected sources to invest in emissions controls as well as signals to consumers to reduce consumption of electricity. 3. The major ""problems"" of RECLAIM were due primarily to flaws in California's newly deregulated electricity markets rather than to serious flaws in the RECLAIM programme itself. Had the structure of California's electricity industry remained composed of regulated monopolies, or if the transition to new competitive market structures had been done more competently and with greater sensitivity to the interactions between NOX RTC prices and spot electricity prices, the impact of higher NOX RTC prices on the average price of electricity would have been much more modest. And if the electricity crisis had not occurred, electricity generators likely would not have been removed-at least temporarily-from the NOX RECLAIM programme. 4. RECLAIM could be improved by providing more tools to manage extreme price volatility effectively. The experience of RECLAIM in 2000 in 2001 shows that short-term and unexpected fluctuations in demand can lead to significant volatility in allowance prices, which can in turn lead to significant volatility in prices of goods whose production involves significant ""use"" of emissions allowances. The major tool used in other programmes to reduce price volatility- banking of excess emissions reductions-is largely unavailable under RECLAIM. Other options include expanding the range of emission-reduction alternatives in RECLAIM- beyond the relatively few additional emission reduction alternatives made available from project-based credits or voluntary opt-ins thus far-and maintaining the mitigation fee or developing a ""safety valve"" that would directly limit the maximum price. © OECD 2004.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746179455

The test object was a 9-litre ethanol-fueled diesel engine from Scania equipped with turbocharger and aftercooler. A similar diesel engine from Scania, but running on ordinary Swedish diesel fuel, was used as a reference and a reminder of ""the state of the art"". The tests involved two different ethanol fuels containing various ignition improvers, Beraid 3540 and rapeseed methyl ester. Test conditions for the engines were those specified in the European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The aftertreatment system reduced the emissions of HC, CO and NOX, down to 0.15, 0.04 and 2.54 g/kWh, respectively, while the estimated particle mass was reduced by 67%. Actually, by using the DNOX™ system, the engines became Euro IV engines regarding the emissions of HC, CO and NOx. The ethanol-fueled engine without EGR, catalyst or DPF emitted approximately 1.6 times more formaldehyde and 9.8 times more acetaldehyde than the diesel engine. However, the emission of acrolein was only 0.47 times the emission of acrolein from the diesel engine. When the ethanol-fueled engine was equipped with DNOX™, a significant reduction of the emissions of aldehydes was obtained. The emissions of acrolein, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were reduced by 56%, 87% and 95%, respectively. An even higher reduction was observed when the system was connected to the diesel engine. Fifteen different hydrocarbons (alkanes, olefins and monoaromates) were also identified. The diesel-fueled engine, without any exhaust aftertreatment devices, emitted approximately twice as much hydrocarbon than the ethanol-fueled engine, also without any exhaust aftertreatment devices. However, there were also qualitative differences. Three hydrocarbons, namely propene, ethene and benzene, accounted for 77 % of the hydrocarbons emitted from the diesel-fueled engine, while acetylene, ethene and benzene, made up only 53% of the hydrocarbons emitted from the ethanol-fueled engine. When connecting the system to the engines, a difference was observed; the reduction of analyzed hydrocarbon emissions was approximately 90% for the diesel-fueled engine, but only 47% for the ethanol-fueled engine. The studied aftertreatment system has been developed and optimized for the diesel-fueled engine. This fact is reflected in the powerful reduction of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, particles and NOX that is obtained when connecting the system to the diesel-fueled engine. Nevertheless, a significant reduction is also obtained when connecting the system to the ethanol-fueled engine. Test results indicate that it should be possible to better optimize the system for the ethanol engine. It is also, probably, necessary to exchange the catalyst in the system. Thereby, an even higher reduction of unregulated and regulated emissions should be obtained.

In this experiment, VOCs emission rates of 178 plant species were measured with a portable photoionization detector (PID). The results showed the most of genera and some families have consistent feature of their VOCs emission, especially for isoprene, and provide the basic premise of taxonomic methodology to develop VOCs emission inventories for temperate grassland. Then, the taxonomic methodology was introduced into assigning emission rate to other 96 species, which no measured emission rates available here. A systematical emission inventory of temperate grassland vegetation in Inner Mongolia was provided and further evidence that taxonomy relationship can serve as a useful guide for generalizing the emissions behavior of many, but not all, plant families and genera to grassland vegetation.","Biogenic emission; Grassland vegetation; Isoprene; Monoterpene; PID; Taxonomic methodology; VOCs","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Photodetectors; Photoionization; Plants (botany); Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic emission; Emission inventory; Grassland vegetation; Isoprene; Monoterpene; Photoionization detector (PID); Quantitative measurements; Taxonomic methodology; Vegetation; air quality; biogenic emission; volatile organic compound; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol; World; Xilin Basin; organic compound; article; China; classification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; physiology; Poaceae; volatilization; China; Classification; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Organic Chemicals; Poaceae; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21844476805

Those rules, and the mechanisms to enforce them, evolve as a reflection of the society's values and cultures. In environmental management, however, units of ecosystem management, such as watersheds, seldom match political boundaries. When an ecosystem crosses state or national borders, therefore, the process of developing and enforcing rules becomes significantly more challenging. In 1909, the United States and Canada established the International Joint Commission under the terms of the Boundary Waters Treaty. The role of the IJC is to ""to prevent disputes regarding the use of boundary waters and to settle all questions⋯between the United States and the Dominion of Canada involving the rights, obligations, or interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, along their common frontier, and to make provision for the adjustment and settlement of all such questions as may hereafter arise"". A keystone in the management of Great Lakes water quality is the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, first signed in 1972 and renewed in 1978. The Agreement is a formal expression of commitment by each country to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. In addition to a number of environmental management and research objectives, the Agreement sets out specific binational water quality objectives and guidelines. Although this framework is potentially a powerful one, the political, economic, social, and regulatory climate in each country is continually evolving. As a result, the provisions of the Agreement do not necessarily keep pace with developments on each side of the international border, and routine audit and enforcement functions are significantly more difficult than would be the case in either country alone.

A comparison of input parameters and model responses are made at Lochnagar, a site for which detailed, high resolution spatial/temporal data exist. The model is capable of reproducing observed trends in non-marine SO2-4, however simulated NO-3 from 1990 to 2000 is lower than the observed trends at Lochnagar due to possible hydrological controls and in-lake processes, rather than terrestrial processes. The Scottish Highlands are remote from emission sources and consequently peak deposition inputs of S in the 1980s are relatively low (33 kg S ha-1 y-1) compared to other regions in Europe. Nonetheless the amount of deposition appears sufficient to cause environmental damage in this acid sensitive region. During the 1980s, simulated Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC) of 13% of the modelled lakes was &lt;20 μeq l-1, a chemical condition that potentially can cause damage to freshwater ecology. Regional and site simulations captured the recovery to 2000 in response to the existing emission reductions. Predictions to 2016 indicates the potential for biological recovery and a return to 'good status' as required by the EU Water Framework Directive, although the hydrochemistry of some sites remain some way from simulated pre-acidification conditions.","Acid deposition; Ecology; Recovery; Scale; Scotland","acid deposition; emission control; hydrochemistry; lake pollution; lake water; Eurasia; Europe; Highland; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543141846

A simple, direct correlation between opacity and particulate emissions does not exist due to the wide variety of factors that affect the production of diesel particulates. In an attempt to address this deficiency, data from the Australian National Environmental Protection Council for 72 vehicles deemed representative in terms of vehicle make, age and mass were analysed. The data included opacity and particulate measurements as well as a breakdown of emissions in terms of O2, CO, CO2, NO x, and HC readings for each vehicle as it was tested according to a comprehensive drive cycle. These drive cycles were developed to be representative of driving in a range of urban traffic conditions on Australian roads. The best model for predicting particulate matter was identified to have a linear relationship with the average opacity, vehicle mass, fuel consumption and O2, CO and NOx readings. As diesel vehicles are classified into six categories by the Australian Design Rules (ADR), correlations for particulate matter were also developed for each vehicle category. The best model for predicting particulate matter across all six ADR categories (with different numerical coefficients for each category) was found to linearly depend on the average opacity, vehicle mass, cumulative power and O2, CO, CO2 and NOx readings. Excellent results were found in four of the six ADR categories examined.

The causes and nature of aridity varied from north to south over the continent. In northern and central Australia, reduced monsoon rain in global cold stages caused lakes and rivers to dry, vegetation to become more sparse, sand dunes to become active, and dust advection to increase. While the monsoon is correlated with warmer global temperatures and high sea levels overall, the exact timing of the greatest development of the monsoon in Stage 5 remains uncertain. In southeastern Australia, the proxy records give a less clear picture. While vegetation seems to have been more sparse in cold stages and sand dune activity and dust flux consequently greater, records of runoff in rivers and lakes have mixed or opposite behaviour to northern or central Australia. The nature of aridity in southeastern Australia is not analogous to conditions anywhere on the continent today. Greatly reduced temperatures over the central and southern interior, greater influence of snow and periglaciation on runoff, high groundwater tables, lower rainfall and reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may all have contributed to and interacted to produce the reconstructed picture of a cold, sparsely vegetated arid landscape with large rivers and perennial lakes. The largest changes in circulation patterns over the glacial cycle probably occurred in the location and/or intensity of summer tropical convergence in northern Australia. Over southern Australia, changes to the temperature and humidity of the westerly circulation have been more significant than the small fluctuations in latitude of the sub-tropical high pressure ridge. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Both planets have permanent, magnetically conjugate auroral ovals, although produced by quite different mechanisms. Both are multispectral, having been observed at X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio wavelengths. The brightest structures are produced by downward accelerated electron fluxes associated with upward Birkeland (magnetic-field-aligned) currents. At both planets, the auroral forms are time variable, especially at highest latitudes. The main power source for auroral emissions is planetary rotation at Jupiter, and the solar wind interaction at Earth. Thus Jupiter's auroral structures tend to be fixed with respect to magnetic (System III) longitude while Earth's are fixed with respect to local time. Earth's auroral structure is strongly dependent on the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). At Jupiter, no IMF dependence is known, but observations have not been sufficient to show such a dependence if it exists. A unique feature of Jupiter's auroral structure, with no counterpart at Earth, is the signature of the large (Galilean) satellites and, in the case of Io, even the corotational wake of the satellite. © 2004 COSPAR.

Heretofore these instrument developments have been designed for low flying known platforms such as the NASA P-3. Commercial-off-the-shelf design materials can be used to inexpensively build antennas that approximate free-space permittivity, enabling remote sensing of soil moisture levels locally using small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A foam/free-space sandwich can be used to minimize the weight of the dielectric backing structure. This technique enables rapid prototyping with space-grade materials. A low-mass 3-element antenna array of this design is already baselined for a University nano-satellite mission. A light-weighted version of the L-band Imaging Scatterometer (LIS) radar electronics is being developed for a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. This lightweight wing antenna has a large potential payoff to NASA. For example, it may enable an active/passive hydrology mission using a fleet of low cost small UAVs. A mesh ground plane can further reduce the overall mass and stowability of the very large antennas required for spaceborne observations at L-Band. The cross track scan success criterion was met at L-Band frequencies for radar and radiometry. That is, we designed and prototyped a wideband antenna patch tunable in this range and additional work is being carried out to improve the cross polarization isolation. Making the present broadband design into arrays will be limited to one dimension due to array spacing and the aspect ratio of the patch elements. A fore and aft Doppler beam synthesis and the LIS cross-track beam forming concept will be considered for potential application to surface hydrology measurements using these arrays.",,"L-band Imaging Scatterometer (LIS); Linear broadband antennas; Synthetically Thinned Array Radiometer (STAR); Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV); Antennas; Hydrology; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Space flight; Unmanned vehicles; Wings; Broadband networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15944391297

Hence it has become an outstanding solution to be used to meet future emission limits in Europe, Japan and North America. To add even more confidence towards the introduction of SCR technology, the implementation of NOx sensors will become mandatory for on-board emission control systems. To demonstrate the usefulness of NOx sensors, a typical North American On-Highway Truck was chosen as a demonstration vehicle. It was equipped with vertically mounted, extruded SCR catalysts, a urea dosing system, and NO x-sensors. In order to achieve EURO 5 or even lower emission limits in NOx and PM, attempts were made to equip the system with oxidation catalysts upstream of the SCR catalyst as well as upstream of the turbine. Some changes had to be made to the model year 2000 engine calibration to reduce PM emissions to EURO 4 and 5 levels. The system was calibrated and then tested according to different HD test procedures on a transient test bench. NO x emissions were determined by CLD and NDIR analyzers and by state of the art NOx sensors. After completion of the test bench work, the catalyst system was transferred to the test truck and the final system calibration was copied from the test bench ECU to the vehicle ECU. On-road NOx measurements were gathered by using NDIR-analyzers and NO x sensors. Based on our previous experience with HD trucks, it can be stated that the introduction of NOx sensors is an appropriate method to monitor NOx conversion performance of SCR systems and also to adapt the system to compensate for various disturbances. Ongoing evaluation of the test truck in the future will include NOx sensor performance, implementation of the NOx signal into the dosing control algorithms, as well as on-road durability testing.

The objective function depends on the current level of SO X concentration and the sensitivity of the area to this type of air pollution. Dispersion of the atmospheric pollution is governed by a multi-layer, dynamic model of SOX transport, which is the main forecasting tool used in the optimization algorithm. The adjoint equation, related to the main transport equation of the forecasting model, is applied to calculate the gradient of the objective function in the main optimization procedure.

Here, element concentrations (Ca, Mg, Sr, Na, Fe, and Mn) have been determined for the carbonate fraction of bulk samples from the late Oligocene Tikorangi Formation, a subsurface, mixed dolomite-calcite, cool-water limestone sequence in Taranaki Basin, New Zealand. While the occurrence of dolomite is rare in New Zealand Cenozoic carbonates, and in cool-water carbonates more generally, the dolomite in the Tikorangi carbonates is shown to have a dramatic effect on the “traditional” positioning of cool-water limestone fields within bivariate element plots. Rare undolomitised, wholly calcitic carbonate samples in the Tikorangi Formation have the following average composition: Mg 2800 ppm; Ca 319 100 ppm; Na 800 ppm; Fe 6300 ppm; Sr 2400 ppm; and Mn 300 ppm. Tikorangi Formation dolomite-rich samples (>15% dolomite) have average values of: Mg 53400 ppm; Ca 290400 ppm; Na 4700 ppm; Fe 28 100 ppm; Sr 5400 ppm; and Mn 500 ppm. Element-element plots for dolomite-bearing samples show elevated Mg, Na, and Sr values compared with most other low-Mg calcite New Zealand Cenozoic limestones. The increased trace element contents are directly attributable to the trace element-enriched nature of the burial-derived dolomites, termed here the “dolomite effect”. Fe levels in the Tikorangi Formation carbonates far exceed both modern and ancient cool-water and warm-water analogues, while Sr values are also higher than those in modern Tasmanian cool-water carbonates, and approach modern Bahaman warm-water carbonate values.

In the future such instruments might become powerful tools for monitoring changes in the atmospheric CO2 abundance and to improve our quantitative understanding of the leading processes controlling this. At the moment, however, we are still in an exploratory phase where first experiences are collected and promising new space-based measurement concepts are investigated. This study assesses the potential of some of these concepts to improve CO2 source and sink estimates obtained from inverse modelling. For this purpose the performance of existing and planned satellite instruments is quantified by synthetic simulations of their ability to reduce the uncertainty of the current source and sink estimates in comparison with the existing ground-based network of sampling sites. Our high resolution inversion of sources and sinks (at 8° × 10°) allows us to investigate the variation of instrument performance in space and time and at various temporal and spatial scales. The results of our synthetic tests clearly indicate that the satellite performance increases with increasing sensitivity of the instrument to CO2 near the Earth's surface, favoring the near infra-red technique. Thermal infrared instruments, on the contrary, reach a better global coverage, because the performance in the near infrared is reduced over the oceans owing to a low surface albedo. Near infra-red sounders can compensate for this by measuring in sun-glint, which will allow accurate measurements over the oceans, at the cost, however, of a lower measurement density. Overall, the sun-glint pointing near infrared instrument is the most promising concept of those tested. We show that the ability of satellite instruments to resolve fluxes at smaller temporal and spatial scales is also related to surface sensitivity. All the satellite instruments performed relatively well over the continents resulting mainly from the larger prior flux uncertainties over land than over the oceans. In addition, the surface networks are rather sparse over land icreasing the additional benefit of satellite measurements there. Globally, challenging satellite instrument precisions are needed to compete with the current surface network (about 1 ppm for weekly and 8° × 10° averaged SCIAMACHY columns). Regionally, however, these requirements relax considerably, increasing to 5 ppm for SCIAMACHY over tropical continents. This points not only to an interesting research area using SCIAMACHY data, but also to the fact that satellite requirements should not be quantified by only a single number. The applicability of our synthetic results to real satellite instruments is limited by rather crude representations of instrument and data retrieval related uncertainties. This should receive high priority in future work. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242687215

In Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, efforts to control motor vehicle pollution have primarily utilized technology mandates - such as emission controls on vehicles, changes in fuel composition, and alternative fuels - rather than controls on individuals' use of their vehicles or efforts to focus or restrict the supply of highway infrastructure. Motor vehicle pollution control efforts have been less aggressive than might have been the case because of institutionalized tensions within the government between pollution control and economic development objectives, as well as cost constraints.

For comparison, LiFePO 4 was also synthesized from iron acetate by a solid-state method. The electrochemical performance of these materials in lithium cells was evaluated and correlated to LiFeP powder morphology and residual carbon structure, as determined by Raman microprobe spectroscopy. For materials with mean agglomerate sizes below 20 μm, an association between structure and crystallinity of the residual carbon and improved utilization was observed. Addition of small amounts of organic compounds or polymers during processing results in carbon coatings with higher graphitization ratios and better electronic properties on the LiFePO4 samples and improves cell performance in some cases, even though total carbon contents remain low (&lt;2%). In contrast, no performance enhancement was seen for samples doped with Mg or Ti. These results suggest that it should be possible to design high-power LiFePO4 electrodes without unduly compromising energy density by optimizing the carbon coating on the particles. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

Enormous reductions in noise emission levels of turbine engines have been achieved during the last years, exposing airframe noise as an additional significant noise source during the approach and landing phase. In order to cope with these varying aircraft noise emission characteristics, new noise-simulation-tools have been developed, like the German Aerospace Center's SIMUL-Program. Now, being able to evaluate present Noise Abatement Procedures (NAPs) with state of the art simulation-tools, it is advisable to review these procedures and modify them with respect to present aircraft noise characteristics. This paper describes the results of a dedicated study on noise abatement approach procedures using the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) as a ""conventional"" noise model, and DLRs simulation model SIMUL. Present procedures are evaluated and effects concerning engine and airframe noise are highlighted. Lessons learned, leading to new future (short- & medium-term) NAPs are presented. A brief outlook on future NAPs and their requirements for special equipment, both, airborne and ground-based, is given. Additionally, comparisons with the findings of other international studies are made.

Fuel cell technology is developing fast and many new concepts for the use of fuel cells must be proposed and analysed, since we are facing enormous challenges when defending liveability and quality of life within available resources. The aim of the present article is to describe a vision of how fuel cell technology used in all the municipal vehicles serving a middle-sized urban center might bring us closer to both urban quality and help to fulfil our commitments regarding the climate. This paper is part I of a double-paper, where part II (named ""Preliminary assessment of a fuel cell public transport system for a medium sized city in the year 2020"") [1] is presented at the same WIT-conference in Dresden (May, 2004). The basic functions of this new public transport system are presented in part I (this paper), with particular focus on those functional qualities figured in the assessment in part II. The climatic goal for a medium sized city in the year 2020 (in this case: 30 percent less CO2-emissions compared to the level of 1990) may be reached if at least one quarter of the vehicle fleet consists of fuel cell cars or if an advanced system of fuel cell-driven local public transport is installed. A combination would be the very best alternative to prepare the city to face the even tougher climatic goals to come. The city may also substitute its part of the national nuclear power program: if about half of the fuel cell car fleet mentioned above is generating electricity about half of the time the cars are parked. The precondition for local sustainability in this respect is that the initially waste- and bio-based hydrogen production is succeeded by renewable hydrogen production methods, working together. New built up areas may be climatically customised (heated, air conditioned etc.) by heat left over from parked fuel cell cars - while generating electricity - if these buildings are well designed for energy economising and adapted synergy. © 2004 WIT Press.","Environmental goal; Fuel cell public transport system; Hydrogen production; Infrastructure; Urban quality and liveability; Vehicle qualities","Electric generators; Electric power generation; Hydrogen production; Sustainable development; Environmental goal; Infrastructure; Public transport systems; Urban quality and liveability; Vehicle quality; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903444346

The lichen vegetation studied in terms of area cover as well as the air pollution sensitivity and preference for nitrogen of the individual lichens. During both surveys the lichen flora was strongly impoverished in urban areas compared to suburban areas and especially to the countryside (reference) areas nearby. The air pollution situation has improved in the area both before and during the study period. This holds especially for SO2, to a lesser extent also for NO2. Following the improvement of the air quality, an increased lichen area cover on the tree trunks was observed. Also the cumulative pollution sensitivity of the lichens present was higher in 1997 compared to 1986/88 in suburban and countryside areas. For the nitrogen impact, the increase from 1986/88 to 1997 was smaller than for pollution sensitivity, but still statistically significant. The trends are interpreted as signs of a normalisation of the lichen flora. It is concluded that the observed pattern of lichen recovery reflects the fact that the reduction of the air pollution level in the central parts of the towns is still not large enough to permit a large-scale recovery of the lichen flora, while in the suburban areas and the countryside next to the towns, the air quality has now improved to an extent, which permits the reinvasion of a number of lichens.","Air pollution; Lichens; Nitrogen dioxide; Nitrogen impact; Photographic method; Pollution sensitivity; Recovery; Sulphur dioxide; Sweden","Air pollution; Air quality; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Epiphytic lichen flora; Nitrogen impacts; Photographic techniques; Vegetation; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; epiphyte; lichen; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; air quality; article; industrial area; lichens; nonhuman; photography; statistical significance; Sweden; urban area; vegetation; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Dioxide; Plants; Sulfur Dioxide; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543052877

The WDS-PM sampler could selectively collect particulate samples in the gas streams from pre-set wind directions. A series of field tests were conducted to measure PM concentrations with both traditional PM and WDS-PM samplers to compare their performances. The tested fugitive sources included four civilconstruction fields and four paved roads in urban area. This research also applied WDS-PM samplers to investigate the contribution of street cleaning on air quality improvement. Experimental results indicated that the WDS-PM sampler could provide more accurate emission factors for PM release than traditional PM samplers. Based on the experimental results for field tests, it was observed that the emission of TSP and PM10 from traffic streets could be reduced by 64-91% and 50-94%, respectively, after the operation of road washing with water. But the emission reduction was only about 7.0 % for TSP and 3.4% for PM10 by dry road scrubbing.

They have contributed least to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is due to their location in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world and their low capacities to adapt to these changes. Adaptation to climate change has become an important policy priority in the international negotiations on climate change in recent years. However, it has yet to become a major policy issue within developing countries, especially the LDCs. This article focuses on two LDCs, namely Bangladesh and Mali, where progress has been made regarding identifying potential adaptation options. For example, Bangladesh already has effective disaster response systems, and strategies to deal with reduced freshwater availability, and Mali has a well-developed programme for providing agro-hydro-meteorological assistance to communities in times of drought. However, much remains to be done in terms of mainstreaming adaptation to climate change within the national policymaking processes of these countries. Policymakers need targeting and, to facilitate this, scientific research must be translated into appropriate language and timescales. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Bangladesh; Climate change; Climate policy; Least Developed Countries; Mainstreaming; Mali; Vulnerability","adaptation; climate change; developing world; hazard management; natural hazard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644457095

The assumption has usually been that the 'culprit' is the loosely bound adsorbed water, generating HF via bath hydrolysis as this surface water is flashed off during alumina feeding. Structural water, or more correctly, structural hydroxyl, also makes a significant contribution to HF generation. Laboratory experiments show that hydroxyl can dissolve in molten cryolitic electrolytes and gives rise to electrochemically generated HF. The electrochemically generated HF could be readily distinguished from HF generated via thermal hydrolysis. Experiments with aluminas of varying combinations of high and low surface adsorbed moisture and structural hydroxyl (as measured by their LOI (20-300) and LOI (300-1000), respectively) confirmed the importance of electrochemically generated HF from structural hydroxyl. While some of the structural hydroxide reacts rapidly at the time of feeding, it also contributes to the steady state HF emission. From plant studies it was estimated that up to 8 kg F/tonne Al was generated from structural hydroxyl, for aluminas containing 0.4 wt% LOI (300-1000) and assuming 3wt% alumina in the bath. Structural hydroxyl is found in transition alumina phases in smelter grade aluminas. Their presence ensures that even conservative smelter specifications of surface areas of 60-80 m 2/g can be met. Paradoxically, this surface area is specified to ensure that the HF adsorption capacity of the alumina is sufficient for scrubber requirements, but for reasons of both surface and structural water incorporation, having a high surface area also means that the alumina will generate more HF. This reopens the debate on the merits of high surface area aluminas.","Fluoride emissions; HF generation; Smelter grade alumina; Structural hydroxyl","Alumina feeding; Smelter grade alumina; Adsorption; Electrochemistry; Electrolytes; Exhaust gases; Hydrolysis; Moisture; Scrubbers; Smelting; Alumina",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442619447

The overall reduction rate is controlled by a complex combination of direct reactions and indirect reactions and never by gasification reaction. The final reduction of iron oxide is controlled by carburized carbon. The carburization of the reduced iron is mainly progressed by the direct carburization reaction, C(s)=[C]. As the carbon content approaches to the solidus line of the phase diagram of Fe-C system, the reduced iron particles are gradually forced to coalesce to grow in much larger particles. The coalescing rate is increased with temperature. Its driving force is the large surface energy of reduced iron due to its large specific surface area. Due to the coalescence, the particles of carbon are apt to lose the contact state with the reduced iron particles and to lose the ability to carburize the reduced iron. Therefore, the carburization exceeding the solidus line can be severely depressed. Consequently, the carburization up to the solidus line can be achieved at relatively lower temperatures, i.e. 1 200-1 250°C. As a result, the carbon content of reduced iron decreases with increasing temperature. Since the coal char has a very poor ability to directly carburize reduced iron, the carbon contents of reduced iron were very low and increased with increasing temperature. Graphite and coke possess the strongest and the intermediate carburizing abilities, respectively. And the carbon contents of the shell part and core part of reduced iron decreases with increasing temperature.","Carbon content; Carbonaceous material; Coalescence; Composite pellet; Detachment; Direct carburization; Free carbon; Iron ore; Reduced iron; Solidus line","Carburizing; Chemical reactions; Coalescence; Composite materials; Gasification; Ore pellets; Reduction; Thermal effects; Carbon content; Carbonaceous materials; Composite pellets; Detachment; Direct carburization; Free carbon; Reduced iron; Solidus lines; Iron ores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444266313

However, large-scale introduction of these locally optimized energy systems in a wider region may not necessarily reduce CO2 emission from the whole region. This is because optimization in a small area depends on CO2 emission per unit of commercial electricity that is determined by an assumed generation mix of commercial power. If these locally optimized energy systems are introduced on large scale, the optimal generation mix would be modified. This paper investigates the relation between the scale of locally optimized energy systems in a region and the CO2 emission from the region. The analysis is performed by developing an integrated model that consists of two separate optimization models, i.e., one is for energy systems in a small area and the other is for determining an optimal generation mix. The developed model is applied to Kansai region of Japan. The results show that large-scale introduction of locally optimized energy systems can generally reduce CO2 emission from the whole region. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Gas mixtures such as SF6/N2 and SF6/c-C4F8 have a desirable feature called synergy effect that the critical values of reduced electric field (E/N)lim are higher than the partial-pressure-weighted values obtained from (E/N)lim of their components. In order to obtain a guide to seek for new insulating gas mixtures with the synergy effect, we have investigated the synergy mechanism from a viewpoint of collaboration between electron energy loss by collisions and electron attachment. The following mechanisms have been indicated as primary factors of the synergy effect; (i) a large attachment cross section of SF6 lying in a low electron energy region plays the main role of the electron capture; (ii) in order to feed electrons into the low energy region of (i) efficiently, a steep rise of an inelastic collision cross section at its onset energy is required. We have evaluated these factors by a Boltzmann equation analysis, and have synthesized the synergy effect using model gases for demonstration. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Two widely adopted local cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L.), MR84 and MR185, were grown in open top chambers ventilated with charcoal-filtered air and non filtered air, and in adjacent open plots on the campus of University Putra Malaysia. This is located on the south side of the Klang Valley, a rapidly developing area embracing Kuala Lumpur and other satellite cities, but where agriculture remains important The experimental period was from October 2000 to January 2001, corresponding to the main rice growing season in peninsular Malaysia. Adverse impacts on rice growth and yield were observed and were attributed to phytotoxic levels of ambient ozone. There was a clear difference in the sensitivity of the two selected cultivars. A yield reduction of 6.3% was observed for cultivar MR185 (p < 0.01) which was largely due to an increase in grain sterility, whilst the yield reduction for cultivar MR84 was not statistically significant. The reasons for these differing responses are discussed, and a comparison of the present findings with crop responses to ozone found under European conditions suggests a higher sensitivity in our study crops. With increasing industrialisation and urbanisation, this study highlights the need for further examination of the sensitivity of a wider range of crops and cultivars to ambient air pollution in this region, and also points to the potential for appropriate cultivar selection to ameliorate impacts.","Ambient air pollution; Klang Valley; Malaysia; Open-top chamber; Oryza sativa L.; Ozone; Southeast Asian countries","Agriculture; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Ozone; Satellites; Ambient air pollution; Grain sterility; Rice growth; Air pollution; charcoal; ozone; air quality; ambient air; cultivar; rice; agriculture; air conditioning; air pollutant; ambient air; article; crop management; cultivar; Europe; filtration; industrialization; Malaysia; nonhuman; ozone layer; phytotoxicity; plant growth; rice; season; sensitivity analysis; statistical significance; tropics; university; urbanization; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Farm Crops; Grain; Ozone; Satellites; Asia; Eurasia; Klang Valley; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; West Malaysia; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543140666

Furthermore, hydrocarbons (hereafter, HC) from the fuel system must be reduced to near 0.0 grams, according to the PZEV (Partial Zero Emission Vehicle) regulations enforced from 2003. The wet film in intake ports and fuel leaking from the injector nozzles evaporate and diffuse while the car is parked, and consequently may cause HC to leak the air cleaner inlet. The air cleaner which prevents HC leakage from the air intake system is already in mass production. In the course of designing this product to be installed in a vehicle, the authors developed a method to estimate the amount of HC that reaches the air cleaner. Based on detailed investigation on HC distribution and the changes that occur during parking, the HC amount reaching the air cleaner was calculated by both the equation of diffusion and the equation of state. Therefore, application of this method enabled estimation of the reduction effects of HC diffusion gained by improving the air intake system in the stage of experimental production.

As automobiles are one of the major sources of energy consumption and urban emissions, engineers concerned are under significant pressure to improve their energy efficiency and reduce exhaust emission levels. While tremendous effort has been devoted in improving performance and reducing emissions of current engines, new technologies are also getting attention. One example is the Low Heat Rejection Engine (LHRE). A technological thrust is currently in progress to develop insulated, low heat rejection engines which exhibit higher thermal efficiency and improved exhaust emissions. The low heat rejection engine concept is not new. For the past two decades many have conducted experiments on low heat rejection engines. Although promising, the results of the experimental investigations have been somewhat mixed. Many have shown that insulation reduces heat transfer but none have shown substantial gains in efficiency, performance and emissions. Some investigators even concluded that insulation increases heat transfer and degrades the performance of the engine. This paper presents a general overview about the previous experimental research efforts into low heat rejection engine concept. This paper explains in detail the engine used, test conditions and constraints, insulation materials used, degree of insulation and results obtained by different researchers in their experimental investigation. The factors that affect thermal efficiency, other performance parameters and exhaust emissions were deduced and their influences discussed.

An increase of the emission intensity was observed both in the case of the mechanical injury and action of AsA or LA. It is pointed out that the use of the SPC is justifiable for samples requiring a high time resolution while the use of the SPCI for samples requiring determination of the space-distribution of emission.

Such kind of arc has been elaborated and studied at the Institute for a few years. Two arcs in series are used: The first one is a short gas stabilized argon arc with low gas flow rate. This arc creates a cathode for the second arc stabilized by water vortex. Parameters of the generated thermal plasma jet and plasma composition can be controlled by a change of parameters of both arcs and by conditions of their interaction. A two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model describes the region between the inlet and outlet nozzles in the arc discharge chamber. It is assumed that the plasma flow is steady, laminar, compressible and in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The governing equations with temperature-dependent transport and thermodynamic properties are solved numerically by the Finite Volume Method. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of different radiation models on the radial energy transfer from the hybrid arc and overall arc performance for different currents and molar ratios argon-water. We employ three radiation models in our calculation: The two models involve the net emission coefficients approach, and one of them accounts for the reabsorption of radiation at the colder arc boundary. In the third model, radiation transfer within the arc column is calculated using the partial characteristics method for atmospheric pressure water-argon arc discharge. Results carried out for 150-600 A and for argon mass flow rates 7.5-27.5 slpm proved that hybrid stabilized electric arc exhibits higher outlet velocities under the practically unchanged plasma enthalpy compared to Gerdien arc. Reabsorption of radiation implies higher outlet temperatures and velocities with respect the case for zero reabsorption. The amount of reabsorbed radiation in the method of partial characteristics is decreased since the molecules of water species have been neglected in calculation so far. Comparison between present calculation and experiments carried out on the hybrid plasma torch operating at the Institute shows a good agreement.",,"Absorption; Atmospheric pressure; Composition; Energy transfer; Enthalpy; Finite volume method; Flow of fluids; Plasma flow; Plasma jets; Plasma torches; Radiation; Thermodynamic properties; Gerdien arc; Radiation transfer; Thermal plasma jet; Thermodynamic equilibrium; Arc lamps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244260717

In the process of synthesizing ZnSe nanocrystallites, ZnSeO4·H2O crystallites precipitated in organic solvent was prepared first, then the crystallites were reduced with carbon monoxide atmosphere. The XRD analysis reveals the structure of ZnSe phase is sphalerite (cubic ZnS). XPS results show that the atomic ratio of Se/Zn was smaller than the nominal atomic ratio of the sample, which means the selenium element was volatilized seriously. The AFM images show that the size of ZnSeO4 crystallite was increased with the concentration of selenium element.

An economic evaluation of an enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM)/CO2 sequestration project in coalbed with properties similar to those found in the Northern Appalachian basin is presented. PSU-COALCOMP, a two-phase, multi-dimensional, dual porosity compositional coalbed methane reservoir simulator is used. The most important economic parameter to be considered in the design of the project is the net cost of CO2 (CO2 cost minus CO2 credit). A negative net cost of CO2 in the $0-0.75 range produced positive net present values (NPV) for reservoir permeabilities over 2mD. Lower permeabilities increase production times and costs, having detrimental effects on the economics of the project. Lower injection pressures are favorable for ECMB economics, but the opposite can be true for CO2 sequestration projects that can benefit from CO2 credits. The time to start CO2 injection have negligible influence on the final project economics. The analysis demonstrates the significance of reservoir size, proper design and implementation, and tax incentives for economic viability of projects for ECBM production, and coalseam sequestration.

Twenty-one states plus Washington DC are included in the program that will limit emissions during the ozone season. Coal-fired power plants, which emit most of the NOx in this region, are heavily impacted by these new restrictions. Power markets within the Eastern Interconnect will be affected by emission regulations, with the extent determined by compliance strategies chosen by plant owners. This paper presents a modeling methodology based on economic principles and power market rules to help coal-fired generation owners develop a NOx emission reduction strategy to comply with the SIP Call. Applying the model suggests that burner modifications and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) additions should be significant contributors to achieving regional compliance. Over 100 GW of installed coal capacity is determined to benefit from the addition of NOx controls. Additional selective catalytic reductions (SCR) constitute less than 1% of these modifications.","Costs; Economics; Emission; Incremental Cost; Iterative Methods; Nitrogen Compounds; Power Generation Dispatch; SIP Call","Costs; Economics; Environmental protection; Iterative methods; Marketing; Nitrogen compounds; Power generation; Regulatory compliance; Emission; Incremental cost; Power generation dispatch; State implementation plan (SIP) call; Strategic planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244278237

The use of nitrite as intermediate in the treatment of wastewater has been largely ignored, but is actually a relevant energy saving process compared to conventional nitrification/denitrification using nitrate as intermediate. Full-scale results and pilot-scale results using this process are presented. The process needs some additional process considerations and process control to be utilized. Especially under tropical conditions the nitritation process will round easily, and it must be expected that many AS treatment plants in the food industry already produce NO2-N. This uncontrolled nitrogen conversion can be the main cause for sludge bulking problems. It is expected that sludge bulking problems in many cases can be solved just by changing the process control in order to run a more consequent nitritation. Theoretically this process will decrease the oxygen consumption for oxidation by 25% and the use of carbon source for the reduction will be decreased by 40% compared to the conventional process. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Denitritation; Food industry; Nitritation; Nitrogen removal; Organic wastewater","Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Oxygen; Energy saving processes; Organic wastewaters; Oxygen consumptions; Wastewater; nitrite; nitrogen; Denitrification; Energy efficiency; food industry; Wastewater treatment; article; carbon source; controlled study; denitrification; developed country; energy conservation; food composition; food industry; intermethod comparison; nitration; nitrification; oxidation; oxygen consumption; pilot study; problem solving; process control; process development; sludge; Thailand; tropics; waste component removal; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244256120

The release of these plant-produced VOCs (i.e. terpenes) triggers the release of active biochemical defenses, which target the attacker. In some cases, the VOCs send cues to nearby carnivorous predators to attract them to the feeding herbivore. Volatile compounds are released both locally by damaged leaves and systemically by the rest of the plant. These compounds are released in large quantities, which facilitate detection of pests in the field by parasitoids. Detecting the plant's VOC emissions as a function of various parameters (e.g. ambient temperature, atmospheric nitrogen levels, etc.) is essential to designing effective biological control systems. In addition these VOC releases may serve as early warning indicator of chemo-bio attacks. By combining Raman spectroscopy techniques with Laser Remote Sensing (LIDAR) systems, we are developing a Standoff detection system. Initial results indicate that is it possible to detect and differentiate between various terpenes, plant species, and other chemical compounds at distances greater than 12 meters. Currently, the system uses the 2 nd harmonic of a Nd:YAG; however plans are underway to improve the Raman signal by moving the illumination wavelength into the solar-blind UV region. We report on our initial efforts of designing and characterizing this in a laboratory proof of concept system. We envision that this effort will lead to the design of a portable field-deployable system to rapidly characterize, with a high spatial resolution, large crops and other fields.","Chemical Sensors; LIDAR; Raman Spectroscopy; Stand-off; Terpenes","Biochemical defenses; Stand-off; Stress conditions; Terpenes; Agricultural engineering; Biodiversity; Chemical sensors; Control systems; Crops; Farms; Herbicides; Optical radar; Plants (botany); Raman spectroscopy; Soils; Stresses; Volatile organic compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442604260

This was fundamentally different than the strong and large recirculation regions that dominate flowfields of the HSI. Under simulated engine conditions, the LSI had the same operating range as the HSI. Its NOx emissions were ∼ 60% lower than the HSI and its CO emissions were comparable. The lack of a strong recirculation zone and the shorter residence time within the LSI might provide an explanation for the NOx reduction.

The technical and economic merits of the competing drive systems have to be considered for each individual project. Traditionally, gas turbines have been the prime drivers for compressor trains, especially in Europe whereas in North America gas engine driven reciprocating compressors are also very common. With the liberalization of the electric power market and tighter environmental restrictions regarding local emissions, high frequency electric motor drivers became a competitive alternative profiting by decreased costs for the electricity infrastructure and the power supply, thus lowering the investment and operational costs. Gas turbines in compliance with the latest emission regulations will maintain their predominant role in natural gas pipeline and storage applications, especially in non-residential and remote areas.

In the course of the European Council Directive on permissible air pollutant limit values, valid starting from 2005 there is an urgent call for action, particularly for fine dust (PM10). Current investigations (Junk & Helbig 2003, Reuter & Baumüller 2003) show that the limit values in certain places in congested areas are exceeded. Only if it is possible to locate these Hot Spots purposeful measures to reduce the ambient air pollution can be conducted. For an efficient identification of these Hot Spots numerical computer models or establishing special measurements networks are too expensive. Using the statistical model STREET 5.0 (KTT 2003) a cost-effective screening of the air pollution situation caused by the traffic can be done. Methods. STREET is based on the 3-dimensional micro-scale non-hydrostatic flow- and dispersion model MISCAM (Eichhorn 1989). The results of over 100.000 different calculations with MISCAM are stored in a Database and used to calculate the emissions with STREET. In collaboration with the city council of Trier more than 150 streets were investigated, mapped, and calculated. A special urban climate measuring network supplies the necessary meteorological input data about the wind field and precipitation events in the valley of the Moselle. Information about road width and road orientation as well as building density was derived from aerial photographs. Traffic censuses and mobile air pollutants measurements supplied the remaining input data. We calculated the mean annual air pollutant concentrations for NO2, CO, SO2, O3, benzene as well as PM10. Results. A comparison of the model results with the values obtained from the stations of the central emission measuring network of Rhineland-Palatinate (ZIMEN, annual report 2002) shows very good agreements. The model was not only used to calculate the annual air pollutant but also for urban planning and management. The absolute level of the air pollutant is mainly dependent on the amount of traffic in the street canyons. Therefore four different case-scenarios with varying quantity of traffic were calculated and interpreted for each street. The results of the calculation show that on the basis of the mean values for both NO2 and benzene, it is not to be expected that the limits will be exceeded significantly. Perspectives. Furthermore the model can be used to find the maximum tolerable numbers of cars for a street without exceeding the air pollutant thresholds.","Benzene; Germany; GIS; Numerical modelling; Traffic emissions; Urban air pollution","air quality; atmospheric pollution; benzene; planning method; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; urban pollution; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Rhineland-Palatinate; Trier",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930475117

MAP data in GRAM are augmented by specially derived longitude variation climatology. Atmospheric composition is represented in GRAM by concentrations of both major and minor species. Above 120 km, MET provides concentration values for N 2 , O 2 , Ar, O, He, and H. Below 120 km, species represented also include H 2 O, O 3 , N 2 O, CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 . Water vapor in GRAM is based on a combination of GUACA, Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL), and NASA Langley Research Center climatologies.

Multi-angle instruments such as Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) provide independent constraints on aerosol properties based on their sensitivity to the shape of aerosol scattering phase functions. The current MISR operational retrieval algorithm (version 16 and higher) was modified by incorporating new non-spherical dust models that account for naturally occurring dust shapes and compositions. We present selected examples of MISR version 16 retrievals over AERONET sunphotometer land and ocean sites during the passage of dust fronts. Our analysis shows that during such events MISR retrieves Angstrom exponents characteristic of large particles, having little spectral variation in extinction over the MISR wavelength range (442, 550, 672 and 866 nm channels), as expected. The retrieved fraction of non-spherical particles is also very high. This quantity is not retrieved by satellite instruments having only nadir-viewing cameras. Our comparison of current (version 16) MISR-retrieved aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with AERONET instantaneous AOT shows better coverage and stronger correlations than when making identical comparisons with previous AOT retrievals (version 15). The MISR algorithm successful mixtures include a non-spherical dust component with high frequency in retrievals over dark water and slightly lower frequency aver land. Selection frequencies of non-spherical dust models also decrease in dusty regions affected by pollution.","Atmospheric dust; MISR retrievals; Optical properties of nonspherical particles","Air pollution; Algorithms; Atmospherics; Dust; Imaging systems; Light scattering; Radiometers; Radiometry; Aerosol scattering; Atmospheric dust; Multi-angle imaging spectroradiometers (MISR) retrievals; Optical properties of nonspherical particles; Atmospheric aerosols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344386002

For this purpose, all obtainable data are initially considered and analysed, followed by an integrated numerical model developed from basic-principles, in order to estimate the air pollutants created from electricity generation. The results presented are based on official data, analysing the SO2, NOx and CO 2 gasses produced on the basis of the fuel utilized. Among the most interesting results of the present survey emerges the continuous increase of air pollutants with time, mainly attributable to the electricity demand amplification and the state policy of using Northern Greece lignite and imported natural gas in the mainland and diesel-oil in the Aegean Sea territories. This strategy practically leads to remarkable air pollution rise during the next decade, a fact that is also validated by the application of the analytical model developed.","Air pollution; Analytical model; Electricity generation; Emission factors; Energy coefficient; Energy policy; Thermal power stations","atmospheric pollution; electricity generation; emission control; energy policy; thermal power; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143149822

The valley incision started at the local ice-sheet terminus in the Young Pleniglacial following the Pomerian stage of the last glaciation (some 16÷15 ka BP) and, as marked by important changes of the river regime, was virtually over at c. 13.8 ka BP (Middle Lithuanian stage of deglaciation). Detailed geomorphologic survey coupled with stratigraphic analysis, 14C dating and pollen spectra provided sound evidence that the complex structure of the valley bottom resulted from the lateral migration of the river which in turn depended upon large-scale climatic changes. Besides of critically reviewing the literature data new, 14C dated pollen chronostratigraphies, fairly consistent with the up to date regional palynologic framework were obtained. Actually it has been found that the most important channel and sedimentation changes cluster at the AL/YD transition, c. 9300 BP, BO/AT transition, middle Atlantic, c. 4200 BP, c. 3250-3000 BP, Roman time (2100 BP) and 1000-900 BP, thus matching the timing of humid and cool climatic phases recorded by the enhanced activity of Belorussian and central European rivers. Though the first prehistoric settlements over the study area date back to Late Neolithic, Zelvianka valley was virtually unaffected by the human impact, except from some low intensity, local aeolian processes which developed in the Subboreal and Subatlantic on the deforested spots.","Belorussia; Climate fluctuations; Holocene; Pollen analysis; Radiocarbon dating; River valley",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983039617

The TIP instrument will primarily observe the airglow emission of the nighttime ionosphere caused by the radiative recombination of atomic oxygen. In addition, the TIP instrument will observe the auroral region boundaries from the emission caused by electron impact excitation. Six TIP instruments will be launched and flown simultaneously as each one is a payload carried aboard the Republic of China Satellite (ROCSAT-3) spacecraft as part of the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) program a constellation built and operated by the country of Taiwan. Observations will be made from three orbital planes spaced 60 degrees apart each containing two TIP instruments. The instruments will be able to provide global coverage as well as system and data redundancy in their intended orbital configuration. Raw data from the TIP instruments will be used for the characterization of ionospheric electron density gradients to improve ionospheric modeling. Data from the TIP instruments can also be combined with the data from the other two payloads on board the spacecraft that are a radio beacon and a GPS occultation experiment to result in enhanced ionospheric measurements. The TIP instrument design had to solve several design challenges in order to achieve its intended science and mission requirements. In addition, the design had to address the operational constraints imposed by the spacecraft and the cost constraints of multiple units.","Aurora; COSMIC; Ionosphere; Photometer; ROCSAT-3","Aurora; COSMIC; Photometer design; ROCSAT-3; Calibration; Carrier concentration; Electromagnetic wave emission; Global positioning system; Ionosphere; Machine design; Satellites; Tomography; Photometers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344400628

Therefore, the objective of the project was to investigate the interaction between copper (Cu) and either lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd) using equilibrium batch adsorption experiments. A first test consisted of soaking three types of sand-bentonite liner samples (0, 5, and 10% bentonite) with a respective cation exchange capacities (CEC) of 2, 6.4, and 10.8 cmol(+)/kg in one of nine solutions consisting of a combination of three pH levels (3.7, 5.5, and 7.5) and three heavy metal solutions (Cu alone, Cu with Cd, Cu with Pb) each offering a respective heavy metal equivalence of 1, 2, and 2 cmol(+)/kg of liner. A second test set consisted in soaking 5% bentonite liner samples in three solutions at a pH of 3.7, with either Cu alone or with Pb or Cd, at 4.8 cmol(+)/kg of liner. For up to 14 days, duplicate samples were sacrificed to determine the supernatant Cu level and pH. The results indicated that under acidic conditions (pH &lt; 6.5), the liner bentonite content, the solution pH and the presence of Pb or Cd significantly influenced Cu adsorption. Lead, and to a lesser extent Cd, competed with Cu for adsorption sites. Under alkaline conditions (pH &gt; 6.5), carbonate and hydroxyl precipitation governed and masked the Pb and Cd competition. Thus, at low pH, limiting the presence of Pb in landfill leachate can improve Cu adsorption.","Cd; Cu; Heavy metal adsorption; Pb; Sand-bentonite liners; Synergetic interactions","Adsorption; Cadmium; Disposability; Ion exchange; Lead; pH effects; Positive ions; Precipitation (chemical); Solid wastes; Cation exchange capacity (CEC); Landfill cells; Metal solutions; Ph levels; Copper; bentonite; cadmium; copper; heavy metal; hydroxyl group; lead; adsorption; article; cation exchange; chemical reaction; landfill; landfill leachate; pH measurement; precipitation; sand; segregation analysis; solid waste; Adsorption; Bentonite; Cadmium; Copper; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lead; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Silicon Dioxide; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544323549

It discusses the consequences of introducing a fuel cell public transport system in a fictitious medium sized city in Europe, ""Excity"". First, the vehicle stock capacity needed for reducing congestion to an acceptable level is calculated. Thereafter, a route system is designed for a light rail or a guided bus system, both of them using modularly designed 12 meter fuel cell vehicles. The effect requirement and energy use per vehicle, as well as the total hydrogen required for the complete transport system are calculated. Different methods of producing sustainable hydrogen are described and compared regarding carbon dioxide emissions and land use. Benefits of a co-evolution between the infrastructures of the urban hydrogen and the public transport system are also discussed. The possibility of using automatic operation in certain parts of the routes combined with divisible sets of vehicles is assessed, as well as using these vehicles for producing electricity and heat when parked. The carbon dioxide emissions of the new urban transport system are calculated and compared with a ""business as usual"" scenario with respect to environmental goals. The reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the increased rider-ship in the local public transport system proposed -full use - is not large, but might fulfil the goals of 2020. If more of the longer trips within the entire urban network are also substituted, and if the possibility of using parked fuel cell cars for producing electricity and heat at park & ride facilities, stimulated by some earnings for the car owners and by the added values in the public transport system, is exploited, the effect could be quite substantial. © 2004 WIT Press.","Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Public transport; Transition management","Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Global warming; Hydrogen; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Vehicles; Business-as-usual; Carbon dioxide emissions; Fuel cell vehicles; Preliminary assessment; Public transport; Public transport systems; Transition management; Urban transport systems; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903441360

As of September 2003, HETE-2 had localized 47 GRBs; 16 localizations had led to the detection of an X-ray, optical, or radio afterglows. The prompt position notification of HETE-2 enabled probing the nature of so-called ""dark bursts"" for which no optical afterglows were found despite of accurate localizations. In some cases, the optical afterglow was found to be intrinsically faint, and its flux declined rapidly. In another case, the optical emission was likely to be extinguished by the dust in the vicinity of the GRB source. The bright afterglows of GRB021004 and GRB030329 were observed in unprecedented details by telescopes around the world. Strong evidence for the association of long GRBs with the core-collapse supernovae was found. HETE-2 has localized almost as many X-ray rich GRBs as classical GRBs. The nature of the X-ray rich GRBs and X-ray flashes have been studied systematically with HETE-2, and they are found to have many properties in common with the classical GRBs, suggesting that they are a single phenomenon.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044227155

As a result of that work, a combustion concept, called Modulated Kinetics (MK) combustion, was developed that reduces NOx and smoke simultaneously through low-temperature combustion and premixed combustion to achieve a cleaner diesel engine. In subsequent work, it was found that applying a low compression ratio was effective in expanding the MK combustion region on the high-load side. The MK concept was then combined with an exhaust after-treatment system and applied to a test vehicle. The results indicated the attainment of ULEV emission levels, albeit in laboratory evaluations. In the present work, the combination of the MK combustion concept and certain fuel properties has been experimentally investigated with the aim of reducing exhaust emissions further. The results indicated that the use of a high cetane number gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel with a lower compression ratio provides a sufficiently long ignition delay to accomplish MK combustion. The effect on a simultaneous reduction of NOx and smoke was confirmed. The results also indicated that the use of GTL fuel can reduce the total hydrocarbon level substantially under a cold condition because of its good ignition characteristics, with a high cetane number and high levels of paraffin compounds. As a result, one possible approach to the attainment of SULEV emission levels was found.

Oerst., in which leaf shape, size and arrangement vary systematically with altitude and geographic origin. Measurements of incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were made in the laboratory at solar angles corresponding to noon at summer solstice, winter solstice and equinox on branches collected from a common garden experiment. Tasmanian plants showed more self-shading than Victorian plants in summer and equinox. This was related to branch angle, leaf arrangement and leaf shape. Using a modelled light response-curve, we estimated the carbon assimilation rate and the flux density of excess photons at different incident PPFD. Victorian plants had higher predicted assimilation rates than Tasmanian plants in summer and equinox, but were exposed to substantially greater levels of excess photons. Because of the shape of the light-response curve, self-shading appears to reduce the plant's exposure to excess photons, thus providing photoprotection, without substantially reducing the carbon assimilation rate. This is dependent on both regional origin and season.","Assimilation; Leaf morphology; Photoprotection; Phyllotaxy; Self-shading","Carbon; Climate change; Cooling; Forestry; Photons; Photosynthesis; Photon fluxes; Rainforest trees; Plants (botany); altitude; leaf morphology; light use efficiency; photoprotection; photosynthesis; Fagus; Nothofagus; Nothofagus cunninghamii; Victoria",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042703360

The study investigates the contribution from urban versus regional sources of particle number and mass concentration. The total particle number (ToN) and NOx, are well correlated at the urban and near-city level and show a distinct diurnal variation, indicating the common traffic source. The average ToN at the three stations differs by a factor of 3. The observed concentrations are 2500#cm-3 4500#CM-3 and 7700#cm -3 at rural, near-city and urban level, respectively. PM10 and total particle volume (ToV) are well correlated between the three different stations and show similar concentration levels, in average within 30% relative difference, indicating a common source from long-range transport that dominates the concentrations at all locations. Measures to reduce the local urban emissions of NOx and ToN are likely to affect both the street level and urban background concentrations, while for PM10 and ToV only measurable effects at the street level are probable. Taking into account the supposed stronger health effects of ultrafine particles reduction measures should address particle number emissions. The traffic source contributes strongest in the 10-200 nm particle size range. The maximum of the size distribution shifts from about 20-30 nm at kerbside to 50-60 nm at rural level. Particle formation events were observed in the 320 nm size range at rural location in the afternoon hours, mainly under conditions with low concentrations of preexisting aerosol particles. The maximum in the size distribution of the ""traffic contribution"" seems to be shifted to about 28 nm in the urban location compared to 22 nm at kerbside. Assuming NOx as an inert tracer on urban scale allows to estimate that ToN at urban level is reduced by 15-30% compared to kerbside. Particle removal processes, e.g. deposition and coagulation, which are most efficient for smallest particle sizes (&lt;20 nm) and condensational growth are likely mechanisms for the loss of particle number and the shift in particle size. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043069140

H 2, D2, Kr have high values of the deactivation rate constants of X2 ∑ + level. So the possibility of quasicontinuous laser on B-X transition of CO+ is determined by the ratio of the upper and lower laser levels quenching rates of H2, D2 molecules, Kr atoms. In the present work the luminescence spectra of gas mixtures with carbon monoxide under α- particle excitation are investigated. CO+ (B) quenching rate constants are obtained from dependence of the CO first negative system intensity on gases partial pressure in He+CO+H2 (D2, Kr) mixtures. At the analysis of experimental dates the population of the upper level during He2 +-CO charge exchange was taken into account. Efficiency of B 2 ∑u, v=0+ level population was defined by the ratio of the intensities of 1 system of N2 and Baldet - Johnson system in He-N2 and He-CO mixtures. The upper limit for the CO + (B) quenching rate constant in collisions with H2 (D2, Kr) is estimated as: kq&lt;10-10 cm 3 s-1.

It was demonstrated that the temperature-phased anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (TPASBR) system for the co-digestion of sewage sludge and food waste resulted in enhanced volatile solids (VS) reduction and methane production rate. At the organic loading rate (OLR) of 2.7 g VS/l/d, the TPASBR system showed the higher VS reduction (61.3%), CH4 yield (0.28 l/g VSadded) and CH4 production rate (0.41 l CH4/l/d) than those (0.29 l CH4/l/d) of the mesophilic two-stage ASBR (MTSASBR). In the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests on thermophilic biomass of the TPASBR system, the average SMA of acetate (93 ml CH4/gVSS/d) was much higher than those of propionate (46 ml CH4/g VSS/d) and butyrate (76 ml CH4/g VSS/d). Also, higher specific hydrolytic activity (SHA, 217 mg COD/g VSS/d) of the biomass supported fast hydrolysis under thermophilic conditions. The track study revealed that the most active period of the 24 h cycle was between 6 and 12 h. The enhanced performance of the TPASBR system could be attributed to longer solids retention time, fast hydrolysis, higher CH4 conversion rate, and balanced nutrient condition of co-substrate. It was verified that this combination could be a promising and practical alternative for the simultaneous recycling of two types of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) with high stability. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Anaerobic digestion; Co-digestion; Food waste; Sewage sludge; Temperature-phased anaerobic sequencing batch reactor","Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Bioreactors; Food products; Methane; Reduction; Anaerobic sequencing; Batch reactors; Food wastes; Thermophilic biomass; Sewage sludge; acetic acid; butyric acid; hydrolase; methane; propionic acid; anaerobic process; Sewage; sludge; Waste disposal; Wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; biomass; chemical reaction; controlled study; hydrolysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; sequencing batch reactor; sludge; sludge digestion; sludge treatment; temperature dependence; waste component removal; Gadus morhua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244261652

The fuels used throughout the validation program were diesel fuels with less than 15-ppm sulfur content. Trucks and buses were retrofitted with two types of passive DPFs. Two rounds of emissions testing were performed to determine if there was any degradation in the emissions reduction. The results demonstrated robust emissions performance for each of the DPF technologies over a one-year period. Detailed descriptions of the overall program and results have been described in previous SAE publications [2, 3, 4, 5]. In 2002, a third round of emission testing was performed by NREL on a small subset of vehicles in the Ralphs Grocery Truck fleet that demonstrated continued robust emissions performance after two years of operation and over 220,000 miles. As of 2003, there are still questions about the durability of the passive DPF technology. Will the technology maintain emissions reduction performance over a long period of operation? Will it meet the durability criteria expected by the heavy-duty diesel community? A fourth round emissions evaluation of a subset of the Ralphs Grocery Truck fleet from the original ARCO EC-Diesel™ Technology Validation Program [2] was performed and an assessment of the technology will be presented in this paper. Emissions testing was performed during the summer of 2003 to provide data covering 3-1/2 years of operation and 340, 000 miles. The evaluation will examine some of the key parameters that allows for the successful implementation of the passive DPF in this heavy-duty application. This will include examining the engine exhaust gas temperatures, the backpressures created by the DPF and NOx/PM ratios provided by the engine application. The results will show that with a NOx/PM ratio better than 20:1 and exhaust gas temperatures above 250°C, the technology will provide robust long-term performance with emission reductions of 99% PM, 85% HC, and 65% CO in a heavy-duty application with some significant variability associated with the CO and HC measurements.

This paper reports the results of a 16-yr subsurface tile drainage research study on a site located in southeastern Indiana, USA. The site includes three tile drain spacings (5, 10, and 20 m) managed for 10 years with chisel tillage in monoculture corn (Zea mays L.) and currently managed under a no-till corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Drainflow volumes are continuously recorded and the water is sampled for nitrate-N on a flow-proportional basis. Additional field measurements have included soil water content and potential, water table, and crop yield. In general, drainflow and nitrate-N losses per unit area increase as drain spacing becomes narrower. Drainflow removed between 8 and 26% of annual rainfall, depending on the year and drain spacing. Nitrate-N concentrations in the drainflow did not vary with spacing, but concentrations have significantly decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiment. Concentrations dropped from a mean of 28 mg L-1 in the 1986-1988 period, to a mean of 8 mg L-1 in the 1997-1999 period. The reduction in concentration was due to both a reduction in fertilizer N rates over the course of the experiment and to the addition of a winter cover crop as a ""trap crop"" after corn in the corn-soybean rotation. Average annual nitrate-N mass losses dropped from 38 kg ha-1 in the 1986-1988 period, to 15 kg ha -1 in the 1997-1999 period, and losses were greatest for the narrowest spacing. Most of the nitrate-N losses occurred during the dormant season, when most of the drainage occurred. Results of this study underscore the necessity of long-term research on different soil types and in different climatic zones, in order to develop appropriate management strategies for both economic crop production and protection of environmental quality.","Cover crops; Drainage; Leaching; Nitrate; Tiles; Water quality","Fertilizers; Leaching; Nitrates; Rain; Soils; Tile; Water; Cover crops; Soil water content; Tile drainage; Water tables; Drainage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844539491

It is based on a generalization of a model previously proposed by Tamano et al.1. The new model is evaluated through comparisons with both finite element analyses and test data. It is more accurate in dealing with combined internal pressure, external pressure and axial load than, for example, the model currently provided in API Bulletin 5C32. The joint API/ISO SC5 Work Group 2B tasked with modernizing the API 5C3 property equations has evaluated a number of collapse models available in the literature on their performance against several different collapse databases.

Considering the drawback of installing an end-use CGS into the customer with small or middle scale floor space, however, it is difficult to achieve those distinctive features because the thermal-electricity ratio of CGS does not always be in agreement with that of customer energy demand. In order to overcome that matching deficiency, it is hence better to organize an on-site generator network based on mutual electricity and heating transmission. But focusing on some cogenerators underlying their behaviors on maximizing their own profits, this on-site network, which situation corresponds to a grand coalition, is not necessarily established because of each cogenerator's motivation to form a partial coalition and acquire its own profit as much as possible. In this paper, we attempt to analyze the optimal operation of an on-site generator network and identify by applying the nucleolus of the cooperative game theory the optimal benefit allocation strategy in order for the cogenerators to construct the network. Regarding the installation site of this network, the center of Tokyo area is assumed, which locational information includes floor space and so forth through a GIS (geographic information system) database. The results from the nucleolus suggest that all districts should impartially obtain the benefit from organizing network for the purpose of jointly attaining the system total cost reduction. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Soot emissions are also very low due to the premixed nature of combustion. However, the unburned hydrocarbon emissions are relatively high and the same holds for CO emissions. The formation of these pollutants, for a given fuel, is strongly affected by the temperature distribution as well as by the charge motion within the engine cylinder. The foregoing physical mechanisms determine the local ignition timing and burning rate of the charge affecting engine efficiency, performance and stability. Obviously the success of any model describing HCCI combustion depends on its ability to describe adequately both the chemistry of combustion and the physical phenomena, i.e. heat and mass transfer within the cylinder charge. In the present study a multi-zone model is developed to describe the heat and mass transfer mechanism within the cylinder. The main objective is to determine the temperature of each zone during the processes of compression, combustion and expansion. This will provide in-cylinder temperature distribution that obviously determines the ignition angle and combustion rate of the charge. The position and configuration of each zone relative to the others and to the engine cylinder is determined by geometrical considerations. The zones are allowed to exchange heat based on the local gas temperature difference. Mass transfer between zones is also considered as imposed by the motion of the piston. For the prediction of charge ignition and combustion rate a simplified model is used, to evaluate the behavior of the present model under firing conditions. Moreover the effect of equivalence ratio, initial charge temperature and compression ratio on the temperature distribution and mass transfer is examined. Thus the goal of the present work is not to concentrate on the chemical kinetics but to develop a phenomenological model capable of providing a realistic distribution of the charge temperature. This model can then be coupled to models describing accurately the reaction mechanism.

Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are an effective means of significantly reducing PM emissions from vehicles powered by diesel engines. This paper outlines the use of the ActiveClean™ Thermal Regenerator (TR) system to reduce PM emissions in several different applications. Test cell data was collected using a 15.8L diesel engine to provide exhaust flow. The objective of this test was to evaluate the steady state HC, CO and NOx emissions of the engine and TR combination during regeneration of the filter. The data reveals only a slight increase in HC and CO emissions depending on configuration (single-or dual-leg) for steady state regenerations. It also showed that the TR had very little impact on NOx emissions during regeneration. The ActiveClean™ Thermal Regenerator was also tested in a FTP cycle on two different diesel engines, and these tests showed that the system was able to achieve over 80% PM reduction. The systems were also installed on several vehicles in various configurations: a 10° single-leg unit was installed on a 4.8L diesel engine, 12° single-leg units were installed on 5.5L and 6.1L diesel engines, and a dual-leg 12° system was installed on a 12.5L and a 14.6L diesel engine. The installations demonstrated that with an ActiveClean™ Thermal Regenerator visible PM emissions were eliminated. These applications show the potential for significant reduction in diesel engine particulate matter emissions over a wide range of applications.

Due to the conflict between particulate and NOx emissions, both components of the exhaust gas are limited: The combination of direct injection of diesel into the combustion bowl and limited adoption of air swirl causes locally fuel-rich regions which lead to soot and burn at high peak temperatures in stoichometric regions. Simultaneously, the transient drive-off torque and the maximum power output are limited due to the time which is necessary for the mixture formation process. By means of intensified flow energy and a demand-oriented regulation of the air mass flow using an impulse charging device for diesel engines, locally fuel rich regions inside the combustion bowl can be minimized which finally influences the NOx-Soot Trade-Off by inside-engine measures and improves low-end torque and power characteristics. Current high-pressure injection systems mainly influence the combustion process by fuel-energy guided measures (shift of timing and pressure level). The air-energy guided influencing of mixture formation by means of a required utilization of timing and swirl energy is not possible concerning current diesel engines.

Stormwater runoff from Caltrans construction sites and roadways is subject to the federal Clean Water Act and its associated NPDES permit program. Caltrans began implementing a Statewide Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) in 1996. In conformance with EPA directives, Caltrans control efforts have focussed on ""best management practices"" (BMPs) to control sources of pollutants in storm water. For the most part, BMPs consist of common sense pollution prevention techniques rather than use of structural treatment facilities. The same approach, using non-structural controls, has also been applied to urban runoff from large regulated municipalities and runoff from construction sites. During 1999, the regulatory climate for storm water management in California changed dramatically. New permit requirements will require methods that achieve higher levels of pollutant control than are achieved by conventional BMPs. The statewide storm water permit recently issued to Caltrans, as well as other recently issued municipal permits, require that storm water discharges comply with established water quality standards. Compliance with these standards is a significantly more stringent requirement than was previously applied to these discharges. Also, limited information is available regarding the technology and other controls that can be used to meet these more stringent requirements. Caltrans has modified its Storm Water Management Plan to incorporate this new goal. In addition, Caltrans has initiated an extensive research and pilot-testing program to identify technologies that can be used to meet water quality standards.

Accordingly the US' three major concerns in The Hague about the Kyoto Protocol have been investigated with the following result. Firstly, the EU should scrap the supplementarity principle of 50% domestic reduction or at least reduce it considerably. This would lower costs particularly by enhancing more free trade with emission permits. Secondly, the EU should support the US proposal to incorporate carbon sinks into the Protocol. Thirdly, the developing countries should be persuaded to make binding commitments preventing any carbon leakage which is harmful to the American economy. Together these measures should minimize US compliance costs, and ensure for the US a positive net gain from participation and thereby provide an incentive to rejoin. The overall result is that the EU necessarily has to make concessions to persuade the World's largest CO2 emitter to join international climate negotiations again. This would ensure environmental improvement and co-operation in contrast to the present situation of US refusal to participate.","Carbon leakage; Carbon sinks; European Union; International climate negotiations; Kyoto agreement; Supplementarity principle; United States","Contracts; Costs; Environmental impact; Particulate emissions; Domestic reductions; Kyoto agreement; Public policy; climate change; environmental protection; European Union; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242716713

Relationships of clay minerals, as well as their morphological and structural peculiarities, are described for each type. It is demonstrated that sediments formed under the substantial influence of hydrocarbon fluid fluxes are characterized by a high (relative to hemipelagic sediments) content of smectites and mixed-layer clay minerals of the illite-smectite series.

In the case of bovine carbonic anhydrase (CAB), a significant release of calcein was observed at pH 4. The conformational change of CAB from the native to the molten-globule (MG) state was confirmed using an aqueous two-phase partitioning method and immobilized liposome chromatography. The CAB-liposome interaction was maximum at a specific pH (4.0), where the CAB conformation was an MG-like state. The results may show that the hydrophobic interaction between CAB and liposomes enhances the perturbation of the liposome membrane, leading to a significant release of calcein from liposomes. These phenomena depended not only on the characteristics of proteins (local hydrophobicity, LHpr) but also on the dynamic properties of liposomes (membrane fluidity). These results obtained with CAB may be extended to other proteins. The manner of protein-induced calcein release was classified into at least two types. Calcein release due to the addition of proteins having either disulfide bonds or being rich in beta-sheet structure was not observed. On the contrary, a significant release of calcein was observed in the case of a reduced protein with a cleaved disulfide bond and in the case of a protein with relatively a low content of beta-sheet structure. These findings suggest that a liposome containing calcein can be used as an effective sensor element for the detection of proteins having large structural fluctuations.","Calcein release; Immobilized liposome chromatography; Liposome-protein interaction; Local hydrophobicity; Membrane fluidity; Membrane perturbation; Molten-globule (MG) state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744280042

Today, less than 1.2 million ha remain. However, over the past 10-15 years, public land managers have begun to restore many longleaf pine forests. More recently incentive programs have prompted reforestation and afforestation programs on nonindustrial private lands. These activities have been facilitated by improved longleaf regeneration technology and by expanded educational and outreach efforts. In the South, there is also a growing trend towards longer rotations due to changes in wood/fiber markets and prices. These trends suggest a new strategy to increase terrestrial carbon storage in the southeastern United States in a way that provides many simultaneous ecological and economic benefits. For example, longleaf pine is a long-lived species with a low mortality rate. Among the southern pine species, it has a high specific gravity and can tolerate a very wide variety of habitats. Longleaf pine is better able to sustain growth at older ages (over 150 years) and is tolerant to fire and many insects and diseases. Recent research also indicates that longleaf pine managed for longer rotations outperforms other commercial southern pine species on most sites and might better adapt to future climate scenarios with higher temperatures and higher atmospheric CO2 levels. Moreover, the higher-value, longer-lasting wood products derived from longleaf pine forests will continue to store carbon over long time periods. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Carbon storage; Longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; Us southern forests","Carbon; Climate change; Diseases; Economic and social effects; Growth kinetics; Land use; Sustainable development; Carbon sink; Carbon storage; Longleaf pine; US southern forests; Forestry; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest; reforestation; strategic approach; afforestation; carbon storage; economics; ecosystem; ecosystem regeneration; fiber; forest; high temperature; insect; pine; reforestation; review; rotation; species habitat; United States; Carbon; Climates; Diseases; Economic Analysis; Forestry; Land Use; Sustainable Forest Management; Hexapoda; Insecta; Pinus echinata; Pinus palustris",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544439147

After a long period of intensified pollution hitting the peak at the end of the 80s, reduced amount of emissions from main industrial and municipal sources led to a lower pollution load of the Elbe and its principal tributaries. The scope and speed of such water quality changes is unprecedented in the Czech as well as in the European perspective. Decrease in the pollution level is however spatially limited to the Elbe river and its main tributaries. Further reduction of emission load will not result in corresponding decline of water pollution. This is due to different evolution of rivers of different sizes, but mainly to insufficient decrease of pollution load in the headstream areas of the river basin. It is this area of small watercourses that has to be in the centre of attention because without its radical changes it isn't possible to ensure permanent improvement of water quality in the Elbe and its tributaries.","Elbe; Hydrology; Modelling; Pollution; Water quality","hydrological modeling; pollutant source; river basin; tributary; water pollution; water quality; Central Europe; Elbe River; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24944505366

This paper presents analysis and estimates of the potential mill-level air emissions and financial performance of future commercial BLGCC systems described in technical detail in the companion paper. Also, potential regional and national impacts on energy consumption and emissions are estimated under different future BLGCC market penetration scenarios. Emission estimates for SO2, NOX, CO, volatile organic carbon (VOCs), particulate matter, total reduced sulfur (TRS) and CO2 are developed based on detailed quantitative data for Tomlinson furnaces and on extrapolation of gas turbine emissions and other relevant data for BLGCC systems. Prospective economics for a hypothetical representative mill in the Southeastern U.S. are assessed by assuming that an investment would be made in a new power/recovery system to replace an existing Tomlinson system that has reached the end of its working life. Key inputs to the financial analysis include the mass/energy balances shown in the companion paper and engineering cost estimates for each power/recovery system that were developed by two outside engineering firms. Because the overall objective of the study was to examine the long-term commercial potential for BLGCC, the capital cost estimates were based on assumed ""Nth plant"" levels of technology maturity and operational reliability. Widespread commercial implementation of BLGCC systems in the United States would enable significant energy savings for the country as a whole. Significant reductions in emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases could also be achieved, especially in the Southeastern United States, where two-thirds of U.S. kraft pulp mills are located. Relative to state-of-the-art Tomlinson systems, financial returns on investment are attractive without explicit valuation of environmental benefits. With monetary valuation of such benefits, the financial returns are very attractive.",,"Costs; Gasification; Industrial emissions; Kraft pulp; Paper and pulp mills; Papermaking; Volatile organic compounds; Emission reduction; Total reduced sulfer (TRS); Lignin; Black Liquors; Costs; Gasification; Greenhouse Gases; Kraft Pulping; Paper Making; Paper Mills; Pulp Mills; Voc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244255111

We take the view that SD is most applicable at the urban or societal level, since it includes issues of social equity and broad issues of economics, in addition to concerns about ecosystems and human health. It is difficult to apply these broader societal issues to buildings in a practical way and instead, many building researchers and designers find it more meaningful to develop models of building performance that is consistent with SD at the societal level. In short, Green Building helps to support a broader Sustainable Development agenda. If Sustainable Development goals are to be truly reached, we could argue that buildings should consume no energy, water or materials, and should produce no emissions, noise or waste over their lifespans. While this is an interesting concept, it is likely that we will have to work towards more modest goals during the next 20 years. Even at a more realistic level, there is global interest in improving the performance of buildings.

The steam-based thermal processes are energy intensive and hence, high carbon dioxide (CO 2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), emissions. There are potentials for the reduction of CO 2 emissions by capturing and disposal of CO 2 for pressure maintenance during the later stage of these thermal operations. This paper describes the numerical investigation on the feasibility of using CO 2 for pressure maintenance during a steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) wind-down process in an Athabasca bitumen reservoir in Northern Alberta, Canada. It is found that SAGD wind-down process with CO 2 injection is feasible although oil recovery performance is slightly sacrificed. The oil recovery performance during the wind-down period with pure CO 2 injection is slightly better than those with other gas injections such as flue gas (i.e., a mixture of nitrogen (N 2) and CO 2) and pure N 2 mainly because CO 2 acts as a solvent in reduction of the bitumen viscosity. From a GHG storage point of view, CO 2 storage capacity of approximately 2 × 10 7 sm 3 (or 37,244 tonne) in a single Athabasca-type SAGD pattern with dimensions of 100 m wide, 500 m long and 25 m thick can be achieved. CO 2 balance indicates that CO 2 stored during SAGD wind-down processes is less than the CO 2 emitted from steam generation during the initial SAGD period. However, ""CO 2 credit"" in the order of 10,000 tonne can still be claimed in a single SAGD pattern because using CO 2 as steam substitute during the wind-down process results in less CO 2 emission compared to continuously operating the SAGD process. Recently, numerical prediction in this study has been validated qualitatively by the experimental observations of SAGD pressure maintenance from a low-pressure/low-temperature CT experiment and a high-pressure/high-temperature 2-D experiment conducted at the Alberta Research Council (ARC).",,"Greenhouse gases (GHG); Steam assisted drainage gravity (SAGD); Thermal processes; Additives; Carbon dioxide; Industrial emissions; Numerical methods; Particulate emissions; Pressure effects; Steam; Viscosity; Oil fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942576041

Both federal (New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards) as well as state regulations require targeted industries to control fugitive VOC emissions through the implementation of Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programs. Unlike other regulations, LDAR requirements are work practice standards with no set emission standards to be achieved. However, chemical processing facilities, being on the NSR ""List of 28"", must also include fugitive emissions when determining net emissions increases of new or modified sources for New Source Review analyses. Therefore, these facilities are required to determine potential fugitive VOC emissions when evaluating new construction and process modification projects. A background on the most common methods of estimating fugitive VOC emissions is provided including an explanation of the underlying piping component counts and various sets of emission factors available to environmental professionals. The possibility of having a fluctuating potential to emit (PTE) from groups of such sources is illustrated.

RF current scanning, transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell and semi-anechoic chamber were used for characterization of the radiated emission. It is found that the distribution area and intensity of radiated emission for the SIP is far less complicated and two times smaller than those of the discrete PCB. Apparently, TEM cell method indicates that characterization for EMI of the SIP is approximately 6∼15dBuV lower in the entire frequency range compared to the discrete PCB. For the semi-anechoic chamber, radiated emission of the SIP is much lower than the discrete system, and discrepancy is maximum 15dBuV and 7dBuV in lower and higher frequency region, respectively. Furthermore, effects of the power net impedance and power bouncing noise has been taken into account for speculation of the EMI behavior. Overall, the SIP demonstrates better EMI behaviors than the discrete system due primarily to reduction of the radiation source in size and interconnection length. Consequently, such reduction of radiated emission from the SIP is an immaculate benefit for EMI in higher frequency region. Furthermore, EMI behavior of the SIP fabricated with multilayer PCB will also be characterized and compared to the SIP and discrete system.","Discrete system; Electromagnetic interference (EMI); Printed circuit board (PCB); Radiated emission; RF current scan; Semi-anechoic chamber; System in packag (SIP); TEM cell","Computer simulation; Electric fields; Electric impedance; Fabrication; Integrated circuits; Microcontrollers; Performance; Random access storage; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Transmission electron microscopy; Discrete systems; Radiated emissions; RF current scan; Semi-anechoic chambers; System in package (SIP); TEM cell; Printed circuit boards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644335131

Compared to today's levels, a 90% reduction in particulate matter (PM) must be achieved by 2007, and a 90% reduction in nitric oxides (NOx) must be achieved by 2010. This paper focuses on the technology solutions possible for engine makers for the interim 2007-2009 timeframe and discusses the additional NOx reduction strategies for a 2010 compliant engine. The possibility of achieving a larger portion of the interim 2007-2009 NOx standard through in-cylinder control methods rather than by NOx exhaust treatment is discussed. High levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and advanced injection strategies to modify the conventional diesel combustion process are just two processes that can be accommodated in many of today's engine designs. Variable valve actuation (VVA) will help control air management and residual as well as provide exhaust gas temperature control for exhaust treatment synergy. Advanced control strategies will be used to control transient emissions. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) will be used for the primary particulate control as of 2007, notwithstanding additional PM countermeasures that can be obtained from fuel system control. The remaining significant issues of fuel consumption and durability are discussed in light of alternative solutions.

The Stage 1 Study evaluated the potential of various forms of RE technologies for wide-scale local use, and related legal, institutional and promotional issues. It also made recommendations for formulating an implementation strategy. The Stage 1 Study was completed in early 2003. Upon reviewing current technological trends and applications, and taking into account Hong Kong's local characteristics, RE technologies that are considered potentially feasible for wide-scale application in Hong Kong include: a. Solar power; b. Wind Power; and c. Energy from waste. Public consultation on the findings and recommendations was conducted from February till April 2003, and the results indicated that the public are more receptive to RE than the consultant have envisaged. The Stage 2 Study is a design and build project involving the installation of a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system in the Wanchai Tower.

Investigation of the leak determined that the root cause was corrosion of the steel cylinder where the concrete lining had been cut back to weld the joint and the lining had not been repaired. This design change was apparently made during construction as the original design called for external bell-bolted joint restraint for an adjacent 90-degree elbow. Based on the leak investigation findings, a decision was made to take advantage of the shut down to evaluate the condition and serviceability of 518 meters (1,700 feet) of the pipeline isolated for the leakage repairs. The investigations conducted and the subsequent pipeline rehabilitation techniques employed on the South Plainfield 1.52-meter (60-inch) PCCP are presented as well as current program efforts to monitor and assess the overall condition of PCCP pipelines in the EWC system. The 1.52-meter (60-inch) diameter PCCP South Plainfield water transmission main was constructed of pipe manufactured by the Interpace Corporation (Interpace) around 1977. Prestress wire used in the pipe manufacture was high strength ""Class IV,"" with a history of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. As a proactive approach to managing the South Plainfield pipeline, a comprehensive failure investigation and condition assessment program was conducted. An initial visual and sounding inspection was performed. Nine additional internally field welded joints, where the concrete lining had been cut back similar to the leaking pipe. 55 additional joints were observed in need of joint mortar repairs where the parging had deteriorated or fallen out. One pipe length in a state of incipient failure was discovered, as evidenced by longitudinal lining cracks with carbonate staining. External inspection of the pipe confirmed that broken prestress wire had resulted in loss of core compression in the pipe. P-Wave electromagnetic inspection was conducted to detect pipes with broken wires not detectable by more conventional visual and sounding techniques. Ten pipe lengths were identified as anomalous with wire breaks estimated to range from 5 to 75. The greatest numbers of wire breaks were located within the distressed pipe with longitudinal cracking found during the visual inspection. Since shut down of this stretch of pipeline could potentially impact the capacity of the EWC water system during periods of high demand anticipated in early spring, a fast-tracked rehabilitation and replacement program was implemented. Contiguous sections of the line with distressed pipes, or questionable joint restraint integrity due to corrosion of exposed portions of the steel cylinder, were replaced with new PCCP. One pipe length was rehabilitated with seven-strand tendon reinforcement. Two distressed pipes, in close proximity to a commercial building, were lined with steel in-situ to eliminate the need to excavate adjacent to the structure. Deteriorated joint mortar was repaired throughout the 518 meters (1,700 feet) of the line. After completion of the pipeline repairs, the line was returned to service on schedule. Currently EWC is engaged in an aggressive program of PCCP pipeline condition assessment and asset management. As part of this program, a five-year plan for acoustic emission monitoring of up to 120 miles of PCCP has been initiated. Limited pipeline redundancy in the PCCP pipelines within the EWC has led to selection of acoustic emission monitoring for wire break events as the current best technology for monitoring lines that can not be readily removed from service for extended periods.",,"Concrete lining; Prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP); Serviceability; Water transmission; Concrete pipe; Decision making; Joints (structural components); Magnetoelectric effects; Pipe linings; Steel; Water supply",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27144530659

This high-level control problem is commonly referred as the power management problem. In the past, many supervisory control strategies were developed on the basis of a few pre-defined driving cycles, using intuition and heuristics. The resulting control strategy was often inherently cycle-beating and lacked a guaranteed level of optimality. In this study, the power management problem is tackled from a stochastic viewpoint. An infinite-horizon stochastic dynamic optimization problem is formulated. The power demand from the driver is modeled as a random Markov process. The optimal control strategy is then obtained by using Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP). The obtained control law is in the form of a stationary full-state feedback and can be directly implemented. Simulation results over standard driving cycles and random driving cycles are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic approach. It was found that the obtained SDP control algorithm outperforms a sub-optimal rule-based control strategy trained from deterministic DP results.",,"Control law; Deterministic dynamic programming (DDP); Intution; Stochastic dynamic programming; Computer simulation; Dynamic programming; Fuel economy; Heuristic methods; Mathematical models; Optimization; Random processes; SCADA systems; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744283624

The field emission process is described quantummechanically by the Fowler-Nordheim equation. The cathode plasma and surface properties are considered within the framework of the effective work function approximation. Space charge effects are described by Poisson's equation including relativistic effects. Ionization effects at the high-transparency mesh anode are ignored. The numerical calculations are carried out on a time scale much shorter than the emergence of the gap closure. We found that the quasi-stationary state of the diode exhibits a cutoff voltage. The electric field on the cathode surface is found to be saturated in the high voltage regime and is determined by the effective work function only. However, ionization effects at the anode cannot be eliminated in the real world, even for the high-transparency mesh anode. It is well known that the emergence of upstream ion current would enhance the space-charge limiting current. In the present work, we consider the anode plasma effects on the relativistic field-emission-limiting current. Thus, the previous theory is extended to the bipolar field-emission-limited flow. The ion current has been included in the relativistic Poisson's equation and has been treated as a tuning parameter. The comparisons of emission characteristics between space-charge-limited and field emission-limited diodes will be given. The Je-V and Es-V curves are plotted for variant ion current, where Je is the electron current density, V is the diode voltage, and Es is the electric field on the cathode surface.

Notably, these analysis showed that the diamond nucleation would be preferable inside a carbon nanotube due to the effect of surface tension induced by the nanosize curvature of the carbon nanotube and diamond critical nuclei, compared with diamond nucleation on the flat surface of a silicon substrate. Meanwhile, the metastable phase region of diamond nucleation would be driven into a new stable phase region in the carbon thermodynamic equilibrium phase diagram by the effect of nanosize-induced additional pressure.

It is believed that the North America forest ecosystems are a net sink for anthropogenic carbon. However, significant uncertainties exist in quantifying this claim. Inaccurate and incomplete characterization of forest vegetation is among the main causes to these uncertainties. To characterize forest vegetation for global carbon cycle and climate change research at large spatial scales, satellite remote sensing, particularly coarse-resolution remote sensing is an appropriate means. While there have been many successful applications of AVHRR and MODIS data, improvements in accuracy are still urgently needed for reducing uncertainties in related carbon cycle modeling. Multi-angular remote sensing is a new field in remote sensing and has been recently accepted as necessary. It is different from conventional nadir-only remote sensing observations in that multi-angular spectral measurements are sensitive to vegetation canopy structures, thus having the potential to enhance the characterization of forest vegetation. In this paper, we present a case study using MISR to characterize not only land cover types but also forest growth stages in the eastern United States forest ecosystems. Combined with forest inventory data, the magnitude of current carbon stock and carbon sink capacity in the Shenandoah National Park forest has been estimated. It is demonstrated that by introducing forest age differentiation, significant improvements can be made in estimating the magnitude of carbon stocks and sinks in the forest ecosystems. © 2004 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The majority of current size distribution analyses are conducted during steady state engine conditions. Although steady state analysis is valuable, most engines in mobile applications are operated under transient conditions, creating a demand for the transient state analysis of particulate emission patterns. In order to measure the instantaneous emissions of an engine under transient conditions, instrumentation must respond to the changing engine conditions as quickly as possible. In this study, a fast-scanning nanometer Aerosol Size Analyzer (n-ASA) was used to measure the emitted particles of a heavy duty diesel engine during transient simulations. The results showed patterns of PM emissions at key areas throughout the test. It was found that when the engine was decelerating, which can include reduced engine speed, load, or exhaust gas temperatures, a favorable condition was created for the formation of nuclei-mode particles through gas-to-particle conversion. While the engine was accelerating, which generally consisted of increased engine speed, load, fuel consumption, and exhaust gas temperatures, accumulation-mode diesel particles tended to be produced.

Under the ideal conditions of operating with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and filtered and conditioned intake air, a diesel engine produces a certain amount of PM. The PM emission levels may increase when intake air is polluted during harsh on- or off-road conditions. In this study, contaminants were allowed to enter the intake tract of the engine to determine whether or not increased particle ingestion leads to increased particulate matter expulsion. Diesel and test dust contaminants dispersed in intake air were filtered using both a conventional filtering medium and a nano-medium to determine their effects on diesel engine-out PM emissions. The paper characterizes the two media by microstructure, permeability, porosity, and fractional efficiency. Exhaust gas particle size distributions show reduced number concentrations for the nano-material versus the stock material during steady-state modes, which was consistent with predictions. Gravimetric tests during transient cycles also showed improved results for the nano-material. During transient cycles, diesel-contaminated intake air led to higher total PM mass emissions, while test dust-contaminated intake air showed lower total PM mass emissions, compared to non-contaminated intake air.

This destruction of cyanide resource runs counter to the prevailing social ethic of resource conservation wherein cyanide recovery-and-reuse is considered a more socially responsible cyanide use pattern than systematic cyanide destruction. HW Process Technologies, Inc. (HWPT) has developed membrane based methods for the recovery of cyanide from barren solution as a means to reduce cyanide waste. The HWPT Engineered Membrane Separation (EMS™) system uses state-of-the-art spiral wound membrane elements that are engineered specifically for the treatment of high pH cyanide process solutions. The membranes fully reject WAD CN, SAD CN and most minor metals, and partially reject SCN, Free CN and precious metal cyanide from a high clarity barren solution feed to a small volume EMS™) ""concentrate"" stream. The EMS™) ""concentrate"" stream is returned to the process. The large percentage of the EMS™) process feed exits the system as cyanide lean EMS™) ""permeate."" The EMS™) permeate, after residual cyanide destruction, polishing, and pH adjustment, is, thereafter, typically suitable for discharge. Separately, the HWPT EMS™)-PLS method of cyanide recycling is an internal plant cyanide recovery step that removes base metal cyanides from a pregnant leach solution to a small volume EMS™) concentrate stream. The concentrate stream is then typically processed further for the recovery of metals and recovery-recycling of cyanide. The method makes it economically practical to recover gold from Merrill-Crowe or carbon plant ""fouling"" solutions, e.g., those with greater than 400 ppm Cu, as might result from the use of the EMS™) method wherein EMS™) concentrate is constantly thrown back into the mine leach solution pool as part of the free cyanide recycle process, or as might result from the single-pass leach treatment of high copper content ores or concentrates. The EMS™) cyanide recovery method for barren solution treatment is shown to be ""economic"" for the treatment of clear solutions at the approximately 200 ppm total cyanide level (CN T), and for slurries at the approximately 400 ppm total cyanide level, where economic is defined as a 2 year EMS™) plant payback. The EMS™) plant payback calculation includes the beneficial monetary impacts of gold and free cyanide recycling and the avoided operating cost of cyanide destruction.

In November and December of 1999, radon, thoron, carbon dioxide, and mercury soil gas concentrations were obtained at 106 points within the caldera, as well as carbon dioxide efflux. The spatial distribution of the concentrations of these gases and carbon dioxide efflux show that the values of Ilopango Caldera are within background levels of other active volcanoes of the world and El Salvador. However, several areas where anomalies of high radon, thoron, carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide efflux coincide were identified in regions of dense faulting. Heavier carbon isotope values between -13‰ and -20‰ (overall range: -13.1‰ to -29.8‰) in the anomalous regions suggest mixing of minor amounts of volcanic gases with biogenic gases or the presence of C 4 plants. Degassing of carbon dioxide from the lake was calculated using a double boundary layer model. A total carbon dioxide efflux of 644 to 1111 t d-1 was calculated for the lake and the soils of the caldera.

The research study developed a relatively simple and low-cost method for quantifying the travel and emission impacts of these programs, often called ""Spare the Air"" in California. The study developed survey methods that included both a long, detailed questionnaire and a short, simple one. Through these questionnaires, the study collected comprehensive travel data of a random sample of the general population and of individuals who said they responded to the Spare the Air (STA) message. The data, collected during two summer ozone seasons in Sacramento, allowed researchers to compare the travel behavior of the same individuals on both STA and regular (non-STA) summer days and of STA participants and nonparticipants. The study found a statistically significant difference between self-reported vehicle trip reductions and measured vehicle trip changes due to STA programs among STA participants. A correction factor was derived based on this research finding. By applying the correction factor to a simple and less costly survey, similar to the simple questionnaire used in this study, air districts will be able to adjust future self-reported vehicle trip reductions and extrapolate them to the entire regional population of drivers within an acceptable margin of error.",,"Air pollution; Data acquisition; Environmental protection; Extrapolation; Gas emissions; Public policy; Air Resources Board (ARB); Ozone alert programs; Ozone reduction; Quantification methods; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044224760

It also demonstrated ways to use biomass in the coke base Blast Furnace technology in order to reduce CO2 emissions and improve hot metal metallurgical properties through the use of charcoal injection as a substitute of coal. Brazil is the world greatest charcoal producer with an average annual production of 2.3 millions of metric tons. This production is only a small fraction of the actual potential to produce charcoal from cultivated biomass and agricultural crop wastes. The DPC process was specially developed to bring logistic, environmental, technical, economic and global energy efficiency when compared to most of the existing biomass carbonization process. The DPC process encompasses the following main advantages: 1 - Utilizes the volatile materials (condensable and non-condensable) as a source of the energy required by the carbonization process guarantying its complete combustion; 2 - The gases emitted during the pyrolysis step are used as a heat carrier for the endothermic stage of the pyrolysis. As a result the DPC process obtains a higher charcoal to biomass yield, and avoids the waste to the atmosphere of valuable renewable energy presented in the volatile fraction as well as reducing the total CO2 emission in this type of process with practically no emissions of noxious wastes to the environment. In the DPC process, the functions of: wood drying; wood pyrolysis and the resultant charcoal cooling are performed simultaneous and independently into at least three reactors. The emitted gases during pyrolysis with a significant heating value are burned in a combustion chamber, generating hot gases, which are returned to the reactor performing the drying of wood. In this process, charcoal can be made from virtually any organic material, wood logs, coconut shells, bones, elephant grass, sawmill wastes and a variety of other substances. Wood pieces up to 5 meters long can be pilled directly into the reactors, avoiding the need of a sawing plant, as in the tower type continuous carbonization reactor. The DPC process creates an opportunity for investment in the economic production of charcoal from any organic material in an environmentally sound basis. Its use could represent a real economic option in many regions of this planet and very especially in Brazil.",,"Air pollution; Carbonization; Charcoal; Environmental protection; Heating; Investments; Metallurgy; Productivity; Coconut shells; Continuous carbonization reactor; Elephant grass; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645014790

Typically, individual source-plume systems are evaluated on a site-specific basis; however, much can be learned by looking at the collective data from multiple sites. This has been done with leaking underground storage tank sites in California, Texas, and Florida, where the analyses led to important conclusions concerning dissolved MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and benzene plume behaviors that could not be drawn from individual site data sets. In these previous works, each site data set was reduced to a plume length and then a statistical analysis of plume lengths was performed. In this paper, the use of multiple-site collective data analyses is also pursued; however, rather than use a single metric plume length analysis, a composite plume data analysis approach is proposed and examined. This alternate approach provides a means for making use of data from ground water plumes that are incompletely defined. In addition, few of the assumptions required by single plume studies for interpolation of data are necessary. The composite plume approach is especially well suited to the analysis of large sites or regions with multiple source areas within similar hydrogeochemical settings. A case study of petroleum hydrocarbon transport at a large former oil field with more than 90 source areas illustrates the application and benefits of this approach.",,"Crude petroleum; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogeology; Interpolation; Oil fields; Data sets; Downdragient receptors; Nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL); Petroleum hydrocarbon transport; Contamination; groundwater pollution; leakage; MTBE; nonaqueous phase liquid; pollutant transport; solute transport; underground storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544259718

Three independent emissions inventories, that are (i) emission estimates from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) for the year 1995, (ii) a regional emission inventory used in the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) program with emissions for the year 2000 and (iii) a national emission inventory used in the China Ozone Research Program (CORP) with emission estimates for the year 1995, are used for model simulation over a summer period. Methods used for the development of the inventories are discussed and differences in simulated ozone and its precursors with these emission inventories are analyzed. Comparison of the emission inventories revealed large differences in the emission estimates (up to 50% for NOx, ∼100% for NMVOC and ∼1000% for CO). Application of the different emission inventories in three model simulations showed minor differences in both surface O3 in rather unpolluted areas in China and at higher altitudes (500 mbar). In polluted areas, differences in surface O3 are 30-50% between the different model simulations which seem rather small taking into account the large differences in the emission inventories. Additional sensitivity runs showed that the difference in NOx emissions as well NMVOC emissions is a dominant factor which controls the differences in simulated O3 concentrations while the impact of differences in CO emissions is relatively small. Although the CO emission estimate by CORP seems to be underestimated, there is no confidence to highlight one emission inventory better than the others. © European Geoscience Union 2004.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544330017

Although naturally fractured, the Midale Unit proved to be a good candidate for a miscible CO2 flood. Encouraging results from a demonstration CO2 flood in a small part of the Midale Unit (±2,000 acres) prompted an extensive study to evaluate the potential of the full-field CO2 flood. The study involved analytical modeling and several compositional simulation models, ranging from a small, element-of-symmetry model to the comprehensive, field-scale model. This paper describes the compositional simulation conducted on a large 3D model containing 40,000 grid blocks. The 204-well model covered 20 inverted nine-spot waterflood patterns and the CO2 demonstration flood area including both vertical and horizontal wells; this comprises approximately 25% of the total Unit. The reservoir fluid was characterized using a 9-component Peng-Robinson equation-of-state model. Pattern-based permeability anisotropy was a key parameter used to accurately match individual well response to the waterflood and the CO2 flood. A very good history match was obtained on both the field and the well scale. The tuned model was used to predict future reservoir performance under various operating and development scenarios. Various CO2 injection strategies were considered, including Continuous CO2 flood, Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) and Hybrid WAG. Under each strategy a detailed sensitivity modeling was performed investigating the optimal CO2 volumes, injectivity, WAG ratio and the benefits of pressure support and limiting the gas production. The study showed that incremental recoveries of 11-15% OOIP can be expected by implementing the optimized CO2 flood scenario. Results of the compositional model were then used to tune the streamline simulator for the full field model. A full field development plan was delivered in 4 months. © Canadian International Petroleum Conference 2004, CIPC 2004.All Rights Reserved.",,"Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Floods; Fracture; Gasoline; Horizontal wells; Water injection; Well flooding; Compositional modeling; Compositional simulations; Field development plans; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Permeability anisotropy; Reservoir performance; Vertical and horizontal wells; Water alternating gas; Oil well flooding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055122242

An air pollution episode in 2003 was investigated by the usage of satellite products. Our conclusion for the air pollution control strategy in Beijing is that only reducing the pollution sources from inner city can't fully solve the pollution problems in Beijing and the regional transports from the nearby southern provinces are contributing a lot to the pollution situation in Beijing.","Beijing; MODIS Aerosol Level 2 products; Particulate matter air pollution","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospherics; Environmental protection; Particles (particulate matter); Regional planning; Ultraviolet radiation; Air pollution index (API); Beijing, China; MODIS Aerosol Level 2 products; Particulate matter air pollution; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14944361853

Kerosene combustion within silicon-carbide coated, carbon foam porous inert media (PIM) was studied. Combustion performance was quantified with temperature and CO and NOx emissions measurements at the PIM exit. Results showed uniform flow, temperature, and emissions profiles in the middle region of the PIM. Measurements near the wall were affected by the heat loss from the burner. Results showed higher emissions with increasing equivalence ratio and decreasing vaporization and mixing length. The lean blow-off limit was also extended as the vaporization and mixing length was decreased. The locally fuel rich regions in the PIM transferred energy to locally fuel lean regions to sustain burning at an overall equivalence ratio leaner than the lean blow-off limit for the completely premixed case.

However, there is uncertainty about the effects of elevated CO2 on stomatal behaviour, water relations and plant productivity, owing to the lack of long-term experiments in representative natural ecosystems. In this work, variations in stomatal density and index, leaf water relations and plant biomass of semi-natural grassland communities were analysed under field conditions by comparing plants in three different experimental set-ups (natural CO2 springs, plastic tunnels and mini-FACE systems). Natural degassing vents continuously expose the surrounding vegetation to truly long-term elevated CO2 and can complement short-term manipulative experiments. Elevated CO2 concentration effects on stomata persist in the long term, though different species growing in the same environment show species-specific responses. The general decrease in stomatal conductance after exposure to elevated CO2 was not associated with clear changes in stomatal number on leaf surfaces. The hypothesis of long-term adaptive modifications to stomatal number and distribution of plants exposed to elevated CO2 was not supported by these experiments on grassland communities. Elastic cell wall properties were affected to some extent by elevated CO 2. Above-ground biomass did not vary between CO2 treatments, leaf area index did not compensate for reduced stomatal conductance, and the root system had potentially greater soil exploration capacity. Considerable between-species variation in response to elevated CO2 may provide a mechanism for changing competitive interactions among plant species.","Biomass; Leaf conductance; Root density; Stomatal density; Water relations","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Morphology; Physiology; Vegetation; Leaf conductance; Stomatal density; Plants (botany); biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; grassland; physiological response; stomatal conductance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842582048

The first one (SBF-dynamic) avoids the variations of the ionic concentration in the assay solution with a continuous renewal of SBF. The second protocol, uses a carbonated simulated inorganic plasma (CSIP), prepared by substituting the tris(hydroxymethyl aminomethane)/ HCl buffer (TRIS) of SBF for a CO2/HCO3- buffer, whereby a physiological concentration of HCO3- in solution is reached (24 to 27 mM) whereas the pH is maintained between 7.3 and 7.4. After the in vitro immersions, S72.5P2.5 exhibited a hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) surface layer in both cases, but some differences were found depending on the in vitro protocol. In CSIP, a higher HCA crystallization rate was initially observed (1 day vs 3 days in SBF-dynamic). Nevertheless, after 7 days in SBF-dynamic, the new layer was thicker (6 μm vs 1 μm) and presented a Ca/P molar ratio lower than in CSIP (1.7 vs 2.1). In the case of HAP ceramic, a HCA layer was observed only in CSIP. In SBF-dynamic the local supersaturation degree of the solution and/or the system dynamics were not appropriated for HCA layer formation.","Hydroxyapatite; In vitro protocols; Mineralisation; Sol-gel glass; Supersaturation","Body fluids; Computer simulation; Crystallization; Hydroxyapatite; Negative ions; pH effects; Sol-gels; Supersaturation; Mineralization; Molar ratio; Simulated body fluids (SBF); Ceramic materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347516212

In order to address these issues, this paper will present a 9-year data set for two research basins located in the boreal forest/tundra transition zone near Inuvik, NWT. On an annual basis, these data present the best estimate to date of the magnitude and relative importance of all water balance components, and these data have illustrated large inter-annual variability. However, given the short term covered by these data, it is not surprising that there is little evidence of a trend. The exception is a trend toward earlier spring melt, a longer runoff season, and a deeper active layer. These changes are in response to changes in temperature in the study area, as reported earlier.","Boreal forest; Hydrology; Northern Canada; Permafrost; Tundra; Water balance","Climate control; Data reduction; Forestry; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Permafrost; Research; Boreal forests; Northern Canada; Tundra; Water balance; River basin projects; boreal forest; meltwater; river basin; runoff; tundra; water budget; Basins; Data Processing; Forests; Hydrology; Mathematical Models; Meteorology; Permafrost; Research; Canada; Mackenzie Delta; North America; Northwest Territories; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844253964

The EPA Ozone Program calls State Implementation Plans to reduce summertime NO x emissions by 800,000 ton/yr, while industrial facilities with fossil fuel fired boilers of 250 million Btu/h and electric generating facilities of 25 MW or more should reduce emissions by 0.15 Ib NO x /million Btu. Developing a sustainable cost efficient control technology capable of achieving NO x removal efficiencies comparable to Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a challenge for researchers and engineers. The feasibility of a hybrid technology comprised of enhanced oxidation, absorption and biofiltration is evaluated in this paper. The strength of the technology resides in the synergy between the combustion process and the unit operations of the control technology. The first stage converts the insoluble nitric oxide (NO) into more soluble species by hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) enhanced oxidation. In the second stage, the scrubber removes a sizable fraction of NO x simultaneously with SO 2, if present. The resulting cooler gas stream is saturated with moisture and contains lower concentrations of the pollutants, thus making it suitable for biological treatment in the biofiltration stage, where microorganisms will further remove the pollutants. The water collected in the scrubber will be re-used for humidification of the biofilter. Mathematical models for the three processes, integrated into a global model and parametrical sensitivity analyses will be used for assessing the feasibility of the technology as well as for optimization, evaluation of design scenarios, studying the effects of SO2, prediction of removal efficiency and emissions. This Green Engineering/ Industrial Ecology approach, with closed materials and energy loops, can draw public and regulatory agencies acceptance.","Biofiltration; NO x removal; Scrubbing; SO 2 removal","Cooler gas streams; Global models; Lungs; Performance standards; Absorption; Acid rain; Biofilters; Combustion equipment; Filtration; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Power plants; Scrubbers; Sulfur dioxide; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944376677

The area is thus a representative example of large urban region. The accumulated data collected by a network of air quality measuring stations, distributed throughout the SPMA, enables the monitoring of the air quality and is an adequate source of information for checking the effect of air quality control measures in the region. The present work shows that, although the levels of primary air pollutants have decreased over the last 20 years, events with high levels of NO2, CO, particulate material and ozone still take place. In the last five years ozone has become the most problematic pollutant, in view of the high frequency of peak events. Increased control of emission sources and adequate planning of the urban area, especially concerning the traffic system, are both necessary in order to keep pollution in the area under established levels.","Air pollutants; Air quality; Atmospheric pollution; Ground-level ozone; Urban air pollution","Air pollution control; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Urban planning; Emission sources; Inhabitants; São Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA); Air quality; alcohol; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; gasoline; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; metropolitan area; ozone; pollution policy; urban pollution; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; article; Brazil; city; city planning; exhaust gas; industrial area; particulate matter; policy; traffic; urban area; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9644304474

This article deals with damage monitoring in carbon/epoxy cross ply laminates submitted to static and tension-tension fatigue loading. The materials have been exposed to high temperature before being mechanically tested. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a thermal degradation of the matrix and fiber/matrix interface on the mechanical fatigue behavior of composite material. The onset and development of damage were followed by means of two complementary NDI techniques. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Acousto-Ultrasonics (AU). AU and AE signals were recorded during cyclic testing. Through an analysis of the signal contents, the AU technique proved to exhibit a distinction between the thermally exposed and the unexposed laminates. The results obtained indicate that the identification of the state of degradation of the composite due to overheating and to mechanical loading can be discriminated.","Acoustic emission; Acousto-ultrasonic; Fatigue loading; Graphite/epoxy; Thermal degradation","Acoustic emissions; Degradation; Fatigue of materials; Interfaces (materials); Loads (forces); Nondestructive examination; Ultrasonic waves; Acousto-ultrasonics; Cyclic testing; Damage modes; Fatigue loading; Composite materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644266221

The meteorological conditions, light synoptic wind, sunny and cold (between 0 and 5 Celcius degrees), were favorable for the establishment of urban induced circulations in the boundary layer. Observations were conducted both at or near the surface (surface energy balance in city center and rural area), UHI measurement network, profilers and completed by in-situ measurements in the boundary layer: radiosoundings (upwind rural and in the city center) and aircraft. The contrast between the rural and urban surface energy budgets is clear. At night the city warms the atmosphere by more than 50 Wm-2 continuously through the night. This creates an UHI and over the city an instable boundary layer more than 100m develops during-the day, the larger warming from the city surface induces a boundary layer of 1100m deep, compared to 900m in the countryside upwind of the urban area. The urban dome is then approximately of 200m. Aircraft measurements measured a thermodynamical plume, with an increase of air temperature at 300m of height of approximately 1.5 degree when the airplane flew from upwind to above city. This warmer air is advected 50km downwind of the city.

As of August 2003, HETE-2 had localized 47 GRBs, and 19 localizations had led to the detection of X-ray, optical or radio afterglows. The prompt position alert enables researchers to probe the nature of so-called ""dark bursts"" - GRBs for which no optical afterglow has been found despite accurate localizations. Bursts localized by HETE-2 can be observed more promptly, when the afterglow is intrinsically brighter; thus, afterglows can be detected for bursts which would have otherwise been considered as ""dark"". In one case of a ""dark"" burst observed by HETE-2, the optical afterglow was found to be intrinsically faint, and its flux declined rapidly. In another case, the optical emission was likely extinguished by the dust in the vicinity of the GRB source. X-ray rich GRBs or X-ray flashes (XRFs) are found to have many properties in common with classical GRBs, suggesting that they are a single phenomenon. However, optical identification of XRFs has been difficult, perhaps because the counterparts are intrinsically faint; prompt localizations from HETE-2 will help observers identify optical counterparts to XRFs. The bright afterglows of GRB 021004 and GRB 030329 were observed in unprecedented detail by telescopes around the world; GRB 030329 was subsequently identified with SN 2003dh, a Type Ic supernova. Consequently, strong evidence for the connection of long GRBs with core-collapsed supernovae was found.","Gamma-rays: bursts; Stars: supernovae; X-rays: flashes",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24944503106

The project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by subsurface injection of CO 2 into deep coalbeds and to enhance coalbed methane recovery and production rates. CO 2 injectivity was greater than for weakly adsorbing N 2 through the use of alternating injection shut-in sequences and perhaps as the result of coal weakening. Injection increased the absolute permeability and effective permeability to gas to a level easily allowing injection. The combination of these two observations suggests that low permeability coal seams that may not be commercial under primary production could still be CO 2 storage sites with the added benefit of improving the possibility for commercial gas productivity.

Yet by the end of the 1990s, MTBE had leaked from tens of thousands of underground storage tanks across the country, polluting groundwater and precipitating a large-scale environmental crisis. This Article explores the spectacular rise and fall of MTBE as a case study in regulatory failure. The Article reviews five critical decision points at which EPA or Congress could have either prevented the MTBE crisis or greatly reduced its severity. Drawing on this history, the Article then explores the explanatory power of eight prominent theories of regulation and regulatory failure and the lessons that can be learned from the MTBE crisis.

Additionally, the US EPA has proposed a new sulfur regulation for off-road diesel of 500 ppm in mid-2007 with further reduction to 15 ppm in 2010. Although no new specifications have been proposed for HHO and jet fuel, it is widely expected that the sulfur level in these fuels will also be reduced from their current levels of 2000-5000 ppm. Although the new diesel fuel regulations set by the US EPA only change the sulfur content of on-road diesel, the state of California and some European governments have also set more stringent limits on other diesel fuel properties such as aromatics, polynuclear aromatics and cetane index or cetane number. We analyzed the cost to produce ULSD as well as the cost of other potential future distillate fuel regulations based on a comprehensive analysis of the US oil industry. In addition to cost to produce, we also calculated additional hydrogen production requirements and the impact of the regulations on CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows that the cost to produce ULSD is significantly lower than that reported in other studies; however, it is consistent with the actual cost to produce LSD which required similar refinery modifications.

This region has shown a large number of violations of the PM 10 24-hour average air quality standard of 150 Jig/m 3 as well as of the annual average air quality standard of 50 μ/m 3. The Paso del Norte region is increasing its industrial, commercial, and transportation activities and the problem threatens to become worse. The high PM 10 concentrations represent a health risk for the population, in particular for children and elderly people. In this work we present results of a study to evaluate potential risks for chronic exposure to PM 10 based on the calculation of hazard coefficients in the region. The procedure is based on the use of GIS software to develop maps of average PM 10 concentrations in the region for a proposed grid on the domain. Individual risks were estimated for each cell in the grid and maps of hazard coefficients were developed for children, adults, and elderly groups of population. Maps of social risks were obtained combining maps of hazard coefficients and maps of population density. The maps show the areas with higher individual and social risks in the region. The results are the basis for evaluating the benefits of health risk reduction in the region and for assessing the impact of air pollution control strategies on individual health risk and social risk in the area.","Air Pollution; Geographic Information Systems; Paso del Norte; Risk Assessment","Chronic exposure; Hazard coefficients; Population density; Social risks; Air pollution; Air quality; Computer software; Geographic information systems; Hazards; Health risks; Pollution control; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Codes (standards)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944384547

Interactions among these bats, their food plants, and the climate were studied in an Atlantic Forest area in Southeastern Brazil. Path analysis was used to estimate the strength of direct and indirect effects through which variables determine the timing of bat reproduction. Temperature had a small direct influence, but a strong indirect one. Rainfall affected bat reproduction through indirect ways. Although the consumption of Piper fruits by bats did not have a significant influence, the timing of production of Piper fruits was a strong variable directly affecting bat reproduction.

In the case of contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons, plants enhance microbial degradation of the contaminant in the rhizosphere. The potential of this technology for the tropics should be high due to prevailing climatic conditions favoring plant growth and stimulating microbial activity. Investigations of the potential of tropical plants for phytoremediation, however, are scarce. The present work studied two grasses and six legumes from the eastern savannah of Venezuela on their reaction to crude oil contamination in soil. Results shall help to identify plants with a potential for phytoremediation and subsequent studies. Seedling emergence and biomass production were determined for plants growing in soil contaminated with 0%, 3%, and 5% heavy crude oil. Contamination had, in general, a tendential but not significant negative influence on seedling emergence. Dry matter production was reduced by only a few percent to up to 85%. Furthermore, in some legumes inhibition of nodulation was observed. The grass Brachiaria brizantha and the legumes Centrosema brasilianum and Calopogonium mucunoides are promising for phytoremediation because in contaminated soil they combined high seedling emergence with least affected biomass production. Since they are cultivated forage/soil cover species also in other regions of the tropics, their potential for phytoremediation of petroleum contaminated soils extends beyond Venezuela.

A unique feature for this approach is that it allows small sized units with the ion source and excimer medium contained in vessels of order 30-cm radius. The IEC operates by applying a high negative voltage (up to -100 kV) on a spherical mesh grid (cathode) located in the center of a grounded grid (anode), all within a spherical vacuum vessel. A plasma discharge is created between the grids. The cathode extracts ions from the discharge and accelerates them towards the center of the device. Large ion background gas collision densities are created in the center region and along the ion beam paths, creating intense light emission. An alternate approach discussed here allow lower operating pressures and reduced ion thermalization, giving improved emission efficiencies, uses an external RF ion generator to separate the injected species from the mixture.

Two cases of vehicle idling were considered: reduced idling of heavy-duty diesel trucks at truck stops and reduced idling of school buses. Emission reductions are achievable in each case. Electrification of truck stops has the greatest potential for reducing emissions because of the relatively high emission rate of air pollutants from idling diesel trucks and the fact that these vehicles often spend many hours each day idling. USEPA has established a goal of reducing idling from school buses by 30 minutes per day. The paper shows the typical emission reductions achievable from reduced idling by school buses in the 8-county area.

The Nashville area is planning improvements to the regional transit system by building a new commuter rail system and expanding bus service. This paper shows an analysis of the air pollution emission reductions expected to be achieved as a result of the transit system improvements. The analysis is based on the projected ridership of the bus and rail system for 2007. Emission reductions from improved transit come from diverting private vehicle trips to transit trips. If enough private vehicle trips can be diverted to transit to offset the emissions of the transit vehicles, then a net reduction in emissions may occur. The magnitude of the emission reduction is dependent on the vehicle miles of travel that can be diverted from private vehicle use to transit use. The Nashville commuter rail service will employ diesel-powered locomotives. The increase in emissions from the diesel locomotives and new buses must be considered as well as the decrease in emissions from the private vehicle VMT that will no longer occur.

This paper describes one of the measures being considered effecting non-road mobile source emissions. Non-road mobile sources will account for 17.6% of NOx, 10.3% of VOC, 35.6% of CO and 5.7% of PM2.5 of the area wide emissions in 2007 in the 8-county Nashville EAC (Early Action Compact) area. In this paper emission reductions from replacing old equipment and vehicles with new low-emission equipment and vehicles have been estimated. Emission reductions from construction equipment were divided between reductions from TN DOT contractors involved in land clearing and building of roads, compared to other contractors involved in construction of residential and commercial facilities. The result of the modeling analysis showed 4.31 tons/day of NOx, 0.53 tons/day of VOC, 1.92 tons/day of CO and 0.40 tons/day of PM2.5 could be reduced by requiring new or retrofitted construction equipment. Similarly 0.04 tons/day of NOx, 0.003 tons/day of VOC, 0.026 tons/day of CO and 0.002 tons/day of PM2.5 could be reduced by replacing old airport service vehicle with new or retrofitted equipment.

One of the key goals of sustainable development is to separate increases in non-renewable resource use (particularly fossil fuels) from economic growth. This is to be accomplished by modifying individual practices, encouraging technological innovation and redesigning systems of production and consumption. Settlements represent a scale at which significant advances on each of these can be made and where there is an existing management structure. However, urban areas currently consume a disproportionate share of the Earth's resources and urbanization has modified local climate and weather significantly, usually to the detriment of urban dwellers. There is now a lengthy history of urban climate study that links existing settlement form to climatic consequences yet, there is little evidence that climate information is incorporated into urban designs or that the climatic impact of different plans is considered. Consequently, opportunities for planning sustainable urban forms that are suitable to local climates and promote energy conservation and healthy atmospheres are not taken and much effort is later expended in 'fixing' problems that emerge. This paper will outline the links between urban climate and sustainability, identify gaps in our urban climate knowledge and discuss the opportunities and barriers to the application of this knowledge to urban design and planning. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040525394

Currently, there is a growing awareness that smoke from wildland fires exposes individuals and populations to hazardous air pollutants. In order to understand and to simulate forest fire effects on air quality, several issues should be analysed and integrated: fire progression, fire emissions, atmospheric flow, smoke dispersion and chemical reactions. In spite of the available models to simulate smoke dispersion and the existence of some systems already covering the main questions, there still remains a lack of integration concerning fire progression. Photochemical pollution is also not included in these modelling systems. AIRFIRE is a numerical system, developed to estimate the effects of forest fires on air quality, integrating several components of the problem through the inclusion of different modules, namely the mesoscale meteorological model MEMO, the photochemical model MARS, and the Rothermel fire spread model. The system was applied to simulate plume dispersion from a wildfire that occurred in a coastal area, close to Lisbon city, at the end of September 1991. Results, namely the obtained pollutants concentration fields, point to a significant impact on the local air quality. Obtained wind fields and concentration patterns revealed the presence of sea breezes and also the influence of the fire in the atmospheric flow. Estimated carbon monoxide concentration levels were very high, exceeding the recommended hourly limit value of the World Health Organization, and ozone concentration values pointed to photochemical production.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243192413

Afterwards, this concept has been rapidly generalized. In the fishery, this idea is also beginning to spread for solution of problems. A large amount of raw squid material is used in our country, and, as a result, the squids- processing industry has generated a large amount of wastes. Thinking of this point, we have begun the research on utilization of squid wastes. One is the development of the dyestuff extracted from squid ink. Another is the artificial bait made from squid liver. The former is a trial of clarifying the industrial character in region by the reason why squids are used not only for food but also for culture and art. The latter was developed for the tuna long line fishery. This fishery is currently done in the sea all over the world. Because the nitrogen included in the bait is carried out to the sea area in foreign countries, it would contribute to the world circulation of nitrogen. In this respect, it is thought that the artificial bait needs some incentives in price competition. Moreover, it should be recognized as an ecological commodity in the future. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The soil horizon could be, in general, characterized as very loosened in comparison with deeper parts of rock environment. However, in fact, the gas permeability of weathering cover is given by its specific physical properties mainly by grain structure, grain shape and water content. These are parameters which essentially influence an interaction between pore space of soil layer and atmospheric air. Changes of physical properties of atmospheric masses during a year have their reflection in variations of radon volume activity in soil air. The goal of this work was the monitoring of this interaction in time. The presented paper brings some results of almost two years of monitoring measurements of soil radon volume activity in three study areas in Bratislava and their analysis in dependence on physical properties of weathering cover and on changes of temperature, humidity and pressure of atmospheric air. Thanks to relatively high difference in clay component contents in the studied localities, the presented results confirmed, in good agreement with former works, their inversely proportional relation to variations of soil radon volume activity values. They also confirmed some dependence of soil radon volume activity on time changes of meteorological parameters in a year climatic cycle. In case of 222Rn the two-maxima shape of its volume activity course during a year with main dependence on rain precipitation intensity was measured and in case of 220Rn a strong dependence on temperature in a year cycle is visible. The radon risk category assessment in study areas based on monitoring measurements results in different time periods during a year shows a category change possibility mainly in case of areas with inhomogeneous structure of their geological basement, which was the case of study area with active tectonics presence.","Gas permeability; Radon risk; Radon variations; Soil air; Volume activity of 222Rn and 220Rn","radon; soil emission; soil gas; Bratislava; Bratislavsky; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Slovakia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29944432863

Soil characteristics of the lake catchments were obtained from the National Survey of Forest Soils and Vegetation also carried out by SLU. Deposition data were provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The model successfully simulated the observed lake and soil chemistry at 133 lakes and their catchments. The fact that 85% of the lakes calibrated successfully without being treated in an individual way suggests that data gathered by the national monitoring programmes are suitable for modelling of soil and surface water recovery from acidification. The lake and soil chemistry data were then projected into the future under the deposition scenario based on emission reductions agreed in the Gothenburg protocol. Deposition of sulphur (sea salt corrected) was estimated to decrease from 1990 to 2010 by 65-73%; deposition of nitrogen was estimated to decrease by 53%. The model simulated relatively rapid improvements in lake water chemistry in response to the decline in deposition from 1990 to 2010, but the improvements levelled off once deposition stabilised at the lower value. There was a major improvement of simulated lake water charge balance acid neutralising capacity (ANC) from 1990 to 2010 in all lakes. The modelled lakes were divided into acidification sensitive and non-sensitive. The modelled sensitive lakes are representative of 20% of the most sensitive lakes in Sweden. By 2010, the ANC in the sensitive lakes was 10 to 50 μeq L-1 below estimated pre-industrial levels and did not increase much further from 2010 to 2040. Soils at the majority of the modelled catchments continued to lose base cations even after the simulated decline in acid deposition was complete, i.e. after the year 2010. Based on this model prediction, the acidification of the Swedish soils will in general not be reversed by the deposition reduction experienced over the last 10 years and expected to occur by the year 2010. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Acidification; Dynamic modelling; Lake; MAGIC; Regional modelling; Soil; Sweden","acidification; atmospheric deposition; emission control; lake water; numerical model; remediation; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344624637

The potential seems to be substantial; but it has not been even adequately recognized, let alone exploited. Proper design and management of agroforestry practices can make them effective carbon sinks. As in other land-use systems, the extent of C sequestered will depend on the amounts of C in standing biomass, recalcitrant C remaining in the soil, and C sequestered in wood products. Average carbon storage by agroforestry practices has been estimated as 9, 21, 50, and 63 Mg C ha-1 in semiarid, subhumid, humid, and temperate regions. For smallholder agroforestry systems in the tropics, potential C sequestration rates range from 1.5 to 3.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Agroforestry can also have an indirect effect on C sequestration when it helps decrease pressure on natural forests, which are the largest sink of terrestrial C. Another indirect avenue of C sequestration is through the use of agroforestry technologies for soil conservation, which could enhance C storage in trees and soils. Agroforestry systems with perennial crops may be important carbon sinks, while intensively managed agroforestry systems with annual crops are more similar to conventional agriculture.

This decision could put some 60 people out of work and cause a significant negative economic impact on the community. A study was commissioned to determine what could be done to reduce the facility's energy and operating cost. Coal fired in a small industrial boiler (to make steam) was the source of the plant's energy. Even though coal is typically a very low-cost source of energy, it turns out that this cost was half of the cost required to make the product. The project objective was defined as: Reduce the cost of energy by one-half, with no-change to the plants operating permit, and meet the Company's capital cost recovery objectives! This report summarizes the critical issues addressed to meet this objective; such as fuel selection, environmental regulations, and the suggested technical approach to modify the boiler with the field demonstrated Clean Combustion System™ offered by Phenix Limited, LLC.

Data for daily admissions for myocardial infarction were provided by the Administration of Careggi Hospital in Florence for the period 1998-2003. Hourly meteorological data was obtained from a weather station located in the main urban park of Florence and managed by the Institute of Biometeorology of the National Research Council. The analyses were concentrated on winter season, when the maximum peak of hospitalization for myocardial infarction occurred. A principal component analysis and a successive clustering technique was applied to identify typical air masses characteristics of the Florentine area. A multiyear comparison of MI admissions between air mass types was made by the calculation of a myocardial infarction admission index. Sequences of air mass types and their impact on hospitalizations were also investigated. Two antyciclonic air mass types (the continental anticyclonic and the anticyclonic mixed tropical maritime and continental) and the cyclonic one, were often associated with high mean daily admissions for myocardial infarction, especially when consecutive days with these air mass types occurred.",,"Cardiology; Climatology; Environmental impact; Health care; Hospitals; Patient monitoring; Weather forecasting; Cardiovascular diseases (CVD); Florence, Italy; Myocardial infarction (MI); Wind velocity; Diseases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144434879

A matrix relating the statistics was designed in order to calculate the spatial homogeneity index (SHI), which is a good way to classify the variability of the NDVI. This classification permits the identification of areas with homogeneous behaviour in terms of inter-annual land cover dynamic. Moreover, with the aim to compare the aforementioned classification with the superficial Biomass, the potential yields of the natural prairies were modelled in the study area at the same spatial resolution of NOAA. A model based on simulation of the prairies growth and which integrates the main eco-physiologic processes and its climatic regulation and maturity, was developed.

Studies of the lake sequence, with a basal date of 11,110±110 yr BP, provide a history of climatic changes divided into nine zones. Zone A1 (prior to 11,000 yr BP) contains diatom taxa suggesting dry environments. Zone B1 (around 11,000 yr BP) indicates very humid climatic conditions synchronous with reduced temperatures. Around 8,710±150 yr BP, the core does not contain diatoms, and the convergence of some paleoclimatic indicators suggests that a drier paleoclimate is represented. Zone A2 and B2 have planktonic diatom spectra that suggest progressive high humidity. A marked decline in moisture levels is expressed in Zone C, as suggested by an increase in only one dominant periphytic taxon. The following periods (Zones D1, D2 and D3) were characterized by several water level oscillations, with short and intensive dry events and longer intervening humid periods. Zone E establishes the present diatom and climatic pattern of Lagoa Dourada. Cultural disturbances could be indicated by the high K+ levels detected on the core top, which are probably due to the agricultural boom in the catchment area. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Grazing, burning, and fertilization have been shown to increase soil carbon storage in rangeland soils of the Great Plains. Research was initiated in 2001 in northwestern South Dakota to evaluate the role of interseeding a legume, Medicago sativa ssp. falcata, in northern mixed-grass rangelands on carbon sequestration. Sampling was undertaken on a chronosequence of sites interseeded in 1998, 1987, and 1965 as well as immediately adjacent untreated native rangeland sites. Soil organic carbon exhibited an increase of 4% in the 1998, 8% in the 1987, and 17% in the 1965 interseeding dates compared to their respective native untreated rangeland sites. Nitrogen fixation by the legume led to significant increases in total soil nitrogen and increased forage production in the interseeded treatments. Increases in organic carbon mass in this rangeland ecosystem can be attributed to the increase in soil organic carbon storage and the increased aboveground biomass resulting from the increased nitrogen in the ecosystem. The practice of interseeding adaptable cultivars of alfalfa into native rangelands may help in the mitigation of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and enhance the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Interseeding; Legume; Rangelands; Soil organic carbon","Carbon; Chelation; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Seed; Soils; Sustainable development; Carbon sequestration; Interseeding; Legume; Rangeland ecosystem; Rangeland soils; Soil organic carbon; Plants (botany); organic carbon; carbon sequestration; legume; rangeland; soil organic matter; alfalfa; article; biomass production; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; chronobiology; comparative study; ecosystem; grass; land biome; nitrogen fixation; rangeland; soil; Carbon; Chelation; Ecosystems; Plants; Seeding; North America; South Dakota; United States; Medicago sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444460340

The stochastically cooled proton beam and the used detection system allowed to determine the momenta of the outgoing protons with a precision of [Formula Presented] in the center-of-mass frame. The determination of the four-momentum vectors of both outgoing protons allowed to derive the complete kinematical information of the [Formula Presented] system. An unexpectedly large enhancement of the occupation density in the kinematical regions of low proton-[Formula Presented] relative momenta is observed. A description taking the proton-proton and the [Formula Presented]-proton interaction into account and assuming an on-shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the produced particles fails to explain this strong effect. Its understanding will require a rigorous three-body approach to the [Formula Presented] system and the precise determination of contributions from higher partial waves.

The design of air quality strategies for the road-based public transportation system in the Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) is considered. An analysis is done of 28 different emission reduction strategies consisting of bundles of technological and supply and demand management emission reduction policies across alternative future development scenarios of the MCMA in the 2000-2025 period. The analysis combines demand modeling, fleet evolution modeling, mobile-source emissions modeling, and trade-off analysis to evaluate the impact of these emission reduction strategies and to determine their cost-effectiveness. The combined use of scenario analysis and multiattribute trade-off analysis is a unique approach that allows the design of strategies that are robust across a range of future uncertainties. Results of the analysis show that combinations of aggressive technological and supply and demand management strategies are needed to achieve sustained emission reductions in the 2000-2025 period. The recommendation calls for combinations of strategies that rely on aggressive hybrid vehicle introductions, catalyst and particulate matter and nitrogen oxide filter retrofitting, dedicated busways, public transportation fare integration, and subsidies and fuel taxes. These combined strategies can reduce transportation emissions by more than 85%. Results also indicate that even the most aggressive strategies fail to achieve sustained emission reductions in the case of urban sprawl and the rapid growth in transportation demand.",,"Air pollution; Fleet operations; Large scale systems; Mathematical models; Motor transportation; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Retrofitting; Strategic planning; Urban planning; Vehicles; Gross domestic products (GDP); Mexico city metropolitan area (MCMA); Road-based public transportation; Supply and demand management; Sustained emission reduction; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14544287728

The extent to which these benefits are due to enhanced mixing, low-temperature combustion modes, altered combustion phasing, or other factors is not fully understood. A traditional single-injection, an early-injection-only, and two dual-injection cases are studied using a suite of imaging diagnostics including spray visualization, natural luminosity imaging, and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of nitric oxide (NO). These data, coupled with heat-release and efficiency analyses, are used to enhance understanding of the in-cylinder processes that lead to the observed emissions reductions. Results show that combustion of the early-injected fuel occurs in two phases: a cool-flame phase characterized by very weak chemiluminescence, followed by a premixed-burn phase characterized by localized regions of bright soot incandescence. Combustion of the early-injected fuel liberates only a fraction of its chemical energy. Spray visualization images show that this low combustion efficiency could be due at least in part to liquid fuel penetrating to and wetting in-cylinder surfaces, but NO PLIF images of the early-injection-only case also show strong interferences from unburned fuel vapor and/or condensed fuel droplets, suggesting that incomplete bulk-gas combustion and quenching in crevices also may play roles. The traditional single-injection case produced the highest NO PLIF signal levels. Both dual-injection cases reduced NO PLIF signal levels, with the reduction being most dramatic for the retarded-main-injection case.

A full engine map was developed for the chosen mixture, and was verified over the steady-state AVL8 cycle. In general, the HCNG calibration included operation at higher air-fuel ratios and retarded spark timings. The results indicated that the NOx and NMHC emissions were reduced by 50% and 58% respectively, while the CO and CH4 emissions were slightly reduced. The HCNG engine torque, power and fuel consumption were maintained the same as for the natural gas fuel. The chassis dynamometer transient testing confirmed large NOx reduction of about 56% for HCNG operation. The buses have successfully completed the 24,000 miles field trials and their performance was found very satisfactory.

The flammability, combustion processes and emissions were studied by simulating, in small-scale, potential effects of a possible fire in full-scale bale storage area. Despite the high water content and the high density of the bales, after setting fire, the bales burned well, even though no risk for self-ignition exists. The following parameters of the combustion product were measured continuously: O2, CO2, CO, SO2, NO, NO 2, NOx, THC, smoke gas rate and the temperature of the smoke. Soot particles in the smoke were collected and analysed for Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Ni, Cr, Mn, Cu, Co, Sb and V concentrations. The analysis of the moisture content, concentrations of Hg, Cd, HCl, HF, HBr, NH3, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated and brominated dioxins (PCDD/F and PBrDD/F, respectively) were carried out.

The rate of attainment of environmental standards for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in urban areas is still low in Japan. Diesel vehicles emit the vast majority of air pollutants from exhaust. Therefore, developing emission measures, particularly for diesel vehicles, is an urgent task for addressing air pollution. Furthermore, at the Third Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 3) held in Kyoto in December 1997, Japan pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008 to 2012. To address vehicle emissions, Japan is gradually introducing increasingly strict NOx and particulate matter regulations. In addition, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) considers measures to encourage the development and promotion of EFVs as an important issue for the government alongside the setting of emission regulations and fuel-efficiency targets. Because EFVs are expensive and require tremendous R&amp;D investment, the Japanese government is promoting the development of next-generation EFVs to replace current heavy-duty diesel vehicles. The National Traffic Safety and Environment Laboratory spearheaded the launch of a three-year project starting in FY2002 to promote the development of next-generation EFVs. The project aims to have EFVs that can replace heavy-duty diesel vehicles reach the commercialization stage in 2010. Under this project, the development of new technologies for next-generation fuel-efficient low emission vehicles, including dimethyl ether (DME), natural gas, next-generation hybrids and super-clean diesel vehicles, is promoted.

Lab., Berkeley, CA, United States","In the United States, 48 million adults smoke 3.5-5 × 10 11 cigarettes/year. Many cigarettes are smoked in private residences, causing regular environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure to roughly 31 million nonsmokers (11% of the US population), including 16 million juveniles. (Upper bound estimates are 53 million exposed nonsmokers including 28 million juveniles.) ETS contains many chemical species whose industrial emissions are regulated by the US federal government as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). In this paper, average daily residential exposures to and intakes of 16 HAPs in ETS are estimated for US nonsmokers who live with smokers. The evaluation is based on material-balance modeling; utilizes published data on smoking habits, demographics, and housing; and incorporates newly reported exposure-relevant emission factors. The ratio of estimated average exposure concentrations to reference concentrations is close to or greater than one for acrolein, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and formaldehyde, indicating potential for concern regarding noncancer health effects from chronic exposures. In addition, lifetime cancer risks from residential ETS exposure are estimated to be substantial (∼2-500 per million) for each of five known or probable human carcinogens: acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene, acrylonitrile, and 1,3-butadiene. Cumulative population intakes from residential ETS are compared for six key compounds against ambient sources of exposure. ETS is found to be a dominant source of environmental inhalation intake for acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene. It is an important cause of intake for acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde, and a significant contributor to intake for benzene.","Exposure; Health risk; Indoor air quality; Passive smoking; Second-hand smoke; Toxic air contaminants","1,3 butadiene; acetaldehyde; acrolein; acrylonitrile; benzene; formaldehyde; tobacco smoke; adult; air particle control; air pollution; ambient air; cancer risk; concentration (parameters); conference paper; controlled study; demography; environmental exposure; female; hazardous waste; health hazard; household; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; passive smoking; population exposure; smoking habit; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; Female; Hazardous Substances; Housing; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; United States; Nicotiana tabacum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542438735

Experimental technique of plane photoelasticity was used for stress analysis. Stress level was determined according welding procedures and parameters established for each one of those procedures: height of the air flow jet, compressed air flow, temperature, welding sequence and sense of welding passes. It was obtained, a mapping of stresses and at the same time it was verified how welding situation affects stress state after welding process. Welding of medium to fine thickness plates results in large residual deformation next to the welding bead. In practice, there are difficulties for evaluation residual stresses level in this situation. Some numerical methods modeled those stresses to validate the experiments. In this way, the main contribution of this work was the visualization and quantification of the stresses levels in welding of plane plates, using bidimentional photoelasticity.

The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of clonidine premedication on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia during sevoflurane anesthesia using the carbon dioxide (CO 2) steady state method. Methods: Sixty children (3-13 yr) were assigned to receive clonidine 4 μg·kg-1 or placebo. Anesthesia was maintained with spontaneous breathing and 2% sevoflurane. Minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (RR), endtidal CO2 pressure (PECO2), and arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured with a facemask tightly fitted before and during 7% CO2 inhalation. Results: Compared with placebo, oral clonidine failed to reduce VE volume before CO2 loading under general anesthesia with 2% sevoflurane. Inhalation of CO2 increased VE. Oral clonidine did not attenuate the increase in VE induced by hypercapnic challenge under sevoflurane anesthesia. There were no differences in RR, P ECO2, or SpO2 between the placebo and clonidine groups before and during CO2 loading. Conclusion: These data suggest that oral clonidine is a suitable premedication for sevoflurane anesthesia under spontaneous breathing conditions in children.","Alpha2-agonists; Hypercapnia; Premedication; Sevoflurane","carbon dioxide; clonidine; sevoflurane; adolescent; article; breathing; breathing rate; child; controlled study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; face mask; general anesthesia; human; hypercapnia; lung minute volume; lung ventilation; major clinical study; oxygen saturation; pediatric anesthesia; premedication; priority journal; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Analgesics; Analysis of Variance; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Carbon Dioxide; Child; Child, Preschool; Clonidine; Humans; Hypercapnia; Methyl Ethers; Preanesthetic Medication; Pulmonary Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144332968

It is thus important to develop technology that can suppress N2O emission. The effects of sludge retention time (SRT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on N2O emission in an anoxic-oxic activated sludge system were estimated. Moreover, the microbial community structure in the sludge, which plays an important role in N2O suppression, was clarified based on nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene analysis by molecular biological techniques. The results showed that under low SRT conditions, nitrification efficiency was reduced and the N2O emission rate in the oxic reactors was increased. It was also observed that N2O emission was enhanced under low DO conditions, where the available oxygen is insufficient for nitrification. Moreover, molecular analysis revealed that the clones identified in this study were closely related to Ralstonia eutropha and Paracoccus denitrificans. The fact that the identified sequences are not closely related to known culturable denitrifier nosZ sequences indicates a substantial in situ diversity of denitrifiers contributing to N2O suppression, which are not reflected in the cultivatable fraction of the population. The further application of these new molecular techniques should serve to enhance our knowledge of the microbial community of denitrifying bacteria contributing to N2O suppression in wastewater treatment systems.","Denitrification; Dissolved oxygen; Global warming; Nitrification; nosZ; sludge retention time","Bacteria; Genes; Global warming; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Sewage sludge; Wastewater; Sludge retention time (SRT); Enzymes; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; oxygen; activated sludge; bacterium culture; calculation; conference paper; denitrification; DNA extraction; enzyme activity; gas analysis; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic analysis; greenhouse effect; mathematical computing; microflora; molecular biology; molecular cloning; nitrification; Paracoccus denitrificans; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; reactor; sludge; time; waste component removal; waste water management; water sampling; Wautersia eutropha; Bacteria (microorganisms); Paracoccus denitrificans; Ralstonia; Wautersia eutropha",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346008003

This study was performed to investigate the potential to achieve even lower particulate emission if a 9-liter Scania diesel engine, running on ethanol fuel is equipped with emission control. State-of-the art technology in emission control was applied, e.g., exhaust gas recirculation, EGR, catalysts and a continuous regenerating particle filter, DPF. Particulate emissions were compared with emissions from a 9-liter Scania diesel engine from the same engine family, running on Swedish environmental class 1 diesel fuel. Tailpipe measurements of particle size and distribution were performed with a scanning mobility particle sizer, SMPS, instrument together with filter sampling. An evaluation of SMPS measurements was performed for test conditions specified according to a 22-mode test cycle, which included the test modes in the European Stationary Cycle, ESC. Calculated weighted particle mass from SMPS-data, and in accordance with ESC, showed that the ethanol engine without emission control emitted approx. 1/12 of particle mass compared to the diesel engine. Weighted particulate emissions were reduced by approx. 96%, when the engine was fitted with EGR and DPF. The reduction of weighted particulate emissions was even higher when the diesel engine was fitted with EGR and DPF, as high as 99%. Particle size and distribution measurements revealed that particles emitted from the ethanol engine mainly consisted of ultrafine particles (<100nm), usually had a mean diameter of about 30 nm, while particles emitted from the diesel engine usually had mean diameters of about 60-70 nm and sizes going up to approx. 300 nm. Filter samples analyzed by Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis SEM/EDX showed that the particles, both from the ethanol-fueled engine and the diesel fueled engine mainly consisted of carbon and that they agglomerated, dependent upon running conditions, chainlike or clot-wise. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the same elemental carbon was present in particles emitted from diesel and ethanol-fueled engines. The investigations showed that the system used, with EGR and DPF combined, is highly effective in reducing particulate emissions from ethanol and diesel-fueled diesel engines. A general conclusion is also that the ethanol-fueled engine, equipped with emission control system or not, emitted lower particle mass, smaller particle sizes and approx. the same or a greater number of particles in the emissions than the diesel fueled engine.

Some advantages of using GTL as a diesel engine fuel include reduction of soot emission levels, power output and fuel consumption with GTL to conventional diesel fuel operation is equivalent, super-low sulfur content of GTL and its liquid state at normal temperature and pressure. However, there are some problems with putting GTL fuel on the market, such as lubricity, aptitude for sealing materials, high cetane index and high pour point. It is necessary to use additives to improve GTL's lubricity, and selecting the most appropriate type of lubricity improver is also important. The influence of GTL on the swelling properties of standard rubber materials seem basically the same, but it is necessary to notice on used rubbers. The cetane number is needed to evaluate compression ignition characteristics of GTLs, because errors of cetane index tend to be large for GTL. Blending GTL kerosene in GTL fuel is one method in securing of GTL's low temperature flowability.

In the past, a method of injecting fuel at the initial stage of the compression stroke has been proposed, but it is known that fuel adheres to the cylinder wall, causing a decline in combustion efficiency and oil dilution. The authors have developed Premixed Compression Ignition (PCI) combustion as a technology of solving the above problem as well as simultaneously reducing NOx and soot. In PCI combustion, fuel is injected into a combustion chamber in the vicinity of the top dead center for preventing fuel from adhering to the wall, and pre-mixture, which is formed shortly before ignition, is burnt. By pre-mixing, this combustion reduces the over-rich region of the mixture to reduce soot emissions, and at the same time lowers the combustion temperature by introducing a large amount of EGR to reduce NOx emissions. This paper reports the result of detailed examination of the basic characteristics of PCI combustion using a single-cylinder engine, and that PCI combustion which uses our investigated approaching can achieve substantial and simultaneous reduction of NOx and soot. This paper also studies the possibility of realizing Split-PCI combustion, which uses the two different combustion modes of PCI combustion and diffusion combustion during one cycle, in high-load operation where application of PCI combustion is restricted by diesel knock. As results of this study, this paper reports that it is available to reduce NOx and soot emissions to a large extent by Split-PCI combustion, even in high-load operation.

We have developed various micro/nano probes for nanometric sensing and processing. A silicon probe array with integrated electrostatic actuators could manipulate an individual nanomaterial and characterize its electric properties. Irradiation of a laser beam on the small gap of the two metallized probes with the electrostatic actuator generates a localized near-field light beyond the diffraction limit of light with a high efficiency because of surface plasmon enhancement, and scanning optical near-filed microscopy (NSOM) was demonstrated. In order to overcome its low wear resistance on these silicon probes, diamond microfabrication was developed. A diamond multiprobe with an integrated diamond tip on each probe could applied to thermomechanical lithography for defining features of 20 nm, and also high-density data storage based on ferroelectric nonlinear scanning microscopy was demonstrated. Miniaturization of mechanical sensing elements enables to raise its resolution and response. In order to integrate individual carbon nanotube (CNT) into these probes, a selective growth technique using field-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was de developed. Nanofabrication of single crystalline silicon for nanomechanical sensing was developed and minimum thickness of 20 nm was achieved. Ultrathin single crystalline silicon cantilevers with a thickness of below 100 nm exhibit a very low thermomechanical noise, and applied to ultra-high sensitive sensing for a small force and mass. A force of below 3.0×10-16 N was detected in vacuum at room temperature, which will open up new applications in imaging science. Using the developed mass sensors, a minimum detectable mass of 10-18 g in vacuum and 2×10-14 g in atmosphere were demonstrated for bio-chemical sensing. This nanomechanical structure has a limitation in the detectable minimum value in atmosphere because of the low Q factor originated in gas dumping. Therefore, we have been studying resonant structure of AT-cut quart that has shear vibration mode with a feasibility of high Q factor in atmosphere. A resonator made of the AT-cut quartz with a cantilevered shape shows various vibration modes depending on the excitation frequency, and high sensitive force and chemical sensing are expected. We believe that instrumentations developed by NEMS/MEMS will play an important role in future nanoscience and nanoengineering. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Actuators; Arrays; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical sensors; Chemical vapor deposition; Diamonds; Microelectromechanical devices; Micromachining; Nanotechnology; Near field scanning optical microscopy; Silicon; Tools; Wear resistance; Micro-components; Miniaturization; Nanomechanical sensing; Thermomechanical noise; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344445898

Farmers also frequently migrate on temporary basis to locations which have favourable farming conditions or better access to markets. More permanent migration to towns and cities has also increased. Farming practices and heavy reliance on forest resources have resulted in soil erosion and deforestation which have reduced water retention, increased flooding after rains and reduced water flow between the rains. These environmental changes complicate living with increased climate variability in the future because reduced natural resource base may not be able to provide the same safety net functions as it currently provides during periods of stress. This would be particularly problematic for those who live in more remote rural villages and who suffer from limited access to markets, public services and utilities. Efforts to reduce vulnerability to increased climate variability in the region would need to safeguard the natural resource base, promote market access and augment human capital. Natural resource base demands attention because its safety net functions are important to large proportions of rural and urban population and because the loss of ecosystem services would increase the exposure of large downstream populations to floods and scarcity of water. The promotion of market participation can provide incentives to diversification and intensification and help reduce dependence on risky agricultural production. Finally, diversification of livelihoods is constrained by deficiencies in physical health, skills and knowledge. Therefore, public spending and programs related to health, education and wellbeing can facilitate diversification in the future.","Adaptation to climate change; Livelihoods; Social justice; Tanzania; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449083496

Even if PM10 averages are within the order of magnitude of (or slightly above) the European legislated values - the same happens with PM2.5, considering the USA EPA guidelines - lead levels are well below such limits, particularly since the use of unleaded fuels became mandatory in the late 1990s. Through the country, nickel appears more concentrated in PM2.5 than in the coarse fraction and, apart from extreme cases (rural sites and coal-fired plants), its levels are not significantly different from place to place. Highest values for arsenic and mercury have been found in the vicinity of the coal-fired plants as well.

It is known that carbon- and nitrogen-signaling pathways influence one another to affect gene expression, but little is known about which genes are regulated by interactions between carbon and nitrogen signaling or the mechanisms by which the different pathways interact. RESULTS: Microarray analysis was used to study global changes in mRNA levels due to carbon and nitrogen in Arabidopsis thaliana. An informatic analysis using InterAct Class enabled us to classify genes on the basis of their responses to carbon or nitrogen treatments. This analysis provides in vivo evidence supporting the hypothesis that plants have a carbon/nitrogen (CN)-sensing/regulatory mechanism, as we have identified over 300 genes whose response to combined CN treatment is different from that expected from expression values due to carbon and nitrogen treatments separately. Metabolism, energy and protein synthesis were found to be significantly affected by interactions between carbon and nitrogen signaling. Identified putative cis-acting regulatory elements involved in mediating CN-responsive gene expression suggest multiple mechanisms for CN responsiveness. One mechanism invokes the existence of a single CN-responsive cis element, while another invokes the existence of cis elements that promote nitrogen-responsive gene expression only when present in combination with a carbon-responsive cis element. CONCLUSION: This study has allowed us to identify genes and processes regulated by interactions between carbon and nitrogen signaling and take a first step in uncovering how carbon- and nitrogen-signaling pathways interact to regulate transcription.",,"carbon; nitrogen; Arabidopsis; article; biological model; enhancer region; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; growth, development and aging; methodology; microarray analysis; physiology; plant seed; protein database; signal transduction; validation study; Arabidopsis; Carbon; Databases, Protein; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Microarray Analysis; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; Seeds; Signal Transduction; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20044381102

A4 as a convenient reporter gene. Methods and Results: Thermus thermophilus PPKU was constructed, in which the β-gal gene was deleted from the chromosome. Two inducible promoters PdnaK (regulating the DnaK heat shock-inducible protein) and Parg (regulating expression of an arginine-inducible protein) and a carbon-regulated promoter, Pscs-mdh (regulating expression of succinyl-coA and malate dehydrogenase) were cloned upstream of the β-gal reporter gene derived from Thermus sp. A4 to construct vectors pTEX7, pTEX8 and pTEX9, respectively. The amount of β-galactosidase activity produced by the PdnaK promoter in pTEX7 was substantially above the background level of 0.3 U mg -1, and increased from 5.2 to 10.4 U mg-1 after heat-shock induction indicating that significant amounts of DnaK are produced even when T. thermophilus is grown at its optimum temperature. The Parg promoter was found to be maximally induced by 10-30 mM arginine, but was inhibited by higher concentrations. The Pscs-mdh promoter was maximally active in the presence of malate while lower levels of activity were observed in the presence of succinate, pyruvate, glutamate, glucose and the presence of yeast extract or peptone. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that several inducible and regulated promoters are available for genetic studies in Thermus and that β-galactosidase can be used as a convenient reporter gene for studies of transcriptional regulation in Thermus. Significance and Impact of the Study: The availability of characterized inducible and regulated promoters will facilitate the development of improved gene expression vectors for Thermus. The demonstration that β-galactosidase activity in T. thermophilus PPKU can be used to allow reliable screening for β-gal-positive transformant colonies on agar plates will add to the convenience of performing genetic manipulations in T. thermophilus. Future studies of transcriptional regulation in Thermus will benefit from the β-gal host-vector system reported here.","β-galactosidase; Gene expression; Inducible; Promoter; Thermus","beta galactosidase; glucose; glutamic acid; peptone; protein; pyruvic acid; regulating expression of an arginine inducible protein; regulating expression of succinyl coa and malate dehydrogenase; regulating the dnak heat shock inducible protein; succinic acid; unclassified drug; gene expression; article; bacterial strain; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene expression regulation; gene induction; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; promoter region; protein induction; reporter gene; temperature sensitivity; Thermus thermophilus; Acyl Coenzyme A; Arginine; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Galactosidase; Carbon; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Reporter; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Malate Dehydrogenase; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Thermus thermophilus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Thermus; Thermus sp.; Thermus thermophilus; vectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042509674

However, to achieve this level of CF4 reduction biofilters must be properly designed. The present study was conducted to develop a method for properly designing biofilters based on landfill size and location. A quadratic equation was developed to describe the dependence of CH4 oxidation rate in a sandy loam textured soil as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture and ammonium nitrogen concentration. Using this equation and the average monthly soil temperature and moisture contents for the largest cities of each of the 48 contiguous states, the monthly CH4 oxidation rate at each location was calculated. Then, assuming a standard landfill depth of 27.6 m, and a standard area of 121,500 m2, the required biofilter size was calculated. Finally, the ratio of biofilter size to landfill size was calculated. Design calculations for biofilters located in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas where the CH4 oxidation rates are relatively high throughout the year indicate that the necessary biofilter sizes are small. In addition, biofilters in these states may be expected to be effective throughout the year. In contrast, the calculations indicated biofilter systems in the states of Idaho, Minnesota and North Dakota will have much lower efficiencies during much of the year due to unfavorable soil moisture and temperature ranges. Given proper design, installation and management, a biofilter should be capable of achieving a significant reduction in atmospheric CH4 emission as compared to emissions from the same landfill without a biofilter.","Landfill gas; Methane; Methanotrophs; Oxidation; Soil biofilter","Air pollution; Gas emissions; Installation; Land fill; Methane; Moisture; Oxidation; Quadratic programming; Reaction kinetics; Methane emissions; Quadratic equation; Soil moisture; Soil temperature; Biofilters; methane; biofilter; design; landfill; methane emission; air particle control; article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric diffusion; biofilter; calculation; landfill; methanotrophic bacterium; moisture; oxidation kinetics; particle size; plume dispersion; soil aggregation; soil temperature; temperature dependence; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944249798

The reduction of the meteorological influence in the O3 mechanisms is achieved by applying meteorological classifications. The analysis for the cold period reveals that CO and NO display decreasing concentrations from weekdays to weekends, whereas O3 shows increasing concentrations. During the warm period, although primary pollutants display decreased concentrations compared to the cold period, their weekly cycles remain the same. On the other hand, meteorological changes affect the weekly cycle of ozone peaks.

The characteristics of the recalculating flow are dependent on the swirl number and on axial pressure gradients. Coupling to downstream pressure pulsations is also possible. Control methods of unstable thermoacoustic modes and reduction of NOx and CO emissions were investigated in a low-emission swirl-stabilized industrial combustor. Several axisymmetric and helical unstable modes were identified for fully premixed and diffusion type combustion. In addition to mode variation, the instabilities spanned a wide range of frequencies. The unstable modes that were associated with flow instabilities of the wake-like region on the combustor axis due to vortex breakdown (VBD), shear layer instabilities at the sudden expansion (dump plane) and equivalence ratio fluctuations were in a range of normalized frequency St = 0.5 - 1.1. Other unstable modes at higher frequencies of St = 7.77, were excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices shed at the burner's exit. The combustion structures associated with the different unstable modes were visualized using phase locked images of OH chemiluminescence and analyzed using cross-correlations between OH detecting fiberoptics. After identifying the structure of the instabilities and determining their source, different geometrical changes were applied to disrupt their formation or vary their characteristics. These modifications reduced the periodic heat release and enabled decoupling of the heat from acoustic modes that led to thermoacoustic instabilities. The passive control techniques that will be described in this paper were effective in suppressing the thermoacoustic pressure oscillations and also reduced NOx and CO emissions.",,"Aerodynamics; Carbon monoxide; Chemiluminescence; Combustors; Correlation methods; Diffusion; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Photoacoustic effect; Visualization; Vortex flow; Wakes; Combustion control; Swirl number; Thermoacoustic pressure oscillations; Vortex breakdown; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244251726

Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are one of the geologic targets considered for sequestration. Even though CO2 is currently being used in the enhanced oil recovery operations, injection of CO2 in depleted oil reservoirs as a carbon sequestration strategy needs validation. This paper provides an overview of the first U.S. field test of CO2 sequestration in a depleted oil reservoir, sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. The main objective of the project is characterization of CO2 migration through an integrated study that includes, field/laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. A small-scale field experiment was conducted whereby approximately 2100 tons of CO2 was injected in the West Pearl Queen Field, NM over a two-month period. Migration of CO2 was monitored using high-resolution 4-dimensional surface seismic surveys as well as downhole pressure monitors. Comparison of pre-injection and post-injection surveys indicates presence of an anomaly within the vicinity of the injection well, which could be resulting from injected CO2. After a 6-month soaking period CO2 was vented from the injection well. The amount of reservoir fluids produced during venting was monitored. A number of samples of reservoir fluid and gas were collected for compositional analyses. Changes in chemical compositions of fluid samples were observed indicating interaction between CO2 and reservoir fluids.

Subsequently, environment quality preservation organizations increased their pressure on their government to adopt the ""precautionary principle"" and to reduce the allowable ELF Magnetic Field exposure to much lower values than are recommended by ICNIRP-1998. As an example the present Environmental Ministry in Israel recommendation is to lower the ELF Field exposure to 10mG averaged over 24h. As a result of this stringent exposure guideline imposed by the government, electrical engineers who are involved in the deployment and installation of large and medium electrical utilities, such as overhead power lines, transformers, UPS systems, electrical public transportation, switching stations, etc., are much more aware to the need to employ special measures and methods for reducing the magnetic fields that might be emitted from such utilities. There are few computer codes that are capable of analyzing with great accuracy magnetic and electric fields surrounding single phase and three phase electrical utilities in a 3-D system. The best presentations of the analysis results are by equi-value contours depicting electric and magnetic fields. This graphical presentation is a powerful design tool that enables better deployment and installation design aided to reduce the magnetic field emissions from high-power electrical utilities. This paper describes the various types of graphical presentations available for ELF field contours, the dependent and independent variants and parameters, magnetic field animation for optimization of power line installation and routing, and finally an example that demonstrates the usefulness of the graphical presentation tools. ©2004 IEEE.",,"Environment quality preservation; Extremely low frequency (ELF); Power line installation; Root mean square (rms); Algorithms; Cost effectiveness; Electric fields; Electric lines; Electric utilities; Electrical engineering; Electromagnetic fields; Graphic methods; Uninterruptible power systems; Vectors; Magnetic fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444395265

However, increasingly stringent emission regulations such as those found in California pose a major technical challenge that these devices must overcome if they are to make significant market penetrations. In the context of these regulations, the present study characterizes the exhaust emissions and mixing capability of a commercial MTG and assesses (1) the ability of this device to meet future emissions regulatory requirement and (2) the extent to which mixing can be used to reduce emissions. The results establish that, for this MTG, both NOx and CO are minimized for 80-100% load. Kinetics and CFD analysis illustrate how NOx emissions are affected by local equivalence ratios and how fuel staging and local quenching impact CO emissions. Measured injector premixing levels indicate a standard deviation of less than 4% relative to the mean. Subsequent analysis using a well-stirred reactor approach suggests a maximum of a 10% reduction in NOx could be achieved with further improved premixing.",,"Carbon monoxide; Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuel injection; Gas turbines; Particulate emissions; Retrofitting; Catalytic combustion; Microturbine generators (MTG); Surface stabilized combustion; Turbogenerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244270747

This standard limits dioxin/furan emissions to less than 0.2 or 0.4 ng/dscm toxic equivalency (TEQ) depending on the cement kiln system's inlet temperature to the air pollution control device (APCD). In order to maximize operational flexibility at either of these types of operations, cement-manufacturing facilities strive to demonstrate compliance with this emission standard while operating at the highest APCD inlet temperature possible. Previous guidance and data supplied by industry and the United State Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) indicate that operating temperature is a significant factor in the formation of dioxin/furans. Therefore, accurate correlations between APCD inlet temperatures and dioxin/furan emissions for a manufacturing process would prove useful for operators. The usefulness of such a predictive tool extends from the design and performance of compliance emissions testing to possible easement of future regulations to allow extrapolation to higher APCD inlet temperatures.

Patterns were faithfully transferred to many different organic compounds, including polymers, low-molar-mass compounds, and blends, up to 100-nm scale resolution. Lithography does not reduce the emission yields of light-emitting organic compounds, thus opening the way to the one-step realization of organic-based confined optoelectronic devices. We carefully investigated the possible changes in the optical properties (absorbance, luminescence, and quantum yield) of light-emitting species, thus ruling out any possible degradation of the active materials after patterning. In particular, the observed increase in the external luminescence yield is ascribed to the reduced self-absorption within the dielectric slab of the organic film, as a consequence of the pattern-induced enhanced forward scattering. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For better understanding of combustion systems and hence having the possibility of systematic innovation of gas turbine combustion systems, a permanent improvement of design tools is essential. Demonstrated here is the use of an advanced combustion model - the INTRINSIC LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLD (ILDM) approach - in Computational Flow Dynamics (CFD) analysis. In the past, chemical kinetic models used in CFD-calculations were based on empirical parameters and so called ""global mechanisms"" which are in fact ""local"" models and can be used only when modeling one operating point of the gas turbine combustion system. The scope of the integration of the ILDM approach into CFD is the use of a generalized approach for modeling chemical kinetics in CFD. Turbulence-chemistry interaction is considered by a presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) approach. The benefit of this method is a realistic prediction of all relevant flame characteristics e.g. piloting of premixed flames.

The network of the ground-based MF and meteor radars for measuring winds in the Arctic upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere provides an excellent opportunity for study of the main global dynamical structures in this height region and their dependence from longitude. Preliminary estimates of the differences between the measured winds and tides from the different radar types, situated 125-273 km apart (Tromsø, Andenes and Esrange), are provided. Despite some differences arising from using different types of radars it is possible to study the dynamical wind structures. It is revealed that most of the observed dynamical structures are persistent from year to year, thus permitting the analysis of the Arctic MLT dynamics in a climatological sense. The seasonal behaviour of the zonally averaged wind parameters is, to some extent, similar to that observed at the moderate latitudes. However, the strength of the winds (except the prevailing meridional wind and the diurnal tide amplitudes) in the Arctic MLT region is, in general, less than that detected at the moderate latitudes, decreasing toward the pole. There are also some features in the vertical structure and seasonal variations of the Arctic MLT winds which are different from the expectations of the well-known empirical wind models CIRA-86 and HWM-93. The tidal phases show a very definite longitudinal dependence that permits the determination of the corresponding zonal wave numbers. It is shown that the migrating tides play an important role in the dynamics of the Arctic MLT region. However, there are clear indications with the presence in some months of non-migrating tidal modes of significant appreciable amplitude. © European Geosciences Union 2004.","Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (middle atmosphere dynamics, climatology; waves and tides, instruments and techniques)","atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric tide; atmospheric wave; mesosphere; thermosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644292488

One of several applied methodologies, biogeochemical modeling, offers possibilities to distribute estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) over regions, estimate the effects of changes in climate and ecosystem management on SOC, and quantify changes of soil properties over time or space. In this study, the sensitivity of the Century model was assessed in regards to uncertainties for soil texture, natural fire return periods, grazing intensities, and climate. The study area was situated in central Sudan and dominated by subsistence agroecosystems. Uncertainties in the modeling of historical SOC levels, prior to known human interactions, can be reflected in the estimation of the current or future SOC levels, as some soil processes take many years to occur. The relationship between these differences in historical and current SOC levels was calculated. Soil texture, derived from a number of different sources, had the greatest impact on modeled SOC. Overall, data uncertainties for the five parameters tested resulted in SOC variations of up to 160 g C/m2 (1.6 t C/ha) for the estimation of the current level (year 2002), which corresponds to a difference of approximately 80% of the average current level. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Century; Modeling; Semiarid; Sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Sudan; Uncertainties","Agronomy; Arid regions; Biochemistry; Carbon; Chelation; Degradation; Ecosystems; Geochemistry; Parameter estimation; Biogeochemical modeling; Semiarid; Uncertainties; Soils; organic carbon; carbon sequestration; modeling; organic carbon; soil organic matter; uncertainty analysis; agroecosystem; ambiguity; article; atmosphere; biogeochemistry; carbon sequestration; climate; data analysis; environmental management; grazing; model; soil analysis; spatial soil variability; Sudan; Agronomy; Carbon; Chelation; Degradation; Ecosystems; Geochemistry; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544466383

This study was conducted to determine decomposition rates of the legume soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and nonlegume grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] residue produced under two levels of atmospheric CO2 (ambient and twice ambient) on a Blanton loamy sand (loamy siliceous, thermic, Grossarenic Paleudults) in Auburn, Alabama, USA, managed using no-till practices. At maturity, harvested plants were separated into component parts for dry weight determination and tissue analysis. Mass, C, and N losses from residues were determined using the mesh bag method. Biomass production was significantly greater for soybean compared to sorghum and for elevated versus ambient CO 2-grown plants. The CO2 level had little affect on the C/N ratio of residue (probably because the tissue used was senesced). Elevated CO2 concentration did not affect percent residue recovery; however, greater biomass production observed under elevated CO2 resulted in more residue and C remaining after overwintering. The higher total N content of soybean residue, particularly when grown under elevated CO2, indicated more N may be available to a following crop with lower N inputs required. Results suggest that in a high CO2 environment, greater amounts of residue may increase soil C and ground cover, which may enhance soil water storage, improve soil physical properties, and reduce erosion losses. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Global change; Leaves; Litter; Roots; Sorghum; Soybean; Stems","Atmospherics; Biomass; Concentration (process); Ecosystems; Erosion; Nitrogen; Water; Agroecosystems; Crop residue; Global change; Litter; Agriculture; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; agroecology; biomass; carbon dioxide; decomposition; agroecosystem; article; atmospheric deposition; biomass production; decomposition; dry weight; legume; loam soil; nitrogen dynamics; soil amendment; soil analysis; soil erosion; soil water content; sorghum; soybean; United States; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Concentration; Ecosystems; Erosion; Nitrogen; Water; Glycine max; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum bicolor bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942569979

Possible links between observed climate change at these stations and possible natural and anthropogenic drivers were also investigated. Regression analysis indicates that the temperature in Ottawa increased, on average, at a rate of &gt;0.01°C yr−1 in comparison to adjacent rural areas over the last century. Wavelet analysis shows that this relative urban warming trend was primarily manifested in the form of multidecadal and interseasonal cycles that are likely attributable to gradual increased winter heating in Ottawa (heat island effects) associated with population growth. We estimate that the 1°C increase in the Ottawa temperature is equivalent to an increase in population size of ∼400,000. In contrast, interannual variability correlates well between rural and urban areas with about the same temperature amplitudes. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"climate variation; regression analysis; rural-urban comparison; temporal variation; wavelet; Canada; North America; Ontario; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7444232475

The EEIS program was sponsored by Queensland EPA, Ergon Energy and Education Queensland. Participants learnt about innovation, leadership, coal mining, greenhouse issues, the “greenhouse challenge”, conducting energy audits, alternative energy and promoting energy efficient practices in school and the community. Three EEIS models in Queensland that supported change in energy usage behaviours of participants (school students, parents and staff) is examined. In each of the models, interviews were conducted and questionnaires were completed with participants. In Model 1 it was found that, overall; the EEIS program did develop positive energy efficient behaviours in those who participated. In relation to whole school effects, mixed results were obtained. In Model 1 a rural school initially reduced energy consumption by fifty percent and in Model 2 significant changes in energy efficient behaviours in the school communities occurred. In Model 3 one school followed through an action plan and similar positive effects were observed. The development of an action plan that is implemented in the school, the selection of suitable participants, and post-program visits to schools by relevant staff were among the factors that contributed to the overall success. Each model was found to have achieved their aims to varying degrees but had outcomes that are likely to have both lifetime and possibly intergenerational effects. © 2004, Cambridge University Press.

Greenhouse gas abatement is part of the pressure that is redefining agricultural practices and the nature and extent of forestry in Australia in an attempt to meet international obligations (targets) defined in the Kyoto Protocol. While a considerable investment has been made to improve understanding of the processes of carbon emission and sequestration in the land sector, comparatively little effort has been devoted to understanding the social dimension of the massive changes that some expect landholders will have to make. In broad terms, the key social issues relate to the nature, scale and rate of change by individual landholders, geographical communities and industry sectors, but a full understanding of the key social issues is yet to be attained. For instance, many farming families and agricultural industries do not have the social and economic capacity to make widespread changes to current practices, even if alternative practices are highly desirable. Furthermore, there is great variation in the feasible options available to individual farming families, regional communities and rural sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — forced change may see this disparity increase. This paper contributes to the debate in favour of carbon sequestration by providing information about appropriate and feasible change which is sensitive to the social context of rural Australia. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agriculture; Australia; Carbon sequestration; Change; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Social change; Social impact","Acoustic emissions; Agriculture; Carbon; Cultivation; Forestry; Geographical regions; Land use; Social aspects; Carbon sequestration; Change; Green house gases; Social change; Social impact; Greenhouse effect; Agriculture; Carbon; Cultivation; Emission; Forestry; Geographic Variations; Greenhouse Effect; Land",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144234824

Nowadays, several techniques such as injection control strategies, EGR and exhaust after treatment devices have been used to reduce diesel emissions. However, emission control alternatives are often accompanied by fuel consumption or cost penalties and also, the request for improving the pollutant emissions behavior of the existing diesel vehicle fleet has become mandatory. Thus, research scientists and engineers have focused also on the area of fuel composition for the reduction of pollutant emissions. Of major importance seems to be the use of oxygenated additives to reduce particulate emissions. According to recent studies, soot emissions are decreased following the increase of oxygen percentage. But the effect of oxygen content and type of oxygenate on soot formation and oxidation process and NO formation mechanism have not been fully elucidated yet. A question is also raised as whether the presence of fuel-bounded oxygen affects the soot formation or oxidation mechanism. A further question concerns the NO emissions and specifically, up to what extent the presence of oxygen inside the fuel affects its local formation rate and thus, tailpipe emission values. For this reason, in the present study a multi-zone combustion model is used after modifications to examine the effect of oxygenated additive percentage and type on combustion and pollutant formation processes of DI Diesel engines. One conventional and two oxygenated fuels having oxygen content between 0% and 9% are examined. Rapeseed methyl ester, diglyme and butyl-diglyme are mixed at different proportions with a commercial diesel fuel. Representative chemical formulas are derived for the two oxygenates and used to examine the effect of fuel-bounded oxygen on combustion characteristics in the simulation. The effect of oxygenates on soot formation and oxidation process and on NO formation mechanism is also investigated. The predictive ability of the multi-zone model with regard to cylinder pressure history and pollutant emissions is verified against corresponding results obtained from tests conducted in a single cylinder DI Ricardo Hydra diesel engine. Higher peak combustion pressures are experienced for the oxygenated fuels compared to conventional one. An earlier combustion commencement is observed for the oxygenated fuels as compared to the conventional one due to increase of cetane number and earlier shift of dynamic injection timing. The results reveal for the in-cylinder soot history that the fuel-bound oxygen enhances soot oxidation during expansion stroke. High fuel equivalence ratio and soot concentration areas within the fuel jet are confined with increasing oxygen content. It is shown also that the oxygen enrichment of the conventional fuel is not accompanied by a sharp increase of the in-cylinder NO concentration as expected due to decrease of the local temperature as a result of the lower fuel heating value.

Similar arguments can be made for global radiosonde observations. These uncertainties are often larger than the sensitive signals and processes, that satellite and radiosonde measurements are designed to reveal, particularly in the realm of climate. Possible strategies to quantify and compensate for these problems include the analysis of satellite overlap data and/or available collocations of satellite and ground truth (radiosonde) observations. However, overlap observations are typically not available except in extreme polar regions and current sampling strategies for compiling collocated radiosonde and satellite observations are insufficient, further compounding the inherent uncertainties in the ground-truth radiosonde data. A Satellite Upper Air Network is proposed to provide reference radiosonde launches coincident with operational polar satellite(s) overpass. The SUAN consist of 36 global radiosonde stations sub-sampled from the Global Upper Air Network (GUAN), and is designed to provide a robust, global sample of collocated radiosonde and satellite observations conducive to the monitoring and validation of satellite and radiosonde observations. The routine operation of such a network in conjunction with operational polar satellites would provide a long-term of performance for critical observations of particular importance for climate.

In 25 rats, the medullary cavity of both femurs was entered by an awl from the trochanteric area. With steel burrs it was successively reamed to a diameter of 2.0 mm. Nails with a diameter of 2.0 mm and with a length of 34 mm were inserted in a random manner; either a pure titanium nail, a titanium nail entirely plasma-sprayed with a 75-100-μm layer of HA or a titanium nail coated with 2-10-μm carbon. The surface roughness of the pure titanium was characterized by Ra 2.6 μm and Rt 22 μm. Ra of HA was 7.5 μm and Rt 52 μm, and of carbon Ra was 0.4 μm and Rt 4.0 μm. Twelve rats were randomized to a follow up of 8 weeks, and the remaining 13 rats were followed for 16 weeks. At sacrifice both femora were dissected free from soft tissues and then immersed in fixative. A specimen slice of about 5 mm thickness was prepared from the subtrochanteric region with a water-cooled band-saw. Sample preparation for un-decalcified tissue followed the internal guidelines at the laboratories of Biomaterials/Handicap Research. At 8 weeks the median bone bonding contact of the implants was 43% (range 0-74) in the titanium group, 39% (0-75) in the HA group, and 3% (0-59) in the carbon group.

More daring vehicle styling, innovative designs (modularity, platform commonization, hybrid powertrains, side airbag curtains, electronics), new materials and applications (dual-phase and boron steels, structural foam, aluminum, composites), manufacturing techniques (hydroforming, tailored blanks, weld-bonding, laser welding) and the like are offering consumers an increasing variety of product choices, with continuous improvements in comfort, safety, convenience, durability, fuel economy and emission reductions. In spite of all these advances in technologies, the reality is that vehicles will continue to be involved in collisions. The rate of increase in average collision repair costs more than offsets decreases in collision claims frequencies. How can the cost of insurance and collision repairs be kept in control, to keep vehicles affordable? How will collision repair technicians be able to repair these new technologies? The purpose of this paper are to provide real-world examples of designing vehicles for insurability, which means designing for damageability and repairability by recommending improvements, based on SAE Recommended Practice J1555, the Research Committee for Automobile Repairs ""Vehicle Design Features for Optimum Low Speed Impact Performance"" and other examples from automotive manufacturers. Among the specific topics covered include bumpers, exterior lighting, closure panels, body structures, chassis, exterior ornamentation, and engine compartment packaging. Utilization of these and other design guidelines by automobile manufacturers, along with the analysis of collision repair claims data and consultation with insurance companies and body repair shops, can provide assurance to customers that motor vehicles they purchase will be resilient to collision damage and inexpensive to repair. Collision repair shops will benefit from vehicles that are simple and cost effective to repair, increasing their productivity, quality and profitability. The Collision Repair Committee of the SAE Vehicle Service Development Division has sponsored incorporating many improvements in the Recommended Practice, J1555 Design Guidelines for Optimizing Vehicle Damageability, revised in 2000. The Research Council for Automobile Repairs, (RCAR), has also supported this effort over the past 30 years, by working directly with vehicle manufacturers. The development of design guidelines for improving vehicle damageability, repairability, safety and theft deterrence represents one of the best interactions of different industries with a common customer focus. While this document provides examples of the best design practices as observed by the North American RCAR research centers and specifically targeted toward vehicle manufacturers in this region, the recommendations herein are generally applicable to all new global vehicle designs. Also, automotive, insurance and repair industry experts have developed the guidelines in J1555 to provide practical alternatives and trade-offs so that all new vehicle program design parameters can be met in the most cost and time-efficient manner possible.

Higher in-cylinder pressures and leaner air/fuel ratios are required in order to meet these demands. The performance and durability of spark plug ignition systems suffer as a result of the increase in spark energy required to maintain suitable engine operation under these conditions. Advancing the state of the art of ignition systems for these engines is critical to meeting increased performance requirements. Laser-spark ignition has shown potential to improve engine performance and ignition system durability to levels required meet or exceed projected requirements. This paper discusses testing which extends previous efforts [1] to include constant fueling knock, misfire, thermal efficiency, and NOx emissions mapping of a single cylinder lean burn natural gas engine. Tests are conducted using an open beam path laser spark ignition system and a conventional spark plug based system for contrast. Under the conditions tested, the laser-spark ignition system increased the total operating envelope of the engine by 46% when compared to the conventional ignition system. Due to a wider misfire margin using the laser spark system, NOx emissions were half the minimum value of the spark plug ignition system with no appreciable degradation in thermal efficiency. Hydrocarbon emissions were comparable for both systems. The results of the testing are discussed in detail.

In the modem ocean, reduction in carbonate deposition on the continental shelves can be compensated for by the increased preservation in deep sea sediments of biogenic carbonate originating from planktic calcifiers living in the open ocean. The result is that ocean carbonate chemistry is strongly buffered and the carbon-climate system relatively stable. How-ever, before the advent of metazoan biomineralization in the Cambrian and proliferation of calcareous plankton during the Mesozoic, carbonate deposition would have been largely restricted to shallow water photic environments in the Neoproterozoic. A fall in sea level acting to restrict the photosynthetic area within Precambrian seas would necessarily initially decrease the global rate of carbonate deposition without being compensated by the typical Phanerozoic deep sea sedimentary ‘buffer’. Ultimately, carbonate precipitation would reestablish itself at a greater local rate throughout the more areally restricted seas. The resulting higher degree of ocean saturation translates to substantially lower atmospheric CO2 and colder terrestrial conditions. Ice ages of near-global extent and multi million-year duration can thus be understood as a direct consequence of the weak ‘buffering’ of the Precambrian carbon cycle, amplified by feedbacks involving CO2 and climate. Both the widespread occurrence and observed thickness of ‘cap’ (dolostone) carbonate deposited during postglacial flooding of the shelves are explicit predictions of this hypothesis, and record the rapid removal from a highly oversaturated ocean of excess alkalinity accumulated during the glacial. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014134467

Traditionally detectors for toxic gas leaks in chemical plants use catalytic beads, semiconductor or PID (= Photo Ionisation Detector) sensor technology. When it comes to certain gases, however, more is needed. Consider the toxic properties of Phosgene, of which the TLV (= Threshold Limit Value) is as low as 0.1 ppm in the United States of America, and even 20 ppb in Europe. It is obvious that for this application, extremely accurate sensor technology is needed, one specific to the actual gas being detected while avoiding common cross-sensitivities. For instance, the atmosphere even in a non-industrial environment contains up to 5 ppm Methane from natural gas sources. In urban areas 10 to 20 ppm CO and a certain amount of Nitrous gases from traffic and combustion processes may also be present. Many other substances from a variety of different sources can have a bearing on the environment. Compared to the low threshold value of Phosgene, sensors having cross interferences to one of the gases mentioned are inadequate for either monitoring or leak detection purposes. Another important issue is the fact that most Phosgene manufacturers and users have a strict ""zero emission"" policy. This obviously cannot be obtained if there is no tool available for determining a potential Phosgene concentration from the background of other gases.

Retail industry marketers, as a component of their evolving animal care audit programs, are issuing guidelines for the control and reduction of ammonia within poultry facilities to address animal welfare concerns. At the same time, pressure is being placed on poultry producers from interested groups and neighbors to reduce ammonia emissions for environmental reasons. Since the current procedure for reducing ammonia levels in houses is to exhaust air as much as possible, this will, in some part, conflict with efforts to reduce ammonia emissions from poultry live production facilities. Research will be needed from the industry and academia to develop methods of reducing nitrogen excreted by poultry, e.g., research in nutrition, genetics, poultry husbandry, and management. Research is needed to improve or develop methods of manure management and treatment that will reduce ammonia emissions. Research is also needed in developing methods of closing the loop, using nitrogen in poultry manures to produce crops that can be fed back to poultry. Importing major quantities of feedstuffs from other regions of the country and depositing manure onto low-productivity pastures or cropland may not be sustainable. Some combination of reducing excess nutrients in manure, alternative uses for these nutrients, shipping excess nutrients back to grain producing areas, or increasing grain production in poultry-producing areas will be required to address environmental concerns and minimize regulatory advances.","Ammonia; Emission; Health; Poultry","Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844286370

Despite this, there is little information on yield and oil content expectations in relation to rainfall, location, and soil type and the reliability of the crop in a region characterised by high climatic variability. In this paper we assess variation in profitability of canola production in locations with different rainfall in the north-eastern wheatbelt by using long-term simulations at 4 locations spanning the climatic range of the region (Gunnedah, Moree, Walgett, Roma) with a validated model (APSIM-Canola). A new semi-mechanistic method for simulating oil content, accounting for temperature and water deficit effects during grain filling, is described and tested. Key agronomic determinants of reliable grain yield and oil content are identified. Long-term simulations showed strong effects of location, plant-available soil water at sowing (PAW), and in-crop rainfall on grain yield expectations. Yield was negatively related to sowing date, particularly in those situations of high water supply (PAW and in-crop rainfall). Grain yield was positively related to in-crop rainfall up to 300 mm, with water use efficiency in most seasons falling between 6 and 12 kg/ha.mm. Variation in oil content was most strongly affected by sowing date, followed by location, with PAW having a minor effect. Importantly, the price bonus cut-off for oil content of 42% was exceeded in 25, 40, 40, and 55% of seasons for Roma, Walgett, Moree, and Gunnedah, respectively. Negative and falling phases of the SOI in April-May were associated with lower grain yield and oil contents, whereas positive and rising phases with higher grain yield and oil content. This suggests that the choice to sow canola over other alternatives could be a tactical decision that depends upon the seasonal climate outlook. The approach used in this paper can be applied to the analysis of canola production risk (yield and oil content) and profitability in other prospective environments.","Oil content; Plant-available water; Profitability; Simulation modelling; Sowing date","crop production; modeling; oil; profitability; risk assessment; sowing date; Australasia; Australia; Bonus; Brassica napus var. napus; Sinapis arvensis; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142659700

Attention has been focused on mechanisms which, if compromised, could give rise to dental fluorosis. The literature is extensive and often confusing but a much clearer picture is emerging based on recent more detailed knowledge of odontogenesis. Opacity, characteristic of fluorotic enamel, results from incomplete apatite crystal growth. How this occurs is suggested by other changes brought about by fluoride. Matrix proteins, associated with the mineral phase, normally degraded and removed to permit final crystal growth, are to some extent retained in fluorotic tissue. Fluoride and magnesium concentrations increase while carbonate is reduced. Crystal surface morphology at the nano-scale is altered and functional ameloblast morphology at the maturation stage also changes. Fluoride incorporation into enamel apatite produces more stable crystals. Local supersaturation levels with regard to the fluoridated mineral will also be elevated facilitating crystal growth. Such changes in crystal chemistry and morphology, involving stronger ionic and hydrogen bonds, also lead to greater binding of modulating matrix proteins and proteolytic enzymes. This results in reduced degradation and enhanced retention of protein components in mature tissue. This is most likely responsible for porous fluorotic tissue, since matrix protein removal is necessary for unimpaired crystal growth. To resolve the outstanding problems of the role of cell changes and the precise reasons for protein retention more detailed studies will be required of alterations to cell function, effect on specific protein species and the nano-chemistry of the apatite crystal surfaces.

Immediately after injection, the CO 2 will be stored as a free phase within the host rock. Over time it will dissolve into the local formation water and initiate a variety of geochemical reactions. Some of the these reactions could be beneficial, helping to chemically contain or 'trap' the CO 2 as dissolved species and by the formation of new carbonate minerals; others may be deleterious, and actually aid the migration of CO 2. It will be important to understand the overall impact of these competing processes. However, these processes will also be dependent upon the structure, mineralogy and hydrogeology of the specific lithologies concerned and the chemical stability of the engineered features (principally, the cement and steel components in the well completions). Therefore, individual storage operations will have to take account of local geological, fluid chemical and hydrogeological conditions. The aim of this paper is to review some of the possible chemical reactions that might occur once CO 2 is injected underground, and to highlight their possible impacts on long-term CO 2 storage. © The Geological Society of London 2004.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; chemical reaction; climate change; greenhouse gas; underground storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044220835

It is one of two scientific instruments on the Greenhouse Gases Observations Satellite (GOSAT) proposed for launch in 2008. The winds are to be determined by measuring the Doppler shift of thermal emission lines in a narrow spectral range using a limb viewing field widened Michelson interferometer. The instrument spectral range for this study is centered about a reference ozone line at 1133.4335 cm -1 with a full-width at half-maximum of ∼0.1 cm-1 for the instrument transmittance function. Measurement simulation and data retrieval are applied in the present investigation to evaluate and elaborate on measurement and processing conditions required to satisfy the desired wind accuracy. The related principles, processes, and tools are summarized. Radiative transfer and instrumental measurement simulations are conducted to produce raw image measurements. These raw images are processed up to and including inversions performed using the maximum a posteriori solution equation with differential regularization. In addition to retrieving the Doppler wind and ozone number density profiles, allowance is made to investigate the additional recovery of parameters such a pressure scaling factor and profiles of temperature and nitrous oxide.

Selected lakes were representative of a wide range of chemical characteristics and of sensitivity to acidification. The most sensitive lakes have already shown in the latest years signs of recovery in terms of pH and ANC. The model well captured the main trends in lake chemical data. According to the model forecast recovery at sensitive lakes will continue in the next decades under the hypothesis of a further decrease of acidic input from the atmosphere. Results clearly demonstrated the benefits of achieving the emission reductions in both S and N compounds agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol. Nevertheless, besides the achieved reduction of SO2-4 deposition from the peak levels of the 80s, also N deposition should be reduced in the near future to protect alpine lakes from further acidification. The condition of lake catchments with regard to N saturation will probably be the dominant factor driving recovery extent. Beside atmospheric deposition, other factors proved to be important in determining long-term changes in surface water chemistry. Climate warming in particular affects weathering processes in lake catchments and dynamics of the N cycle. Including other factors specific to the alpine area, such as dust deposition and climate change, may improve the fit of experimental data by the model and the reliability of model forecast.","Atmospheric deposition; Modelling; Nitrogen; Trend; Water chemistry","acidification; hydrochemistry; lake; modeling; mountain region; nitrogen; Alps; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543136880

For this purpose a thermogravimetric balance has been equipped with a specific acoustic emission device in order to continuously measure the mass variation of the corrosion sample and the acoustic emission transient under experimental conditions of temperature and gas phase compositions that are representative of the industrial environments. The catalytic coke deposition condition that is a major problem for the refinery and petrochemical industries, has been studied with such a device. The carbon deposition on reactor walls can induce localised disruption in the process such as heat-transfer reduction and pressure drops. To prevent these perturbations, proper selections of the metallurgical or internal coating compositions of the equipment, or the injection of accurate amount of inhibitors have to be decided. The feasibility of the coupling at high temperature of thermogravimetric and acoustic emission has been demonstrated. This new technique has been applied to study the inhibition of the catalytic coke deposition on pure iron by sulphur additives in the temperature range of 650°C and under different mixed atmospheres of hydrocarbon and hydrogen contents. Good correlation has been obtained between the coking rates measured by thermogravimetric measurements and the intensities of the acoustic emission parameters.","Acoustic emission; Coke deposition; Thermogravimetry","Acoustic emission measurement; Carbon deposition; Catalytic coke; Coating compositions; Coke deposition; Emission parameters; Experimental conditions; Gas phase composition; Good correlations; High temperature; Hydrogen contents; In-situ; Industrial environments; Mass variations; Metallic material; Petrochemical industry; Physical analysis; Pure iron; Reactor walls; Temperature range; Thermogravimetric; Thermogravimetric measurement; Acoustic emissions; Corrosion; Hydrocarbons; Protective coatings; Sulfur; Thermogravimetric analysis; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867255571

Possible methodologies for baseline setting may be classified into multi-project and project-specific approaches. While multi-project approaches provide baselines for a series of typical projects within a certain geographic region, a sector, or a load range, project-specific (or project-by-project/ single-project) approaches only cover one specific project. Project-by-project baseline approaches have been tested extensively within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) pilot phase; multi-project methodologies, on the other hand, have only rarely been applied due to the (perceived) political and economic complexity of the issue, which makes the process of introducing standardised baselines a very sensitive task. In particular, there is a lack of multi-project baseline approaches taking advantage of optimising computer models within the electricity sector, even though other fields of research have made use of such models quite successfully in the past. Experiences made in the Procedures PROBASE project with the calculation of standardised, aggregated multi-project baselines for Joint Implementation (JI)/Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects using optimising energy system models are illustrated in this paper for South Africa, Russia, and Indonesia.

Forests constitute pools of terrestrial carbon and are generally considered as global sinks of atmospheric CO2. contributing to attenuating the greenhouse effect. Large amounts of carbon are also stored in boreal lakes, bogs and wetlands, partially released as CH4 and other trace gases to the atmosphere during the spring and summer months. Human activities in the forest zone are however reducing the size of the carbon pool and climate change is triggering shorter winters and earlier thaw onset, changing the natural equilibrium. Given its global importance, there is a need to map and monitor the boreal zone, and as the changes occur on all from local, regional to global scales, fine resolution information over vast areas is required. The Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) project is an international collaborative undertaking initiated by NASDA in 1996, as a follow-on to the tropical-focused Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) project [1]. Utilising the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), one of the main objectives of the GBFM project is the generation of extensive, pan-boreal, SAR image mosaics, to provide snap-shots of the forest-, wetland and open water status in the mid-1990's. Mosaics over Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Europe have been generated, available on the Internet and on DVD free of charge for research and educational purposes. The GBFM project also entails research activities in North America, Siberia and northern Europe, aimed at advancing scientific applications of L-band SAR data in the boreal zone.",,"Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse effect; Internet; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite observatories; Boreal ecosystems; Forest zones; Global boreal forest mapping (GBFM) project; Japanese Earth Resources Satellites (JERS); Synthetic aperture radar; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Forests; Greenhouse Effect; Mapping; Radar; Remote Sensing; Satellites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20144386949

Difficulties arise when corporate standards intended for global use do not account for the many influencing factors (such as differences in local governing regulations, geographical locations, climatic conditions and contractual obligations) which will affect the validity and ultimate acceptance of a corporate sanctioned standard. To complicate matters further, in many cases the multinational personnel responsible for complying with the standards may or may not have the language skills required to read or comprehend a given standard unless it is translated into their indigenous language(s). Provided all these challenges can be overcome, the timely and effective distribution of documents to all corners of the globe presents another major challenge in addition to large costs incurred. Due to the dynamic nature of the industry and the desire to continuously improve, standards require periodic revisions, so a means to track and effectively distribute updates around the world is needed. This process requires personnel resources and discipline, and if not done properly, it can lead to a state of confusion among the intended users. The following paper describes a novel approach for globalizing corporate sanctioned standards in a multinational service company, including standards for: field operations, quality, health and safety, environmental, maintenance, engineering, laboratory, and training. This novel approach, which employs a customized database application, is presented. Most unique to the application is its user interface which allows users to view the standards specifically applicable to their particular business unit, geographic region, and country, and in their native language. The approval process required to ensure all standards are reviewed and authorized at the appropriate level of the organization is addressed. In addition the methodology used for translating documents written in English into four additional languages will be covered.

In Europe it is meanwhile an accepted technology in advanced wastewater treatment, whenever space is scarce and a virtually suspended solids-free effluent is demanded. Although more than 500 plants are in operation world-wide there is still a lack of published operational experiences to help planners and operators to identify potentials for optimisation, e.g. energy consumption or the vulnerability against peak-loads. Examples from pilot trials are given how the nitrification and denitrification can be optimised. Nitrification can be quickly increased by adjusting DO content of the water. Furthermore carrier materials like zeolites can store surplus ammonia during peak loads and release afterwards. Pre-denitrification in biofilters is normally limited by the amount of easily degradable organic substrate, resulting in relatively high requirements for external carbon. The combination of pre-DN, N and post-DN filters is much more advisable for most municipal wastewaters, because the recycle rate can be reduced and external carbon can be saved. Exemplarily it is shown for a full scale preanoxic-DN/N/postanoxic-DN plant of 130,000 p.e. how 15% energy could be saved by optimising internal recycling and some control strategies. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Biofiltration; Denitrification; Energy consumption; Municipal wastewater treatment; Nitrification; Plant optimisation","Denitrification; Effluents; Energy utilization; Organic compounds; Recycling; Wastewater treatment; Biological aerated filters (BAF); Solids-free effluents; Biological filter beds; ammonia; carbon; nitrogen; organic compound; zeolite; biological treatment; Design; energy; filter; Nitrogen; Optimization; Wastewater treatment; aeration; article; biofilter; biofiltration; bioreactor; control strategy; controlled study; denitrification; effluent; energy consumption; Europe; municipal solid waste; nitrification; pilot study; process optimization; suspended particulate matter; waste water management; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244232912

This has also led to much conjecture as to the exact mechanism by which bacteria are able to enhance sulfide oxidation and as to which species of bacterial microflora are the most dominant. Recent advances in 16S rNA sequencing has confirmed that many of the bacterial species once thought to dominate commercial oxidation circuits were simply more willing to grow under the culturing conditions used and may only play a minor role in the oxidation process (Rawlings, 2002). Consequently this research will look at bacterial oxidation under conditions more reflective of commercial operations, focusing on the presence of organic carbonaceous material within a refractory sulfide ore body to be sourced from the Fosterville deposit of Perseverance Corporation Limited. To achieve this it will be necessary to determine what affect the presence of carbonaceous ore material has on the bacterial oxidation process, specifically the BIOX process, focusing mainly on the effect on the cellular growth and the interaction between bacteria and mineral surfaces. The presence of humic material has already been confirmed to cause a decrease in the sorption of bacteria to iron hydroxide coated quartz particles, presumed to be the result of direct competition for active sites (Richardson et al, 2000). These results however were obtained using sand particles pre-coated with iron and organic material and so it remains to be seen whether the presence of dissolved organic material is capable of out-competing bacteria for active sites on the surface of sulfide minerals. The presence of humic acid has not been detected within the Fosterville deposit (Pyke et al. 1999), with the organic material comprising predominantly of near amorphous bitumen and pre-graphite flakes (McKnight, 2004), see Figure 1. The rapid, and irreversible attachment of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacteria to the surfaces of coal however has led to the suggestion that there exists a certain degree of compatibility between the two (Bagdigian and Myerson, 1986), and as such the possibility of a direct interaction between organic ore material and sulfide oxidising bacteria will need to be examined. The presence of organic material within the ore stream may also impact on the diversity of the microflora present in the bacterial oxidation process, providing an organic carbon source which may support the growth of heterotrophic bacteria. A number of bacteria have been identified which are capable of promoting the oxidation of sulfides utilising organic carbon sources at rates approaching that of the chemolithotrophic commonly used in commercial processes (Bacelar-Nicolau and Johnson, 1999). Consequently the presence of such bacterium would be unlikely to produce a negative effect on the overall rate of sulfide oxidation, indeed the constant removal of potentially toxic organic material and possibly even of dead bacteria may prove to be beneficial, see Figure 2. Bacteria have also been identified which, under anaerobic conditions, are capable of utilising organic carbon sources to reduce ferric iron (Johnson and McGinness, 1991) effectively reversing the process of sulfide oxidation. Although commercial sulfide are aerated to maintain high dissolved oxygen contents, there is always the potential for localised areas low in oxygen which may support the growth of such bacteria. Futhermore the bacteria commonly used as the model for sulfide oxidation. Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans (or Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) has also been identified as being capable of utilising organic carbon sources such as glucose and other sugars as a sole energy source (Tabita and Lundgren, 1971). Cells adapted to growth solely on an organic medium however subsequently lost their ability to oxidise ferrous ions, suggesting that the presence of such material may inhibit the regeneration of ferric ions considered necessary for the oxidation of sulfides. Also of concern is the toxicity of low molecular weight organic acids to bacteria used in processing refractory ores, due to the ability of such compounds to diffuse into the cells at low pH values (Pronk et at, 1991). This causes acidification of the internal part of the cell, destroying the pH gradient essential for bacterial growth in acidic environments (Frattini et al, 2000) leading to the destruction of the cell membrane (Tuttle el al, 1977). Although the presence of organic ore material may only introduce a small amount of these toxic organic acids, it will be important to determine the level at which toxic effects are noticeable, and to investigate whether bacteria are capable of developing a resistance. It may also be possible to eliminate this problem through the addition of other bacterium, capable of utilising organic acids (Wichlacz and Unz, 1981) or aromatic hydrocarbons (Stapleton et at, 1998) as their sole carbon source under acidic conditions. Given that commercial bacterial oxidation is not operated under ideal sterile conditions it is more than likely that the bacteria present will over time, differ greatly from that introduced in the initial inoculum. It will therefore be of interest to look at the most likely source of bacterial contamination, the ore feed and water circuits, to try and identify bacteria present which may be capable of growth under the conditions encountered during sulfide oxidation. In doing so it may be possible to identify bacteria already associated with the natural oxidation of the ore body which may be better adapted for growth on the ore minerals present, and which may also be capable of oxidising the organic component of the ore. The problem of 'preg-robbing', caused by the presence of specific organic material in subsequent cyanidation stages for the recovery of gold, will also need to be examined to determine whether the physical or chemical properties of the organic material is altered in any way by the bacterial oxidation process. It has already been determined that the organic material within the Fosterville ore body is quite an active preg-robber (Pyke et al, 1999), so it will be of particular interest to determine whether the action of bacteria in oxidising or attaching to the organic material renders it incapable of adsorbing aurocyanide complexes, thereby reducing the severity of the preg-robbing effect. It will also be important to determine whether the organic material generated by bacterial growth during biological oxidation is itself capable of preg-robbing and if this can be reduced without impacting on oxidation efficiency. The aim of this project therefore is to look at how the carbonaceous component of a refractory gold bearing sulfide ore affects, or is affected by, the bacterial oxidation and subsequent cyanidation processes. In doing so it is hoped that a process may be developed which will eliminate, or significantly reduce, any negative effects caused by the presence of organic material. Ideally any such development should be able to be integrated into the existing BIOX process, unless any potential gains will offset the added cost and complication of integrating an additional stage prior to, or after, the existing BIOX circuit. The success of such a project has implications in improving the efficiency of sites already treating carbonaceous ores and in allowing the effective treatment of ore deposits not economically viable using currently available processes.",,"Acidic conditions; Acidic environments; Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans; Active sites; Anaerobic conditions; Aurocyanide complexes; Bacterial contaminations; Bacterial growths; Bacterial oxidations; Bacterial species; Bacterial strains; Bearing ores; Biological oxidations; Carbonaceous components; Carbonaceous materials; Cellular growths; Commercial operations; Commercial processes; Cyanidation; Degree of compatibilities; Direct interactions; Dissolved organic materials; Dissolved oxygen contents; Energy sources; Ferric ions; Ferric irons; Ferrous ions; Graphite flakes; Heterotrophic bacteria; Humic Acids; Humic materials; In processing; Iron hydroxides; Low molecular weight organic acids; Microflora; Mineral surfaces; Natural oxidations; Operating plants; Ore bodies; Ore materials; Ore minerals; Organic components; Organic materials; Organic mediums; Overall rates; Oxidation efficiencies; Oxidation processes; Ph values; Quartz particles; Refractory golds; Refractory ores; Refractory sulfides; Sand particles; Sole carbon sources; Sterile conditions; Sulfide ores; Sulfide oxidations; Thiobacillus ferrooxidans; Toxic effects; Water circuits; Aluminum; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bacteriology; Biological materials; Cell growth; Cell membranes; Chemical properties; Cytology; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Fire hazards; Flow interactions; Glucose; Gold; Gold deposits; Gold ore treatment; Graphite; Growth (materials); Hydrocarbons; Iron; Metal recovery; Mineralogy; Minerals; Networks (circuits); Nucleic acids; Ore deposit geology; Ore deposits; Ore treatment; Ores; Organic acids; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Organic minerals; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Oxide minerals; Oxygen; pH; pH effects; Quartz; Refractory materials; RNA; Silica; Silicate minerals; Sorption; Sugar (sucrose); Sugars; Sulfide minerals; Theorem proving; Toxic materials; Surfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049151062

Natural gas is gaining interest due to the worldwide ratio of assured reserves of natural gas and crude oil shifting towards natural gas. The main motivation for the use of gas are oil substitution, source diversification and independency of fuel supply as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases especially CO2. Natural gas operation usually reduces the torque of a naturally aspirated engine due to fuel properties. The paper shows that an optimization of a naturally aspirated engine layout can reduce the loss significantly. Besides compression ratio optimization also intake manifold and camshaft redesign for natural gas specific application can reduce the torque loss to a minimum. Super charging or turbo charging of spark ignition engines can effectively overcome the torque loss. The development of a vehicle with 1.8L turbo charged engine described in the paper shows the high potential in power and torque with an increase of more than 25% in break mean effective pressure (BMEP). The excellent combustion quality with reduced engine out toxic emissions and low smog formation potential as well as low particulate level currently allows relatively low emissions even without aftertreatment devices and leads to large conversion programs in areas with high local pollution. The current article describes how ultra low emission standards can be reached in combination with modern engine control technology strategies and advanced catalyst layout.

As such, the EPA trend analysis approach applied over the 1990s indicated three often trends covering five Class I areas were worsening visibility trends. By including a statistical significance test (Appendix C of 40 CFR 60), only one of three worsening visibility trends identified by the EPA default method was significant. A scientific approach developed to estimate statistical uncertainty in progress goal visibility determinations used the mean uncertainty of some components. These uncertainty estimates do not necessarily reflect the maximum uncertainty that exists. As a result, statistical uncertainty at some sites will be even greater than calculated. Even so, the improvement in visibility needed from the baseline period (2000-2004) to achieve the progress goal (2014-2018) falls within the range of statistical uncertainty in visibility determinations. Such large uncertainties may render progress goal projections problematic and unreliable.","Air quality; Haze; Progress Goal; Regional Haze Rule (rhr); Trend Analysis; Uncertainty","Air quality; Data reduction; Particulate emissions; Statistical methods; Visibility; Haze; Progress rule; Regional haze rule (RHR); Trend analysis; Uncertainty; Laws and legislation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944438114

Using published ecosystem models and equations, we developed a simulation model to evaluate the effects of dynamics of aboveground net primary production (ANPP), carbon allocation, residual slash, decomposition, and disturbances (harvesting, tree mortality, and fire frequency) on available fuel (AF; megagrams per hectare). Both the magnitude and the time of maximum ANPP as well as the duration of high productivity condition had a large influence on AF. Productivity and decomposition were two dominant driving factors determining AF. The amount of AF in arid or cold regions would be affected more by climate change than that in other ecosystems. Frequent fire was an effective tool to control the AF, and medium frequency fire produced the most AF. Disturbances increased AF very rapidly in a short period. The results can be used as a basic knowledge to develop a fire management plan under various climate conditions. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Available fuel; Decomposition; Ecosystem productivity; Fire frequency; Fire intensity; Harvesting; Tree mortality","Climate change; Computer simulation; Decomposition; Ecosystems; Fuels; Mathematical models; Productivity; Available fuels; Ecosystem productivity; Fire frequency; Fire intensity; Fuel dynamics; Tree mortality; Forestry; fuel; decomposition; fire; forest ecosystem; fuel; harvesting; article; carbon allocation; chemical composition; climate; climate change; decomposition; fire; forest; forest dynamics; North America; publishing; Decay; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fuels; Mathematical Models; Productivity; Simulation; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5044239657

Urban background had CSIR within a fairly narrow range. However, the CSIR of two of three MGP wastes were substantially different from those of the urban background samples. CSIR could provide data that separates PAH impacts from different sources even when concentrations are low or when the material has been severely weathered. This is useful when trying to determine whether PAH detected in background locations originated at a particular known PAH source.

The objective of this study was to provide information about the environmental conditions for the formation of calcic horizon in Shahrekord area, in the central west of Iran. The soil moisture and temperature regimes in the study area are xeric and mesic, respectively. The δ13C and δ18O values of pedogenic carbonates and bulk soils were measured in 17 calcic horizons of selected soils derived from calcareous alluvium. In addition, the δ13C and δ18O values of three parent rock samples and the δ13C value of soil organic matter in selected pedons and eight native plants in the region were determined. Results suggest that pedogenic carbonates range from 52 to 96% of total carbonates. Stable isotopic composition of carbonatic pendants shows that the older layers are more depleted in 13C in comparison with younger precipitates. This is likely due to the fact that the older parts precipitated under somewhat different ecological conditions than those of younger parts. Isotopic composition of organic carbon shows that current vegetation consists of C 3 plants; whereas, the pedogenic carbonate in the soils was formed in conditions with a lower proportion of C3 plant species. This can be attributed to human induced land degradation and inappropriate land management in the area, which caused rapid changes in the community of plant species. The results show that the stable isotope composition of carbon can be a good indicator for assessing the degree of land degradation.","C3 plants; Iranian soils; Pedogenic carbonates; Stable isotopes","carbon 13; carbonic acid derivative; indicator; organic carbon; oxygen 18; pedogenic carbonate; soil organic matter; stable isotope; unclassified drug; carbon isotope; carbonate; land degradation; pedogenesis; soil horizon; article; calcareous alluvium; chemical composition; environmental change; geochemistry; Iran; land use; nonhuman; paedogenesis; plant; rock; soil chemistry; soil degradation; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; stable isotope composition; vegetation; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East; Irania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042521424

Analyses of 8-hr O3 concentration trends is also conducted since the new 8-hr O3 standard will soon be implemented across the country. El Paso, TX, is the success story in this area of the US, lowering both 1-hr and 8-hr O3 concentrations to below the health and welfare based O3 standards. El Paso's O3 concentrations have continued to decline in the early 2000's despite hotter temperatures. The 1-hr and 8-hr O3 concentrations in Baton Rouge are lowered long-term to just above the standards, but some more NOx and VOC emissions reductions may be required to achieve attainment in the future. Houston made some progress for both standards with decreases in ambient VOC concentrations and with recent favorable meteorological conditions. Future ambient NOx concentrations in Houston should decrease as stationary source controls become fully implemented. The Dallas-Fort Worth area, dominated by mobile sources and a large population continuing to grow and spread outward, probably has the greatest challenge ahead. One-hour O3 concentrations are decreasing slowly and no large measurable progress has been made on reducing 8-hr O3 concentrations, despite the fact that ambient VOC and NOx concentrations continue to decline in the central core area, and that the percentage of summer daytime hours with high temperature and stagnation is lower during the period 1996-2003 compared to the period 1991-1995.

Once injected, free CO 2 can be retained in deep aquifers for long time periods by slow-moving, downward-directed formation waters. Over time, the injected CO 2 will dissolve in the formation waters and, through reactions with formation minerals, may be converted to carbonate minerals, resulting in permanent sequestration.

The system is a real time, ambient air monitoring system. The system was developed to protect the surrounding community during excavation and removal of impacted soil from a given site. The system consists of eight units, each housing a gas Chromatograph, particulate analyzer and an acquisition system to archive data. All collected data is transmitted to a central computer via radio links where data is stored and downloaded in to a filing system. The primary advantage, which the AirLogics system has over the traditional method of collecting manual samples, is the immediate availability of the data use by site managers in controlling off-site migration of emissions. We feel that proactively managing potential dust emissions using real-time data as opposed to passively measuring and documenting them better serves the owners liability, risk management, and public relations needs. Real-time data gives the site managers the tools to respond quickly to community concerns or regulatory inquiries. Managing the emissions via collection and recording of real-time data creates a record of how ""upset"" conditions were mitigated in a timely manner.

Subsequently, the TWT and 1-93 northbound opened to general traffic on January 2003. The CA/T primary ventilation system employed to maintain acceptable carbon monoxide (CO) levels inside the tunnels, and to control the dissipation of smoke in case of fire, is a full-transverse system divided into 22 ventilation zones. The State of Massachusetts air pollution control regulations require an implementation of a compliance emission monitoring program that measures in part, tunnel hourly CO levels at the exhaust of each ventilation zone. As part of a pilot program, hourly CO concentration data were measured between 1996 and 1998 at the two ventilation buildings serving the TWT. Since February 2003, CO levels have been monitored at the TWT and other ventilation buildings on a continuous basis. The results of this recent data indicate that the in-tunnel CO emissions have significantly decreased when compared to the 1996-98 monitoring studies. This paper provides a summary of the project-wide CO monitoring program, the resulting CO concentration levels recently measured inside the tunnels, and a comparison of the recently measured in-tunnel CO concentration with the measurements collected during the mid-nineties.

In order to ameliorate air pollution, several control measures have been imposed in the last decade, such as: up-grade of gasoline's quality, stringent environmental standards, and catalytic converters. On the other hand and from the beginning of 2001, Tier I emission standards became mandatory for all new model year sold in the country. Car manufacturers in Mexico do not guarantee the performance of their exhaust emissions systems for a given mileage.

One program, an energy efficiency/renewable energy set-aside program, is described in this paper. A crucial element of an allowance trading program is the documentation and verification, or evaluation, of actual emission reductions. Thus, this paper also reviews the evaluation process that has been developed for an energy-efficiency and renewable-energy set-aside program and puts the process in context with methods outlined in the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP).","Allowances; Documentation and verification; Emissions; Savings","Allowances; Documentation and verification; Emissions; Renewable energy; Savings; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Earth atmosphere; Electricity; Nitrogen; Project management; Risk management; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644256103

The performance of a simple aerobic pond was compared to that of an advanced multistage treatment unit, the latter comprising a membrane biological reactor and a two-stage activated carbon filter. For 274 days of the year (75%) the pond was able to provide sufficient treatment even under cold weather conditions. For temperatures lower than 5°C, a higher biomass content and temporal storage of the raw leachate (e.g. increasing hydraulic retention time) could close the gap of insufficient treatment. In contrast, the advanced treatment system could only accomplish limited treatment capabilities due to insufficient maintenance, low loading conditions and deficient coordination between the individual treatment steps. As a result, degradation rates were low and operational problems frequent. Limits for Ntot were exceeded regularly (Ntot,e = 60-70 mg/L), throughput broke down and excessive nitrite production occurred (NO2-Ne = 10 mg/L) as a result of microbial activity inside the activated carbon filters. This case study clearly suggests aerobic ponds as an appropriate solution for the treatment of landfill leachate in areas where operational independence is essential.","Activated carbon; Aerobic pond; Decentralized treatment; Landfill leachate; Membrane biological reactor","Biomass; Bioreactors; Degradation; Land fill; Landfill leachate; Leachate treatment; activated carbon; ammonium nitrate; nitrate; nitrite; active filter; aerobic pond; biofilm; biomass; bioreactor; case study; chemical oxygen demand; cold climate; conference paper; controlled study; denitrification; Germany; hydraulic conductivity; intermethod comparison; landfill; landfill leachate; membrane reactor; microbial activity; nitrification; nonhuman; process control; process monitoring; temperature sense; waste management; weather",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346639187

Mullite could adsorb twice as much PM as alumina did with the same volume. Surface area of mullite and alumina were both under 1 sq m/g. Mullite was more effective adsorbent than alumina. During same adsorption time, the pressure drop of mullite increased rapidly than alumina in proportion to the amount of PM. Regenerated adsorbent at 400°C was the same state of the initial one in the weight and surface color. From the TGA data, PM was combusted at around 500°C, so regenerated temperature seemed reasonable because adsorbents would be more heated by heat transfer while combusting. However, mullite applied to the second engine, which uses marine diesel oil as fuel was not completely regenerated in this condition. Zn component appeared on the surface of alumina used for the first engine after regeneration test while sulfur appeared only on the surface of PM adsorbed mullite in the second engine. Mullite was more effective, but the pressure drop was too high for the practical application. Such a high pressure drop could be lowered by the use of sphere-shape adsorbent.

For many outdoor air pollutants, individuals are closer to their sources (especially traffic) and there are important indoor sources influencing the relationship between ambient and personal exposures. This paper examines the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at central site monitoring stations and personal exposures in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Over a 1-year period, personal exposures to 34 VOCs were measured for 90 volunteers from 30 families living close to one of five central monitoring stations. Simultaneous 24-h indoor, outdoor and central site measurements were also taken. Dual packed thermal desorption tubes and C18 DNPH-coated cartridges were used for sampling VOCs and these were analyzed by GC/MS and HPLC, respectively. A factor analysis of the personal exposure data aided in grouping compounds by the most likely source type: vehicular (BTEX, styrene and 1,3-butadiene), secondary formed or photochemical (most aldehydes), building materials and consumer products (formaldehyde and benzaldehyde), cleaning solvents (tetrachloroethene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane), volatilization from water (chloroform and trichloroethene) and deodorizers (1,4-dichlorobenzene). Mean ambient, indoor and personal concentrations were 7/7/14 μg/m 3 for benzene, 1/3/3 for 1,3-butadiene, 6/20/20 for formaldehyde and 3/9/50 for 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Geometric mean (GM) ambient concentrations of trichloroethene and carbon tetrachloride were similar to GM personal exposures. While outdoor and indoor home GM concentrations for most vehicular related compounds (benzene, MTBE, xylenes and styrene) were comparable, the GM personal exposures were twice as high. Indoor concentrations of 1,3-butadiene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, chloroform, formaldehyde, valeraldehyde, propionaldehyde and n-butyraldehyde were comparable to personal exposures. For certain compounds, such as chloroform, aldehydes, toluene, 1,3-butadiene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, GM personal exposures were more than two times greater than GM ambient measurements.","1,3-Butadiene; Aldehydes; Factor analysis; Indoor concentrations; Personal exposure; VOC","1,1,1 trichloroethane; 1,3 butadiene; 1,4 dichlorobenzene; aldehyde derivative; benzaldehyde; benzene; chloroform; formaldehyde; pentanal; propionaldehyde; styrene; tetrachloroethylene; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; xylene; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution control; ambient air; child; concentration (parameters); conference paper; controlled study; factorial analysis; female; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; household; human; indoor air pollution; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; Mexico; thermal analysis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Aldehydes; Child; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Organic Chemicals; Urban Population; Volatilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542419936

In recent years, a number of innovative solutions that lead to a reduction in fuel consumption rate have been developed, including in-cylinder direct injection and lean burn combustion technologies, as well as an engine utilizing a large volume of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Furthermore, a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine is under development for actual application. However, one of the issues common to these technologies is less stable combustion, which causes difficulty in engine management. Additionally, it is now mandatory to provide an onboard diagnosis (OBD) system. This requires manufacturers to develop a technology that allows onboard monitoring and control of the combustion state. This paper reports on an innovative combustion diagnostic method using an in-cylinder pressure sensor. As a key to the monitoring and controlling system, a new in-cylinder pressure sensor was developed that is integrated with the spark plug. This type of sensing device features advantages in durability and reliability, which are two fundamental requirements for incorporation with the OBD. As a piezoelectric element, a single-crystal lithium niobate (LiNbO3), which features superb pyroelectric properties, was utilized in addition to the conventional poly-crystal materials of lead titanate (PT; PbTiO3) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT; Pb(Zr,Ti)O3). The calculating processor is high-speed and highly reliable. As a combined result, the device diagnoses various combustion phenomena, including misfiring and abnormal combustion, occurring in each cylinder on a real-time basis, and thus allows optimum control of the combustion process. The control technique covers a variety of items, including; (1) knock control, (2) misfire detection, (3) torque-on-demand control, (4) minimum spark advance for the best torque (MBT) control, (5) lean burn/EGR control, (6) NOX restriction, (7) noise/vibration restriction, (8) valve timing detection, (9) cylinder detection and combustion-at-start judgment and, (10) Reid vapor pressure (RVP) detection and calibration.

The use of new heat resistant materials may be of benefit in solving these issues. In addition, highly sophisticated temperature monitoring techniques capable of accurately measuring high temperature regions can reduce the cooling air consumption to the minimum levels. In this study, components were developed to evaluate for the possible application of new heat resistant materials - ceramics matrix composites, single crystal super-alloy, and powder metallurgy super-alloy - to hot parts of an engine. In addition, a smart sensor was developed, which can accurately measure the surface temperature distributions for all the turbine rotor blades. Finally, these components were assembled in a high-temperature demonstrator engine.

Different flow states and transitions among them occur at the same conditions in combustors, vortex tubes, and tornadoes. The jet axis can undergo precession and bending in combustors; this precession enhances large-scale mixing and reduces emissions of [Formula presented] To explore the mechanisms of these phenomena, we address conically similar swirling jets normal to a wall. In addition to the Serrin model of tornadolike flows, a new model is developed where the flow is singularity free on the axis. New analytical and numerical solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations explain occurrence of multiple states and show that hysteresis is a common feature of wall-normal vortices or swirling jets no matter where sources of motion are located. Then we study the jet stability with the aid of a new approach accounting for deceleration and nonparallelism of the base flow. An appropriate transformation of variables reduces the stability problem for this strongly nonparallel flow to a set of ordinary differential equations. A particular flow whose stability is studied in detail is a half-line vortex normal to a rigid plane—a model of a tornado and of a swirling jet issuing from a nozzle in a combustor. Helical counter-rotating disturbances appear to be first growing as Reynolds number increases. Disturbance frequency changes its sign along the neutral curve while the wave number remains positive. Short disturbance waves propagate downstream and long waves propagate upstream. This helical instability causes bending of the vortex axis and its precession—the effects observed in technological flows and in tornadoes. © 2004 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036289669

These future turbine power plants may operate on coal derived synthesis gas (CO and hydrogen) or hydrogen derived from shifting the synthesis gas. Achieving these goals is expected to require improved combustor concepts, which might be different than current swirl-stabilized combustor designs. The status of a test combustor that is providing emissions data, and visual flame data at turbine engine conditions were presented. Initial data from the combustor suggested that heat loss from the flame zone must be considered in numeric predictions of NOx. The heat losses might be exploited to reduce NOx emissions without jeopardizing flame stability. Because all the boundary conditions are known, or measured, these data are expected to be useful m the numerical simulation community, and practical combustor designers. An overview of the various boundary conditions, as well as, preliminary data from testing were provided. Planned work using hydrogen/methane mixtures to study the effect of fuel variability was described.

Methods to reduce these dust emissions include the retrofitting of shrouds, enclosures, local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems and water suppression systems. The operation of these ancillary systems should be optimised to offer maximum performance. It is desirable that the future planning of such facilities include sufficient dust suppression and/or removal systems to ensure that material delivery rates are maintained and the welfare of the workforce is protected. This paper presents the results of an investigation of the tipping process through the application of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods and validation using data obtained from scale experiment. A 3-D computational model has been constructed using the Fluent™ 〈www.fluent.co.uk〉 modelling software to represent the ventilation regimen within an underground crushing installation. The falling ore has been represented as a granular fluid continuum falling under gravity from the bed of the dump truck. Transient streamlines are used to represent the dispersion of dust due to the updraft airflow generated by the tipping process. A parametric analysis has been performed on a model of the tipping process to investigate the influence on dust dispersion of; the orientation of the dump truck, the surrounding ventilation characteristics and the material tipping rate and volume. The CFD models predict a strong shear-induced flow in the region of the crusher during tipping and a high sensitivity to the surrounding ventilation regimen. These results indicate the need for further experimental studies to characterise the entrainment and transport of dust-laden air into the induced shear flow. An experimental rig has been designed and evaluated for the purposes of conducting validation studies and gaining further insight into this phenomenon. Results of these investigations are presented. © 2004 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.","Computational fluid dynamic method; Underground crushing plant; Ventilation","Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Crushers; Dust control; Gyrators; Mathematical models; Underground structures; Ventilation; Compressive crushing plants; Granular fluid continuum; Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems; Underground crushing plants; Crushing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19644370802

In order to monitor phenology in a landscape characterized by heterogeneous features rapidly changing over the territory, we performed multitemporal classifications of NDVI-AVHRR data and interfaced them with Landsat-TM data and orography. The sample area is the Vulture basin (Southern Italy), where cultivated and densely vegetated areas coexist with urban and recently built industrial areas. These land cover patterns rapidly change over the territory at very small spatial scales; it is a complex zone very interesting for studying the use of remote sensing techniques in the integrated monitoring context. Clusters having homogeneous NDVI time behaviors were identified. In spite of its spatial resolution, AVHRR NDVI effectively picks up the characteristic phenology for different covers and altitudes. Moreover, some pixels having particular microclimate were clustered and their characterization was only possible by using orography and TM classification information. The comparison of two intra-annual classifications (1996 and 1998) showed that the proposed approach can be very useful for studying change in pattern of vegetation dynamics.","AVHRR; Multitemporal classification; NDVI; Phenology; TM","Calibration; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Greenhouse effect; Heat flux; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellite observatories; AVHRR; Multitemporal classification; NDVI; Phenology; Vegetation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942452320

The results of testing the anhydrous ammonia NOx reduction system conducted at the CATTS heavy duty diesel facility showed that the dilute NH3 integrated mass emission rates for the New York Bus cycle, Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and CLE567 tests were on average below a conservative detection limit of 300 ppb vol when using the tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer. The sequence of raw diesel exhaust testing were consistent with those observed in dilute testing. NH3 emission rates were higher during transient operation and during steady state throttle dithering to maintain a specific speed. In each case, average NH3 emission rates were below the detection limit of 300 ppb vol. In both the raw and dilute sampling conditions, measurement repeatability and correlation at low levels on a second by second basis were substantially greater than a comparable FTIR under similar conditions. The system demonstrated little or no response deviation or loss of signal due to the presence of diesel exhaust particulate matter in concentrations consistent with normal operation. The system was highly robust, versatile, and with fiber optic coupling capable of operation in severe service environments.

Under Method 21, an operator is required to visit and screen each regulated component on a defined frequency to determine if the component is leaking. Given the variations in state fugitive emission regulations, and between the federal New Source Performance Standards and NESHAP requirements, leak definitions for different components and monitoring frequencies can vary substantially, even within the same refinery/chemical plant complex.

The sheath normal expansion produces a rapidly converging proton beam. Such focused proton beams provide a new and powerful means to achieve isochoric heating to high temperatures. They are potentially important for measuring the equation of state of materials at high energy density and may provide an alternative route to fast ignition3. We present the first results of proton focusing and heating experiments performed at the Petawatt power level at the Gekko XII Laser Facility at ILE Osaka Japan.

However, the roadmap does not address the spatially non-uniform heating issues caused by densely routed circuitry. The localized high heat fluxes that occur due to non-uniform heating require an even more aggressive thermal solution to ensure the circuit temperature stays below the specified value. An approach to mitigating the effect of localized ""hot spots"" is the spread some of the heat from the high heat flux areas to areas of lower heat flux on the chip and/or substrate. Heat spreading at the die level may be accomplished through high thermal conductivity coatings on the backside of the silicon and/or the use of micro heat pipes. Alternatively, solid-state-energy-conversion devices, such as those employing thermionic emission, can be bonded to the back of the silicon chip. The solid state coolers absorb heat at the localized ""hot spot"" region and transport it via electrons to a region of lower heat flux. Si/SiGe superlattice micro-coolers have demonstrated a cooling power density exceeding 500 W/cm 2 in an isolated configuration. In this study we investigate the integration and packaging of such micro-coolers with IC chips.

Under normal operating conditions SO2 emissions fill the building, posing a major health problem for all workers in the building, and reducing their ability to maintain the plant. The converter fume extraction system was analysed using plant measurements, engineering modelling of the entire system and CFD modelling of the extraction hoods. By applying fundamental engineering concepts, a user-interactive computer program was developed that enabled plant engineers and operators to gain a detailed understanding of the system. In conjunction with plant measurements, the model quantified the amount of inleakage throughout the system, identifying it as a significant contributor to the poor extraction performance. Furthermore, it enabled investigation of the effects of hood gates, converters on line, hood dampers, flue insulation, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operation, and inclusion of an acid plant. The model gave unprecedented insight into the operation of a counter-intuitive buoyancy-driven extraction system. CFD modelling of the Pierce-Smith hood was then performed, indicating the cause of the SO2 leakage during normal operations was a local positive pressure region at the top of the hood gate. Modelling of other non-standard operating conditions demonstrated that the existing hoods were fundamentally incapable of containing all emissions. A number of solutions to the problem were proposed: reducing the gap at the top of the hood gate, increasing the hood draught, strategic positioning of blowers around the converter to blow fume back into the hood, and incorporation of a secondary hooding system to capture fugitive emissions from the primary hoods. Further CFD modelling suggested that substantially increased SO2 capture could be attained with most of the above initiatives, while secondary hoods could capture all emissions. Further investigations are currently underway, with implementation of a final solution expected shortly.",,"AND operators; Engineering concepts; Entire systems; Extraction performances; Extraction systems; Fugitive emissions; Interactive computer programs; Normal operating conditions; Normal operations; On lines; Plant engineers; Plant measurements; Pressure regions; Reverberatory furnaces; Standard operating conditions; Strategic positioning; System analysis; Buildings; Chemical plants; Copper; Copper compounds; Copper smelting; Electrostatic precipitators; Electrostatic separators; Gas fuel analysis; Metallurgy; Smelting; Steel metallurgy; Sulfur dioxide; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049181648

Recent estimates of water stocks and flows through the world's hydrologic cycle and their spatiotemporal variability illustrate the nature of current and projected water disparities throughout the world. As all such problems manifest themselves at smaller scales, a major challenge in freshwater assessments is how to handle this on different geographical scales. Increasing use of water is creating water shortages in many countries that are projected to have significant population increases in the next 25 years. Humankind is projected to appropriate from 70% to 90% of all accessible freshwater by 2025. Agriculture is the dominant component of human water use, accounting for almost 70% of all water withdrawals. Hence, many of the solutions to water-related food and environmental security come from within agriculture by increasing the efficiency and productivity of water use. Many factors significantly impact the increasing water demand, including population growth, economic growth, technological development, land use and urbanization, rate of environmental degradation, government programs, climate change, and others. Demand management, not increasing supply availability, is the realistic way forward. Although, thanks to market forces, the threatened exhaustion of nonrenewable resources has not happened, renewable resources, such as freshwater, remain problematic because they are vulnerable to human overuse and pollution. Climate change adds further risks and uncertainties to the global picture requiring the adoption of adaptive management in water resources based on monitoring and reevaluation. Although climate change may be perceived as a long-term problem, it needs to be addressed now because decisions today will affect society's ability to adapt to increasing variability in tomorrow's climate. If we are to balance freshwater supply with demand, and also protect the integrity of aquatic ecosystems, a fundamental change in current wasteful patterns of production and consumption is needed. Recognition of the links between rapidly growing populations and shrinking freshwater supplies is the essential first step in making water use sustainable. © 2004 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Climate change; Economics of water; Hydrologic cycle; Water use and agriculture; World population",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549115054

The idea, which could seem quite exotic, takes its origin from the experimental observation that the occurrence of Ultra Low Frequency ULF ∼ 6-50 Hz) waves is strongly related to the occurrence of positive polarity cloud-to-ground flashes (+CG) The interest in the subject, on the other hand, comes from the fact that the occurrence of ULF waves is not only related to the occurrence of positive polarity flashes but also to the occurrence of newly discovered transient luminous phenomena as sprites, blue jets and gigantic jets. Sprites, as well as blue jets and gigantic jets, are luminous events which have been detected in discharges between thunderclouds (∼ 10 km from Earth's surface) and the lower Ionosphere (mesosphere ∼90 km) These transient luminous phenomena strongly affect the atmospheric electricity, due to transfer of large amounts of charge between different regions of the atmosphere (a gigantic jet can remove as much as 0.02% of the total atmospheric charge), and suggest that some important components of the global electric circuit have still to be identified and incorporated in the theoretical framework. Another important aspect is that, during the charge transfer process (electrical discharge), sprites, blue jets and gigantic jets modify the chemistry of a large portion of the stratosphere and mesosphere, with poorly understood influences on global climate changes. In order to survey the total rate of occurrence and the implications of such phenomena on continental and global scale one needs a signature that can be easily detected by remote measurements and independent from in situ video observations. To understand whether the ULF waves can be used as sprites signatures, we explore the relation between positive polarity lightning and ULF waves by presenting a theory which explains the origin and threshold of the observed ULF waves. As a result, we obtain that very large positive polarity flashes give rise to ULF Dust Acoustic waves in the Ionosphere. We also find that the ULF waves may be destabilized, in absence of positive polarity flashes, by mean of very large Ionosphere to thunderclouds discharges, such as gigantic blue jets, which create large dipole electric fields, comparable with the ones produced by +CG lightning. © Physica Scripta 2004.",,"Charge transfer; Ionosphere; Lightning; Thunderstorms; Atmospherical discharges; Ground lightning; Polarity; Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves; Electromagnetic wave propagation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39549111437

Fed. de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","The consolidation of thermoplastic composites produces internal residual strains due to the differences between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the component materials. In the case of AS4/PPS (carbon fibre - polyphenylene sulphide), where the melting/solidification temperature is 280°C, there exists a 255°C range wherein the various constituents will contract/expand to different degrees. A fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensor may be embedded into this laminate with the goal of characterizing the residual strains; however, these strains may be non-uniform in the longitudinal and transverse directions, and may also vary depending on the laminate architecture. Non-uniform axial strains typically broaden and split the FBG sensor's spectral response, making it difficult to measure the strain distribution. Also, load-induced birefringence caused by the consolidation process will complicate the interpretation of the spectral response. This research is directed at understanding the residual strain state in FBG sensors due to the fabrication process. It is the aim of this study to experimentally investigate the residual strains in long and short gauge length FBG sensors embedded in the 0° plies of AS4/PPS unidirectional and cross-ply laminates (200 × 50 × 3.6 mm). Long gauge length sensors are monitored throughout the fabrication process, to provide insight into the development of the residual strains.","AS4/PPS laminate; Birefringence; FBG sensor; Non-uniform strains; Residual strains; Thermoplastic","Deformation; Fiber Bragg gratings; Laminates; Sensors; Solidification; Strain measurement; Thermoplastics; Environmental loads; Residual strains; Spectral response; Thermoplastic laminates; Strain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844259599

Environment Canada's facilities at the Emissions Research and Measurement Division (ERMD) in Ottawa were used to conduct detailed emission measurements in order to compare the two engine types used by the urban transit bus operator in Montreal; Société des transports de Montréal (STM). The test engines were operated on 500 ppm sulphur diesel fuel, and biodiesel blends of 3 different origins (vegetable oil, animal fat and used cooking oil) at 2 different concentrations (5% and 20%). Tests were conducted using a 1998 and a 2000 model year, four-stroke, 250-HP, Cummins Diesel engines equipped with either a mechanical fuel injection pump or a computer-controlled electronic fuel injection system. All emissions tests were conducted with a degreened diesel oxidation catalyst in place, as is typical for the STM buses purchased from Nova Bus. Particle size distribution measurements and extensive chemical analysis were performed in addition to the regulated emissions. The biodiesel evaluation was a joint effort by the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association, the Fédération des producteurs de cultures commerciales du Québec, Rothsay/Laurenco, and STM, with the support of the Canadian Federal and Quebec Provincial governments. The use of biodiesel was evaluated in severe climatic conditions (from -31°C to +31°C) on 155 urban transit buses for one year from March 2002 to March 2003. In addition to assessing the viability of the fuel during routine operation of a bus fleet that operates in a cold climate, the project also endeavoured to evaluate the potential environmental benefits of biodiesel.

Each nonlinear model is optimised for use under a certain operating region. In order to identify the current operating region and select the appropriate local model for prediction, the rate of change of stored oxygen is monitored. A simplified chemical model, which is based on the dynamics of the fundamental chemical reactions that occur inside the catalyst, is used for this purpose. The developed catalyst model only requires knowledge of the upstream/downstream air-fuel ratio (AFR) and it could form the basis of an on-board catalyst monitoring and control system.

An open-top chamber (OTC) of 2.5 m diameter and 3 m height incorporating an air-filtering unit was developed for this study. Plants grown inside the OTC were exposed to exhaust emissions from a two-stroke Birla Yamaha genset for 10 d, while a control group was maintained outside. Gaseous pollutants and SPM present inside the OTC during the exposure period were measured with a high-volume air sampler. The steady-state LICF spectra of the control and treated plants were recorded in the 650-750-nm region. Fluorescence induction kinetics (Kautsky effect) was also recorded during the stress period from dark-adapted intact plant leaves at the chlorophyll bands of 685 and 730 nm. The vitality indexes (Rfd-685 and Rfd-730) and stress adaptation index (Ap) derived from the induction kinetics were utilised along with the chlorophyll fluorescence intensity ratio (F685/F730) for evaluation of stress-induced changes in plants. It has been observed that F685/F730 ratio increased for all plants inside the OTC whereas the Rfd-685, Rfd-730 and Ap values showed a downward trend with increasing pollution stress. As compared to colocasia and tapioca, kacholam plants showed higher resistance to exhaust emission and water stress as well as better capacity to regain its photosynthetic functioning on removal of the stress.

Ltd., Chiyoda Corp., COSMO Oil Co. Ltd., Nippon Steel Corp., and INPEX Corp. Our new GTL process is particularly effective when it is applied to natural gas feed stock containing 20-40mol% of CO2. It does not require the three expensive items; (1) an oxygen supply plant, (2) a unit for CO2 separation from natural gas, and (3) a H2 separation unit to optimize gas composition. The reduction of these facilities, which are indispensable to the conventional GTL process, would results in less CAPEX and OPEX. For our new GTL process, the most preferable CO2 content in feed natural gas is around 30mol%. Therefore, in case that the CO2 content is less than 30mol%, some amount of CO2 can be supplied from other CO2 sources, such as flare gas, associated gas, remaining CO2 of EOR and exhausted gas from oil refinery and LNG plant. This paper aims to present applications of our new GTL process to enable an economic exploitation of gas reserves in South East Asia and Australia, by taking into account the operation results of the Yufutsu GTL pilot plant of 7BPSD located at Tomakomai city in Hokkaido of Japan, and the study results of process simulation and the economics. We present an attractive combination scheme for our new GTL process with LNG plant by utilizing CO2 exhausted from LNG plant. It reduces initial project's investment compared with a stand-alone GTL plant located in South East Asia and Australia, where infrastructure of an LNG plant can be for common use with our GTL plant.

Semi-solid state behavior and semi-solid extrusion properties of plain carbon steel are investigated. Firstly, the cooling curve of the plain carbon steel is assessed by thermal analysis method, aiming to make clear the semi-solid temperature range. The microstructure obtained at the semi-solid temperature is the so-called globular one, which is similar to that exhibited by semi-solid of aluminum and magnesium alloys. Then to get better understanding of the semi-solid deformation behavior of the material, extrusion tests are carried out at different billet temperatures and cooling conditions at the die exit. In order to prevent temperature drop of the billet, a carbon case and block as a nested structure are used in the extrusion tests. Finally, the mechanical properties of the extruded products are evaluated and discussed, i.e., the semi-solid extrusion force is less than half of hot extrusion. Microstructure is discussed as well. The hardness of the as-extruded products shows the specific distribution from surface to center. The center is about two times harder than the surface.","Microstructure Control; Plain Carbon Steel; Semisolid Extrusion","Billets (metal bars); Cooling; Deformation; Extrusion; Hardness; Microstructure; Thermoanalysis; Cooling curves; Microstructure control; Plain carbon steel; Semisolid extrusion; Carbon steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944451533

Modeling was conducted with the MAGIC model for about 40 to 50 sites within each of three physiographic provinces, stratified by stream water acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) class. Simulations were based on assumed constant future atmospheric deposition at 1995 levels and on three regional strategies of emissions controls provided by the Southern Appalachian Mountains Initiative (SAMI), based on the Urban to Regional Multiscale One-Atmosphere model. The National Stream Survey statistical frame was used to estimate the number and percentage of stream reaches in the region that were projected to change their chemistry in response to the emissions control strategies. There was a small decline in the estimated length of projected acidic (ANC ≤ 0) streams in 2040 from the least to the most restrictive emissions control strategy, but there was little difference in projected stream length in the other ANC classes as a consequence of adopting one or another strategy. However, projections of continued future acidification were substantially larger under a scenario in which S and N deposition were held constant into the future at 1995 levels. Model results suggested that the percent of potentially acid-sensitive streams having chemistry that is chronically unsuitable for brook trout would increase slightly between 1995 and 2040 under all except the most restrictive emissions control strategy.","Acidification; Modeling; Nitrogen; Southern appalachian mountains; Stream water chemistry; Sulfur","Acidity; Aquaculture; Atmospherics; Nitrogen; Plants (botany); Pollution control; Sulfur; Water resources; Aquatics; Physiography; Stream flow; acidification; atmospheric deposition; nitrogen; sulfur; water chemistry; water pollution; Appalachians; North America; Salmonidae; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642414359

This was accomplished by enhancing the Constant Volume Sample System, and correcting hydrocarbon measurements from the Flame Ionization Detector hydrocarbon analyzer for the effect of oxygen quench. Based on the manufacturer's results, it appears that the variation in oxygen content of the calibration gas, span gas, zero gas, and sample gas can affect the accuracy of low level hydrocarbon measurement. Within the last couple of years, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board approved the Bag Mini Diluter method for emission sampling [2,3]. This method was developed by the American auto industry in cooperation with government agencies within the American Industry/Government Emissions Research Consortium. The method was primarily designed to measure the lowest vehicle emission levels [4]. Due to a constant low dilution ratio, exhaust samples contain a lower oxygen content than the hydrocarbon calibration gases, resulting in underreported hydrocarbons. This paper describes a method for optimizing the Flame Ionization Detector hydrocarbon analyzer and correcting for oxygen quench effect. For one test vehicle, the oxygen quench effect on Non-Methane Hydrocarbon emission measurements was -8 percent for the Bag Mini Diluter system and -2 percent for the Constant Volume Sample system.

Along with emissions from mobile sources, the management of these area emissions is particularly difficult because uncertainties regarding their emission inventories are quite large. The effort is much more tedious due to the huge number of source types and VOC species involved in the inventory. As part of a government-funded project, VOC emission factors for mostly urban area sources are being obtained in Korea. Multiple institutions and government agencies are involved in this endeavor. So far emission factors for the dry cleaning industry have been obtained and found to be larger than previous work by 42.4%.

A simpler parsimonious routing scheme based on Askew's formula (1970) for computing time-evolving channel lags is implemented and tested against observations and compared with the variable-velocity scheme of Arora and Boer (1999). The variable-lag routing scheme agrees very well with the variable-velocity scheme. The variable-lag scheme has the advantage of using fewer parameters, which is a major advantage at fine resolution over a large domain, where the uncertainty associated with parameters can be quite large. The spatial resolutions of RCMs are much finer than those of GCMs and hence there is a need for channel routing at fine spatial resolutions. The task of extending the cell-to-cell routing schemes developed for large-scale routing, as in GCMs, to finer spatial scales, as in RCMs, is addressed. The sensitivity of the variable-lag scheme to the routing time interval is studied. The choice of the routing time interval is very critical and varies with the spatial resolution as in any hydrological model. A simple method for determining the appropriate range of routing intervals at different spatial resolutions for the variable-lag scheme is presented. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"atmosphere-ocean system; climate modeling; parameterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644438594

The work is a part of the FINSKEN project, which aimed at developing consistent long-term scenarios of global change for Finland. The derivation of emission scenarios for European countries and the calculation of environmental loading scenarios based on them presented in this paper is analogous to the estimation of future ground level ozone concentrations within FINSKEN. Global energy scenarios are reflected in changing emission quantities in Europe. Deposition scenarios up to the year 2100 are developed using European and regional deposition models. The impacts of alternative energy futures on emissions and regional air pollution are compared with the plausible impacts of climate change on the transformation and transportation of air pollution, based on the work in the European AIR-CLIM project. The long-term emission scenarios are developed taking into account the recent international emission reduction agreements within the UN/ ECE and the EU. Comparisons between IPCC scenarios and European developments indicated that the fossil-intensive IPCC scenarios were pessimistic in their estimates for future sulphur and nitrogen oxides emissions for European regions. In the light of recent air pollution reduction legislation in Europe, increasing sulphur and nitrogen oxides deposition trends for Finland appear unlikely.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442442274

These effects arise because of one or more meteorology-related factors such as higher effective temperatures, sunshine, more consecutive hot days and nights, stagnation, increased humidity, increased pollutant emissions, and accelerated photochemical smog and particulate formation. Innovative urban-climate and environmental control strategies could be implemented to help reduce the local negative impacts of heat waves in the U.S. Short-term urban environmental controls, for example, include modifications to urban surface albedo, reforestation, and a reduction in anthropogenic heating. Long-term solutions could include smart growth strategies, land-use planning, land-cover control, urban design and geometry, passive solar systems, and transport-related actions. In this study, the focus is on increased urban surface albedo and, if suitable, local reforestation. This meteorological and thermal environmental modeling study, currently in its initial stages, will examine the potential of short-term control strategies in reducing the impacts of heat waves in five U.S. regions (California, New York, Maryland, Illinois, and Texas). Work on the Los Angeles area has been completed and is underway for the other four regions. This paper focuses on the initial findings for the Los Angeles Basin and Southern California. The results to date suggest that the above-discussed strategies could produce an urban-area averaged temperature reduction of up to 2K in south Los Angeles with corresponding average decrease of 0.2K in dew point temperature and changes of up to 1 m s -1 in wind speed. These meteorological changes can help reduce heat-related health problems. By analyzing several heat waves that have occurred within the past decade in the Los Angeles area, we estimate that such changes in meteorological conditions could have reduced heat-related mortality by up to 25%.",,"Environmental control; Health complications; Heat waves; Passive solar systems; Computer simulation; Meteorology; Reduction; Solar heating; Solar system; Temperature measurement; Thermal effects; Urban planning; Environmental engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144447519

Parallel stable isotope records were generated using size-specific, depth-stratified planktonic and benthic foraminifera. All three of the foraminiferal δ13C stratigraphies record the isotopic decrease that marks the LMCS. The onset of the LMCS (-7.7 Ma) coincides with upper magnetochron C4n.2n within planktonic foraminiferal zone SN10. No significant increase is seen in the benthic foraminiferal δ18O record, thereby precluding the possibility that a substantial glacioeustatic fall in sea level enhanced the transfer of terrestrial carbon to the oceans during the LMCS. Planktonic foraminiferal shells are highly fragmented/dissolved near the base of the LMCS. This decline in preservation is paralleled by compositional changes to foraminiferal assemblages, a pattern we attribute to species-selective dissolution. Similar pulses of carbonate dissolution punctuate the LMCS at other subantarctic sites, indicating that the dissolution spike at Site 1172 reflects a regional change to Southern Ocean circulation/chemistry. Amplification of the LMCS in G. bulloidesδ13C values conforms to a pattern of stable isotopic variation associated with increased CO3= in surface waters. An important corollary of this interpretation is that surface-ocean pH increased as atmospheric C02 levels decreased during the transition from pre-to post-LMCS conditions. Thus, the LMCS marks when deep-sea δ18O records of more modem aspect first appeared in the geologic record, and may signify a new steady state in ocean carbonate chemistry. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047144276

Our current research goals are to address and quantify the numerous biophysical interactions that occur at the tree-crop interface in order to enhance our understanding of the ecology of tree-based intercropping (a form of agroforestry). In 1987, the University of Guelph established a large field experiment on 30 ha of prime agricultural land in Wellington county southern Ontario, Canada to investigate various aspects of intercropping trees with agricultural crops. A variety of spacing, crop compatibility and tree growth, and survival experiments were initiated at that time, utilizing 10 tree species within the genera Picea, Thuja, Pinus, Juglans, Quercus, Fraxinus, Acer, and Populus. Two between row-spacings (12.5 m or 15 m) and two within row-spacings (3 m, or 6 m) were utilized in conjunction with all possible combinations of three agricultural crops (soybean, corn, and either winter wheat or barley). Investigations over the last decade have documented several complementary biophysical interactions. Nitrogen (N) transfer from fall-shed leaves to adjacent crops with enhanced soil nitrification as the proposed mechanism was estimated to be 5 kg N ha-1. Soil organic carbon (C) adjacent to tree rows has increased by over 1%, largely as a result of tree litterfall inputs and fine root turnover. It is estimated that intercropping has reduced nitrate loading to adjacent waterways by 50%, a hypothesized function of deep percolate interception by tree roots. We have also noticed increased bird diversity and usage within the intercropped area as compared to mono-cropped adjacent agricultural areas, and have recorded increases in small mammal populations. Earthworm distribution and abundance was also found to be higher closer to the tree rows when compared to earthworm numbers in the crop alleys. We speculate that these are indicative of major changes in the flow of energy within the trophic structure identified with intercropping systems. In light of climate change mitigation processes, C sequestration and NO2 reduction potentials in tree-based intercropping systems were studied and compared to conventional agricultural systems. The results suggest that sequestration of C was 5 times more in the former system than in the latter. Competitive interactions between trees and crops for nutrients, moisture and light were also studied. The tangible benefits that are derived from properly designed and managed tree-based intercropping systems place this land management option above conventional agriculture in terms of long-term productivity and sustainability. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Tree intercropping, especially, is a potentially promising agroforestry option in the region. Understanding the ecological interactions between trees and crops in such intercropped systems provides the basis for designing efficient systems with potential for wider applicability. With this objective, the experience from several years of research on this aspect at the University of Guelph, in southern Ontario, Canada are presented. Yields of C3 crops intercropped with trees, as well as growth of trees, did not differ from those in corresponding sole-stand (conventional) systems of crops and trees. But, soil organic carbon content and bird and insect diversity increased in the intercropped area. The abundance and distribution of earthworms were higher closer to the tree rows indicating improved soil health. The C sequestration potential in fast-growing tree (hybrid-poplar)-based intercropping systems was four times more than that reported for conventional agricultural fields in the region. Because of reduced fertilizer use and more efficient N-cycling, the tree-intercropping systems could also lead to the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields by about 0.7 kg ha-1 yr-1. Marginal or degraded land that is suitable for agroforestry is estimated to be 57 million ha in Canada. Tree/crop intercropping is one agroforestry system that shows great potential for this region. We suggest that this land-management option can be placed above conventional agriculture in terms of long term-productivity and sustainability.","Agroecosystems; Biodiversity; Biophysical interactions; Carbon sequestration; Intercropping systems; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural practice; agroforestry; biodiversity; intercropping; Canada; North America; Ontario; Aves; Insecta; Pheretima sieboldi; Populus berolinensis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3342923480

Fuel sulfur control is the key to SOx reduction but NOx and PM production are primarily engine design dependent. Significant reductions in the emissions from on-road vehicles have been achieved in the last decade and emissions from these vehicles will be reduced by another order of magnitude in the next five years. These improvements have served to emphasize the need to reduce emissions from other mobile sources, including off-road equipment, locomotives, and marine vessels. Diesel-powered vessels of interest include ocean-going vessels with low- and medium-speed engines, as well as smaller vessels with medium- and high-speed engines. A recent study examined the use of intake water injection (WIS) and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel to reduce the emissions from a high-speed passenger ferry in southern California. One of the four Detroit Diesel 12V92 two-stroke, high-speed engines that power the ferry was instrumented to collect intake airflow rate, fuel flow rate, shaft torque, and shaft speed. Engine speed and shaft torque were uniquely linked for given vessel draft and prevailing wind and sea conditions. A raw exhaust gas sampling system was utilized to measure the concentration of NOx, carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxygen (O2), with a mini dilution tunnel sampling a slipstream from the raw exhaust was used to collect TPM on 70 mm filters. The emissions data were processed to yield brake-specific mass results. The emissions measurement system that was employed allowed for redundant data to be collected for quality assurance and quality control. To acquire the data, the ferry was operated at five different steady-state speeds. Three modes were executed in the open sea off Oceanside, CA, idle and harbor modes were also selected for the test matrix. Data have showed that the use of ULSD along with water injection (WIS) could significantly reduce the emissions of NOx and PM while not affecting fuel consumption or engine performance, when compared to baseline marine diesel fuel. The results showed that a nominal 40% reduction in TPM was realized when switching from marine diesel fuel to ULSD. A small reduction in NOx was also shown between the marine fuel and the ULSD. The implementation of the WIS reduced NOx by 11% to 17%, depending upon the operating condition. With the WIS, TPM was reduced by a few percentage points, which was close to the confidence level of the measurements.",,"Carbon dioxide; Data reduction; Ferry boats; Fuel consumption; Nitrogen oxides; Quality assurance; Sulfur; Water injection; Wind; Fuel sulfur; Marine vessels; Total particulate matter (TPM); Ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD); Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14044275082

It sought not only to add to our stock of knowledge about how well tradeable permit systems work and the design features that contribute to desirable outcomes, it also sought to use detailed analysis of case studies to shed light on the evaluation process itself, as well as on more general issues associated with the links between policy evaluation and the public policy process. Alongside environmentally related taxes, tradeable permits (TP) are increasing in importance in OECD Member countries as governments seek to introduce more flexible market-based instruments to address environmental problems. However, unlike taxes they are quantity-based, rather than price-based, environmental policy measures. A quantitative limit is introduced either as a maximum ceiling for ""cap and trade"" schemes, or as a minimum performance commitment for ""baseline and credit"" schemes. Moreover, these targets can be either in absolute terms or in relative terms. And finally the permits can be denominated either in terms of 'bads' (i.e. pollution emission) or 'goods' (i.e. natural resources). Amongst economists, and increasingly amongst the environmental policy community in general, it is felt that TP schemes can provide significant benefits in terms of economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness (see OECD 2002 for a full definition). The workshop was designed to build on previous work at the OECD on the use of tradeable permits (OECD 1999a, Godard 2001, OECD 2002), as well as the ex post evaluation of environmental policy instruments (OECD 1997a and Smith 2002). Tradeable permits were seen an especially suitable focal point for examining the wider issues associated with policy evaluation for a number of reasons: Since their use is increasing rapidly (including, but not limited to, the requirements created by the Kyoto Protocol), the demand for insights derived from the evaluation of actual experience is high; The fact that tradeable permits have been controversial and are somewhat unfamiliar to most decision-makers has added to the need for solid information upon which to base decisions;2 Tradeable permit systems are also somewhat unique in that in the normal course of their operation they reveal information about the costs of compliance for affected firms through permit price trajectories, facilitating evaluations; and, The process of assuring compliance generates information on estimated emissions, and can even provide motivation for significantly improving the quality of the emissions data,3 also reducing the cost of conducting an evaluation. In this report we consider how tradeable permits have been applied in a variety of different contexts. These include controlling air pollution, the degradation of wetlands, agricultural pollution, water scarcity and fisheries depletion. In addition, the case studies focus not only on a variety of natural resource and pollution applications, but a variety of geographic locations as well (Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United States). Variations in experience can be exploited to isolate a wider range of lessons for both the design and use of tradeable permits and the design and use of ex post evaluation. Providing a wider variety of contexts allows us to begin to see precisely how context matters. Moreover, the case studies employed a wide variety of methodologies, assessing different evaluation criteria, and undertaken under different institutional arrangements. The workshop discussions and the case studies highlighted the diversity of uses to which evaluations can be put, as well as the diversity of means by which they are undertaken and integrated with the policy framework more generally. Finally, while this workshop dealt explicitly with ex post evaluations, the extent to which the discussions drifted so easily and so frequently into other forms of evaluation indicates the degree to which all forms of evaluation are ultimately linked. Ex ante analysis is frequently a stepping-stone for ex post analysis, and ex post evaluations themselves can serve very different functions. While evaluations performed early in the process may not be particularly helpful in informing definitive judgements on how well the programme ultimately works, they can be very helpful in providing the feedback necessary to shape the evolution of the system over time. Indeed, one central message from these case studies is that the programmes rarely emerge fully-formed. They evolve over time and interim feedback can be particularly valuable. This introductory chapter is divided into four sections. Section I reviews the criteria which can be used for the evaluation of environmental policy instruments in general, and tradeable permit systems in particular. Section II looks at general methodological issues associated with undertaking policyevaluations, while Section III provides a brief review of ex post evaluations of tradeable permit systems, including those discussed at the workshop. And finally, there is a brief concluding section. The remainder of the report is made up of the six case studies presented: The American SO2 allowance program; Los Angeles's RECLAIM program, the Dutch nutrient quota trading system, individual transferable quotas for fish stocks in New Zealand, the American wetlands credit trading scheme, and water trading in Australia. In all cases the results are presented, along with a discussion of methodological issues and policy implications. The report concludes with a discussion of the more general issues associated with the management of ex post evaluations and their integration with the policy process. © OECD 2004.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917515684

The downtime is due to maintenance of the ceramic heat exchanger media. Maintenance of the bed is necessary because the RTO exhaust fan is not able to evacuate sufficient fume from the process. The problems might be a collection system going positive pressure, high localized solvent concentrations-OSHA issues, excessive odors, etc. In any case the plant process is not operating as designed and the RTO is plugging up. This case study analysis will discuss 3 applications where PM was an integral part of the fume stream and where conventional systems either did not work well or would not work at all now. We will discuss each application in depth; provide PM loadings before and after the RTO, and describe what steps have been taken to maintain uptime and reliability for each of the difficult air streams.","Bakeout; Burnout; Ceramic; Monolith; Particulate matter; PM; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer; RTO","Bakeout; Burnout; Ceramic beds; Monolith; Particulate matter (PM); Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO); Ceramic materials; Environmental protection; Heat exchangers; Maintenance; Particles (particulate matter); Pressure drop; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944404959

The protocol may also be interpreted as a technology protocol. The protocol consists of three parameters: a graduation income, below which countries have no emission reduction obligations; a convergence rate, at which emission intensities should approach that of the most carbon-extensive countries; and an acceleration rate, at which the most carbon-extensive countries should improve their technology over and above the business-asusual scenario. Depending on the parameter values, emission reduction ranges from draconian to almost nil. The graduation income and acceleration rate have the expected effects. The effect of the convergence rate is strongly scenario-dependent; some scenarios, perhaps unrealistically, assume strong technological convergence in the nopolicy case; in other scenarios, adopting ‘best commercial technology in the whole world’ would lead to substantial emission reduction. Not surprisingly, different regions prefer different parameters in the emission intensity protocol. Adopting the opinion of the median voter, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide in the year 2200 would be reduced from 1650 to 950 ppm. This reduction is relatively robust to changes in crucial model parameters. The costs of complying with the emission intensity protocol can be reduced substantially through international trade in emission permits and, in particular, by banking and borrowing. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; Integrated assessment; International climate policy; Technology","climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644455127

However, the required precision and resolution of such measurements needed to characterise sources and sinks of CO2 on regional scales presents strong instrument design challenges. One type of remote sensing instrument which has been proposed to measure the integrated-column concentration of CO2 is a Gas-Filter Correlation Radiometer (GFCR). As a technique, a GFCR is a radiometer which uses a sample of the gas of interest as a spectral filter for that gas in the atmosphere. In this paper we present a ""strawman"" design for a GFCR satellite instrument to remotely sense atmospheric CO2. This design, which includes multi-pass CO2 and O2 gas cells with path lengths of up to 10 metres, demonstrates that such an instrument can be built within the constraints of a satellite environment.","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Radiometry; Remote sounding","Acoustic equipment; Air filters; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Global warming; Optical resolving power; Radiometers; Radiometry; Satellite observatories; Carbon cycle; Gas-Filter Correlation Radiometer (GFCR); Remote sounding; Spectral filters; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15844384848

In support of this the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged in a test project under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels-Diesel Emission Control (APBF-DEC) activity to develop a passenger car with the capability to demonstrate compliance with Tier 2 Bin 5 emission targets with a fresh emission control catalyst system. In order to achieve this goal, a prototype engine was installed in a passenger car and optimized to provide the lowest practical level of engine-out emissions. While this optimized calibration proved capable of meeting Euro 4 emission regulations for nitrogen oxides (NOx) on an engine-out basis, a further reduction of 85% in both NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions was necessary to meet the stringent Tier 2 Bin 5 emission levels. The emission control system was subsequently optimized in the test cell under steady-state and transient conditions. A rapid warm-up strategy was developed to achieve the fastest possible catalyst light-off under cold start conditions. The catalyst performance was mapped and optimized under numerous load and speed conditions with different lean-rich modulation approaches. Finally, diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration as well as desulfurization strategies were developed under this project. Vehicle tests with development emission control systems proved that the combination of low engine-out emissions, in conjunction with a sophisticated regeneration strategy, were able to meet Tier 2 Bin 5 emission levels.

We review perspectives on collective action for natural resource management to inform understanding of climate response capacity. We demonstrate the importance of social learning, specifically in relation to the acceptance of strategies that build social and ecological resilience. Societies and communities dependent on natural resources need to enhance their capacity to adapt to the impacts of future climate change, particularly when such impacts could lie outside their experienced coping range. This argument is illustrated by an example of present-day collective action for community-based coastal management in Trinidad and Tobago. The case demonstrates that community-based management enhances adaptive capacity in two ways: by building networks that are important for coping with extreme events and by retaining the resilience of the underpinning resources and ecological systems.

The high cetane number of DGE enables operation at charge-gas temperatures below those required for current diesel fuels, which may be advantageous for reducing NOx emissions. In-cylinder optical measurements of flame lift-off length and natural luminosity were obtained simultaneously with engine-out soot measurements while varying charge-gas density and temperature. The local mixture stoichiometry at the lift-off length was characterized by a parameter called the oxygen ratio that was estimated from the measured flame lift-off length using an entrainment correlation for non-reacting sprays. The results demonstrate that near-zero engine-out soot emissions can be achieved with the oxygenated fuel DGE at high engine loads, even under conditions that yield significant in-cylinder soot formation. In all test cases, significant soot formation during the fuel-injection period was indicated by natural luminosity measurements and was consistent with predictions based on the estimated oxygen ratio at the flame lift-off length, yet near-zero engine-out soot was observed in some cases. The absence of engine-out soot despite significant in-cylinder soot formation is attributed to oxidation of soot before the exhaust valves open. Consistent with this hypothesis, in-cylinder measurements show that most of the natural luminosity signal in high engine-out soot cases occurs after the end of injection and persists until the exhaust valves open. Most compellingly, engine-out soot is found to be proportional to the natural luminosity signal at exhaust valve opening as the quantity of fuel injected, charge-gas density, and temperature are varied.",,"Combustion; Density of gases; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dust; Fuel purification; Fuels; Gas emissions; Glycols; Indium compounds; Luminance; Nitrogen compounds; Optical data processing; Oxygen; Soot; Combustion pro-cess; DI diesel engine; Diethylene glycol diethyl ethers; Hydrocarbon fuel; Injection period; Luminosity measurement; Optical measurement; Soot measurement; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072410088

For last several decades, many studies on antenna characteristics have been done. In terms of antenna impedance, theoretical analyses were done with the assumption of the antenna surface current. Simultaneously analysis of antenna impedance was carried out by real observation with spacecraft and antenna equivalent circuit which consists of parallel circuit of resistance and capacitance. However there are some discrepancy between the observational results and the analysis with antenna equivalent circuit, which may be caused by the plasma kinetic effect such as sheath formation around antenna and photoelectron emission. In order to include such plasma kinetic effects in the analysis of Antenna characteristics, we applied the PIC (Particle-In-Cell) method to the conventional FDTD field solving simulations. In the PIC method, we solve the equation of motion for each particle with the field components obtained at grid points with the FDTD method. In the simulations, we place a receiving antenna in a three-dimensional plasma space in such as situation that an electrostatic wave propagating along the antenna length is initially. We particularly focus on the dependence of antenna properties on the ratio between the local Debye length and the antenna length as well as the ion sheath size created around the antenna. Preliminary results will be also shown on the effects of photo-electron emission on the antenna impedance. We also considered the finite size of a conducting spacecraft and examined the antenna properties by changing the ratio between the spacecraft size and the antenna length. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Computer simulation; Electric resistance; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Electromagnetism; Electron emission; Equations of motion; Finite difference method; Maxwell equations; Photoemission; Plasma sheaths; Plasmas; Space research; Time domain analysis; Electron temperature; Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations; Plasma kinetic effects; Sheath size; Dipole antennas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20844435788

The database, which has been specifically designed to address the needs of researchers in the area of vulnerability assessment of coastal zones, integrates information on physical, ecological and socio-economic characteristics of the coast at various resolutions and covers the world's coastline, excluding Antarctica. Initially developed within a Geographic Information System, this global database forms an integral part of the DINAS-COAST system and one of the principal components of DIVA, the modelling and assessment tool that the project has produced. In order to comply with the physical and functional requirements of this tool, the database design has been based on a linear data model for the representation of the world's coast. According to this model, all the data in DIVA are expressed to linear coastal segments of variable length, thus giving the DIVA database a fundamentally different data structure to the more common raster datasets used in global studies. The decomposition of the world's coastline into segments has been based on a series of physical, administrative and socio-economic criteria and has resulted in 12,148 segments which represent homogeneous units in terms of impacts and vulnerability to sea-level rise and constitute the reference units on which all subsequent modelling and analysis are based. The selection of the data model and the representation of coastal space within DIVA have constituted two of the main challenges of the database design and have formed the basis for the compilation of a reliable, coherent and easy-to-use database that allows for consistent evaluations of coastal-zone vulnerability to sea-level rise at regional and global scales. It is expected that the DINAS-COAST database will provide researchers and modellers from various disciplines with an efficient and consistent basis for studying coastal systems, assessing coastal vulnerability and formulating broad policy responses to climate change. © 2004 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Nitric oxide emissions at optimal furnace settings were similar for fuel oil and SHO20 with values between 68 ppm and 130 ppm. Benefits of SHO include reduced dependence on foreign oil and a new market for the soybean processing industry.

The model has been forced with 3 h meteorological data for the period 1979-1990, producing a 12-year hindcast validated with datasets from the Baltic Environmental Database for the same period. The model results demonstrate the model to hindcast the time-evolution of the physical structure very well, confirming the view of the open Baltic water column as a three layer system of surface, intermediate and bottom waters. Comparative analyses of modelled hydrochemical components with respect to the independent data have shown that the long-term system behaviour of the model is within the observed ranges. Also primary production processes, deduced from oxygen (over)saturation are hindcast correctly over the entire period and the annual net primary production is within the observed range. The largest mismatch with observations is found in simulating the biogeochemistry of the Baltic intermediate waters. Modifications in the structure of the model (addition of fast-sinking detritus and polysaccharide dynamics) have shown that the nutrient dynamics are linked to the quality and dimensions of the organic matter produced in the euphotic zone, high-lighting the importance of the residence time of the organic matter within the microbial foodweb in the intermediate waters. Experiments with different scenarios of riverine nutrient loads, assessed in the limits of a 1-D setup, have shown that the external input of organic matter makes the open Baltic model more heterotrophic. The characteristics of the inputs also drive the dynamics of nitrogen in the bottom layers leading either to nitrate accumulation (when the external sources are inorganic), or to coupled nitrification-denitrification (under strong organic inputs). The model indicates the permanent stratification to be the main feature of the system as regulator of carbon and nutrient budgets. The model predicts that most of the carbon produced in the euphotic zone is also consumed in the water column and this enhances the importance of heterotrophic benthic processes as final closure of carbon and nutrient cycles in the open Baltic. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,"biogeochemistry; marine environment; nutrient; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; oceanic regions; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21844477543

The physical size of its resources (e.g., forests, agriculture, soils, rangeland, and geologic formations) and the expertise in California provides a substantial foundation for developing C sequestration activities. Furthermore, the co-benefits c sequestration - such as improved soil and water quality, restoration of degraded ecosystems, increased plant and crop productivity, and enhanced oil recovery - are significant. In fact, C sequestration often represents a 'no regrets' strategy - implementing C sequestration provides multiple benefits, even without the advent of global climate change. Nevertheless, researchers need to address several issues to determine more accurately the potential, benefits, and costs of sequestering C in California's terrestrial ecosystems and geologic formations, as well as to identify the most promising sequestration methods and their optimal implementation. One key issue is the type of regulatory constraints facing developers of C sequestration projects: what permits are needed for developing these projects? The permitting process may impede the penetration of sequestration technologies into the market if the costs (including transaction costs) of obtaining the permits are too burdensome and costly. For example, at least nine federal regulations and seven state regulations will potentially influence C sequestration projects in California. This paper also provides an example of the types of permits needed for developing a C sequestration project, using California as an example. It is possible that a C sequestration project may have to obtain a total of 15 permits (3 federal, 6 state, 6 local), before it even starts to operate. In the concluding section, we offer some suggested areas for research and activities for policy makers.","C sequestration; California; Environmental impacts; Geologic sequestration; Permits; Regulatory constraints; Terrestrial ecosystems","carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental impact; geological structure; pollution control; California; North America; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942289685

This susceptibility to intercrystalline corrosion is closely related with the precipitation of chromium rich carbides (and/or nitrides) in steel, whereby the carbide surroundings is depleted on the chromium below the limit which is necessary for the formation of a protective passive layer of steel. These depleted regions are than attacked by the corrosive environment easily, whereby the intercrystalline corrosion occurs. The precipitations of the first carbides and/or nitrides of chromium, namely, take place mostly on the grain boundaries, where thermodynamic conditions are favourable for precipitate formation. Therefore, the steel susceptibility to intercrystalline corrosion will change in the case of a change of thermodynamic as well as kinetic conditions for the carbide and nitride occurrence. From it follows then the methods applied to prevent the occurrence of the intercrystalline corrosion, such as a quick cooling-down from solution treatment temperatures, the reduction of carbon content and, finally, the alloying with elements which, due to their great affinity for carbon, produce with it the carbides before the chromium carbides are formed. Carbides of these alloying elements precipitate within all the grain volume (with the exception of carbides occurring by the excessive heating of stabilized steel up to the temperature of the solidus), whereas chromium carbides precipitate preferentially on the grain boundaries. Conditions under which single carbides are formed as well as equilibrium conditions, which are formed, are very important for the investigations of causes of the susceptibility to intercrystalline corrosion. Therefore, our attention will be paid to the problems of the chemical thermodynamics in the solution of stainless steel intercrystalline corrosion problem. The susceptibility of austenitic steels to intercrystalline corrosion is expressed by a C-curve in coordinates ""time-temperature"" (Rollason's diagram).

In the debate on dealing with this threat, expectations are high that agriculture based economies of the developing world can help alleviate this problem. But, the contribution of agricultural operations to these emissions is fairly small. It is the clearing of native ecosystems for agricultural use in the tropics that is the largest non-fossil fuel source of CO2 input to the atmosphere. Our calculation show that the use of fossil energy and the concomitant emission of CO2 in the agricultural operational sector - i.e. the use of farm machinery, irrigation, fertilization and chemical pesticides - amounts to merely 3.9% of the commercial energy use in that part of the world. Of this, 70% is associated with the production and use of chemical fertilizers. In the absence of fertilizer use, the developing world would have converted even more land for cultivation, most of which is completely unsuitable for cultivation. Current expectations are that reforestation in these countries can sequester large quantities of carbon in order to mitigate excessive emissions elsewhere. But, any program that aims to set aside land for the purpose of sequestering carbon must do so without threatening food security in the region. The sole option to liberate the necessary land for carbon sequestration would be the intensification of agricultural production on some of the better lands by increased fertilizer inputs. As our calculations show, the sequestration of carbon far outweighs the emissions that are associated with the production of the extra fertilizer needed. Increasing the fertilizer use in the developing world (without China) by 20%, we calculated an overall net benefit in the carbon budget of between 80 and 206 Mt yr-1 dependent on the carbon sequestration rate assumed for the regrowing forest. In those regions, where current fertilizer use is low, the relative benefits are the highest as responding yield increases are highest and thus more land can be set aside without harming food security. In Sub-Saharan Africa a 20% fertilizer increase, which amounts to 0.14 Mt of extra fertilizer, can tie up somewhere between 8 and 19 Mt of CO2 per year (average: 96 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In the Near East and North Africa with a 20%-increased fertilizer use of 0.4 Mt yr-1 between 10 and 24 Mt of CO2 could be sequestered on the land set aside (40 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In South Asia this is 22-61 Mt CO2 yr-1 with an annual additional input of 2.15 Mt fertilizer (19 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In fact, carbon credits may be the only way for some of the farmers in these regions to afford the costly inputs. Additionally, in regions with already relatively high fertilizer inputs such as in South Asia, an efficient use of the extra fertilizer must be warranted. Nevertheless, the net CO2 benefit through implementation of this measure in the developing world is insignificant compared to the worldwide CO2 output by human activity. Thus, reforestation is only one mitigating measure and not the solution to unconstrained fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Carbon emissions should, therefore, first of all be reduced by the avoidance of deforestation in the developing world and moreover by higher energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Global warming potential; Greenhouse policy; Liming; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon; Trace gas flux","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy use; tropical environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842330600

A total of twelve sensitivity scenarios which can be grouped into four thematic categories were performed. These four categories consist of simulations with different chemical mechanisms, different assumptions concerning the deposition characteristics of intermediate products, assumptions concerning the nitrates from the oxidation of isoprene and variations of the source strengths. The largest differences in ozone compared to the reference simulation occured when a different isoprene oxidation scheme was used (up to 30-60% or about 10 nmol/mol). The largest differences in the abundance of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) were found when the isoprene emission strength was reduced by 50% and in tests with increased or decreased efficiency of the deposition of intermediates. The deposition assumptions were also found to have a significant effect on the upper tropospheric HOx production. Different implicit assumptions about the loss of intermediate products were identified as a major reason for the deviations among the tested isoprene oxidation schemes. The total tropospheric burden Of O3 calculated in the sensitivity runs is increased compared to the background methane chemistry by 26±9 Tg(O3) from 273 to an average from the sensitivity runs of 299 Tg(O3). Thus, there is a spread of ±35% of the overall effect of isoprene in the model among the tested scenarios. This range of uncertainty and the much larger local deviations found in the test runs suggest that the treatment of isoprene in global models can only be seen as a first order estimate at present, and points towards specific processes in need of focused future work. © European Geosciences Union 2004.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043156959

Only exploitation of coal in the regions of Velenje and Zasavje is economically justifiable. Unfortunately, coal in these two regions is environmentally problematic, and reserves are sufficient only for about 40 years of exploitation. Reserves of uranium are bigger, but their exploitation is environmentally questionable and economically not viable. Slovenia has, because of its pre-Alpine geographical location, rather high amount of annual precipitation, which gives possibilities for exploitation of hydropower potential, solar energy and biomass. EU countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, in which they took over obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 8 % in the commitment period 2008-2012. In order to fulfil the Kyoto targets it will be necessary to restructure the sectors of energy supply, industry and transport. The costs of emission reduction should not exceed the purpose of investment into cleaner environment and exploitation of additional energy. The most important options for fulfilment of these commitments are exploitation of renewables and simultaneous production of heat and electricity (CHP). Nevertheless, before construction of power plants for electricity production from renewables or CHP plants, it is necessary to investigate their economic justifiability and impact on the environment. In this process it is necessary not to forget the process of electricity market opening, which reached the Western Europe at the end of last millennium, and is now irrepressibly spreading towards the east and is increasingly becoming (cruel!) reality in our country.",,"Coal; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Electric power plants; Embedded systems; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Investments; Energy supply; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Kyoto targets; Electrical engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744226706

We investigate the dose-serum level relationship after single and multiple lithium acetate dosing in a hemodialysis patient and review the literature. Methods: Lithium acetate was administered orally over a period of 11 months in a patient with major depressive episodes after being placed on hemodialysis three times a week. The serum trough levels of lithium before and after hemodialysis were analyzed. The data were compared with those reported in the literature, and potential drug interactions and the importance of the residual renal function are discussed. Results: No adverse events due to the lithium therapy were documented. Steady state levels of between 0.6 and 0.8 mmol/l of lithium acetate were achieved 17 days after initiating the therapy, using 24 mmol/l of lithium three times a week, in a patient with a residual diuresis of about 400 ml/day. In contrast, data reported in the literature implicate that only 9.6-14.4 mmol/l of lithium (450-600 mg of lithium carbonate) is sufficient to achieve adequate serum levels.

The TRP region has the largest natural wetland extent in China. Drainage of wetlands and conversion from wetland into agriculture land use may be one of the primary reasons for the regional climate change. The region's temperature experienced two sudden increases in early 1970s and late 1980s and those changes were coincident with the time frames of large-scale agricultural reclamations. The TRP region warrants a significant regional study to answer questions such as ""were human-induced LCLUC significant to affect the magnitude and spatial temporal greenhouse gas emissions and in further responsible for regional climate change?"" Integration of satellite remotely sensed land surface conditions and in situ measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes provide a reliable information source to study the spatial-temporal patterns of greenhouse gas emissions. Integration of remote sensing detected land-cover change and patterns of greenhouse gas fluxes associated with different land-cover types allows quantification of regional greenhouse gas emission and in further to study the driving factors of regional climate change. Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data are necessary toward this effort.","Greenhouse gas emission; Land-use and land-cover change; Northeast China; Wetland change","Climate change; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land use; Natural resources; Remote sensing; Wetlands; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use and land-cover change; Northeast China; Wetland change; Landforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15844411318

An attraction of such cycle is that a rated power of 300 MWe can be attainable at a medium turbine inlet temperature, i.e. 550 °C, with a cycle efficiency of 45%. Turbomachinery used in the cycle is composed of two compressors (a main compressor and a recompressing compressor) and a turbine, which work on a single shaft. In fact the high cycle efficiency is realized by having the main compressor operate near the critical point of CO2 to benefit from reduced compression work. Introduction of the recompressing compressor which operates at a temperature higher than critical is to avoid the pinch-point problem which otherwise occurs in the subsequent recuperator. Because the perfect gas law does not apply near the saturation line, CO 2 was treated as a real gas and the NIST property database was used for the purpose of CO2 thermodynamics and transport property evaluation. The preliminary design process for the supercritical CO2 compressors is mainly discussed in this paper. Steady-state design as well as off-design analysis was performed using the AXIAL™ program modified for real gas properties. The results show that the supercritical CO2 compressors are more compact than helium compressors, with equivalent adiabatic efficiency.

Some of these models employ an energy and moisture balance model (EMBM) as the atmospheric component. However, the solar energy disposition (SED) in the subcomponents of these climate models using an EMBM has never been parametrized in a systematic manner. In this paper, the SED, which is a measure of the amount of solar radiation absorbed in the atmosphere, absorbed at the surface and reflected to space, is first expressed as functions of the surface albedo and the integrated atmospheric reflectivity, transmissivity, absorptivity and cloud amount for a one-layer atmosphere which includes a cloud region and aerosols. Then an atmospheric radiative-convective model is used to parametrize the integrated atmospheric reflectivity and transmissivity in terms of cloud optical depth, aerosol optical depth, precipitable water, and solar zenith angle. Next, the presentday climatology of the SED is calculated using the climatological data (for cloud amount and optical depth, aerosol optical depth, precipitable water and surface albedo) from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), ECMWF 15-year Reanalysis (ERA-15) and the Pathfinder Atmosphere (PATMOS). Since cloud amount data are used from three independent sources, three SEDs are in fact calculated and tested against the SED derived from satellite data. The calculated SEDs are in good agreement with the SED derived from satellite data; thus the parametrized SED presented here is recommended for use in climate models which employ an EMBM or a one-layer atmosphere model. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"albedo; climate modeling; optical property; parameterization; radiative transfer; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344606263

Provision of aerobic conditions offers several advantages including accelerated leachate stabilization, increased landfill airspace recovery and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Air injection was applied over 130 days to bench-scale bioreactors containing fresh and aged MSW representative of newly constructed and pre-existing landfill conditions. In the fresh MSW simulation bioreactors, aeration reduced the average time to stabilization of leachate pH by 46 days, TSS by 42 days, TDS by 84 days, BOD5 by 46 days and COD by 32 days. In addition, final leachate concentrations were consistently lower in aerated test cells. There was no indication of a gradual decrease in the concentration of ammonia, and it is likely this high ammonia concentration would continue to be problematic in bioreactor landfill applications. This study focussed only on biodegradability of organics in the solid waste. The concentrations of the nonreactive or conservative substances such as chloride and/or heavy metals remain in the bioreactor landfills due to the continuous recirculation of leachate. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for air injection to accelerate stabilization of municipal solid waste, with greatest influence on fresh waste with a high biodegradable organic fraction. © 2004 CAWQ.","Aerobic bioreactor; Landfill simulation; Leachate; Municipal solid waste; Stabilization; Waste age","Ammonia; Biodegradation; Bioreactors; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Leachate treatment; Monitoring; Pollution control; Air injection; Greenhouse gases; MSW simulations; Municipal solid wastes (MSW); Solid wastes; aeration; Biodegradation; bioreactor; landfill; municipal waste; solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4844225353

The δ13C values of CH4 range from - 96 to -63% in the upper 300 m sediments. Both δ13C values of CH4 and CO2 become more positive with increasing depth. The preferential depletion of 12CO2, progressive decrease in microbial activity with depth and upward gas migration through the sediments column explain the δ13C depth profiles. In deeper horizons, the origins of gases change from microbial to thermogenic at around 1500 mbsf (meters below seafloor). Gases shallower than 1500 mbsf have lower δ13C values of CH4 (lower than -59%), while gases deeper than 1500 mbsf have higher δ13C values of CH4 (-48 to -35%), typical for gases generated by thermal decomposition of organic matter. The measured total organic carbon (TOC) in the Nankai Trough is around 0.5%, which is considered too low for in situ formation of gas hydrate. Consequently, some gas migration and accumulation processes are required for the concentrated formation of the gas hydrates (up to 80% in pore space) in the Nankai Trough. This process may be related to the geological setting of the Nankai Trough, where fluid flow containing methane is active through thrust systems within Nankai accretionary prism sediments. There is, however, no indication of thermogenic gases in shallow sediment including the hydrate-bearing intervals, suggesting that the fluid migration is rather local and restricted to the shallow sediments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The prevention of deforestation - and the re-forestation of degraded land - could become a key elements to national climate protection programs of some developing countries. Agroforestry may offer economically viable windows of opportunity for sustainable use of tropical forests whereas additional funds (e.g. through ""Clean Development Mechanism"") will be required to make re-forestation programs profitable. Alternative management practices in rice-based systems may offer win-win options to reduce emissions and - at the same time - to obtain another improvement in the production system, namely through optimized timing of nitrogen fertilizer, temporary drainage in irrigated rice fields and integrated residue management. Introducing pasture in degraded land can sequester substantial amounts of carbon (similar to re-forestation). Future research has to include participation of stakeholders from all conceivable levels, i.e. farmers' cooperatives, non-governmental organizations, national agricultural research centers and extension services, to devise simple and financially interesting incentives for reducing emissions. The feasibility of environmentally friendly production techniques has to be disseminated to the public through 'success stories' (documented in public media) and demonstration farms.","Agroforestry; Biomass burning; Efficiency; Participatory research; Pasture; Policy; Residue; Rice","agricultural emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; pollution control; tropical region; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842330596

This study aims to determine in situ if the daily variation of chlorophyll fluorescence and other ecophysiological parameters in five seedlings of three woody species, Ilex rotunda, Ficus microcarpa and Machilus chinensis, could be used alone or in combination with other measurements for sensitivity indexes to make diagnoses under air pollution stress and, hence, to choose the correct tree species for urban afforestation in the Delta area. Methods. Five seedlings of each species were transplanted in pot containers after their acclimation under shadowing conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made in situ by a portable fluorometer (OS-30, Opti-sciences, U.S.A). Ten random samples of leaves were picked from each species for LA measurements by area-meter (CI-203, CID, Inc., U.S.A). DW was determined after the leaf samples were dried to a constant weight at 65°C. LMA was calculated as the ratio of DW/LA. Leaf N content was analyzed according to the Kjeldhal method, and the extraction of pigments was carried out according Lin et al. Results and Discussion. The daily mean Fv/Fm (Fv is the variable fluorescence and Fm is the maximum fluorescence) analysis showed that Ilex rotunda and Ficus microcarpa were more highly resistant to pollution stress, followed by Machilus chinensis, implying that the efficiency of photosystem II in I. rotunda was less affected by air pollutants than the other two species. Little difference in daily change of Fv/Fm in I. rotunda between the polluted and the clean site was also observed. However, a relatively large variation of F v/Fm appeared in the other two species, particularly in M. chinensis, suggesting that they were more sensitive to air pollutants than I. rotunda. The mean LA was reduced for all species growing at the polluted site. The mean LMA for all species exceeded the sclerophylly threshold given by Cowling and Campbell and increased for those under pollution stress, which could be explained as one of the acclimation strategies for plants to air pollution stress. Little difference in leaf chlorophyll content was observed in F. microcarpa and M. chinensis, while remarkable differences were found in I. rotunda growing at the polluted and the clean site. Content of leaf carotenoids was largely reduced in I. rotunda growing at the polluted site, but increased in F. microcarpa and M. chinensis, compared with plants growing at the clean site. Plants growing at the clean site had a lower leaf N content than those growing at the polluted site. In addition, species with a higher resistance to pollution stress showed less difference in leaf N content than those sensitive species. Conclusion. Based on Fv/Fm measurements of the three woody species, I. rotunda showed the highest resistance to air pollutants from ceramic industries, followed by F. microcarpa. M. chinensis was the most sensitive species to air pollution, had lowest capacities to cope with the air pollution stress, which was consistent with visual injury symptoms observed in the crown profiles of plants at the polluted site. Fv/Fm, LAM, LA, leaf pigments and N content could be used alone or in combination to diagnose the extent of the physiological injury. The ratio of F v/Fm, however, was the best and most effective parameter. Recommendation and Outlook. Tree species which have higher air-pollutant resistance, as diagnosed by such ecophysiological parameters, should be considered first and planted widely for urban afforestation or forest regeneration in areas where the forest was seriously degraded or forest health was markedly effected by the same kind of air pollutants.","Air pollutants; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Ficus microcarpa; Ilex rotunda; Leaf mass per area (LMA); Leaf N; Machilus chinensis","atmospheric pollution; industrial emission; leaf area; pollution effect; sensitivity analysis; woody plant; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Ficus microcarpa; Ficus microcarpa; Ilex; Ilex rotunda; Ilex rotunda; Machilus; Machilus chinensis; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942735242

NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development will bring the fuel cell cost to $400/kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also, the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change aim to reduce CO 2, NOx, and SO 2 emissions. SOFC's have no emissions so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFC's, reforming, energy storage - has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFC's for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO 2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications. This U.S. DOE fuel cell funding shown in Figure 1 is only for SOFC. If other U.S. agencies, Japanese, European, and industry cost share, SOFC funding is around $100 MM/year. The DOE FE SECA budget has shown strong growth since a small amount of funds were allocated for initial work in 2000. The SECA program has grown as earlier programs ended.

However, these savannas are subject to frequent and extensive fire. Fire regimes are likely to affect the productivity and carbon sequestration potential of savannas, through effects on both biomass and carbon emissions. The carbon sequestration potential has been estimated for some savanna sites by quantifying carbon storage in biomass and soil pools, and the fluxes to these pools. Using different techniques, previous work in these savannas has indicated that net ecosystem productivity [NEP, net primary productivity (NPP) less heterotrophic respiration] was about -3 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). However, the impacts of fire were not accounted for in these calculations. Estimates of NEP have been combined with remotely-sensed estimates of area burnt and associated emissions for a an extensive area of mesic savanna in Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. Combining NEP estimates with precise fire data provides an estimate of net biome productivity (NBP), a production index that includes carbon loss through disturbance (fire), and is thus a more realistic indicator of sequestration rate from this biome. This preliminary analysis suggests that NBP is approximately -1 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). A reduction in the annual area burnt is likely to increase the sink size. Uncertainties surrounding these estimates of NBP and the implications of these uncertainties for land management in these extensive landscapes are discussed.","Aboriginal land; Arnhem land; Carbon accounting; Global change; Land use; Net biome productivity; Net ecosystem productivity; Remote sensing; Tropical savanna","Carbon; Data reduction; Ecosystems; Fire protection; Gas emissions; Productivity; Soils; Tropical engineering; Net biome productivity (NBP); Soil pools; Plants (botany); carbon sequestration; fire; net ecosystem production; savanna; Australasia; Australia; Northern Territory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042779059

Under elevated [CO2], annual community biomass production was stimulated significantly only in the fourth year of investigation. Functional plant groups responded differentially to CO2 enrichment causing a clear shift in botanical composition from 1999 to 2002 towards a higher proportion of legumes under elevated [CO 2] and two harvests per year, respectively. Photosynthetic capacity was not affected by higher [CO2] in the legume Lotus corniculatus but downregulated in the monocot Bromus erectus. Under elevated [CO2] the nitrogen content was lower in all functional plant groups, though C/N ratio was enhanced significantly only in grasses and non-leguminous dicots. In this nutrient-poor grassland community, legumes exhibit a higher competitiveness under elevated [CO2] due to their ability of symbiotic N 2-fixation.","Biomass production; CO2 enrichment; Community composition; Cutting regime; Functional plant groups; Grassland; Nitrogen; Photosynthetic capacity","Bromus; Bromus erectus; Bromus erectus; Dicotyledoneae; Lotus; Lotus corniculatus; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842760638

This project is one of the first in the United States utilizing dynamic closed-loop neural network technology to optimize performance on a load following power plant utilizing cyclone boilers for combustion. A typical characteristic of cyclone boiler design is higher than normal thermal NO x emissions mainly due to higher than usual combustion temperatures in the cyclone. The objective of this project is to lower the NO x emissions while improving unit heat rate and efficiency as well as improving the control on steam temperature taking into account that these units move load continuously.

Communities often become more sensitised and vocal about biosolids issues, once they experience odours emanating from a nearby site. Odour impacts from biosolids, including potential human health effects, have been targeted recently by many national and local newspapers, citizens' groups, and regulatory agencies, who have raised significant concerns, ranging from viable disposal methods/sites to outright bans. Many national and local regulatory agencies in the United States are considering biosolids disposal bans in their communities because of misinformation, poor science, and citizen pressure, but primarily because of odour impact concerns. The wastewater industry has a relatively poor understanding of the operations and treatment parameters that influence biosolids odour emissions. Thus, wastewater treatment plants are often unable to control the odour quality of the biosolids that are delivered into communities. A research study to demonstrate the influence of anaerobic digestion, mechanical dewatering, and storage design and operating parameters on the odour quality of the final product was performed and is the subject of this paper. Established and new sampling and analytical methods were used to measure biosolids odour emissions from 11 test sites in North America. By determining the impacts of these control variables on biosolids odour quality, design and operations of anaerobic digestion systems might be enhanced. This paper also summarises a corollary study performed as part of the WERF research study that addresses the health effects of biosolids odours. © WERF 2004.","Anaerobic digestion; Biosolids; Health effects; Odours; Wastewater; WWTP","Anaerobic digestion; Dewatering; Health; Odors; Wastewater; Biosolids; Odor quality; Water analysis; anaerobic process; Emission control; health hazard; odor; wastewater treatment plant; air pollution; analytic method; article; biosolid; community; controlled study; dewatering; health hazard; odor; quality control; research; sampling; United States; waste disposal; waste water; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644239168

These projects are The Guaraqueçaba Climate Action Project (7 thousand hectares), The Atlantic Rainforest Restoration Project (10 thousand hectares) and The Antonina Pilot Reforestation Project (one thousand hectares). The objectives of the projects are the forest restoration of degraded areas, enrichment of secondary forests, protection of forests (under deforestation risk), conservation of biodiversity, sustainable development and prodution of carbon credits. These projects are located in the EPA of Guaraqueçaba (Environmental Protection Area), coastal north portion of Parana state in south Brazil. The project activities have been divided in three groups: feasibility study, planning & development and execution phase. The LABSIG, Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems of SPVS, participated in all of these three phases. By the phase of planning & development, the definition of the line base in the work area - EPA of Guaraqueçaba - were launched, with a Multitemporal Study of the land use based on orbital images. The environment compartmentation of the area was executed, with the generation of the geoambiental map as subsidy to the planning of the projects. This work consisted in the delimitation of zones with similar characteristics from the overlapping of the subjects in a GIS (soil, geology, relief, climate, hydrography and hydrogeology). After the definition of the areas, photogrammetrics surveys in scale 1:30,000 and digital orthophotos in scale 1:10,000 have been done. During this phase agrarian surveys still have been made as subsidy to the prospection and acquisition of areas, as well as to the definitive mapping of the projects areas, with perimeters and memorials for agrarian regularization. As orientation to the prospection, the degraded areas were maped and quantified in the interest regions. In the phase of project execution, detailed environment surveys have been made for the handling of the reserve, as soil, geology and vegetation in scale 1:10,000. The next step, the forest restoration, was defined as a function of priority areas and attendance of matrices and plantation.","Application; Climate; GIS; Global; Photogrammetry","Applications; Biodiversity; Carbon; Conservation; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Geology; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Hydrology; Information systems; Land use; Photogrammetry; Planning; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Restoration; Surveys; Sustainable development; American electric power; Climate; Digital orthophotos; Feasibility studies; Forest restoration; Global; Project activities; Rainforest restorations; Shore protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957069128

Both organisms are native to South Africa, whilst the plant has also become naturalised in Australia where it is the target of a biological control program. E. osteospermi is under consideration as a biocontrol agent for this weed. Temperature and light requirements for aecidioid teliospore germination and basidiospore development were studied, as was the nuclear cycle during germination. Aecidioid teliospores germinated between 10 and 20°C, with 15°C as optimum temperature. Light, and particularly near-UV light, stimulated germination whereas germination was poor under dark conditions. A period of 6-8 h of light was the minimum needed to obtain germination levels equivalent to continuous light. The temperature requirements for basidiospore development differed from that for aecidioid teliospore germination. Optimal basidiospore production was at 15°C, but a rapid decrease occurred at higher temperatures, with few developing at 19°C, despite a high germination rate at this temperature. Two nuclear divisions occurred within 12 h of germination initiation to produce a metabasidium with three or four nuclei. A third nuclear division occurred in the basidiospores that then germinated between 24 and 48 h. Plants inoculated under controlled conditions took 5 to 24 months after inoculation for witches' broom symptoms to begin to develop. The detailed life cycle of E. osteospermi is presented. A Geographic Information System (GIS) approach was used to develop a model of the potential distribution of E. osteospermi in South Africa. This was based on monthly average climate surfaces with parameters derived from the above experiments. The parameters were modified so that the majority of all recorded localities of E. osteospermi in South Africa were included, whilst at the same time including only the minimum geographic area. The same model was applied to Australia to suggest a potential distribution of the rust fungus if released in Australia for the biological control of C. monilifera ssp. monilifera. This potential distribution was similar to one generated using the climate matching computer program CLIMEX, but gave greater spatial accuracy, at least in South Africa. Both approaches indicate that E. osteospermi should establish in temperate south-eastern Australia where C. monilifera ssp. monilifera is an invasive weed.","Biological weed control; Boneseed; Life cycle; Nuclear cycle","Asteraceae; Endophyllum; Fungi; Pucciniaceae; Uredinales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344298816

It has multiple dimensions, such as the triple bottom line - environmental, economic and social. And it also includes temporal (now and the future) and spatial (local and global) aspects that have to be taken into consideration to achieve true sustainability. Energy sustainability might be defined as - having the light turn on when you push the switch. It has, of course many more dimensions than this simplistic definition. Coal in Australia has an important role in keeping our lights on, but has its problems that need to be tackled head on to maintain a role in sustainable development. An overriding issue in terms of sustainability for coal is its major contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst we have one of the most effective energy sectors in the developed world, based on well-managed, abundant fossil fuels, our greenhouse gas emissions are one of the highest per GDP in the developed world. We have to reduce our 'greenhouse gas signature'. This paper explores the issues of coal utilisation greenhouse gas emissions as an indicator of the fuel's sustainability and the potential lower emissions pathways we will have to follow in a future carbon-constrained world. The technology changes will have significant implications for the minerals industry and it is argued that forward-looking coal/greenhouse emissions strategies need to be developed in alliance with the coal (and energy) sector for the minerals industry to maintain its global competitiveness.",,"Energy sustainability; Greenhouse gases; Infrastructure; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Mineral industry; Natural gas; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044273212

The two instruments' results are based on very different exposures of the Galaxy. While SPI is a coded aperture instrument with a massive BGO shield restricting its field of view (FoV) to ∼ 30°, RHESSI's unshielded Ge detectors observe the whole sky. SPI's 26Al measurement is based on pointed observations of the Galactic central region and background spectra from off-Galactic disk pointings; the RHESSI result is based on Earth occultation. RHESSI exposures cover a significantly larger sky area, specifically in Galactic latitude, compared to SPI's Galactic center deep exposure (GCDE). We check for systematic differences in measured fluxes from diffuse 26Al emission in both experiments by testing the impact of different sky exposures on the respective results. We find that RHESSI's choice of ""source"" and ""background"" regions is critical, as well as the treatment of off-instrument axis 26Al emission in SPI analysis.","26Al; INTEGRAL; Mapping; Nuclear line imaging; Nucleosynthesis; RHESSI; SPI","Aluminum; Earth (planet); Germanium; Image sensors; Imaging techniques; Mapping; Metal detectors; Radioisotopes; Satellites; Spectrometers; Synthesis (chemical); 26Al; INTEGRAL; Nuclear line imaging; Nucleosynthesis; Reuven Ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager (RHESSI); SPI; Galaxies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844480689

The principles behind IPTT may appear straightforward. But the interpretation of IPTT in complex reservoirs, such as carbonates presents many challenges, most of which are related to uncertainties arising from the heterogeneous nature of such reservoirs. A novel, generally applicable approach is proposed for interpretation of IPPT tests. The approach is integrated and efficient, and ensures that the most probably valid and/or valuable information is used and revealed by IPTT. The approach standardizes the complete interpretation procedure of IPTT in a heterogeneous reservoir, using if available, modern wireline logs (such as NMR and Imaging), dynamic data from wireline formation testers and any other relevant information (such as geological description, core data and local knowledge) as constraints on the interpretation. IPTT is also a multi-layer testing technique. An iterative method to define layering is incorporated in the approach to determine the most probable layering. Many types of possible information that can be used to constrain layering definition are classified. Principles and guidelines on using different sources of information to define and refine the layering are recommended. An advanced regression technology is used to get optimized horizontal and vertical permeabilities of reservoir layers. The key is to find as much useful information as possible to guide the regression. To this end, different sources of permeability are classified and used as initial estimates, for input to the regression. Practical skills to perform IPTT regression are also summarized. In many cases, the operating sequences of the formation tester are primarily designed for downhole sampling rather than IPTT. The complicated downhole sampling sequences can make the pressure responses of gauges complicated and noisy. Hence, a Quality Check (QC) procedure is also included into this integrated approach.

More stringent future exhaust emission standards require a better fuel quality and more effective emission control means in motor vehicles. The importance of measures to reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in the optimization of vehicle and powertrain concepts is also steadily growing. Securing a long-term supply of energy sources for the auto industry requires not only that existing fuel resources be utilized as economically as possible, but also that the energy sources used in fuel production be diversified in the medium and long term, including alternative and renewable resources in particular. Synthetic fuels can play a major role in this context in allowing a wide range of usable primary energy. High-quality, environmentally friendly synthetic diesel fuel produced from natural gases via GTL process is, e.g., sulfur and aromatics-free. In the second phase even biomass in many different forms can be used as primary energy for fuel production via a Bio-GTL process. Producing synthetic gas out of biomass and combining it with the Fischer-Tropsch process will create a CO 2 neutral energy source that reduces CO 2 emissions on a well-to-wheel base. If the problem on mobile hydrogen storage and infrastructure will be solved, fuel cell will not only supplement the modern-day internal combustion engine, but will supersede it as a means of vehicular propulsion.

The DPF used for the tests was made of SiC honeycomb which had a soot filtering efficiency close to 100%. The DPF/diesel engine system used was not configured for continuous regeneration. Regeneration was completed by batch heating with electric power. From the result of vehicle road test, the distance between regeneration for the vehicle fueled with biodiesel fuel was longer than that fueled with petro-diesel fuel. This gain in distance was greater than what was expected from the soot reduction because of the biodiesel fuel characteristics. This observation was further investigated in diesel engine bench rig with the DPF using several biodiesel fuels with different degree of purity. From the experimental results, it was found that there was a self-regeneration of the DPF enabled by the residual potassium methoxide as catalyst from biodiesel fuel. This catalyst was used in the transesterification in the fuel preparation process.

We propose two eXtreme UltraViolet (XUV) imagers to take global two-dimensional snapshots of near-Venus space, including the Venus ionosphere and the interaction region between the solar wind plasma and the Venus ionospheric plasma. The imagers detect the resonantly scattering emissions of oxygen ions (O II 83.4 nm) and atoms (O I 130.3 nm), neutral helium (He I 58.4 nm), and hydrogen (H Ly-α 121.6 nm). Scientific goals are to investigate mechanisms of momentum and mass transfer across the ionopause, of convection in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, and of atmospheric escape. Especially, we emphasize that sequential images of the O II 83.4-nm emission will enable us to understand temporal evolution of the vortex produced by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. Though the wave structure due to the K-H instability is generated also at the terrestrial magnetopause, oxygen ions are too tenuous to detect the emission. On the other hand, at the Venus ionopause oxygen ions have enough density to image the resonance emission, i.e., the Venus ionosphere plays a role as a space laboratory for plasma physics. © 2004 COSPAR.

For years, in the field of thermionic emission, a great deal of efforts have been devoted to search for low work function materials with high melting temperature, while the reduction of the local change in time of the work function rather than the work function itself has been the main issue of field emission researches. High brightness and long life are the central targets of the emission material researches for scientific instrument application, while high current density and low power consumption are the guiding principles for display application. In both cases, field emission has been dominating the applications recently. In all above cases the main issue in the future researches will be to analyze the work function in atomic level and thereby to understand the mechanism of the work function reduction by atom adsorption, the change in time of the local work function leading to the current fluctuation, and the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic work functions. Our attempt is discussed, where the work function in atomic level is measured by utilizing the STM technique and it is made clear how far the work function in atomic level extends its influence over the neighboring sites. As a result, a simple relationship is established between microscopic and macroscopic work functions. ©2004 IEEE.",,"Carbides; Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Cathodes; Current density; Electric currents; Electric fields; Heating; Lanthanum compounds; Melting; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Thermionic emission; Melting temperature; Power consumption; Richardson's equation; Work function; Electron emission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444392094

The traditional productivity simulations based on crop models are normally sitespecific. To simulate regional crop productivity, the spatial crop model is developed firstly in this study by integrating Geographical Information System (GIS) with Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The integration applies a loose coupling approach. Data are exchanged using the ASCII or binary data format between GIS and EPIC model without a common user interface. It is crucial for the simulation accuracy of the spatial EPIC model to get the detailed initial conditions (sowing date, initial soil water content, etc) and management information (irrigation schedule, fertilizer schedule, tillage schedule, etc). But when applied at a large scale, the initial conditions and management information are most unlikely obtained through direct measurement. Therefore, the spatial EPIC model is integrated secondly with the MODIS LAI product from the Earth Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center. The integration of the MODIS LAI product makes the real time information taken into account in the simulation of spatial EPIC model, such as the amount of solar radiation captured by plant canopies, soil-water or nutrient effects on crop growth, and the effects of natural or man-made disturbances caused to crop yield. Finally, the method is conducted to estimate the Winter Wheat yield in North China in the year of 2003.","Accuracy; Agriculture; Crop; Estimation; GIS; Integration; Model; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Estimation; Geographic information systems; Integration; Models; Productivity; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; User interfaces; Accuracy; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Irrigation schedule; Management information; Observation systems; Productivity simulation; Real-time information; Remotely sensed data; Data integration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951770164

In DISI (Direct Injection Spark Ignition) engines, VCT is applied in both stratified-charge and homogeneous charge operating modes. In stratified-charge mode, VCT is used to reduce NOx emission and improve combustion stability. In homogeneous charge mode, the function of VCT is similar to that in PFI engines. In DISI engine, however, the VCT also affects the available fuel-air mixing time. This paper focuses on VCT effects on the induction process and the fuel-air mixing homogeneity in a DISI engine. The detailed induction process with large exhaust-intake valve overlap has been investigated with CFD modeling. Seven characteristic sub-processes during the induction have been identified. The associated mechanism for each sub-process is also investigated. Based on the physics of the induction process, the experimentally observed effect of cam phasing on engine manifold pressure is well understood. Both optical engine experiments and CFD modeling showed that retarding the intake cam improves the fuel-air mixing homogeneity over a wide VCT range. Dynamometer engine testing confirms the improved mixing as the CO emission decreases as the intake cam retards. Modeling revealed that the mixing improvement is not due to the overall large-scale in-cylinder flow structure, but due to the local small flow structures.

The issues associated with stratified-charge (SC) operation are combustion stability, smoke emission, and NOx emission. The challenges at homogeneous-charge operation include fuel-air mixing homogeneity at partial load operation, smoke emission and mixing homogeneity at low speed WOT, and engine knock tendency reduction at medium speed WOT operations. In SC operation, the fuel consumption is constrained with the acceptable smoke emission level and stability limit. With the optimization of piston design and injector specification, the smoke emission can be reduced. Concurrently, the combustion stability window and fuel consumption can be also significantly improved. The optimized piston also helps to reduce NOx emission with local mixture enrichment around the spark-plug gap and improved internal residual amount tolerance. The study shows that one of the root causes of smoke emission at low speed WOT is liquid fuel impingement on the valve surface. The smoke emission level can be reduced with injector specification optimization. The mechanism by which split injection improves WOT performance is studied in detail. It is shown that at low speed WOT operation, the split injection improves the liquid spray distribution, thus improves the fuel-air mixing homogeneity and the engine output. At medium speed WOT operation, split injection does not have much effect on the mixing homogeneity, instead it improves the charge temperature distribution, thus reducing the knocking tendency.

The exhaust air was sampled and measured at the immediate exit of the combustor. It is found that NOx increased while CO decreased as increasing inlet air temperature and pressure. NOx decreased, but CO increased as increasing mass flow of inlet air. Equivalent ratio was maintained between 0.10 and 0.16 in the lean region. NOx increased along equivalent ratio, while CO decreased because of the influence of flame temperature.

Each HDV classification scheme has its own usefulness for their own propose; that is that the EPA scheme is for emissions modeling, the FHWA scheme is for highway traffic management, and the GT HDV visual classification scheme is for vehicle activity observation. In terms of emissions modeling, a hybrid HDV scheme such as the X-scheme is needed not only for easy vehicle observation, but also for highway perofmrance monitoring systems database development.

Correlations are often used to estimate the MMP where the injected fluid may or may not contain impurities such as methane. These correlations, however, are based on a limited set of experimental data and as such are not widely applicable. They also do not accurately account for the more complex condensing/vaporizing displacement process. This paper presents new MMP correlations for the displacement of multicomponent oil by CO2 and impure CO2. The approach is to use recently developed analytical theory for MMP calculations from equations-of-state (EOS) to generate MMP correlations for displacements by pure and impure CO2.1-8 The advantage of this approach is that MMPs for a wide range of temperatures and reservoir fluids can be calculated quickly and accurately without introducing uncertainties associated with slim-tube MMPs and other numerical methods. The improved MMP correlation is based solely on the reservoir temperature, molecular weight of C7+, and percentage of intermediates (C2 - C6) in the oil. The MMPs from the improved correlation are compared to currently used correlations and 41 experimentally measured MMPs. Correlations are also developed for impure CO2 floods, where the injection stream may contain up to 40% methane. The new correlations are significantly more accurate and applicable than currently used correlations. © 2004, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Floods; Methane; Numerical methods; Analytical theory; Condensing/vaporizing; Displacement process; Local displacement; Minimum miscibility pressure; New correlations; Reservoir fluid; Reservoir temperatures; Oil well flooding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055876707

As evidence of this perception, most review articles and book chapters devote little attention to the details of determination of the optical functions for carbon-based materials. It is ironic, however, that the same reviews provide ample evidence of useful correlations between the indices of refraction and deposition parameters and/or basic film characteristics. In fact, the complications in the optical characterization of carbon-based materials require greater attention. These complications arise from (1) the great diversity of carbon-based materials that can be prepared with relatively small changes in deposition conditions, in combination with (2) a number of nonidealities and inhomogeneities that may occur in such films including, for example, (i) high sp2 content top surface layers; (ii) graphite-like inclusions; and (iii) layered structures. Although steady progress has been made in the measurement and modeling of the optical properties of carbon-based thin films, such efforts have yet to make major impacts in this field of research. In this contribution, we discuss the current state of research on the optical characterization of carbon-based materials, and place it in perspective relative to the state-of-the-art optical characterization of thin films in general. With this aim, we provide a critical review of selected case studies of carbon-based materials that have been chosen as illustrative examples of the different optical characterization techniques available, the insights they provide, and the future directions suggested.","Carbon based materials; Ellipsometry; Optical function; Tetrahedral bonding; Transmission and reflection","Chemical bonds; Crystal structure; Deposition; Electron energy levels; Ellipsometry; Mathematical models; Optical properties; Reflection; Refraction; Spectroscopic analysis; Carbon based materials; Optical function; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Tetrahedral bonding; Transmittance; Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442265638

The review mainly concerns waves linked to electron dynamics. After a summary of the basics of radio and plasma wave modes as derived from the theory and from observations in the Earth's vicinity, we discuss the counterpart of these waves as observed in outer planets' magnetospheres. Plasma wave spectra display a remarkable overall similarity at all magnetized planets in spite of the very diverse magnetospheric configurations, emphasizing the importance of similar microphysics processes at all magnetized planets, in particular the outer giant planets. But the magnetospheres of the outer planets also give birth to a large diversity of radiosources, reflecting their complex structure (plasma reservoirs, gradients, regimes of f pe /f ce , etc.) and dynamics (locations and distributions of energetic electrons). We discuss in more details these radio components, including their generation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the direct generation of the very intense high latitude radio emissions, but conversion processes also occur in low latitude regions. The Earth stands as a reference in our comparative approach, but the study of radio and plasma waves at the outer planets allows to apply the concepts developed at Earth in different plasma environments, broadening the regime of plasma parameters involved in the generation of these waves. One specific Jovian radio component is identified (made of sporadic bursts), whose study could bring significant conceptual advances in the physics of the generation process involved. Finally, radio waves, because they can freely propagate far from their source regions, are of utmost importance as they allow for remote sensing of magnetospheric plasmas. © 2004 COSPAR.

It showed mutual relationships between sport and the four fields of knowledge: psychology, physiology, biomechanics and sociology. It is a well-known fact that a whole team of specialists co-operate with a sportsman and a coach: medical doctors, physiologists, dieticians and masseurs. The question, however, arises: what relationships should there be between them and according to what model should they act. The idea of social support seems to be useful in creating a model of supporting a sportsman. Four forms of social support were identified: emotional support, information support, instrumental support and increasing self-confidence. Bearing the above mentioned divison in mind, let us take into consideration the functioning of a team supporting both a sportsman and, indirectly, also a coach. Why a coach? While supervising the training of a sportsman the coach looks for information which would minimize the possibility of making a mistake [16]. In giving an athlete emotional support, the dominant role is, undoubtedly, that of a psychologist. A psychologist, involved both directly and indirectly, through the coach, can control the atmosphere in a team or in the relationship between the athlete and the coach. The situation is different in case of information support. If we assume that this kind of support is mainly based on giving information which would help in better understanding of the situation, then it turns out that this kind of support should be given both to the athlete and the coach. This kind of information can come from a physiologist, physician, psychologist (how to cope with a difficult situation) and a specialist in biomechanics. Another form of support is instrumental support, which is, among others, a kind of instruction, for example, how an athlete should behave during a long flight involving changes in time and climatic zones in order to minimize negative physical and mental effects. Instrumental support will again have interdisciplinary character; the advice may come form specialists in various fields of knowledge. The kind of support increasing self-confidence can be given to an athlete by the coach, but also by a physiologist, or a psychologist. The above mentioned facts stress the need to work out a system of support for athletes. Such systems were prepared for sport psychology in Australia before the Olympic Games in Sydney (Blecharz 2001). There is no doubt, however, that one uniform model should be worked out. In Poland an attempt at organizing such a team supporting an athlete has been made in case of Adam Malysz (world champion and vice-champion in Lahti 2002, twice world champion in Predazzo in 2003, winner of silver and bronze Olympic medals in Salt Lake City 2002, and three times World Cup winner). The team consists of two coaches, a psychologist (who, at the same time, takes care of the athlete's physical fitness) a physiologist, a physician and, occasionally, a specialist in biomechanics. In Polish sport we also have Robert Korzeniowski (three times winner of the Olympic gold medals in walking) an athlete who single-handedly can manage his own perfect preparation and support. The problem, therefore is worth undertaking and particular attention should be paid to synchronizing the activities of various members of the team supporting an athlete.","Coach; Sport psychologist; Sport results; Support for an athlete","article; athlete; biomechanics; emotion; human; information; psychologist; self concept; social support; sport; theoretical model; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242705645

Lead-zinc mine tailings can represent a source of toxic elements-Pb and Zn through mobilization into surface water, and then into downstream rivers. Previous studies have shown that migration of heavy metals can be mitigated by carbonate rock. This research investigates the characterization of heavy metals and sulphur isotope in a downstream river of the Shanshulin Pb-Zn mine, which is located in Guizhou province in China, a typical carbonate area in the world. A slight alkalinity (pH &gt; 8) of the river water is maintained owing to the carbonate rich country rocks. The results of this study show that heavy metals in water can be strongly adsorbed by suspended solids and therefore decrease more quickly than in sediments. Pb and Zn contents in water close to the waste pile are 6780 μg L-1 and 324 μg L-1 (Pb and Zn in water not affected by mine waste piles are only 3.71 μg L-1 and 11.6 μg L-1), respectively, meaning that the water is severely contaminated by the pile. Thirty kilometers downstream Pb and Zn contents in water drop quickly to 3.15 μg L-1 and 16.4 μg L-1. In contrast, Pb and Zn contents in sediment close to the waste pile are 4553 mg kg-1 and 7971 mg kg-1, respectively, and are still high 30 km downstream with measurements of 3334 mg kg-1 and 7268 mg kg-1, respectively (Pb and Zn contents in sediment not affected by mine waste piles are only 20 mg kg-1 and 120 mg kg-1). This indicates that the impact of tailings on the sediment can be much further than on water. In sediment, Pb exists mostly as carbonate and oxide fractions, Zn mostly as sulfide+organic fraction, and Cu mostly as sulfide+organic, residual and carbonate fractions. Sulphur characteristics indicate that sulphur in sediment originates from mine tailing, soil and suspended solids in other tributaries, whereas sulphur in water originates from mine tailing dissolution, spring water, rain water and dissolution of gypsum. In conclusion, the environmental impact of mine tailing can be indicated by heavy metals content, sulphur content and sulphur isotope of sediment. On the other hand, heavy metal content, sulphur content or sulphur isotope of water are possibly not good indicators for mine impact due to mitigation of carbonate rocks, sorption of heavy metals, as well as interference of gypsum layers.","Carbonate area; Heavy metals; Mine water; Sulphur isotope","Carbonates; Environmental impact; Heavy metals; Impurities; Isotopes; Mines; pH effects; Rain; Sediments; Sulfur; Surface waters; Water pollution; Carbonate rocks; Mine tailings; Spring water; Tailings; carbonic acid; copper; heavy metal; isotope; lead; sulfur; carbonate; heavy metal; mine drainage; sulfur; acid mine drainage; adsorption kinetics; alkalinity; article; dissolution; particle resuspension; pH measurement; sediment; sediment transport; soil analysis; water analysis; water contamination; water content; water sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944257973

Injecting this greenhouse gas also has environmental merits. Flue gas from power plants is a ready source of CO2; however extracting CO2 for enhanced oil recovery from such a source will increase project costs. Furthermore, to reduce both the net CO2 utilization and the cost of purchasing gas, it is usually necessary to recycle the produced CO2 with as little purification as possible. Therefore, understanding the roles of impurities in fluid phase behaviour and miscibility characteristics is necessary for designing a cost-effective CO2 enhanced oil recovery process. Laboratory studies of the effect of CO2 impurities on phase equilibrium and minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) were conducted on two Saskatchewan light oils covering a range of densities from 29.5°API to 38°API. The results indicate that the MMP for these light oils could increase unfavourably as the N2 and/or CH4 concentration increased in the CO2 stream. The MMP changes as the type and concentration of impurities in the injected CO2 stream change. However, coreflood tests showed that the near-miscible CO2 displacement might employ the same mechanisms as miscible CO2 flooding to mobilize and displace oil; thus, good oil recovery can be achieved in the vicinity of the MMP. While laboratory measurements are essential in the evaluation of a gas injection process, an equation of state (EOS) simulation was demonstrated to be a useful tool in analyzing the phase behaviour of various injection gases, reservoir fluids, and the gas-oil interactions. © 2004, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.",,"Air purification; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Equations of state of gases; Floods; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Oil well flooding; Operating costs; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Solubility; Carbon dioxide flooding; Enhanced oil recovery; Equation of state; Gas injection process; Laboratory measurements; Laboratory studies; Minimum miscibility pressure; Reservoir fluid; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055884321

This new engine features a number of state-of-The-art technologies designed to meet the US 2004 heavy-duty engine emission legislation and other requirements from the customers. A set of combustion development strategies was created. They were, the use of cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) to inhibit NOx formation, a centrally located nozzle and an optimized combustion bowl to improve fuel distribution and reduce soot formation, the use of increased injection pressure to enhance air/fuel mixing and increase soot oxidation rate, and a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) to provide sufficient air/fuel ratio over a broad speed range. The combustion development took full advantage of the ""virtual lab"" tools. For example, a three-dimensional CFD tool was used to optimize the EGR distribution, and a multi-dimensional code for chemically reactive flows with sprays, KIVA, is depended on heavily to screen the combustion bowl designs. These development strategies were proven to be very successful.

Their selection is determined by the efficiency and costs of the method. Biofiltration is a new technology to control environmental pollutants helping to regulate emissions of VOC with unpleasant odours in to the air and working environment. When VOC are to be removed from large volumes of air, equipment of biological purification charged with active sludge is used. Such an equipment has a rather simple structure and efficiency of to 98–99 %. Active sludge as a biocharge has both a high concentration of microorganisms compared to stationary charges and good sorption features. Sorptive capacity changes when a load to active sludge is changed, and this has a negative impact on biochemical decomposition of organic substances and, at the same time, on purification efficiency. Calculation and evaluation of an optimal working mode of the equipment enable to avoid desorption of VOC in the system or to diminish it to a minimal value. In the biological air-purification equipment sorption of an organic substance on the surface of active sludge is running at the initial stage. An organic substance is decomposed biologically only in the second stage, and oxygen dissolved in the system (in the charge) is used and VOC desorption from the system is blocked. One of the main parameters determining the biological air-purification process and its intensity is change of the concentration of oxygen dissolved (CDO) in water phase and maintenance of its minimal value after termination of aeration (when the equipment is out of operation for some time). In operating equipment with a biocharge one more important problem is encountered - the lifetime of the charge and its renewal in the equipment to maintain required concentration of the active sludge. The goal of the investigation is evaluation of purification efficiency of the equipment and the sorptive capacity of active sludge (depending on a load), selection of the working mode, uninterrupted biochemical decomposition of organic substances (based on the concentration of dissolved oxygen) when the charge is in its still state, and investigation of its biooxidating properties when a biofilter works with a biologically active charge and with an inactive charge having only sorptive properties. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Active sludge; Biological air purification; Concentration of dissolved oxygen (CDO); Organic substances; Sorption load; Volatile organic compound (VOC) desorption","Air purification; Costs; Decomposition; Desorption; Enzymes; Health risks; Microorganisms; Oxidation; Oxygen; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Water aeration; Active sludge; Biological air purification; Concentration of dissolved oxygen (CDO); Organic substances; Sorption load; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942624239

An alternative solution to standard electric spark is the use of pulsed laser, focused to create plasma, which will avoid the heat loss at the plug.

Following the shifting focus from the supply side to the demand side, the present paper introduces congestion charging as an efficient measure to improve urban mobility and reduce transport emissions through an adequate management of the available capacity. The theoretical foundation of the pricing mechanism involved and the relations with the EU transport and energy policy guidelines and directives are reviewed. Several trends are analysed in detail to support the need for an efficient and major policy as congestion charging, among them the following: the still growing EU urban population which is expected to make passenger transport demand grow until more than 40% above the 1990 levels, the estimations by the UK government of almost 90% of the road congestion costs due to urban traffic whilst only representing 20% of the total vehicles-km travelled, and finally, the 40 million people residing in EU cities suffering significant poor air quality. In the second part of the paper we review BESTUFS research on the state of implementation of this measure across EU member states, making clear that there exist currently different applications based on differing conceptual bases; demand management, revenue generation, emission control etc. The paper details the varied political and business controversy following the measure. Special attention is paid to the UK case, where the initial successful implementation of London Congestion Charging has led the government to consider a national charging strategy. Finally, conclusions about the need of a steady vision on the measure are reached, making clear that any money collected from the roads will have to be use for the benefit of road traffic in the urban environment and therefore for the cities as a whole.","Charging; Congestion; Economic; Emissions; Environment; Policy; Pricing; Traffic; Transportation; Urban",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644241773

The tool used during the training was ESPVI 4.0 computer model for Windows, developed over a number of years and upgraded for the needs of the project in Russia under the sponsorship of the EPA. Currently, the project team is finalizing assistance agreements with selected power plants in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Upgrade activities have already been initiated at selected TPPs as their in-kind contributions. This paper describes NIS TPPs and associated ESPs, results of computer simulations of their ESPs, recommended upgrades, and predicted PM emission reduction benefits resulting from implementation of these upgrades. The on-going ESP upgrade activities at two TPPs in Russia are also discussed in the paper.",,"Cleaning efficiency; Coal-fied thermal power plants; Computer model; Power industry; Air pollution; Coal fired boilers; Installation; Optimization; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Power plants; Project management; Throughput; Electrostatic separators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944389215

MACT rules, Title V permitting, and continuing uncertainty regarding routine repair and maintenance, may increase the need for VOC testing to determine applicability and permitting requirements. Future regional policy efforts to achieve attainment of the 8-hour ozone standard and address PM2.5 will result in additional emission reduction measures targeting VOC/s. An evolving policy discussion highlights potential issues around the definition of VOC and the application of the available published test methods. Further complexity arises from EPA efforts focused around other testing approaches such as the Midwest Scaling Protocol.
