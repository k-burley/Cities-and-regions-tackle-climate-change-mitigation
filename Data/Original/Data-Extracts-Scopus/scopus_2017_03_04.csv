We show that the unprecedented haze event is due to the extremely poor ventilation conditions, which had not been seen in the preceding three decades. Statistical analysis suggests that the extremely poor ventilation conditions are linked to Arctic sea ice loss in the preceding autumn and extensive boreal snowfall in the earlier winter. We identify the regional circulation mode that leads to extremely poor ventilation over the ECP region. Climate model simulations indicate that boreal cryospheric forcing enhances the regional circulation mode of poor ventilation in the ECP region and provides conducive conditions for extreme haze such as that of 2013. Consequently, extreme haze events in winter will likely occur at a higher frequency in China as a result of the changing boreal cryosphere, posing difficult challenges for winter haze mitigation but providing a strong incentive for greenhouse gas emission reduction. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"Climate models; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sea ice; Snow; Arctic sea ice; Climate model simulations; Cryosphere; East China; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Haze pollutions; Higher frequencies; Regional circulation; Ventilation; Arctic; article; autumn; carbon footprint; China; climate change; haze; sea ice; simulation; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018299638

The aim for development for these NG engines is to realize fuel cost savings and increase operating range while reduce harmful emissions and maintaining durability. Traditionally, port-fuel injection (PFI) or premixed NG spark-ignited (SI) combustion systems have been used for light duty LD, and MD engines with widespread use in the US and Europe [1]. However, this technology exhibits poor thermal efficiency and is load limited due to knock phenomenon that has prohibited its use for HD engines. Spark Ignited Direct Injection (SIDI) can be used to create a partially stratified combustion (PSC) mixture of NG and air during the compression stroke. PSC promises to deliver improved thermal efficiency by avoiding excessive premixing and extending the lean limits which helps to extend the knock and load limit. In this work, a CAT 3401 SCOTE single cylinder engine with 14:1 compression ratio (CR) was used to investigate SIDI NG combustion using an integrated spark injector-igniter. The injector nozzle included angle (NIA) was varied from 80 degrees to 150 degrees to determine the impact on fuel consumption, combustion stability, phasing, and emissions. Start of injection (SOI) and spark ignition (SPK) timings were determined from previous work for a near stoichiometric operation (AFR 16 to 20:1). The nozzle included angle of 100 degrees resulted in up to 43% indicated thermal efficiency across a part-load operating range 3 to 11 bar and provided the best trade-off between fuel economy, emissions and combustion stability. This work demonstrated the optimization potential of a 100 degree NIA for high thermal efficiency of a heavy duty engine over the low load operating conditions.

I find that increasing the downstream flow of sediments retained in upstream dams is a crucial measure for dealing with climate change threats (sea-level rise) in the Delta. Yet, state policies do not increase sediment flow, but instead implement incremental adaptation at the site of climate impact (coast), which, at times, requires executing small-scale land expropriations. Refraining from improving human security via increasing sediment flow benefits corporate interests upstream. At the same time, expropriation silences mild farmer protest downstream and adds insult to injury by conveying to farmers a sense of blame for their vulnerability to climate change. Meanwhile, using expropriation at the service of incremental adaptation goes against the very rationale of expropriation established by Spanish legislation and creates a fundamental contradiction between what the practice is meant to deliver, namely security and the social contract from the part of the state, and what it actually does, i.e. permit the state to evade providing human security. I conclude that, under climate change, achieving human security, the delivery of the social contract, and corporate rent-seeking at the same time may not be possible. Moreover, rather than the social contract been threatened by state incapacity to respond to the effects of climate change and breached social contract expectations of vulnerable communities, it is the actual mobilisation of the contract in order to respond to climate change that diminishes human security. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate-security nexus; Ebro Delta; Farmland expropriation; Human security; Social contract","adaptive management; agricultural land; climate change; coastal zone management; sea level change; sediment transport; Catalonia; Ebro Delta; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010831249

Efforts of the shipbuilding industry to reduce the toxicity of exhaust gas emitted by the main engines have been indicated and pointed to the desirability of the use of these catalysts in maritime transport. It has been pointed out that studies of the harmful substances in exhaust gases performer at vehicle inspection stations have an impact on increasing the safety of drivers and other road users and contribute to preserving the natural environment by reducing the danger coming from cars operating on Polish roads. An opinion has been expressed that the most serious threats to the environment are emitted by car transport exhaust fumes, which are characterized by significant emission of toxic compounds excreted into the atmosphere from tailpipe emissions. It has been demonstrated that a fully functioning catalytic reactor, operating in a steady state at appropriate temperatures and the composition of the mixture close to stoichiometric ratio, can reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides by more than 90%. Also, an assessment has been presented reporting the efficiency of catalytic reactors of spark ignition engines operating in a test vehicle inspection station. The results of research in the evaluation of their performance were correlated with their operation waveforms. Such an approach is justified by the fact that during the operation of each vehicle the wear of its assemblies and components is different - including the catalytic reactor. The catalytic layer undergoes aging so that there are changes in the structure and chemical composition of the catalyst bed, while the overlapping of layers of different chemical compounds that block access to the active layer of the reactor. An opinion has also been expressed that it would be advisable to take steps to use research results presented in this article for research of catalytic reactors similar use in diagnostic systems of marine combustion engines, especially the main ones, which exhaust emissions are incomparably greater than in the case of car engines. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","catalytic reactor; harmful compounds; ship engine; the catalytic reactor efficiency","Automobile engines; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Chemical compounds; Combustion; Crashworthiness; Efficiency; Engines; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Gases; Marine engines; Nitrogen oxides; Shipbuilding; Ships; Vehicles; Catalytic reactor; Chemical compositions; Harmful compounds; Maritime transport; Natural environments; Shipbuilding industry; Stoichiometric ratio; Vehicle inspections; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017623150

Our econometric analysis implies that political orientation in the USA is by far more relevant for general climate change beliefs and beliefs in anthropogenic climate change than in Germany and China. Furthermore, US and German citizens with a conservative, but not green identification significantly less often support publicly financed climate policy, while US and German respondents with a social–green identification and Chinese respondents belonging to the Communist Party have a significantly higher willingness to pay a price premium for climate-friendly products. However, our econometric analysis overall reveals that environmental values, which are measured by a New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, are the major factors for climate change beliefs and attitudes in all three countries and thus play an even more dominant role than political orientation. In addition, environmental values weaken the differences in several climate change beliefs and attitudes between a right-wing and a left-wing identification. These interaction effects between political orientation and the NEP scale are especially strong in the USA, only relevant for the support of publicly financed climate policy in Germany, and negligible in China. Our estimation results suggest alternative strategies such as specific communication campaigns in order to reduce the climate change skepticism in conservative and right-wing circles in the USA and to increase the support of climate policies among such population groups. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change beliefs; Climate policy; Econometric analysis; Environmental values; NEP scale; Political orientation; Price premium for climate-friendly products","Social sciences; Value engineering; Climate policy; Econometric analysis; Environmental values; NEP scale; Political orientation; Price premiums; Climate change; climate change; econometrics; empirical analysis; environmental policy; environmental politics; environmental values; China; Germany; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013850915

Such transition has been resulted in changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, though it is rarely studied, especially in the pastoral area of China. Aimed to address this question, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau we selected Chanaihai village as the pastoralism system, and Guinan Grassland Development Limited Company as the combination of extensive and intensive livestock husbandry system, to compare the GHG emission between the two systems using life cycle assessment method. Our results showed that the GHG emission intensity both in per unit of area and per unit of carcass weight in the combined extensive/intensive livestock husbandry were higher than the pastoralism, indicating that the shift into the combined extensive/intensive livestock husbandry system increased the GHG emission. Such results could be attributed to the lower soil carbon uptake and higher GHG emission derived from the external inputs such as seed, diesel, and electricity in the combined extensive/intensive system. These findings demonstrated that the ongoing transition in the pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may be inappropriate under the background of global GHG mitigation. As suggestions, we argued that reduction in the manure combustion and increase in soil carbon uptake could be effective measures to reduce the GHG emission intensity of livestock husbandry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Combined extensive/intensive system; GHG emission intensity; Life cycle assessment; Pastoralism; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Combined extensive/intensive system; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pastoralism; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013676638

This study used site-level observations of carbon, water, and energy fluxes of biofuel crops to parameterize and evaluate the community land model (CLM) and estimate CO2 fluxes, surface energy balance, soil carbon dynamics of corn (Zea mays), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) ecosystems across the conterminous United States considering different agricultural management practices and land-use scenarios. We find that neglecting biophysical effects underestimates the CWMP of transitioning from croplands and marginal lands to energy crops. Biogeochemical effects alone result in changes in carbon storage of −1.9, 49.1, and 69.3 g C m−2 y−1 compared to 20.5, 78.5, and 96.2 g C m−2 y−1 when considering both biophysical and biogeochemical effects for corn, switchgrass, and miscanthus, respectively. The biophysical contribution to CWMP is dominated by changes in latent heat fluxes. Using the model to optimize growth conditions through fertilization and irrigation increases the CWMP further to 79.6, 98.3, and 118.8 g C m−2 y−1, respectively, representing the upper threshold for CWMP. Results also show that the CWMP over marginal lands is lower than that over croplands.

However, long-term ecological consequences of anthropogenic forest plantations on the community structure and diversity of soil microorganisms and the underlying mechanisms in determining these patterns are poorly understood. In this study, we selected 78-year-old tree plantations that included three coniferous tree species (i.e. slash pine, hoop pine and kauri pine) and a eucalypt species in subtropical Australia. We investigated the patterns of community structure, and the diversity of soil bacteria and eukaryotes by using highthroughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. We also measured the potential methane oxidation capacity under different tree species. The results showed that slash pine and Eucalyptus significantly increased the dominant taxa of bacterial Acidobacteria and the dominant taxa of eukaryotic Ascomycota, and formed clusters of soil bacterial and eukaryotic communities, which were clearly different from the clusters under hoop pine and kauri pine. Soil pH and nutrient quality indicators such as C : Nitrogen (N) and extractable organic C: Extractable organic N were key factors in determining the patterns of soil bacterial and eukaryotic communities between the different tree species treatments. Slash pine and Eucalyptus had significantly lower soil bacterial and eukaryotic operational taxonomical unit numbers and lower diversity indices than kauri pine and hoop pine. A key factor limitation hypothesis was introduced, which gives a reasonable explanation for lower diversity indices under slash pine and Eucalyptus. In addition, slash pine and Eucalyptus had a higher soil methane oxidation capacity than the other tree species. These results suggest that significant changes in soil microbial communities may occur in response to chronic disturbance by tree plantations, and highlight the importance of soil pH and physiochemical characteristics in microbially mediated ecological processes in forested soils. © 2017 Author(s).",,"biodiversity; coniferous tree; methane; microbial community; nutritional status; oxidation; pH; plantation; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; Australia; Acidobacteria; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Coniferales; Eucalyptus; Eukaryota; Pinus elliottii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018633448

The rationality of the regional allocation has become an important consideration for the government in ensuring stable growth in different regions that are experiencing disparity in resource endowment and economic status. Based on constructing the quota allocation indicator system for carbon emission, the emission quota for each province in different scenarios and schemes in 2020 is simulated by the multifactor hybrid weighted Shannon entropy allocation model. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The top 5 secondary-level indicators that influence provincial quota allocation in weight are as follows: per capita energy consumption, openness, per capita carbon emission, per capita disposable income, and energy intensity. (2) The ratio of carbon emission in 2020 is different from that in 2013 in many scenarios, and the variation is scenario 2 > scenario 1 > scenario 3, with Hubei and Guangdong the provinces with the largest increase and decrease ratios, respectively. (3) In the same scenario, the quota allocation varies in different reduction criteria emphases; if the government emphasizes reduction efficiency, scheme 1 will show obvious adjustment, that is, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Yunnan will have the largest decrease. The amounts are 4.28, 8.31, 4.04, and 5.97 million tons, respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon emission allocation; Indicator system; Provinces; Scenario classification","carbon emission; economic activity; environmental economics; environmental indicator; global warming; government; market conditions; rationalization; resource allocation; resource use; scenario analysis; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon; chemistry; China; economic development; economics; environmental policy; socioeconomics; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Carbon; China; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Models, Statistical; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009469056

However, the comprehensive understanding of structure-property relationships needed to design improved tungsten cathodes with larger thermionic emission is still lacking. In this study, composition-structure-property relationships governing thermionic emission from W-Os alloys were investigated using quantum mechanical calculations. Low-energy W-Os atomic configurations at various compositions were determined from first-principles calculations based on density functional theory in combination with cluster expansion calculations. Electronic properties were investigated in terms of the electron density of states. The relative position of the Fermi level with respect to peaks and pseudogaps in the density of states for different W-Os structures can be used to explain, at least in part, observed variations in thermionic emission from Os-coated tungsten dispenser cathodes. © 2017 American Vacuum Society.",,"Calculations; Carrier concentration; Dispensers; Electron density measurement; Electronic density of states; Electronic properties; Osmium alloys; Quantum theory; Structural properties; Thermionic cathodes; Thermionic emission; Atomic configuration; Cath-ode materials; Composition structure; Dispenser cathodes; First-principles calculation; Quantum-mechanical calculation; Relative positions; Structure property relationships; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008949765

In this study, granulated biochar (1.2-2 mm) and powdered biochar (&lt;0.15 mm) were amended to two ferrihydrite (in situ ferrihydrite and ex situ ferrihydrite) enrichments to investigate the effect of biochar with different particle sizes on dissimilatory iron(III)-reducing bacteria (DIRB) and methanogens. Biochar addition significantly stimulated the reduction of both in situ ferrihydrite and ex situ ferrihydrite and the production of methane. Powdered biochar amendments increased iron reduction compared to granulated biochar amendment in both the in situ ferrihydrite and ex situ ferrihydrite enrichments. However, no significant difference was observed in methane production between the powdered biochar and granulated biochar amendments in the two ferrihydrite enrichments. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that both DIRB and methanogens were enriched after biochar amendments in the in situ ferrihydrite and ex situ ferrihydrite enrichments. Taxa belonging to the Geobacteraceae and methanogenic genus affiliated to Methanosarcina were detected with significantly higher relative abundances in powdered biochar amendments than those in granulated biochar amendments in both the ferrihydrite enrichments. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated green rust [Fe2(CO3) (OH)] and vivianite [Fe3(PO4)2 8(H2O)] formed in the ex situ ferrihydrite and in situ ferrihydrite enrichments without biochar addition, respectively. After granulated biochar amendment, the mineral phase changed from the green rust to vivianite in the ex situ ferrihydrite enrichment, while crystalline vivianite and iron oxide (γ-Fe2O3) were detected simultaneously in the in situ ferrihydrite enrichment. No crystalline iron compound was found in the powdered biochar amendments in both ferrihydrite enrichments.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of converting croplands to long-term hybrid poplar (Populus × euramericana cv. I-72) plantations for 10, 15 and 20 years on soil bacterial and fungal communities and on their relationships with soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization. Overall, the results indicated that the long-term hybrid poplar plantations increased soil pH, SOC, total N and moisture contents and decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4 + and NO3 − contents compared to that on the cropland. There were lower cumulative amounts of CO2 respired and SOC mineralization rates in the hybrid poplar plantation soils compared to that of the cropland. The hybrid poplar plantation with 20 years caused a greater fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene copy number and a lower bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number and dehydrogenase and β-glucosidase activities compared to that in the cropland soils. As indicated by Illumina MiSeq sequencing, the establishment of hybrid poplar plantations harbored distinct soil bacterial and fungal communities, which were strongly correlated with specific soil properties. We further found that the SOC mineralization rate was positively correlated to the bacterial abundance and the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas negatively correlated to the fungal abundance. This study suggested that the long-term hybrid poplar plantation reduced SOC mineralization, causing changes in habitats that favor fungal community growth and shifts in bacterial community composition to more facultative and/or obligate anaerobes and less microbes that are capable of decomposing recalcitrant carbon, which may help enhance SOC accumulation in soil and mitigate climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Afforestation; Hybrid poplar plantation; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; Microbial community; SOC mineralization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007480750

The relatively high percentage of hexagon and the regular arrangement of the polygons make it energetically more favorable than most of other predicted 2D carbon allotropes. Phonon dispersions without negative frequencies also indicate its stability. Electronic structure calculations show that its metallic nature is mainly due to the atoms shared by the pentagon, hexagon and octagon. Its lattice thermal conductivity is only about one fifth of that of graphene. Armchair- and zigzag-edged nanoribbons of this structure are also studied.

The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method is employed to explore the drivers of the carbon footprint of Guangdong's crop production system from 1993 to 2013. The results indicated the following: (1) increased crop production output is not always positively correlated with an increased carbon footprint; (2) weak decoupling is the main tendency between carbon footprint and crop production; (3) the decoupling stability coefficients show that the threat of high-carbon-emission crop production does exist; and (4) the agricultural economy level is the determining factor for the growth of the carbon footprint in crop production, but agricultural investment, urbanization and technical progress contribute to the reduction of the carbon footprint in Guangdong Province.

The proportions of tetra- to hexa-chlorinated dibenzofurans (∑Cl4–6CDFs) at the kiln back-end areas were in the range of 50–80% of the total PCDD/Fs in mass concentrations and 62–87% in toxic equivalent concentrations. These results indicated that ∑Cl4–6CDFs are the dominant homologs that should be the focus for reducing PCDD/F emissions in cement kilns that co-incinerate municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. It is speculated that the low contents of oxygen and copper compounds, as well as the alkaline conditions, may contribute to the dominance of ∑Cl4–6CDFs in the PCDD/Fs formed. Chlorination was assumed to be the mechanism of formation of PCDFs. The results from model predictions and thermodynamic calculations used to test this assumption were consistent with the PCDF profiles observed from the field study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cement kiln; Co-incineration; Municipal sewage sludge; Municipal solid waste; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; Polychlorinated dibenzofurans","Air pollution control; Brickmaking; Cements; Chlorine compounds; Incineration; Kilns; Organic pollutants; Sewage sludge; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Cement kiln; Co-incineration; Municipal sewage sludge; Polychlorinated dibenzo- p - dioxins; Polychlorinated dibenzofurans; Municipal solid waste; cement; cement kiln; copper; oxygen; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; unclassified drug; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; sewage; solid waste; cement; chlorination; concentration (composition); formation mechanism; incineration; municipal solid waste; PCDD; PCDF; sewage; theoretical study; thermodynamics; Article; cement industry; chlorination; concentration (parameters); controlled study; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; municipal solid waste; particulate matter; sludge treatment; thermodynamics; building material; chemical model; chemistry; devices; equipment design; incineration; procedures; sewage; solid waste; Construction Materials; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; Equipment Design; Incineration; Models, Chemical; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Sewage; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008195294

In this regard, this paper reviews the existing literature on the relationship between urban development, local health and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Some findings suggest that patterns of urban development could promote urban sustainability in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions, for example, high-density development or compact urban form, which reduces vehicle kilometres travelled and thus reduce GHG emissions. However, it has also been found that these types of urban development might also cause health problems for local residents related to factors such as overcrowding, less green space for outdoor activities, a local heat island effect, high exposure to traffic and air pollution, and psychological stress. This local health paradox related to environmentally sustainable development is also deeply connected to equity issues, including environmental justice, health equity and the related spatial inequities. For future research, the paper proposes a new conceptual framework of the ‘glocal environmentally sustainable city’, addressing a balance between local health and global environmental sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"atmospheric pollution; conceptual framework; emission control; environmental justice; equity; greenhouse gas; greenspace; health status; heat island; literature review; sustainability; sustainable development; traffic emission; urban area; urban development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018525011

Here, we conducted synchronous measurements of submicron aerosols (PM1/ at ground level and 260m on a meteorological tower by using a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor, respectively, in Beijing from 22 August to 30 September. Our results showed that the average PM1 concentrations are 19.3 and 14.8 μgm-3 at ground level and 260 m, respectively, during the control period (20 August-3 September), which are 57 and 50% lower than those after the control period (4-30 September). Organic aerosols (OAs) dominated PM1 during the control period at both ground level and 260m (55 and 53 %, respectively), while their contribution showed substantial decreases (∼40 %) associated with an increase in secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) after the parade, indicating a larger impact of emission controls on SIA than OA. Positive matrix factorization of OA further illustrated that primary OA (POA) showed similar decreases as secondary OA (SOA) at both ground level (40% vs. 42 %) and 260m (35% vs. 36 %). However, we also observed significant changes in SOA composition at ground level. While the more oxidized SOA showed a large decrease by 75 %, the less oxidized SOA was comparable during (5.6 μgm-3/ and after the control periods (6.5 μgm-3/. Our results demonstrated that the changes in meteorological conditions and PM loadings have affected SOA formation mechanisms, and the photochemical production of fresh SOA was more important during the control period. By isolating the influences of meteorological conditions and footprint regions in polluted episodes, we found that regional emission controls on average reduced PM levels by 44-45 %, and the reductions were close among SIA, SOA and POA at 260 m, whereas primary species showed relatively more reductions (55-67 %) than secondary aerosol species (33-44 %) at ground level. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; formation mechanism; particulate matter; photochemistry; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014734172

Increasingly strict regulations of vehicle emission have been introduced and efforts have been put on both the suppression of particulate formation inside the engine cylinders and the development of after-treatment technologies such as filters. With modern direct injected engines that produce a large number of really small sub-micron particles, the focus has increased even further and now also includes a number count. The problem of calculating particle trajectories in flow ducts like vehicle exhaust systems is challenging but important to further improve the technology. The interaction between particles and oscillating flows may lead to the formation of particle groups (regions where the particle concentration is increased), yielding a possibility of realizing particle agglomeration. The oscillating flow may simply be hydrodynamic or as assumed here: the flow oscillations are created by sound propagation rather than hydrodynamic approaches. An analysis is presented which gives the relationship between the speed of sound, the mean flow velocity and the amplitude of the acoustic particle velocity for particle agglomeration to be feasible. It is shown that it can be achieved if the convective speed of sound is reduced to the same order as the mean flow velocity. It is therefore suggested to use the so-called acoustic metamaterials, which can help control, direct and manipulate sound waves. At this stage a phenomenological 1D model is used for the analysis, which allows the authors to build an understanding of the effect of the sound waves and flow oscillations on particle motion and paves the way for further analysis on particle agglomeration. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic wave velocity; Agglomeration; Automobile engines; Engine cylinders; Flow velocity; Hydrodynamics; Metamaterials; Particles (particulate matter); Velocity control; Acoustic metamaterials; Acoustic particle velocity; After-treatment technology; Exhaust particulate matter; Particle agglomerations; Particle concentrations; Particle trajectories; Particulate formation; Oscillating flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018319516

After slow development, Chinese strawberry production and breeding began to develop faster in the 1980s. ISS2012 provided a new opportunity to Chinese breeders. Nearly 20 public institutions and private companies are engaged in strawberry breeding. They are trying to select better new cultivars to replace the present popular ones. Sweet taste and intense aroma as well as high yield and strong resistance to diseases are the main traits selected in Chinese strawberry breeding programs. According to local climate and the trend of local strawberry industry in different regions, breeders prefer to develop June-bearing cultivar or/and everbearer. Amongst the Chinese cultivars released in recent years, 'Jingzangxiang', 'Jingtaoxiang', 'Pink Princess', 'Yanli', 'Ningyu', 'Yuexin', 'Shimei 7'and 'Sigongzhu' are becoming popular.","Ananassa; Breeding; China; Fragaria ×; Status",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019906249

Meanwhile, the development of after-treatment technologies for the diesel engine brings new insight concerning emissions especially the particulate matter pollutants. In order to study the coupling effects of biodiesel blend and CCRT (Catalyzed Continuously Regeneration Trap) on the particulate matter emissions, the particulate matter emissions from an urban bus with and without CCRT burning BD0 and BD10 respectively was tested and analyzed using electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI). The operation conditions included steady state conditions and transient conditions. Results showed that the particulate number-size distribution of BD10 and BD0 both had two peaks in nuclei mode and accumulation mode at the conditions of idle, low speed and medium speed while at high speed condition the particulate number-size distribution only had one peak. In addition, under steady state condition, the average PN (particulate number) emission rate decreased approximately 17.8% and average PM (particulate mass) emission rate decreased about 26.3% after the bus was fuelled with BD10. While under transient condition, PN and PM average emission rates of BD10 were less than that of BD0 by about 20.0% and 17.9% respectively. When the bus was equipped with CCRT, its tail-pipe PN concentration decreased substantially both for BD0 and BD10 and the peaks in accumulation mode disappeared. Meanwhile, PN and PM average emission rates decreased more than 94.0% for BD10 and BD0 under both steady and transient conditions and the filtration efficiency was slightly higher for BD10.

The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001–2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003–2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year− 1; P &lt; 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-C5 (− 0.14% year− 1, P &lt; 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-C5 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua-C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aqua; Browning; Collection 5 & 6; Greening; MODIS; Terra; Vegetation indices","Carbon; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Aqua; Browning; Greening; MODIS; Terra; Vegetation index; Vegetation; Aqua (satellite); biogeochemistry; global change; MODIS; NDVI; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics; vegetation type",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010281688

China is now ranked first in terms of NEV adoption. Policies are the main driving force. This paper aims to uncover how policies systematically link together to provide support, direct rapid development, regulate various players to cope with the challenges, and achieve an impressive progress in NEV adoption in China. We propose a policy dependency mapping method which enables us to analyze 175 NEV policies from national, Jing-Jin-Ji regional, Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei from January 2006 to April 2016, with adoption targets projected from 2016 to 2020. Our research reveals that the NEV policies constitute complex policy systems involving governments at various levels with multiple purposes. The national policies direct local policies and depend upon local policies to implement and meet the decomposed targets, whereas regional policies horizontally coordinate the provincial governments and solve issues across provincial boundaries. Local policies play a key role in implementing the national and regional policies and address different local challenges (such as traffic congestion and local economy development). The NEV policy systems are dynamic, and NEV adoption in local areas is uneven. The public sector is the first breakthrough to promote NEV adoption, followed by a demonstration in the private sector. Beijing takes the lead in terms of both EV adoption and policymaking. Challenges in local protectionism, technology advancement with subsidies phasing out, and subsidies fraud are discussed. These findings help both policy makers and NEV players to understand the NEV development roadmap and create better strategies to promote NEVs in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Market adoption; New energy vehicle; Path dependence; Policy system; Subsidy","Automotive industry; Electric vehicles; International trade; Petroleum transportation; Public policy; Traffic congestion; Market adoption; New energy vehicles; Path dependence; Policy systems; Subsidy; Vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997285692

Addition of TiO2 (A) significantly improved not only visible light absorption of doped TiO2 (A/R, TiO2 (A)), but also the efficiency of photo-excited charges separations due to the existence of interfacial regions of anatase-rutile TiO2 junctions.

Reducing GHG emissions is essential to mitigate the threat of global warming. Household carbon (dioxide) emissions have been recognized as one of the most important contributors to climate change, with a significant impact on both the local and global environment, and various policy instruments have been implemented by governments to bring about the reduction. This paper reviews these carbon abatement policy measures from demand-side and supply-side perspectives based on 144 countries across the world. The advantages and disadvantages of the policies are analyzed and it is found that income level largely affects the choice of policy, with high-income countries being mostly associated with demand-side policy instruments. Low-income countries adopt less demand-side policy measures and mainly depend on supply-side polices such as targets and regulations. Geographic location is also an important factor influencing the choice of policy instruments due to the different climates between different regions, although targets, regulations and carbon taxes are dominant GHG reduction policy measures worldwide. In America, tendering and net metering are popular, while in Europe feed-in-tariff (FIT) policies are implemented for more than 70% of the time. In Asia, policy measures, whether supply-side or demand-side, are comparatively weakly implemented and influenced by location, urbanization and economic growth. This paper suggests that, although the economic level is different, low-income countries and particularly developing countries can promote carbon abatement as well as the financial market by gradually changing from supply-side policy instruments to demand-side policies. This critical review provides a systematic understanding of various carbon emission policies in different countries and regions worldwide, which will provide significant assistance for the development of policies to reduce household carbon emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-supply; Energy policy; Household carbon emission","Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy policy; Global warming; Carbon abatement; Carbon emissions; Demand supplies; Economic development; Geographic location; Global environment; Low income countries; Policy instruments; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; demand analysis; developing world; emission control; energy policy; financial market; policy analysis; pollution policy; pollution tax; Asia; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006049092

After crystallization, the doping ions are found to be selectively incorporated into the precipitated oxyapatite crystals on La3+ sites, contributing to the remarkably enhanced visible emission of Eu3+ under 394 nm excitation.

Results show that land finance and land urbanization significantly affect carbon emissions. The rate of land urbanization contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, it has less impact compared with other determinants. The effect of land finance and land urbanization on carbon emissions indicates that a local government's willingness to lease land for revenue aggravates carbon emissions. Economic growth and industrial structure also influence carbon emissions. Furthermore, the land requisition system and rural land conversion market should be enhanced through the guidance provided by the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020) to promote the diversification of land transfer, fully consider regional differences, and establish a distinct policy focus that can contribute to emission reduction and land use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Land finance; Land urbanization; Land use; STIRPAT; Urban development","carbon emission; emission control; finance; land market; land use; local government; panel data; urban development; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013421250

A number of cities in developing countries have used license plate-based driving restrictions as a policy for reducing urban air pollution and traffic congestion. This paper develops a theoretical model of the effects of license plate-based driving restrictions on air quality that combines an economic model with information about the sources and atmospheric chemistry of different air pollutants. We then draw upon suggestive empirical evidence from license plate-based driving restrictions implemented in Bogotá, Colombia. Consistent with our theory model, we find suggestive empirical evidence that under certain circumstances, due to substitution, the purchase of a second car, the use of alternative modes of transportation, and/or atmospheric chemistry, it is possible for license plate-based driving restrictions to increase air pollution. Also consistent with our theory, we find that license plate-based driving restrictions may have different effects on different air pollutants, reflecting heterogeneity in the sources and atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants. In particular, owing to atmospheric chemistry, it is possible for a license plate-based driving restriction to cause a significant decrease in NO and a significant increase in NO2, NOx, and O3. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality; Driving restriction","Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Developing countries; Pollution; Purchasing; Traffic congestion; Air pollutants; Colombia; Different effects; Driving restrictions; Economic modeling; Theoretical modeling; Theory model; Urban air pollution; License plates (automobile); air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution policy; theoretical study; traffic congestion; traffic management; Bogota; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006365151

However, they emit more hazardous pollutants than gasoline engines, especially particulate emissions, which have negative impacts on human's health and air quality in cities. In order to meet future increasingly stringent regulations for particulate emissions, exhaust gas aftertreatment technologies for diesel engines are essential. Particulate emissions from a heavy-duty diesel engine which meets the China national V emission regulation were studied, and the engine was equipped with/without diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The fuel used in this article is ultra low sulfur diesel fuel whose sulfur content is less than 10 ppm. A TSI 3090 Engine Exhaust Particulate Sizer was used to study the number and size distribution of particulate emissions. Results show that with the increase of engine load, the total number of particulate emissions increases, and especially under high engine load, the increase of total particulate number is drastic in consequence of the deterioration of combustion in the cylinder. Compared with the engine without exhaust gas aftertreatment devices, DOC+CDPF+SCR can evidently reduce the particulate number by 1∼2 orders of magnitude, and the decreasing range can up to 2∼3 orders of magnitude when the particulate diameter is between 10∼60 nm. At the maximum torque speed of 1400 rpm and rated speed of 2200 rpm, the filtration efficiency of total particulate number from the engine can be over about 95%.

The contribution attributed to regulation function was the highest, especially the value from the hydrological regulation (36.17%) and climate regulation (16.04%). The Total Economic Value (TEV) method and the Equivalent Value Factors (EVF) method are compared in this study. Results show that Equivalent Value Factors derived value of the Sanjiang Plain ecosystem services is slightly lower than the value obtained by the Total Economic Value method, i.e., 537.84 billion yuan, of which the total value of the Feature Services has reached as high as 38.35 billion yuan. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Equivalent Value Factors; Index system; Sanjiang Plain; Valuation methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006954247

Sludge bio-drying, as an effective sludge treatment technology, is being adopted worldwide. In this study, two aeration strategies (piles I and II) were compared to investigate the primary contributors to N2O emission during sludge bio-drying through studying the evolution of functional genes involved in nitrification (amoA, hao, and nxrA) and denitrification (narG, nirS, nirK, norB, and nosZ) by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results showed that the profile of N2O emission can be divided into three stages, traditional denitrification contributed largely to N2O emission at stage I (days 1–5), but N2O emission mainly happened at stage II (days 5–14) due to nitrifier denitrification and NH2OH accumulation by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), accounting for 51.4% and 58.2% of total N2O emission for piles I and II, respectively. At stage III (days 14–21), nitrifier denitrification was inhibited because sludge bio-drying proceeded mainly by the physical aeration, thus N2O emission decreased and changed little. The improved aeration strategy availed pile I to reduce N2O emission much especially at stages II and III, respectively. These results indicated that nitrifier denitrification by AOB and biological NH2OH oxidation due to AOB made more contribution to N2O emission, and aeration strategy was crucial to mitigate N2O emission during sludge bio-drying. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","N2O emission; Nitrifier denitrification; Nitrogen transformation functional genes; Quantitative PCR; Sludge bio-drying","Bacteria; Biology; Drying; Genes; Global warming; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Piles; Polymerase chain reaction; Aeration strategies; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Denitrifiers; Functional genes; Nitrous oxide; Quantitative PCR; Sludge bio-drying; Sludge treatment; Denitrification; ammonium hydroxide; nitrous oxide; air; nitrous oxide; sewage; aeration; bacterium; bioactivity; denitrification; emission; global warming; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; oxidation; polymerase chain reaction; sludge; technology adoption; aeration; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; amoA gene; Article; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifyer; evolution; gene expression; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hao gene; microbial community; microbial gene; narG gene; nirK gene; nirS gene; nitrification; nitrifyer; nonhuman; norB gene; nosZ gene; nxrA gene; oxidation; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; sludge; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; bioreactor; chemistry; denitrification; desiccation; genetics; microbiology; nitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; sewage; volatilization; Nitrosomonadales; Air; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Desiccation; Global Warming; Nitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sewage; Volatilization; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006512038

In this process, urban energy policies are crucial and pioneering cities should play a leading role. The change in energy consumption patterns in three cities, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, and Bangkok, was studied, and these cities' low carbon development strategies were reviewed. It was found that total energy consumption in the three cities has shown a tendency towards being stable or even started to decrease. The energy consumption by industry has started to decrease or stopped increasing. Service sectors became the most important energy consumers in all three cities, particularly the transport sector in Bangkok. Household energy consumption gradually increased in Beijing and Shanghai. Electricity use at home and energy for vehicles are becoming more important with urbanization and changes in lifestyles. All three cities have adopted a variety of low carbon development strategies, such as transition towards a lower carbon economy, developing a low carbon transportation system, and adopting cleaner and renewable substitutes for electricity to disengage from the dependency on coal and petroleum products. However, most low carbon strategies have focused on industrial and service sectors. Those cities should also explore and lead more sustainable lifestyles, which are important for system-wide energy savings. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Coal transportation; Developing countries; Energy conservation; Petroleum transportation; Planning; Strategic planning; Asian developing countries; Household energy consumption; Low carbon transportations; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon strategies; Renewable substitutes; Total energy consumption; Transport sectors; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017176660

To analyze the gradient of species richness in China using water-energy dynamics, this study used linear regression to examine how species richness is related to (1) the long-term mean of evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and (2) the temporal stability of ET and PET. ET and PET were used to represent the water-energy dynamics of the terrestrial area. Changes in water-energy dynamics over the 14-year period (2000 to 2013) were also analyzed. The long-term mean of ET was strong and positively (R2 ∈ (0.40 ∼ 0.67), p &lt; 0.05) correlated with the species richness gradients. Regions in which changes in land cover have occurred over the 14-year period (2000 to 2013) were detected from long-term trends. The high level of species richness in all groups (birds, mammals, and amphibians) was associated with relatively high ET, determinism (i.e., predictability), and entropy (i.e., complexity). ET, rather than PET or temporal stability measures, was an effective proxy of species richness in regions of China that had moderate energy (PET &gt; 1000 mm/year), especially for amphibians. In addition, predictions of species richness were improved by incorporating information on the temporal stability of ET with long-term means. Amphibians are more sensitive to the long-term ET mean than other groups due to their unique physiological requirements and evolutionary processes. Our results confirmed that ET and PET were strongly and significantly correlated with climatic and anthropogenic induced changes, providing useful information for conservation planning. Therefore, climate management based on changes to water-energy dynamics via land management practices, including reforestation, should be considered when planning methods to conserve natural resources to protect biodiversity. © 2017 by the authors.","Evapotranspiration (ET); Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA); Terrestrial biodiversity protection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014838937

To help reach these ambitious goals, Kazakhstan has adopted the Law on Energy Savings (2012) and the “Energy Saving 2020” program (2013) [1]. Under these policies, businesses that consume more than 1500 ton of coal equivalent (tce) per year and all municipal buildings are required to conduct energy audits and implement identified energy-saving measures. Achieving these national goals and helping regulated companies comply with the law requires the services of experienced energy professionals. Thus, in 2014, the USAID Kazakhstan Climate Change Mitigation Program (KCCMP) helped launch the AEE Kazakhstan Chapter, and establish four Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) based at leading Kazakhstani technical universities. Although the local model differs slightly from that of US-based IACs, the Centers provide on-the-job training to help create the next generation of energy professionals and assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in complying with the laws. A typical Kazakhstani energy audit group consists of an international energy auditing expert, nationally certified auditors, as well as engineering faculty members and students. These four types of individuals learn from each other while identifying opportunities for enterprises to decrease their energy intensity. Since their establishment (in October 2014), the IAC teams have performed 14 express energy audits and trained 91 local energy practitioners. The average annual energy consumption of 14 audited businesses is 67,772 tce (excluding a large combined heat and power [CHP] plant), or about $12.2 million in annual energy expenditures. To date, the IAC teams have identified energy savings of as much as $2.8 million annually (10,421 tce). Thus, IACs are helping to implement Kazakhstan's national energy strategy by training qualified professionals and by helping businesses to both be more competitive and to comply with national regulations. ©, Copyright Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).",,"Climate change; Cogeneration plants; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Laws and legislation; Personnel training; Annual energy consumption; Climate change mitigation; Combined heat and power; Engineering faculty members; Gross domestic products; Industrial Assessment Centers; Small and medium enterprise; Technical universities; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014585646

The clear-cut Co3O4 nanocubes of uniform size were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and characterized with XRD, RS, HR-TEM, XRF, TPSR (CH4/16/18O2), and SSITKA (CH4/16/18O2) techniques. The experimental results were corroborated by first-principles thermodynamic and DFT+U molecular modeling, providing a rational framework for a detailed understanding of the origin of a different redox comportment of the catalyst with the varying temperature and its mechanistic implications. Three temperature/conversion stages of the methane oxidation reaction were distinguished, depending on involvement of the adsorbed or lattice oxygen and the redox state of the catalyst. A stoichiometric (100) surface region (300°C &lt; T &lt; 450°C, XCH4 &lt; 25%) is featured by the dominant suprafacial (Langmuir-Hinshelwood) mechanism of methane oxidation. A region of slightly defected surface (450°C &lt; T &lt; 650°C, 25% &lt; XCH4 &lt; 80%), in which oxygen vacancies produced upon CO2 and H2O release are virtually refilled by dioxygen, is characterized by coexistence of the suprafacial (Langmuir-Hinshelwood) and intrafacial (Mars-van Krevelen) mechanistic steps. In a nonstoichiometric surface region (T &gt; 650°C, XCH4 &gt; 80%), the oxygen vacancies are only partially refilled, the catalyst is significantly reduced, and methane is combusted according to the Mars-van Krevelen scheme. Molecular modeling revealed that the suprafacial Co-Oads adoxygen species are more active (ΔEa = 0.83 eV) than the intrafacial Co-Osurf surface sites (ΔEa = 1.11 eV) in the CH4 oxidation. The (100) surface state diagrams for the three distinguished conversion regions were constructed to elucidate the catalyst thermodynamic behavior under those conditions. It was shown that the activity of cobalt spinel is maintained by redox autotuning of the catalyst and dynamic adjustment of uneven participation of the suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in methane oxidation to the actual reaction conditions. These factors have important structural and mechanistic consequences for the catalytic CH4 combustion on cobalt spinel and related systems, controlling not only the sustainable versus the stoichiometric turnovers but also for the prevalence or coexistence of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and the Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms with the reaction progress.

In this paper, a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis was employed to examine the factors (e.g., the number of households, per capita household income, household size, urbanization, energy intensity, energy structure and emission coefficient) impacting the changes in RDCE in Shanxi province of China from 1995 to 2014. The results showed that the increase in RDCE mainly attributed to the growing per capita household income and the increasing number of households. Additionally, the expansion of urbanization also contributed marginally to the increase in emissions. However, the shrinking household size was a main inhibitory factor and the decline in energy intensity was also responsible for the diminishing emissions. Based on the results, four emission reduction measures and strategies were identified: (i) using market economic mechanism to regulate household consumption behaviors towards environment protection and low carbon development, as well as encouraging the use of energy-efficiency domestic appliances and less energy-intensive lifestyles; (ii) setting strict divorce processes to lower divorce rates and encouraging people to live with their children and parents; (iii) realizing green transformation development of urbanization; (iv) promoting a shift to renewable and clean energy in people's daily life and power generation, e.g., wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and biogas. © 2016 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Decomposition analysis; Household-related factors; Residential direct CO2 emissions; Shanxi province; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002033460

In some cases, the most likely emission site close to the central black hole is ruled out because of the high opacity caused by strong optical and infrared photon sources, such as the broad-line region. Mostly neglected for jet modelling is the absorption of γ -rays in the starlight photon field of the host galaxy. Analysing the absorption for arbitrary locations and observation angles of the γ -ray emission site within the host galaxy, we find that the distance to the galaxy centre, the observation angle, and the distribution of starlight in the galaxy are crucial for the amount of absorption. We derive the absorption value for a sample of 20 TeV-detected blazars with a redshift zr &lt; 0.2. The absorption value of the γ -ray emission located in the galaxy centre may be as high as 20 per cent, with an average value of 6 per cent. This is important in order to determine the intrinsic blazar parameters. We see no significant trends in our sample between the degree of absorption and host properties, such as starlight emissivity, galactic size, half-light radius, and redshift. While the uncertainty of the spectral properties of the extragalactic background light exceeds the effect of absorption by stellar light from the host galaxy in distant objects, the latter is a dominant effect in nearby sources. It may also be revealed in a differential comparison of sources with similar redshifts. © 2016 The Authors.","Galaxies: active; Gamma-rays: galaxies; Opacity; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014628385

Emission standards have significant impacts on the environmental management, especially on controlling the pollutant emissions and reducing environmental risks. The evolution and improvement of the air pollutants emission standards were critically analyzed, which focus on thermal power plant atmospheric pollutants emission standards, boiler air pollutant emission standards and atmospheric pollutants integrated emission standard. According to the different versions of the Atmospheric Pollutant Emission Standard of Thermal Power Plants, a case study was carried out in Shandong Province, China. Data was quantitatively analyzed to examine the effectiveness of environmental standards on pollutants emission reduction. The results showed that each amendment to the standard has a significant reduction effect on the discharge of pollutants. In Shandong Province, the emission coefficients of sulfur dioxide and soot (dust) in 2013 was only 15.9% and 11.6% of the 1993 level.

The applied climate datasets were performed in the framework of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-Africa) project. After evaluation of the historical runs of the climate models' ensemble, a statistical bias correction (empirical quantile mapping) was applied to daily precipitation. Temperature and bias corrected precipitation data from the ensemble of RCMs-GCMs was then used as input for the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) to simulate water balance components. The mean hydrological and climate variables for two periods (1971-2000 and 2021-2050) were compared to assess the potential impact of climate change on water resources up to the middle of the 21st century under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The results indicate (i) a clear signal of temperature increase of about 0.1 to 2.6 °C for all members of the RCM-GCM ensemble; (ii) high uncertainty about how the catchment precipitation will evolve over the period 2021-2050; (iii) the applied bias correction method only affected the magnitude of the climate change signal; (iv) individual climate models results lead to opposite discharge change signals; and (v) the results for the RCM-GCM ensemble are too uncertain to give any clear direction for future hydrological development. Therefore, potential increase and decrease in future discharge have to be considered in climate change adaptation strategies in the catchment. The results further underline on the one hand the need for a larger ensemble of projections to properly estimate the impacts of climate change on water resources in the catchment and on the other hand the high uncertainty associated with climate projections for the West African region.

The power-to-gas (P2G) technology, which uses electricity to produce hydrogen or synthetic natural gas, has become a promising energy conversion option for the utilization of surplus power energy. In this paper, an integrated natural gas, heat, and power dispatch (INGHPD) model which balances natural gas, heat, and power demand considering wind power and a P2G unit, is proposed. A natural gas network and P2G are modeled and integrated into the dispatch model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an integrated energy system consisting of a six-bus power system, a six-node natural gas system, and a district heating system is simulated. The benefits of P2G are investigated in terms of reducing wind power curtailment, as well as system operation cost and CO2 emissions. The results in the deterministic model show that with the introduction of 40 MW P2G, the wind power curtailment rate decreases from 24.0% to 9.7%. The daily wind power energy consumed by P2G reaches 256 MWh and the daily CO2 emissions reduction reaches 46,080 kg. Additionally, the impact of the power and heat demand on the gas production of P2G and of the P2G capacity on the wind power curtailment are also investigated. P2G tends to generate more natural gas when the power demand is low and the heat demand is high. © 2017 by the authors.","Combined heat and power; Economic dispatch; Natural gas system; Power-to-gas; Wind power","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chemical alteration; combined heat and power; gas production; heat production; natural gas; performance assessment; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018511236

This reaction family is first divided into classes depending upon H atom transfer from -OOH bonded carbon or non-OOH bonded carbon, and then the two classes are further divided depending upon the ring size of the transition states and the types of the carbons from which the H atom is transferred. High pressure limit rate rules and pressure-dependent rate rules for each class are derived from the rate constants of a representative set of reactions within each class using electronic structure calculations performed at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. For the intramolecular H-migration reactions of •O2QOOH radicals for abstraction from an -OOH substituted carbon atom (-OOH bonded case), the result shows that it is acceptable to derive the rate rules by taking the average of the rate constants from a representative set of reactions with different sizes of the substitutes. For the abstraction from a non-OOH substituted carbon atom (non-OOH bonded case), rate rules for each class are also derived and it is shown that the difference between the rate constants calculated by CBS-QB3 method and rate constants estimated from the rate rules may be large; therefore, to get more reliable results for the low-temperature combustion modeling of alkanes, it is better to assign each reaction its CBS-QB3 calculated rate constants, instead of assigning the same values for the same reaction class according to rate rules. The intramolecular H-migration reactions of •O2QOOH radicals (a thermally equilibrated system) are pressure-dependent, and the pressure-dependent rate constants of these reactions are calculated by using the Rice-Ramsberger-Kassel-Marcus/master-equation theory at pressures varying from 0.01 to 100 atm. The impact of molecular size on the pressure-dependent rate constants of the intramolecular H-migration reactions of •O2QOOH radicals has been studied, and it is shown that the pressure dependence of the rate constants of intramolecular H-migration reactions of •O2QOOH radicals decreases with the molecular size at low temperatures and the impact of molecular size on the pressure-dependent rate constants decreases as temperature increases. It is shown that it is acceptable to derive the pressure-dependent rate rules by taking the average of the rate constants from a representative set of reactions with different sizes of the substitutes. The barrier heights follow the Evans-Polanyi relationship for each type of intramolecular hydrogen-migration reaction studied. All calculated rate constants are fitted by a nonlinear least-squares method to the form of a modified Arrhenius rate expression at pressures varying from 0.01 to 100 atm and at the high-pressure limit. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters for all species involved in these reactions are calculated by the composite CBS-QB3 method and are given in NASA format. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Abstracting; Atoms; Electric circuit breakers; Electronic structure; Free radical reactions; Least squares approximations; NASA; Temperature; Electronic structure calculations; High-pressure limits; Intramolecular hydrogen migration; Low temperature combustion; Low-temperature oxidation; Nonlinear least squares methods; Temperature increase; Thermodynamic parameter; Rate constants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020195386

Anthropogenic emissions are from the Community Emissions Data System that is newly developed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Over north China where the air quality is often poor, about 90% of near-surface BC concentration is contributed by local emissions. Overall, 35% of BC concentration over south China in winter can be attributed to emissions from north China, and 19% comes from sources outside China in spring. For other regions in China, BC is largely contributed from nonlocal sources. We further investigated potential factors that contribute to the poor air quality in China. During polluted days, a net inflow of BC transported from nonlocal source regions associated with anomalous winds plays an important role in increasing local BC concentrations. BC-containing particles emitted from East Asia can also be transported across the Pacific. Our model results show that emissions from inside and outside China are equally important for the BC outflow from East Asia, while emissions from China account for 8% of BC concentration and 29% in column burden in the western United States in spring. Radiative forcing estimates show that 65% of the annual mean BC direct radiative forcing (2.2Wm-2) in China results from local emissions, and the remaining 35% is contributed by emissions outside of China. Efficiency analysis shows that a reduction in BC emissions over eastern China could have a greater benefit for the regional air quality in China, especially in the winter haze season.",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; black carbon; concentration (composition); emission inventory; haze; radiative forcing; seasonality; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016759386

However, most of them are based on a random accumulation connection of two different crystals and there are obvious empty spaces, which are formed as deplete layer to hinders the charge transfer to a large extent. In order to shorten the charger transfer path and make a direct charge transform from interface to surface, a chemically bonded interface in the composite is more reasonable.

Whilst existing research has examined the factors influencing ambient air pollutant concentrations, previous studies have failed to adequately explore the determinants of such concentrations from either a source or diffusion perspective. This study addressed both source (specifically, anthropogenic emissions) and diffusion (namely, meteorological conditions) indicators, in order to detect their respective impacts on the spatial variations seen in the distribution of air pollution. Spatial panel data for 113 major cities in China was processed using a range of global regression models—the ordinary least square model, the spatial lag model, and the spatial error model—as well as a local, geographic weighted regression (GWR) model. Results from the study suggest that in 2014, average SO2 concentrations exceeded China's first-level target. The most polluted cities were found to be predominantly located in northern China, while less polluted cities were located in southern China. Global regression results indicated that precipitation exerts a significant effect on SO2 reduction (p &lt; 0.001) and that a regional increase of 1 mm in precipitation can reduce SO2 concentrations by 0.026 μg/m3. Both emission and temperature factors were found to aggravate SO2 concentrations, although no such significant correlation was found in relation to wind speed. GWR results suggest that the association between SO2 and its factors varied over space. Increased emissions were found to be able to produce more pollution in the northwest than in other parts of the country. Higher wind speeds and temperatures in northwestern areas were shown to reinforce SO2 pollution, while in southern regions, they had the opposite effect. Further, increased precipitation was found to exert a greater inhibitory effect on SO2 pollution in the country's northeast than that in other areas. Our findings could provide a detailed reference for formulating regionally specific emission reduction policies in China. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic emissions; China; Meteorological conditions; SO2 concentration; Spatial variation","Air pollution; Emission control; Least squares approximations; Pollution; Regression analysis; Wind; Adverse health effects; Anthropogenic emissions; China; Emission reduction policies; Meteorological condition; Ordinary least squares; Spatial error models; Spatial variations; Sulfur dioxide; sulfur dioxide; sulfur dioxide; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; meteorology; pollutant transport; spatial variation; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; ambient air; Article; China; controlled study; environmental temperature; meteorological phenomena; panel study; precipitation; statistical model; wind; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; theoretical model; China; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028246062

In order to ensure satisfactory air quality during this event, a phased emission control measures were taken in Beijing and its surrounding provinces. The 24-h PM2.5 samples were collected in Beijing from August 1 to September 15, 2015 covering the period before, during and after this large-scale event. The observed PM2.5 data, meteorological data, emission reduction measures, and air mass trajectory simulation results were systematically analyzed to understand the pollution characteristics and chemical compositions of PM2.5 in Beijing. The results indicated that PM2.5 concentration during the two emission control phases was reduced by 61.7% comparing to the non-control period, but the regional transport of pollutants and meteorological conditions had a more prominent impact on PM2.5 than emission reduction during phase 2. The secondary water-soluble ions including SO4 2–, NO3 –, and NH4 + were found as the main ions present in PM2.5. During the entire emission control period, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) mass concentrations were decreased by 53.1% and 57.9%. A PM2.5 mass balance was analyzed, and it was found that the organic matter accounted for 29.3, 37.6 and 28.5% of the PM2.5 mass before, during and after the emission control, while the contribution of mobile sources to PM2.5 was relatively outstanding after a series of emission control measures. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Air mass trajectory; Chemical composition; Emission control; PM2.5; Water-soluble ion","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Chemical analysis; Emission control; Ions; Meteorology; Organic carbon; Air mass trajectories; Chemical compositions; Emission control measures; Meteorological condition; Meteorological data; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Water-soluble ions; Quality control; air mass; air quality; chemical composition; elemental carbon; emission control; mass balance; organic carbon; organic matter; particulate matter; solubility; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016646812

The pulsars are detected multiple times across the full parameter spaces of X-ray luminosity (LX = 1031 − 38 erg s− 1) and spin period (P &lt; 1 s to P &gt; 1,000 s), and the library enables time-domain studies at a range of energy scales. The high time resolution and sensitivity of the European Photon Imaging cameras are complemented by the angular resolution of Chandra and the regular monitoring of RXTE. Our processing pipeline uses the latest calibration files and software to generate a suite of useful products for each pulsar detection: event lists, high-time-resolution light curves, periodograms, spectra, and complete histories of P, the pulsed fraction, and so on, in the broad (0.2–12 keV), soft (0.2–2 keV), and hard (2–12 keV) energy bands. After combining the observations from these telescopes, we found that 27 pulsars show long-term spin up and 24 long-term spin down. We also used the faintest and brightest sources to map out the lower and upper boundaries of accretion-powered X-ray emission: the propeller line and the Eddington line, respectively. We are in the process of comparing the observed pulse profiles to geometric models of X-ray emission in order to constrain the physical parameters of the pulsars. Finally, we are preparing a public release of the library so that it can be used by others in the astronomical community. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Estimates are made both using available satellite data and a carbon map for the “pre-modern” period (prior to 1970). We used data from Brazil’s Project for Monitoring Deforestation in Amazonia updated through 2013 and from the Brazilian Biomes Deforestation Monitoring Project (PMDBBS) updated through 2010. To obtain the pre-modern and recent carbon stocks we performed an intersection between a carbon map and a map derived from settlement boundaries and deforestation data. Although the settlements analyzed occupied only 8 % of Legal Amazonia, our results indicate that these settlements contributed 17 % (160,410 km2) of total clearing (forest + non-forest) in Legal Amazonia (967,003 km2). This represents a clear-cutting of 41 % of the original vegetation in the settlements. Out of this total, 72 % (115,634 km2) was in the “Federal Settlement Project” (PA) category. Deforestation in settlements represents 20 % (2.6 Pg C) of the total carbon loss in Legal Amazonia (13.1 Pg C). The carbon stock in remaining vegetation represents 3.8 Pg C, or 6 % of the total remaining carbon stock in Legal Amazonia (58.6 Pg C) in the periods analyzed. The carbon reductions in settlements are caused both by the settlers and by external actors. Our findings suggest that agrarian reform policies contributed directly to carbon loss. Thus, the implementation of new settlements should consider potential carbon stock losses, especially if settlements are created in areas with high carbon stocks. © 2016, The Author(s).","Agrarian reform; Amazon forest; Carbon; Colonization; Global warming; Settlement project","Deforestation; Global warming; Vegetation; Agrarian reform; Amazon forests; Brazilian biomes; Carbon reduction; Colonization; Reform policies; Satellite data; Settlement project; Carbon; carbon; carbon; agrarian reform; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; colonization; deforestation; forest ecosystem; global warming; policy implementation; project design; rural policy; satellite data; agricultural worker; Article; Brazil; cocoon; deforestation; government; greenhouse effect; hydrography; Mato Grosso; modern times; Roraima; sustainable development; Tocantins; urban area; vegetation; biomass; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; human; rural population; trends; Amazonia; Brazil; Biomass; Brazil; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992170538

The problem is to commit and dispatch distributed devices with renewable generation to minimize the total energy and emission cost while meeting the forecasted energy demand. The problem is challenging because of the intermittent nature of renewables. In this paper, photovoltaic (PV) uncertainties are modeled by a Markovian process. For effective coordination, other devices are modeled as Markov processes with states depending on PV states. The entire problem is Markovian. This combinatorial problem is solved using branch-and-cut. Beyond energy and emission costs, to consider capital and maintenance costs in the long run, microgrid design is also essential. The problem is to decide device sizes with given types to minimize the lifetime cost while meeting energy demand. Its complexity increases exponentially with the problem size. To evaluate the lifetime cost including the reliability cost and the classic components such as capital and fuel costs, a linear model is established.

To meet climate-change mitigation targets, environmental policy instruments have been designed to transform the way goods and services are produced as well as alter consumption patterns. The government of Malaysia is strongly committed to reducing CO2 gas emissions as a proportion of GDP by 40% from 2005 levels by the year 2020. This study evaluates the economy-wide impacts of implementing two different types of CO2 emission abatement policies in Malaysia using market-based (imposing a carbon tax) and command-and-control mechanism (sectoral emission standards). The policy simulations conducted involve the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products by the government. A carbon emission tax in conjunction with the revenue neutrality assumption is seen to be more effective than a command-and-control policy as it provides a double dividend. This is apparent as changes in consumption patterns lead to welfare enhancements while contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions. The simulation results show that the production of renewable energies is stepped up when the imposition of carbon tax and removal of the subsidy is augmented by revenue recycling.

This &lt;q&gt;N demand&lt;/q&gt; can be satisfied in various ways, including biological N fixation (BNF) (the dominant pathway under natural conditions), lightning-induced abiotic N fixation, N uptake from sedimentary substrates, and N deposition from natural and anthropogenic sources. We estimated the global new N fixation demand (NNF), i.e. the total new N input required to sustain net primary production (NPP) in non-agricultural terrestrial ecosystems regardless of its origin, using a N-enabled global dynamic vegetation model (DyN-LPJ). DyN-LPJ does not explicitly simulate BNF; rather, it estimates total NNF using a mass balance criterion and assumes that this demand is met from one source or another. The model was run in steady state and then in transient mode driven by recent changes in CO2 concentration and climate. A range of values for key stoichiometric parameters was considered, based on recently published analyses. Modelled NPP and C:N ratios of litter and soil organic matter were consistent with independent estimates. Modelled geographic patterns of ecosystem NNF were similar to other analyses, but actual estimated values exceeded recent estimates of global BNF. The results were sensitive to a few key parameters: The fraction of litter carbon respired to CO2 during decomposition and plant-type-specific C:N ratios of litter and soil. The modelled annual NNF increased by about 15% during the course of the transient run, mainly due to increasing CO2 concentration. The model did not overestimate recent terrestrial carbon uptake, suggesting that the increase in NNF demand has so far been met. Rising CO2 is further increasing the NNF demand, while the future capacity of N sources to support this is unknown. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biogeochemistry; carbon; decomposition; ecosystem modeling; litter; net primary production; nitrogen; nitrogen fixation; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017534887

The boost system architecture plays an essential role in providing adequate air flow rate for diesel fuel combustion while avoiding impaired transient response of the downsized engine. Electric Turbocharger Assist (ETA) technology integrates an electric motor/generator with the turbocharger to provide electrical power to assist compressor work or to electrically recover excess turbine power. Additionally, a variable geometry turbine (VGT) is able to bring an extra degree of freedom for the boost system optimization. The electrically-assisted turbocharger, coupled with VGT, provides an illuminating opportunity to increase the diesel engine power density and enhance the downsized engine transient response. This paper assesses the potential benefits of the electrically-assisted turbocharger with VGT to enable heavy-duty diesel engine downsizing. A 1D engine simulation model of the Caterpillar 7.1L 6-cylinder diesel engine has been developed and validated against engine test data taken with ETA device fitted. Both steady state and transient engine performance are evaluated with different electric power levels, motor response time and VGT vane positions. The ETA technology gives transient response benefits over a range of transient events, but with diminishing returns at the higher levels of ETA power. Better transient response and fuel consumption could be achieved by combining ETA device with VGT versus a standard fixed turbine. The importance of ETA control with fast response time during transient maneuver is highlighted. This study also demonstrates the engine speed drop is less significantly affected than recovery time over block load test by employing ETA technology. This potential limit of the requirement to have sufficient initial excess boost for downsized engine could be addressed by controlling the VGT vane position. Finally, the capability of this optimized boosting system to enable downsizing from 9.3L to 7.1L is demonstrated.

Yet, limited attention has been given to their potential influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including the diurnal variations of GHG fluxes that are fundamental in estimating the carbon and nitrogen budget. In this study, we examined the diurnal variation in fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a S. alterniflora intertidal flat in June, October, and December of 2013 and April of 2014 representing the summer, autumn, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. We found that the average CH4 fluxes on the diurnal scale were positive during the growing season while negative otherwise. The tidal flat of S. alterniflora acted as a source of CH4 in summer (June) and a combination of source and sink in other seasons. We observed higher diurnal variations in the CO2 and N2O fluxes during the growing season (1 536.5 mg CO2 m–2 h–1 and 25.6 μg N2O m–2 h–1) compared with those measured in the non-growing season (379.1 mg CO2 m–2 h–1 and 16.5 μg N2O m–2 h–1). The mean fluxes of CH4 were higher at night than that in the daytime during all the seasons but October. The diurnal variation in the fluxes of CO2 in June and N2O in December fluctuated more than that in October and April. However, two peak curves in October and April were observed for the diurnal changes in CO2 and N2O fluxes (prominent peaks were found in the morning of October and in the afternoon of April, respectively). The highest diurnal variation in the N2O fluxes took place at 15:00 (86.4 μg N2O m–2 h–1) in June with an unimodal distribution. Water logging in October increased the emission of CO2 (especially at nighttime), yet decreased N2O and CH4 emissions to a different degree on the daily scale because of the restrained diffusion rates of the gases. The seasonal and diurnal variations of CH4 and CO2 fluxes did not correlate to the air and soil temperatures, whereas the seasonal and diurnal variation of the fluxes of N2O in June exhibited a significant correlation with air temperature. When N2O and CH4 fluxes were converted to CO2-e equivalents, the emissions of N2O had a remarkable potential to impact the global warming. The mean daily flux (MF) and total daily flux (TDF) were higher in the growing season, nevertheless, the MF and TDF of CO2 were higher in October and those of CH4 and N2O were higher in June. In spite of the difference in the optimal sampling times throughout the observation period, our results obtained have implications for sampling and scaling strategies in estimating the GHG fluxes in coastal saline wetlands. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon dioxide; diurnal variation; methane; nitrous oxide; S. alterniflora",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017615685

Previous studies revealed that the agricultural greenhouse gas emissions of China kept increasing in the past few years. In this study, the life cycle assessment method was used to calculate the product and farm carbon footprints of rice, wheat and maize based on the governmental statistical datasets and published results. The spatial and temporal patterns of carbon footprint was analyzed, and the impacts of environmental and socioeconomic factors on carbon footprints were evaluated using canonical correspondence analysis. The results showed that the product carbon footprints of rice, wheat and maize corresponded to 1.06 ± 0.03, 0.50 ± 0.04 and 0.40 ± 0.03 kg CO2 eq/kg, while the farm carbon footprints were 7285 ± 78, 2800 ± 222 and 2707 ± 151 kg CO2 eq/ha.

The farm carbon footprints of grain crops in the southern provinces were higher than those in the northern provinces. Topsoil clay fraction, latitude, arable land per capita in the rural areas, and longitude significantly affected the spatial distribution of carbon footprints.

Magnoliaceae species are of great scientific importance but are extremely endangered, therefore, it is crucial to study their ecophysiological adaptations for ex situ conservation. Here, we chose four common Magnoliaceae species growing in two botanical gardens located in south and north subtropical monsoon regions, and measured hydraulic and photosynthetic traits in both wet and dry seasons. We found that plants growing in north region showed significant lower leaf water potential at predawn and midday than those in south region, indicating that species suffered more severe drought stress in north region. As a result, species in north region had lower stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates, as well as smaller stomatal pore index. In addition, significantly lower stem hydraulic conductivity of the two deciduous species in north region were observed compared with species in south region, while the two evergreen species at both regions showed similar values of stem hydraulic conductivity. Non-significant differences in leaf turgor loss points, leaf conductance, specific leaf area, and wood density were found when comparing species from the north and south regions. Our results suggested that the adjustment of plant hydraulics to local climatic conditions of Magnoliaceae species occurs primarily through changes in stomatal morphology and function, whereas the contribution of intraspecific variation in leaf hydraulic traits appears to be limited. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climatic regions; Hydraulic conductivity; Leaf habit; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Stomatal regulation","angiosperm; climatic region; drought stress; ecophysiology; environmental conditions; hydraulic conductivity; intraspecific variation; leaf; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; stomatal conductance; China; Magnoliaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010749146

Palaeolimnological records have a great potential to reveal long-term variations and dynamic interactions in ESs, especially supporting/regulating services, which are not easily quantified by documentary records. To elucidate the variations between eight important ESs in shallow lake ecosystems, we combined documentary records with palaeolimnological proxies (covering the past 100 years) from two typical lakes (Lakes Taibai and Zhangdu) of the Yangtze River basin. Although all supporting services and some provisioning services have increased, the regulating services of the two lakes have markedly declined, in particular since the 1950s. Human activities, including hydrological intervention, nutrient input and land-use change, were identified as the main factors behind the observed variations. Both in Lake Taibai and Zhangdu, primary production and biodiversity (supporting services) have increased (synergies), whereas climate and water purification (regulating services) have significantly decreased (tradeoffs) since the 1950s when attempts were made by the local population to reach a higher land/fish ESs level. By considering long-term records, dynamic tradeoff and synergy relationship between various ESs relative to different types of human “modification” in a temporal perspective, we suggest valuable information can be gained in future lake management initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem service; Human activity; Palaeolimnology; Synergy; Tradeoff; Yangtze River","Biodiversity; Ecology; Lakes; Land use; Ecosystem services; Human activities; Palaeolimnology; Synergy; Tradeoff; Yangtze River; Ecosystems; ecosystem service; historical record; human activity; lake ecosystem; long-term change; paleolimnology; trade-off; water management; Article; biodiversity; China; climate; environmental management; environmental monitoring; human; human activities; human impact (environment); hydrology; lake ecosystem; land use; paleolimnology; resource management; water management; article; China; lake ecosystem; nutrient; river basin; China; Hubei; Jiangxi; Taibai Lake [Jiangxi]; Yangtze Basin; Zhangdu Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028265653

Based on 38 meteorological stations in the middle and southern Loess Plateau area, the effects of agricultural irrigation on climatic variables from 1960 to 2005 were evaluated. Climatic trends from non-irrigated areas were used as a reference. Trends in climatic variables for the growing season and the summer period are negatively correlated with the percentage of cultivated land within a 3 km radius of the meteorological stations. Trends for the average summer temperature (Ta), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin) and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) decreased by 0.065, 0.073, 0.054 and 0.025 °C per decade, respectively. Summer net solar radiation (SR) decreased by 0.0325 MJ m−2 day−1 per decade and summer relative humidity (RH) increased by 0.255% per decade with a 10% increase in the area of cultivated land. The climatic effects on meteorological stations in irrigated areas are compared to the trends of non-irrigated areas in the study region. The expansion of irrigation has had a noticeable cooling effect on summer Ta, Tmax, Tmin and DTR with values of 0.192, 0.193, 0.142 and 0.058 °C (10 years)−1, respectively. Irrigation increased RH by 0.916% per decade and net radiation reduced by 0.230 MJ m−2 day−1 per decade. On monthly scales, these effects were more obvious in June and August. The dependence of climatic trends on the proportion of cultivated land can be attributed to agricultural irrigation. The changes in climatic differences for Ta, Tmax, Tmin, RH and SR corresponded with the expansion of irrigation. The cooling effects induced by irrigation have also partly masked the effects of greenhouse gas-induced warming. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society","air temperature; climate change; climatic effects; irrigation; relative humidity; solar radiation","Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Climatology; Cultivation; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Land use; Landforms; Meteorology; Sediments; Solar radiation; Agricultural irrigation; Agricultural practices; Air temperature; Climatic effects; Diurnal temperature ranges; Meteorological station; Minimum temperatures; Rain fed agriculture; Radiation effects; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; irrigation; regional climate; relative humidity; solar radiation; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983507814

Attitude is partially socially constructed and thus must be studied locally rather than inferred from other settings. This study explored public attitudes toward air pollution among Beijing residents through interviews and thematic analysis. In contrast to previous studies mostly focusing on a certain dimension of attitudes, we attempted to show an initial picture of attitudes in three dimensions, knowledge and belief, perception and concern, and covert and overt behaviors, and identify underlying factors accounting for such attitudes. The results showed that the interviewees largely knew the sources and impacts of air pollution but also demonstrated misunderstandings; half of them perceived air pollution as ‘severe’ and three-fourths of them showed little concern about air pollution; their protective and mitigation responsive behaviors were inadequate. Factors affecting such attitudes, both existing and missing in current literature, were identified. Perceived air pollution is determined by sensory cues and imagination, and mediated by lived experiences and place identity. Lack of concern about air pollution can largely be explained by a feeling of uncontrollability and the crowding effect in competing for attention. This lack is further influenced by the perceived benefits of living in large cities, perceived fairness of the impact across the population, and perceived delay of the health impacts posed by air pollution. Protective behaviors, specifically wearing facemasks, are influenced by perceived severity, vulnerability, efficacy, and barriers. Mitigation behavior, which refers to reducing car use in this case, is discouraged by a lack of feeling responsible and by perceived inconvenience and ineffectiveness. At an academic level, the results of this exploratory study are expected to provide a base for further investigations of factors affecting public attitudes. From a policy perspective, the results should provide information for designing policy instruments to raise awareness and motivate actions to cope with air pollution. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","air pollution; attitude; behavior; concern; perception","Pollution; Sensory perception; attitude; behavior; concern; Exploratory studies; Perceived benefits; Policy instruments; Responsive behaviors; Urban air pollution; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939538811

To alleviate this problem, the Chinese government introduced a National Air Pollution Control Action Plan (NAPCAP) with air pollutants reduction targets by 2017. However, there is doubt whether these targets can be achieved once the plan is implemented. In this work, the effectiveness of NAPCAP is analyzed by developing models of the statistical relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and air pollutant emissions (SO2, NOx, smoke and dust), while taking into account wind and neighboring transfer impacts. The model can also identify ways of calculating the intended emission levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The results indicate that haze concentration control targets will not be attained by following the NAPCAP, and that the amount of progress needed to meet the targets is unrealistic.

Moreover, total energy consumption and CO2 emissions in China will continue to increase due to the rapid growth of industrialization and urbanization. Therefore, vigorously developing the high–tech industry becomes an inevitable choice to reduce CO2 emissions at the moment or in the future. However, ignoring the existing nonlinear links between economic variables, most scholars use traditional linear models to explore the impact of the high–tech industry on CO2 emissions from an aggregate perspective. Few studies have focused on nonlinear relationships and regional differences in China. Based on panel data of 1998–2014, this study uses the nonparametric additive regression model to explore the nonlinear effect of the high–tech industry from a regional perspective. The estimated results show that the residual sum of squares (SSR) of the nonparametric additive regression model in the eastern, central and western regions are 0.693, 0.054 and 0.085 respectively, which are much less those that of the traditional linear regression model (3.158, 4.227 and 7.196). This verifies that the nonparametric additive regression model has a better fitting effect. Specifically, the high–tech industry produces an inverted “U–shaped” nonlinear impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, but a positive “U–shaped” nonlinear effect in the central and western regions. Therefore, the nonlinear impact of the high–tech industry on CO2 emissions in the three regions should be given adequate attention in developing effective abatement policies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 emissions; Nonparametric additive regression model; The high–tech industry","Carbon; Energy utilization; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Additive regression; Economic variables; Linear regression models; Non-linear impact; Non-linear relationships; Regional differences; Residual sum of squares; Total energy consumption; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997701912

We also look at the energy transition (from primitive fuels to advanced fuels) caused by economic development, as well as the mitigation potential of greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. Several studies have provided evidence of a positive correlation between income and per capita final energy use at the national level. In addition to income, demographic factors such as household size and education level have also been suggested to have influences on urban energy use. In this study, we consider various socio-economic indicators to analyze their influences on household energy use. Considering the economic and climate diversity across China's provincial regions, our analysis is based on the 31 provincial regions and examines the emissions pathways of 31 provincial regions. We first apply a multiple linear regression analysis on historical panel data to determine the correlations between socio-economic indicators and domestic energy sources. Next, we use the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM/Enduse) to estimate mitigation potential due to energy transition and sustainable policies. The results suggest that income and education levels are major drivers that have a significant impact on household energy choices both in rural and urban areas. In rural areas, climate and energy resource potential also have an impact on the choices of biomass energy use. Without consideration of energy transition constraints, future estimation of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be greatly overestimated or underestimated depending on the socioeconomic status of the province. It is important to note that the way that we consider energy transition constraints also significantly affects the air pollutants' emissions of the household sector due to biomass consumption, especially on particulate matter 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) emissions. Furthermore, implementation of efficient technologies contributes to achieving China's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and brings the co-benefits of air pollutants' emission reductions. © 2017 by the authors.","Chinese provinces; Energy ladder; Household energy; INDC; Scenario analysis","atmospheric pollution; economic development; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental technology; greenhouse gas; household energy; income; residential location; scenario analysis; socioeconomic indicator; sustainable development; urban development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018476532

However, little is known about carbon stocks in poplar–maize intercropping systems in arid regions of China. This study was conducted in the temperate desert region of northwestern China, a region with large area of poplar–maize intercropping systems. The objective of this study was to assess biomass production and carbon stock under three poplar–maize intercropping systems (configuration A, 177 trees ha−1; configuration B, 231 trees ha−1; and configuration C, 269 trees ha−1). We observed a significant difference in the carbon stock of poplar trees between the three configurations, with the highest value of 36.46 t ha−1 in configuration C. The highest carbon stock of maize was achieved in configuration B, which was significantly higher than configuration A. The grain yield was highest in configuration A, but there was no significant difference from the other two configurations. In the soil system (0–100 cm depth), the total carbon stock was highest in configuration C (77.37 t ha−1). The results of this study suggest that configuration C is the optimum agroforestry system in terms of both economic benefits and carbon sequestration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon concentration; Carbon stock; Crop yield; Poplar–maize intercropping system","agroforestry; biomass; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); crop yield; deciduous tree; greenhouse gas; intercropping; maize; temperate environment; China; Populus; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961786680

Therefore, from the provincial value chain perspective, using input-output tables from China in 2002, 2007, and 2010, this study constructs models to calculate the CO2 emissions responsibility of each province under the production, consumption, and value capture principles, respectively. Empirical results indicate that Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Henan bear the most responsibility for CO2 emissions under the three principles in China, while Hainan and Qinghai have the least responsibility. However, there is a great difference in the proportion of carbon emissions responsibility for each province during the same period under different principles or different periods under the same principle. For consumption-oriented areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Guangdong, the production principle is more favorable, and the consumption principle is more beneficial for production-oriented provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi. However, the value capture principle strikes a compromise of the CO2 emissions responsibility of each province between the production and consumption principles, and it shares the CO2 emissions responsibility based on the actual value captured by each province in the provincial value chain. The value capture principle is conducive to the fair and reasonable division of CO2 emissions rights of each province by sectors, as well as the construction of a standardized carbon emissions rights trading market. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon responsibility sharing; Consumption principle; Production principle; Provincial value chain; Value capture principle","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; emission inventory; emissions trading; empirical analysis; global warming; input-output analysis; national planning; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Guangdong; Hainan; Hebei; Henan; Jiangsu; Liaoning; Nei Monggol; Qinghai; Shaanxi; Shandong; Shanxi; Tianjin; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017391974

In this study, soil C and nitrogen (N) were measured 13 years after cropland conversion in a karst area, southwest China. Four restoration strategies were included, i.e., (i) restoration with an economic tree species Toona sinensis (TS), (ii) restoration with Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass (GG), (iii) restoration with a combination of Zenia insignis and Guimu-1 hybrid elephant grass (ZG), and iv) spontaneous regeneration (SR). Cropland under maize-soybean rotation (CR) was used as reference and the space-for-time substitution approach was adopted to evaluate soil C and N stock (0–15 cm) change. Soil C stocks in TS and SR were elevated by 40% and 50%, respectively, relative to CR, while those in GG and ZG were not significantly changed. Soil N stocks in GG were not significantly changed, but stocks in TS, ZG and SR were enhanced by 130%, 81% and 117%, respectively, relative to CR. Significant correlation was found between soil C and N stock changes with rate of relative N stock change greater than that of C stock change. Similar to soil N stock, nitrate concentration, net nitrification rate and δ15N values in TS, ZG and SR were greater than those in GG or CR. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that exchangeable calcium was the soil variable mainly responsible for the dynamics of both soil C and N. Our results indicate that plantation with economic tree species and spontaneous regeneration are likely equally effective in soil C sequestration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Accumulation; Cropland abandonment; Karst region; Soil organic matter; Spontaneous regeneration; Tree plantation","Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Global warming; Landforms; Linear regression; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Restoration; Soils; Accumulation; Cropland abandonment; Karst regions; Soil organic matters; Spontaneous regeneration; Tree plantations; Soil pollution; carbon cycle; concentration (composition); crop rotation; global warming; grass; karst; land use change; maize; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; organic carbon; plantation forestry; regeneration; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soybean; China; Glycine max; Pennisetum purpureum; Toona sinensis; Zea mays; Zenia insignis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012085414

It is unknown whether or not biocrusts will decrease soil moisture and result in the degradation of artificially planted shrubs in semiarid climates. In a semiarid watershed on the Loess Plateau of China, we selected 18 sampling sites in artificial shrublands and measured at each the soil moisture from 0 to 200 cm depth under bare land, moss-dominated biocrusts, artificially planted Artemisia ordosica, A. ordosica with biocrusts, and dead A. ordosica with biocrusts. We also estimated the water-holding capacity and infiltrability of the soil with and without biocrusts. The A. ordosica with biocrusts had 24.4% lower biomass and 18.9% lower leaf area index than those without biocrusts, suggesting negative effects of biocrusts on these shrubs. Moreover, the biocrusts underneath A. ordosica decreased soil moisture 14.8% on average (2.6% vs. 3.1%; p < 0.01) due to their significant higher water-holding capacity (≥ 21.6%) and lower infiltrability (50.4%), compared to the area without biocrusts. Most importantly, the area with biocrusts and dead A. ordosica had similar soil moisture to the area with biocrusts and live A. ordosica, suggesting that the decreased soil moisture under the biocrusts persists after the death of A. ordosica. Our results suggest that biocrusts reduce soil water resources available to the artificially planted shrubs, thus increasing the risks of shrub mortality and further land degradation. The high coverage of moss-dominated biocrusts appears to be a dominant factor in soil moisture variations in artificial shrublands under semiarid climates, making the soil water balance more vulnerable in this region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artemisia ordosica; Biological soil crust; Microbiotic crust; Soil water balance; Soil water regime; Vegetation degradation","Moisture; Plants (botany); Soil surveys; Soils; Water resources; Artemisia ordosica; Biological soil crusts; Microbiotic crust; Soil water balance; Soil water regime; Vegetation degradation; Soil moisture; biogenic material; decomposition; mortality; semiarid region; shrub; soil degradation; soil microorganism; soil moisture; water retention; China; Loess Plateau; Artemisia ordosica; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008402760

However, knowledge about the economic benefits and cost-efficiency of ecosystem-based approaches is still limited. The objective of this paper is to enhance understanding of synergies and trade-offs between climate policy related measures and nature conservation and how ecosystem-based approaches can contribute to both climate as well as biodiversity and ESS conservation goals, through overall economic analyses to inform balanced decision making. The paper builds upon the current state of knowledge as brought together by contributors to the German national TEEB-study “Natural Capital and Climate Policy – Synergies and Conflicts”. We present options and lessons learned from major land-use sectors of high relevance for ecosystem-based approaches to climate change, namely agriculture, peatlands, forests, wetlands and coastal and marine ecosystems. Based on these assessments, we argue that successful implementation of an ecosystem-based climate policy requires effective coordination and coherence between sectors and their respective policies, for example agriculture, forestry and energy. We identify specific targets for an ecosystem-based climate policy and options for achieving this coherent implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Climate policy; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Ecosystem-based mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015018984

We surveyed the distribution of these three species and their forage plants in the nature reserve between 2012 and 2013. Using the Maxent model, we projected the potential distribution of the Tibetan antelope, wild Tibetan donkey, and wild yak and their forage plants based on the four representative concentration pathways set by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for 2070.

We found that projected food availability associated with climate niche would be more realistic for ungulates distribution projections under climate change. Our results demonstrated that future climate change would greatly change the habitats of three threatened endemic ungulates and their forage plants. The ranges of climate niche projected for the Tibetan antelope, wild Tibetan donkey, and wild yak would be reduced by 44, 7, and 20%, respectively, with future climate change under representative concentration pathways 2.6 scenario. Among them, the ranges of Tibetan antelope and wild Tibetan donkey would reduce even more under warmer scenarios, but wild yak would be opposite. The projected distribution ranges of forage plants reduced with the climate change in the future. The combined effects of shifting climate niche and food resources would lead to the reduction of habitats for Tibetan antelope, wild Tibetan donkey, and wild yak by 82, 34, and 30% under representative concentration pathways 2.6. However, conditions would be worse for Tibetan antelope and wild Tibetan donkey but better for wild yak under other scenarios. We suggested that future conservation efforts should be focused on improving habitat quality (including food availability) and finding alternative habitats for the three ungulates especially Tibetan antelope and wild Tibetan donkey. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.",,"Biodiversity; Chemical contamination; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Population distribution; Uncertainty analysis; Altun Mountain National Nature Reserve; Combined effect; Food availability; Habitat quality; Model uncertainties; Narrow distribution; Potential distributions; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; conservation status; food availability; forage; future prospect; geographical distribution; habitat availability; habitat quality; niche; prediction; ungulate; Altun National Nature Reserve; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Xinjiang Uygur; Bos grunniens mutus; Equus asinus; Equus kiang; Pantholops hodgsonii; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016469100

Based on a multi-regional input-output model, we calculated EEPT for China's 30 provinces in 2002, 2007 and 2010, and we attempted to determine the drivers of EEPT. The results showed that, during this period, the ratio of EEPT to production-based emissions increased over time, reaching 40.24% in 2010. In consideration of its important role in carbon emissions, we analyzed the factors attributable to EEPT through structure decomposition analysis. The decomposition results showed that final demand and carbon emission intensity were two major factors in EEPT, while the final demand in other provinces and the carbon emission intensity in the local province were major factors for Emissions embodied in provincial exports and the final demand in the local province and the carbon emission intensity in other provinces were major factors for Emissions embodied in provincial imports. Regarding the differences among the EEPT of different provinces, changes in the structure of trade were the primary reason. © 2017 Wu, Wang.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"Article; carbon footprint; China; decomposition; emissions embodied in provincial trade; energy balance; environmental policy; global climate; industrial production; mathematical model; organization; regionalization; responsibility; rural area; structure analysis; commercial phenomena; China; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018506014

This study assessed the impact of congestion charging on traffic and emissions in Beijing using macroscopic traffic simulation and vehicle emissions calculation. Multiple testing scenarios were developed with assumptions in different charging zone sizes, public transit service levels and charging methods. Our analysis results showed that congestion charging in Beijing may increase public transit use by approximately 13%, potentially reduce CO and HC emissions by 60–70%, and reduce NOx emissions by 35–45% within the charging zone. However, congestion charging may also result in increased travel activities and emissions outside of the charging zone and a slight increase in emissions for the entire urban area. The size of charging zone, charging method, and charging rate are key factors that directly influence the impact of congestion charging; improved public transit service needs to be considered as a complementary approach with congestion charging.

A quantitative estimation of health effects attributed to PM2.5 in China is urgently required, particularly because it has the largest population and high air pollution levels. Based on the remote sensing-derived PM2.5 and grid population data, we estimated the acute health effects of PM2.5 in China using an exposure-response function. The results suggest the following: (1) The proportion of the population exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations (&gt;35 μg/m3) increased consistently from 2000 to 2011, and the population exposed to concentrations above the threshold defined by World Health Organization (WHO) (&gt;10 μg/m3) rose from 1,191,191,943 to 1,290,562,965. (2) The number of deaths associated with PM2.5 exposure increased steadily from 107,608 in 2000 to 173,560 in 2010, with larger numbers in the eastern region. (3) PM2.5 health effects decreased in three pollution control scenarios estimated for 2017, i.e., the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) scenario, the APPCAP under WHO IT-1 scenario (35 μg/m3), and the APPCAP under WHO IT-3 scenario (15 μg/m3), which indicates that pollution control can effectively reduce PM2.5 effects on mortality. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; Fine particulate matter; Health effects; Mortality; Population; Quantitative estimation","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; mortality; particle size; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution exposure; population structure; World Health Organization; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; epidemiology; human; particulate matter; pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014770232

Using least squares and quantile regressions, it is found that the changing generation mix used for producing electricity exerts a strong influence on wholesale prices. This is especially the case with prices expected to increase markedly with the increasing utilization of gas-fired generation used to support the intermittent and variable production from renewables and from the policy-driven use of renewables wind power associated with the current renewable energy target and carbon taxation in Australia. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon taxes; electricity supply; generation mix; greenhouse gas emissions; renewable energy target","Commerce; Costs; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Public policy; Taxation; Wind power; Carbon taxes; Electricity supply; Generation mix; National electricity markets; Regional electricity markets; Renewable energies; Spot electricity prices; Wholesale electricity; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014639605

The sorption experiment tests were conducted via a fixed-bed reactor with different temperatures ranging between 30°C and 60°C at atmospheric pressure. Maximum CO2 sorption capacity was observed at low temperature of 30°C, where 5.24 mmol could be adsorbed by one gram of MIL-127(Fe) and 4.95 mmol CO2 could be adsorbed by one gram of MIL-88A. The presence of moisture in the gas mixture affected CO2 sorption capacity by reducing CO2 capacity as high as 0.5 mmol CO2 per one gram sorbent. In this work, a dynamic breakthrough model was applied to investigate adsorption behavior of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and of the system. The predicted model showed good agreement with experimental results; the Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with our sorption system, suggesting one molecule of CO2 is held at localized sites of the MOFs, which plausibly be at unsaturated Fe2+ metal ion site. Rate of sorption was found to increase with increasing sorption temperature for either intra-particle diffusivity or external mass transfer.

Recent studies revealed the potential use of biochar-amended soil in landfill final covers to promote methane oxidation and odor reduction. However, the effects of biochar application ratio, compaction water content (CWC), and degree of compaction (DOC) on soil-water retention characteristics of biochar-amended clay (BAC) at high soil suction (dry condition) are not well understood. The present study aims to overcome this knowledge gap. Materials and methods: Soil suction was induced using vapor equilibrium technique by a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber, and the water desorption (drying) and adsorption (wetting) water retention curves (WRCs) of compacted pure kaolin clay and peanut shell BAC with different biochar application ratios (0, 5, and 20 %, w/w), DOCs (80, 90, and 100 %), and CWCs (30 and 35 %) were measured. The correlations between these factors and the gravimetric water content were analyzed by three-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey HSD test. The soil micro-structure was studied by scanning electronic microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results and discussion: Measured WRCs of BAC suggest that the soil-water retention capacity at high suction range (48.49–124.56 MPa) was in general increased, upon biochar application. The BAC compacted with CWC of 35 % at low (80 %) and high (100 %) DOCs for the 5 % BAC were increased by 7.30 and 9.77 %, when compared with clay, while the increases of 20 % BAC were 39.89 and 59.20 %, respectively. This is attributed to the embedded effects of clay particles in biochar pores, which reduce the total pore space of BAC. The soil-water retention capacity of BAC was also increased with CWC and decreased with DOC. The results of three-way ANOVA analysis show that the effects of DOC and biochar ratio on soil gravimetric water content was significant (p < 0.05) only at 48.49 MPa on drying path. For other induced suctions, only effects of CWC were significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Biochar application increases soil-water retention capacity of the BAC at high soil suction (48.49–124.56 MPa) (dry condition) at both low (80 %) and high DOC (100 %). The soil-water retention capacity of 20 % BAC was much higher than that of 5 % BAC. BAC is a potential alternative landfill final cover soil with a higher soil-water retention capacity to be used in dry areas or regions with a long period of evaporation event. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biochar-amended clay; Compacted soil; Landfill final cover; Soil suction; Soil-water characteristic; Water retention capacity","adsorption; agricultural soil; charcoal; clay soil; compaction; desorption; fertilizer application; kaolin; landfill; pore space; soil amendment; soil water; suction; variance analysis; water content; water retention; Arachis hypogaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962033198

The growth of the PV systems on the low-voltage distribution networks can create voltage unbalance, voltage rise, and reverse-power flow. Usually these issues happen with little fluctuation. However, it tends to fluctuate severely as Malaysia is a region with low clear sky index. A large amount of clouds often passes over the country, hence making the solar irradiance to be highly scattered. Therefore, the PV power output fluctuates substantially. These issues can lead to the malfunction of the electronic based equipment, reduction in the network efficiency and improper operation of the power protection system. At the current practice, the amount of PV system installed on the distribution network is constraint by the utility company. As a result, this can limit the reduction of carbon footprint. Therefore, energy storage system is proposed as a solution for these power quality issues. To ensure an effective operation of the distribution network with PV system, a fuzzy control system is developed and implemented to govern the operation of an energy storage system. The fuzzy driven energy storage system is able to mitigate the fluctuating voltage rise and voltage unbalance on the electrical grid by actively manipulates the flow of real power between the grid and the batteries. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy driven energy storage system, an experimental network integrated with 7.2kWp PV system was setup. Several case studies are performed to evaluate the response of the proposed solution to mitigate voltage rises, voltage unbalance and reduce the amount of reverse power flow under highly intermittent PV power output. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017609919

In this study, we tested a new approach, combining a process-based model with regression models, to create EPFs to evaluate water storage and local climate regulation from a green infrastructure project on the Yongding River in Beijing, China. Seven artificial lakes and wetlands were established to improve local water storage and human comfort; evapotranspiration (ET) regulates both services. Managers want to minimize the trade-off between water losses and cooling to sustain water supplies while lowering the heat index (HI) to improve human comfort. We selected human benefit indicators using water storage targets and Beijing's HI, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to determine the change in ET from the new ecosystems. We created EPFs to quantify the ecosystem services as marginal values [Δfinal ecosystem service/Δecohydrological process]: (1) Δwater loss (lake evaporation/volume)/Δdepth and (2) Δsummer HI/ΔET. We estimate the new ecosystems increased local ET by 0.7 mm/d (20.3 W/m2) on the Yongding River. However, ET rates are causing water storage shortfalls while producing no improvements in human comfort. The shallow lakes/wetlands are vulnerable to drying when inflow rates fluctuate, low depths lead to higher evaporative losses, causing water storage shortfalls with minimal cooling effects. We recommend managers make the lakes deeper to increase water storage, and plant shade trees to improve human comfort in the parks. © 2017.

Although residential solar has recently become more affordable, market penetration in the U.S. remains relatively low. This study proposes a theoretical framework for investigating the psychological and social determinants of interest in residential solar drawn from three theories that may explain the decision to pursue it: diffusion of innovations theory, theory of planned behavior, and value-belief-norm theory. We test this framework using survey data from 904 non- adopter homeowners, with the aim of identifying potential levers for intervention. Overall, we find that consumers see solar electricity in multiple ways: as an environmental benefit, a consumer good, and an innovative technology. Notably, individuals who trust installers and believe solar will be personally beneficial are more likely to consider contacting an installer, as are individuals drawn to novel products. Proenvironmental personal norms indirectly increase interest through perceived personal benefits, suggesting that marketing efforts aimed at environmentally-concerned individuals may need to emphasize non-environmental benefits. The results also support leveraging trusted social networks to convey the benefits of solar. We conclude by discussing the value of the integrated framework along with implications for policymakers and marketers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Diffusion of innovations; Environmental decision making; Renewable energy; Residential solar photovoltaics; Theory of planned behavior; Value-belief- norm theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010280695

Water in each of its thermodynamic phases interacts with solar and thermal radiation and is the cause for strong climatic feedbacks. Thus, assessments of the habitable zone require models to include a complete treatment of the hydrological cycle over geologic time. Here, we use the Community Atmosphere Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study the evolution of climate for an Earth-like planet at constant CO2, under a wide range of stellar fluxes from F-, G-, and K-dwarf main sequence stars. Around each star we find four stable climate states defined by mutually exclusive global mean surface temperatures (T s); snowball (T s ≤ 235 K), waterbelt (235 K ≤ T s ≤ 250 K), temperate (275 K ≤ T s ≤ 315 K), and moist greenhouse (T s ≥ 330 K). Each is separated by abrupt climatic transitions. Waterbelt, temperate, and cooler moist greenhouse climates can maintain open-ocean against both sea ice albedo and hydrogen escape processes respectively, and thus constitute habitable worlds. We consider the warmest possible habitable planet as having T s ∼ 355 K, at which point diffusion limited water-loss could remove an Earth ocean in ∼1 Gyr. Without long timescale regulation of non-condensable greenhouse species at Earth-like temperatures and pressures, such as CO2, habitability can be maintained for an upper limit of ∼2.2, ∼2.4, and ∼4.7 Gyr around F-, G-, and K-dwarf stars respectively, due to main sequence brightening. © 2017.

Two different light-emitting diode (LED) lamps as an example for typical electronic mass-market products are optimized. Currently, LED lamps are state of the art in the range of efficient lamps. But long-term experiences concerning their immunity against HF disturbances are not investigated so far. In order to assess the additional stress on the built-in components of the LED lamps caused by HF disturbances, the power supplies of two exemplary LED lamps are considered and their input current, the current of the electrolytic capacitor and the current of the LED are depicted. Based on these measurements, the electrolytic capacitor can be identified as one mainly weak point of the LED lamp’s power supply. Subsequently, possible measures to increase the immunity of the identified stressed components and the LED lamp by itself are presented.

Africa is recognized as a particularly vulnerable continent to environmental and climate change since a large portion of its population is poor and reliant on rain-fed agriculture. We use a climate-sensitive approach to model sub-Saharan African violence in the past (geolocated to the nearest settlements) and then forecast future violence using sociopolitical factors such as population size and political rights (governance), coupled with temperature anomalies. Our baselinemodel is calibrated using 1° griddedmonthly data from 1980 to 2012 at a finer spatio-temporal resolution than existing conflict forecasts. We presentmultiple forecasts of violence under alternative climate change scenarios (optimistic and current global trajectories), of political rights scenarios (improvement and decline), and population projections (low and high fertility). We evaluate alternate shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) by plotting violence forecasts over time and by detailed mapping of recent and future levels of violence by decade. The forecasts indicate that a growing population and rising temperatures will lead to higher levels of violence in sub-Saharan Africa if political rights do not improve. If political rights continue to improve at the same rate as observed over the last three decades, there is reason for optimism that overall levels of violence will hold steady or even decline in Africa, in spite of projected population increases and rising temperatures. © The Author(s) 2017.","Disaggregated violence; Environmental change; Governance; Multilevel models; Population projections; Socioeconomic pathways",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018260177

We investigate these couplings in the East River, CO, a high-elevation shale-dominated catchment in the Rocky Mountains, using concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for major cations, anions, and organic carbon. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) displays a positive C-Q relationship with clockwise hysteresis, indicating mobilization and depletion of DOC in the upper soil horizons and emphasizing the importance of shallow flow paths during snowmelt. Cation and anion concentrations demonstrate that carbonate weathering, which dominates solute fluxes, is promoted by both sulfuric acid derived from pyrite oxidation in the shale bedrock and carbonic acid derived from subsurface respiration. Sulfuric acid weathering dominates during base flow conditions when waters infiltrate below the inferred pyrite oxidation front, whereas carbonic acid weathering plays a dominant role during snowmelt as a result of shallow flow paths. Differential C-Q relationships between solutes suggest that infiltrating waters approach calcite saturation before reaching the pyrite oxidation front, after which sulfuric acid reduces carbonate alkalinity. This reduction in alkalinity results in CO2 outgassing when waters equilibrate to surface conditions, and reduces the riverine export of carbon and alkalinity by roughly 33% annually. Future changes in snowmelt dynamics that control the balance of carbonic and sulfuric acid weathering may substantially alter carbon cycling in the East River. Ultimately, we demonstrate that differential C-Q relationships between major solutes can provide unique insights into the complex subsurface flow and biogeochemical dynamics that operate at catchment scales. © 2017.

This study is the first to systematically quantify these losses in relation to land use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production and consumption of (inter)nationally traded goods and services by presenting consumption-based biodiversity losses, in short biodiversity footprint, for 45 countries and world regions globally. Our results showed that (i) the biodiversity loss per citizen shows large variations among countries, with higher values when per-capita income increases; (ii) the share of biodiversity losses due to GHG emissions in the biodiversity footprint increases with income; (iii) food consumption is the most important driver of biodiversity loss in most of the countries and regions, with a global average of 40%; (iv) more than 50% of the biodiversity loss associated with consumption in developed economies occurs outside their territorial boundaries; and (v) the biodiversity footprint per dollar consumed is lower for wealthier countries. The insights provided by our analysis might support policymakers in developing adequate responses to avert further losses of biodiversity when population and incomes increase. Both the mitigation of GHG emissions and land use related reduction options in production and consumption should be considered in strategies to protect global biodiversity.

The increasing prevalence rates of obesity among youth, especially among low income and ethnic minorities, highlight the need to develop effective and innovative intervention approaches that promote positive supportive environments across different contexts for at-risk youth. We propose that the integration of Social Cognitive Theory, Family Systems Theory, and Self-Determination Theory offers a useful framework for understanding how individual, family, and social-environmental-level factors contribute to the development of nurturing environments. In this paper, we summarize evidence-based randomized controlled trials that integrate positive parenting, motivational, and behavioral skills strategies in different contexts, including primary care, home, community, and school-based settings. Taken together, these studies suggest that youth and parents are most likely to benefit when youth receive individual-level behavioral skills, family-level support and communication, and autonomous motivational support from the broader social environment.

In the Australian sector, the SAZ exports large quantities of organic carbon from the surface ocean, despite lower algal biomass accumulation in surface waters than other Southern Ocean sectors. We present the first analysis of diatom and coccolithophore assemblages and seasonality, as well as the first annual quantification of bulk organic components of captured material at the base of the mixed layer (500 m depth) in the SAZ. Sediment traps were moored in the SAZ southwest of Tasmania as part of the long-term SAZ Project for one year (September 2003 to September 2004). Annual mass flux at 500 m and 2000 m was composed mainly of calcium carbonate, while biogenic silica made up on average &lt;10% of material captured in the traps. Organic carbon flux was estimated at 1.1 g m−2 y−1 at 500 m, close to the estimated global mean carbon flux. Low diatom fluxes and high fluxes of coccoliths were consistent with low biogenic silica and high calcium carbonate fluxes, respectively. Diatoms and coccoliths were identified to species level. Diatom and coccolithophore sinking assemblages reflected some seasonal ecological succession. A theoretical scheme of diatom succession in live assemblages is compared to successional patterns presented in sediment traps. This study provides a unique, direct measurement of the biogeochemical fluxes and their main biological carbon vectors just below the winter mixed layer depth at which effective sequestration of carbon occurs. Comparison of these results with previous sediment trap deployments at the same site at deeper depths (i.e. 1000, 2000 and 3800 m) documents the changes particle fluxes experience in the lower “twilight zone” where biological processes and remineralisation of carbon reduce the efficiency of carbon sequestration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coccolithophores; Diatoms; Mass flux; Sediment traps; Southern Ocean; Subantarctic Zone","Algae; Biogeochemistry; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Mass transfer; Phytoplankton; Sediment traps; Sediments; Silica; Biogeochemical fluxes; Coccolithophores; Diatoms; Ecological successions; Organic carbon fluxes; Southern ocean; Subantarctic zones; Winter mixed layer depth; Organic carbon; assembly rule; biomass; calcium carbonate; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; coccolith; diatom; mixed layer; organic carbon; phytoplankton; sediment trap; subantarctic region; succession; Australia; Southern Ocean; Tasmania; algae; Bacillariophyta; Haptophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010510056

HC adsorbers for gasoline applications typically contain zeolite materials for HC storage and a noble metal-based three-way catalyst (TWC) for oxidation of stored HCs, both of which are susceptible to hydrothermal aging. In the present study, state-of-the-art HC adsorbers from two catalyst suppliers were evaluated for their cold-start HC emission reduction potential. After aging at 800 °C, the HC adsorbers tested provided reasonably high conversion efficiencies for aromatics and a moderate level of conversion for olefins but were not able to control paraffins to a significant degree. This resulted in a total HC conversion efficiency of 40–50% over the best HC adsorber for the simulated feed stream used in this study. The overall adsorber performance can be improved somewhat by increasing the noble metal loading or the O2 concentration in the feed stream and was found to be sensitive to adsorber volume (space velocity). After aging at 900 °C, however, none of the HC adsorbers tested was able to convert more than 10% of the HC in the feed. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adsorber; Durability; Hydrocarbon; Palladium; Storage; Zeolite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031428837

Especially in relation to global climate change, cities play a major role considering the impacts of extreme heat waves on the population. For urban planners, it is important to know which types of urban structures are beneficial for a comfortable urban climate and which actions can be taken to improve urban climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to differ between not only urban and rural environments, but also between different levels of urban densification. To compare these built-up types within different cities worldwide, Stewart and Oke developed the concept of local climate zones (LCZ) defined by morphological characteristics. The original LCZ scheme often has considerable problems when adapted to European cities with historical city centers, including narrow streets and irregular patterns. In this study, a method to bridge the gap between a classical land use/land cover (LULC) classification and the LCZ scheme is presented. Multitemporal Landsat 8 data are used to create a high accuracy LULC map, which is linked to the LCZ by morphological parameters derived from a high-resolution digital surface model and cadastral data. A bijective combination of the different classification schemes could not be achieved completely due to overlapping threshold values and the spatially homogeneous distribution of morphological parameters, but the attribution of LCZ to the LULC classification was successful. © The Authors.

Historically, oceanographers have relied primarily on in vitro measurements of 14C uptake (14C-PP) as a proxy for PP. Yet it can be difficult to reconcile PP rates measured in vitro with in situ rates such as those based on oxygen. Here we present diel cycles of optically derived particulate organic carbon (POC) measured in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. We have calculated gross production (OPTGP) from the daytime increase and nighttime decrease of optically derived POC, assuming that the observed change in POC represents the sum of PP and community losses. We have compared these estimates to parallel 14C-PP incubations and considered sources of difference. We find that OPTGP is strongly related to 14C-PP in this region and that growth and loss rates of POC are tightly coupled. ©2017.

Moreover, it explicates which factors constitute this context and how these factors vary across the case municipalities. National climate adaptation policy in Norway can currently be characterized as top down, providing standardized requirements and advice to municipalities. However, Norwegian municipalities vary greatly with respect to physical conditions, organizational resources, and societal needs. They are autonomous to a great extent and are almost solely responsible for developing climate policy and planning within their own territories. Therefore, municipalities adapt national policies to their own context, reflecting local physiographic, organizational, and resource challenges, but these local translations are not fully recognized by national and sectoral actors. This paper underscores that the significant variation in contextual factors between municipalities is not sufficiently addressed and understood by national and sectoral governmental authorities. With the identified variation of the contextual factors across the case municipalities, an adaptive comanagement strategy within a multilevel governance system is suggested as a suitable framework to ensure a proactive approach to local adaptation, that is, mutual understanding and better cooperation between the national and local levels. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; comanagement; environmental planning; environmental policy; governance approach; national planning; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034865266

Land-use and transport planning practice both continue to discuss land-use change primarily in terms of the volume of new building. Land-use policy has focused on co-location of development for related uses, while transport policy relies on vehicle technologies for reducing transport emissions. However, turnover in occupation of the existing stock of housing (‘churn’) is about ten times the rate of new build (and churn of businesses and jobs may well exceed net change in housing), but these factors have received little attention. This paper concludes that a broader concept of land-use, which takes churn into account, could improve the capacity of both land-use and transport policies to reduce transport emissions. What is good for emissions is good for most other aspects of urban policy, so such a concept could also improve the economic and social well-being of cities. As with any concept, however, its impact will depend on the policies and actions that flow from it. © 2017, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

(1) Islander perceptions of climate change and the information sources on which these are based. (2) Migration to richer countries, which dominates popular media articles, so that scholars from a wide range of disciplines have given their perspectives on it.

(5) Social and cultural issues arising from the above. This paper provides an overview of these and some related themes of importance to SIDS, including ocean acidification and land degradation. Researchers based in the SIDS and regional organisations have an important role in recognising these issues and in developing the local skills base needed to deal with them.

Some of these practices have been degraded and some assisted by modernisation. Through their effects on the island environment, these hazards have a range of socio-economic impacts on food (fisheries and crops) and water supply, tourism, and coastal buildings and infrastructure. The varied impacts of climate change not only exacerbate those hazards but also raise new threats, such as sea level rise and ocean acidification, that have no precedent in the past 500 years, and for which there are therefore no traditional adaptations, although Pacific innate ingenuity and resilience remains strong. These issues are particularly acute for the low-lying atoll countries whose continued existence is threatened by sea level rise, but also affect those that live on higher islands in coastal settlements, where most of their population is concentrated. Climate change thus sharpens social and cultural issues of equity (reflecting disparities in location, income, education, gender, health and age), made even more acute by increased levels of voluntary or forced migration within, and even more so beyond, island country boundaries. Consequently, many islanders see climate change as a moral challenge to the richer countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the problem. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptation; Climate change; Pacific Islands; Small islands; Social impacts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977072788

This paper argues that the specific conditions in shrinking middle-size cities create an especially difficult environment for energy renovations. Using empirical data from the shrinking City of Delitzsch, Germany, it is hypothesized that buildings with poor energy efficiency are often inhabited by tenants or owners who impede retrofit activities due to their socio-economic conditions. The research analyzes the relation between buildings with a high potential for final energy reduction and a concentration of low-income, older or empty-nest households. The analysis examines this relation not only on an aggregated city level but also on the level of the city's districts to identify renovation ‘hot spots’ in the city. Specific challenges are identified for building renovations in shrinking cities due to a high concentration of possible barriers in the relevant housing stock. As a further consequence, those households with a low net-equivalent income are also at risk of energy poverty. In order to achieve a low-carbon and just society, possible actions are suggested for buildings with elevated barriers to energy renovation in shrinking cities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building stock; demographics; renovation; retrofit; shrinking cities; wicked issues","Energy efficiency; Housing; Retrofitting; Shrinkage; Building stocks; demographics; renovation; retrofit; Shrinking city; wicked issues; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962352813

Its warming rate was only recently matched by recent warming in the region. Unlike recent warming largely attributable to anthropogenic radiative forcing, atmospheric warming during the ETCAW was strongest in the mid-troposphere and is believed to be triggered by an exceptional case of natural climate variability. Nevertheless, ultimate mechanisms and causes for the ETCAW are still under discussion. Here we use state of the art multi-member global circulation models, reanalysis and reconstruction datasets to investigate the internal atmospheric dynamics of the ETCAW. We investigate the role of boreal winter mid-tropospheric heat transport and circulation in providing the energy for the large scale warming. Analyzing sensible heat flux components and regional differences, climate models are not able to reproduce the heat flux evolution found in reanalysis and reconstruction datasets. These datasets show an increase of stationary eddy heat flux and a decrease of transient eddy heat flux during the ETCAW. Moreover, tropospheric circulation analysis reveals the important role of both the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors in the convergence of southerly air masses into the Arctic during the warming event. Subsequently, it is suggested that the internal dynamics of the atmosphere played a major role in the formation in the ETCAW. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arctic climate; Arctic warming; Circulation; Climate change; Heat flux; Reanalysis; Reconstructions; Troposphere","atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate variation; reconstruction; sensible heat flux; troposphere; twentieth century; warming; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016249478

Building adaptive capacity should be an important component of projects supporting CBA. The literature establishes that adaptive capacity is highly context and culture specific. However, to date, there has been little research into the factors and processes that enable adaptive capacity in Pacific island communities. This paper discusses the Pacific Adaptive Capacity Analysis Framework, a theoretical framework developed to guide assessment of adaptive capacity for the purposes of supporting CBA projects. The framework identifies seven broad factors and several sub-factors of Pacific-specific adaptive capacity: (1) human capital; (2) social capital; (3) belief systems, worldviews, and values; (4) resources and their distribution; (5) options for adaptation, livelihood, and food supply; (6) information and awareness; and (7) history of dealing with climate stress. The paper presents a case study of adaptive capacity from a community in the Solomon Islands and concludes that unlike many adaptive capacity determinants identified in the broader international literature, function-based (factors shaping ability to access and use resources) and cognitive (for example, values and belief systems) determinants are of particular relevance in the Pacific community social and cultural context. The key to building upon cognitive and function-based aspects of adaptive capacity is increasing the ability of people to liaise with external support organisations to plan and acquire resources for adaptation on their own terms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Community-based adaptation; Pacific islands; Solomon Islands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982260939

Salicylic acid indeed initiates pathogenesis-related gene expression and synthesis of defensive compounds involved in local resistance and systemic acquired resistance. Salicylic acid may thus be used against pathogen virulence, heavy metal stresses, salt stress, and toxicities of other elements. Applied salicylic acid improves photosynthesis, growth, and various other physiological and biochemical characteristics in stressed plants. Salicylic acid antagonizes the oxidative damaging effect of metal toxicity directly by acting as an antioxidant to scavenge the reactive oxygen species and by activating the antioxidant systems of plants and indirectly by reducing uptake of metals from their medium of growth.

Decision makers need reliable information on the impacts caused by these warming levels for climate mitigation and adaptation measures. We explore the changes in climate extremes, which are closely tied to economic losses and casualties, under 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming and their scenario dependence using three sets of ensemble global climate model simulations. A warming of 0.5 °C (from 1.5 °C to 2 °C) leads to significant increases in temperature and precipitation extremes in most regions. However, the projected changes in climate extremes under both warming levels highly depend on the pathways of emissions scenarios, with different greenhouse gas (GHG)/aerosol forcing ratio and GHG levels. Moreover, there are multifold differences in several heavily polluted regions, among the scenarios, in the changes in precipitation extremes due to an additional 0.5 °C warming from 1.5 °C to 2 °C. Our results demonstrate that the chemical compositions of emissions scenarios, not just the total radiative forcing and resultant warming level, must be considered when assessing the impacts of global 1.5/2 °C warming. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"accident; aerosol; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; precipitation; radiative forcing; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018944789

However, the mechanism through which the carbon cycle reaches the equilibrium state remains unclear. Moreover, the carbon cycle in most of the short–term field experiments rarely reaches the equilibrium state. In this study, a detachable carbon cycle (DCC) model was proposed to simulate the equilibrium state of each carbon pool. The model was established based on a pool–and–flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools, or carbon flow processes, each process could be detached from the main model and evaluated as an independent component. The environmental scalar algorithms of the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon budget model (InTEC) and Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) were incorporated in the DCC model. Four situations were compared using the two environmental scalar algorithms and model structure (9 vs. 14 carbon pools). Furthermore, the size and turnover time of each carbon pool were analyzed at the equilibrium state. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to investigate the responses of carbon density and equilibrium time to 12 key parameters of the model. Results indicated that the combination of the CABLE environmental scalar algorithm and 14 pools exhibited improved performance on carbon storage simulation than that of the other combinations, and the effect of the environmental scalar algorithm was considerably larger than that of the carbon pool number. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the carbon density of grassland and cropland was more vulnerable and sensitive to key parameters of the model than that of the other biomes. This study elucidates influencing factors and underlying control mechanisms in the carbon accumulation, and provides a framework for quantitative analysis of each component of the carbon cycle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pool; Carbon storage; Detachable carbon cycle model; Turnover time","Budget control; Cables; Forestry; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon accumulation; Carbon cycle models; Carbon pool; Carbon storage; Independent components; Scientific analysis; Terrestrial ecosystems; Turnover time; Lakes; agricultural land; algorithm; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biome; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; environmental modeling; equilibrium; grassland; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; turnover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007246772

In this study, the dissolution of goethite (α-FeOOH) was investigated in the presence of three low-molecular dicarboxylates enriched in the atmosphere, as well as a reference organic acid of methanesulfonate (MSA), which is especially abundant in marine atmospheric boundary layer. Iron mobilized from α-FeOOH was promoted under the irradiation and the deaerated condition, and the soluble Fe(II) concentration was enhanced greatly in the ligand-containing suspensions exposed to light. Irrespective of the reaction conditions, the capacities of the dicarboxylates on Fe mobilization were in the following order: oxalate &gt; malonate &gt; succinate, which were closely correlated with the carbon chain length of dicarboxylates: n = 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4. The space barrier action of carbon atoms inhibited ligand-promoted Fe dissolution by affecting the structure and stability of the complexes. MSA also acted as an organic ligand to mobilize iron and showed weak capacity to reduce Fe(III) under the irradiation. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis indicated that ·OH, O2·-, and H2O2 could be involved in the Fe(II)-Fe(III) redox circle, and the ligand-promoted photoreductive dissolution process could be an important source of ROS in atmosphere water. Both transmission electron microscopy analysis and zeta potential data supported that the adsorption of oxalate molecules onto the surface would change the aggregation state of goethite nanoparticles, which increased the effective surface area, and therefore facilitated Fe mobilization from the oxide. The data shown herein deepens our understanding on the ligand-promoted dissolution mechanisms, which could be an important formation pathway of bioavailable Fe in the atmosphere. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric boundary layer; Boundary layers; Carboxylation; Dissolution; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Iron; Irradiation; Ligands; Oxalic acid; Suspensions (fluids); Transmission electron microscopy; Deaerated conditions; Dissolution process; Effective surface area; Goethite nanoparticles; Ligand-promoted dissolutions; Marine atmospheric boundary layer; Reactive oxygen species; Transmission electron; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027049625

Submicron aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility were measured during and after the control period using a hygroscopic and volatile tandem differential mobility analyzer (H/V-TDMA) system. Three periods, namely the control clean period (Clean1), the non-control clean period (Clean2), and the non-control pollution period (Pollution), were selected to study the effect of the emission control measures on aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility. Aerosol particles became more hydrophobic and volatile due to the emission control measures. The hygroscopicity parameter (<i>Î°</i>) of 40-200ĝnm particles decreased by 32.0-8.5ĝ% during the Clean1 period relative to the Clean2 period, while the volatile shrink factor (SF) of 40-300ĝnm particles decreased by 7.5-10.5ĝ%. The emission controls also changed the diurnal variation patterns of both the probability density function of <i>Î°</i> (<i>Î°</i>-PDF) and the probability density function of SF (SF-PDF). During Clean1 the <i>Î°</i>-PDF showed one nearly hydrophobic (NH) mode for particles in the nucleation mode, which was likely due to the dramatic reduction in industrial emissions of inorganic trace gases. Compared to the Pollution period, particles observed during the Clean1 and Clean2 periods exhibited a more significant nonvolatile (NV) mode throughout the day, suggesting a more externally mixed state particularly for the 150ĝnm particles. Aerosol hygroscopicities increased as particle sizes increased, with the greatest increases seen during the Pollution period.

However, how soil aggregation regulates SOC sequestration and microbial activity after manuring has received less attention. We studied the distribution of SOC, microbial community composition and activity in four aggregate classes (>2, 1–2, 0.25–1, and <0.25 mm) using field moisture sieving of soil from a 23-year manure addition field experiment under a rice–barley rotation. Long-term manuring increased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) by 2.4% (p < 0.05), and reduced the portion of microaggregates (<0.25 mm, including sand and silt) by 5.9% (p < 0.05) compared with soil without manure (control). Manuring increased SOC and total nitrogen contents of the large macroaggregates by 9.1% and 7.1%, respectively, but not of the microaggregates. Also, manuring increased the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) contents of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and total microbes of the macroaggregates (>2, 1–2, and 0.25–1 mm) but not of the microaggregates. The fungal/bacterial PLFA ratio remained unchanged in all aggregates. Manuring increased β-glucosidase and chitinase activities in two macroaggregate classes (>2, and 1–2 mm), but not in the microaggregates. In conclusion, SOC, microbial biomasses and enzyme activities in the macroaggregates are more sensitive to manuring than in the microaggregates.

By determining the best available representation of composition-varying and time-varying emission factors with fuzzy mathematics method and S-shape curves, a comprehensive atmospheric emission inventories of 9 typical toxic heavy metals (THMs, e.g. mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), selenium (Se), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni)) from open MSW burning activities in China is established during the period of 2000–2013 for the first time. Further, the emissions in 2013 are allocated at a high spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° grid by surrogate indexes. The results show that 9 typical THMs emissions from open MSW burning are estimated at 21.25 t for Hg, 131.52 t for As, 97.12 t for Pb, 10.12 t for Cd, 50.58 t for Cr, 81.95 t for Se, 382.42 t for Cu, 1790.70 t for Zn, and 43.50 t for Ni, respectively. In terms of spatial variation, the majority of emissions are concentrated in relatively developed and densely-populated regions, especially for the eastern, central and southern regions. Moreover, future emissions are also projected for the period of 2015–2030 based on different scenarios of the independent and collaborative effects of control proposals including minimizing waste, improving MSW incineration ratio, and enhancing waste sorting and recycling, etc. The collaborative effect of the above proposals is expected to bring the most effective reduction to THMs emissions from open MSW burning in China except for Hg. The results will be supplementary to all anthropogenic emissions and useful for relevant policy-making and the improvement of urban air quality as well as human health. © 2016","Control proposals; Emission characteristics; MSW; Open burning; Toxic heavy metals","Air quality; Atmospheric spectra; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Heavy metals; Waste incineration; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric emission inventory; Densely populated regions; Emission characteristics; Fuzzy mathematics methods; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Open burning; Toxic heavy metals; Municipal solid waste; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; copper; heavy metal; lead; mercury; nickel; selenium; zinc; air quality; anthropogenic effect; emission control; emission inventory; fuzzy mathematics; heavy metal; incineration; municipal solid waste; policy making; public health; recycling; spatial resolution; toxic substance; urban atmosphere; air quality; Article; atmosphere; China; dangerous goods; health; human; incineration; mathematics; municipal solid waste; priority journal; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003875528

Besides the ground state geometric parameters, the different triplet states are finally determined by both the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) methods. On the basis of the respective optimized triplet geometry, the emissive wavelength is determined by the ΔSCF-DFT method. For all the experimental reported complexes, the Kasha rule is broken. The emission from the non-Kasha state is possible. To determine the quantum yield, the radiative rate constant (kr) is calculated by two different methods. Moreover, the items related with the kr, such as, Zero-field splitting (ZFS), transition dipole moments μ(Sn), singlet-triplet splitting energies ΔE(Sn − T1), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix elements 〈T1|HSO|Sn〉 are also calculated to further confirm the kr. The nonradiative rate constant (knr) is qualitatively evaluated by the popularity of the 3MC d-d state by the energy difference between 3MLCT/π-π∗ and 3MC d-d state, the barrier height between 3MLCT/π-π∗ and 3MC d-d state, and the required energy from 3MC d-d state decay to the 1S0 state. The barrier height between 3MLCT/π-π∗ and 3MC d-d state plays an important role to determine the knr. Finally, a novel Ir(III) complex is designed bearing 2-(2-trifluoromethyl) pyrimidine-pyridine (TPP) as primary ligand and amidinate as ancillary ligand. The phosphorescent emissive wavelength is obviously blue-shifted.

However, the roles of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites (Co2+Td) and octahedrally coordinated Co3+ sites (Co3+Oh) still remain elusive, because their oxidation states are strongly influenced by the local geometric and electronic structures of the cobalt ion. In this work, we separately studied the geometrical-site-dependent catalytic activity of Co2+ and Co3+ in VOC oxidation on the basis of a metal ion substitution strategy, by substituting Co2+ and Co3+ with inactive or low-active Zn2+(d0), Al3+(d0), and Fe3+(d5), respectively. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and in situ DRIFTS spectra were thoroughly applied to elucidate the active sites of a Co-based spinel catalyst. The results demonstrate that octahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites (Co2+Oh) are more easily oxidized to Co3+ species in comparison to Co2+Td, and Co3+ are responsible for the oxidative breakage of the benzene rings to generate the carboxylate intermediate species. CoO with Co2+Oh and ZnCo2O4 with Co3+Oh species have demonstrated good catalytic activity and high TOFCo values at low temperature. Benzene conversions for CoO and ZnCo2O4 are greater than 50% at 196 and 212 °C, respectively. However, CoAl2O4 with Co2+Td sites shows poor catalytic activity and a low TOFCo value. In addition, ZnCo2O4 exhibits good durability at 500 °C and strong H2O resistance ability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","benzene oxidation; DFT calculation; ordered mesopore; spinel; sustainable chemistry","Benzene; Carboxylation; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Cobalt compounds; Electronic structure; Geometry; Metal ions; Metals; Oxidation; Temperature; Volatile organic compounds; X ray absorption; X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; Benzene oxidation; DFT calculation; Mesopore; spinel; Sustainable chemistry; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026908290

Two or three triplet excited states are confirmed for three complexes, respectively. On the basis of the respective optimized triplet geometry, the emissive wavelength is determined by the ΔSCF-DFT method. Furthermore, the radiative rate constant (kr) is also calculated corresponding to each triplet state. Combination of kr and emissive energy, the emission rule is determined. It is found that complex (DMDPI)2Ir(tftap) follows the dual emission scenarios, while complexes (tftap)2Ir(DMDPI) and Ir(DMDPI)3 obey the Kasha rule.

To analyze potential sources of carbon intensity reduction, this study applied a metafrontier function and a non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to propose a new carbon emission performance index. An empirical study of carbon emissions from 58 countries between 2001 and 2007 led to three key findings. First, different reference technologies lead to significant differences in carbon emission performance. Assessing carbon emission performance using the group frontier as the evaluation criterion consistently yields equal or greater performance than when using the metafrontier as the benchmark. Second, the carbon emission performance of Asia is lower than that of Europe and the Americas, but Asia has the greatest potential to reduce carbon intensity. Production technology levels in Asia have lagged behind levels in Europe and the Americas; these gaps, however, have gradually narrowed. Finally, ineffective management and gaps in production technologies are the two main contributors to carbon dioxide intensity. Management factors are more significant overall for Asia, Europe and America; However, different individual countries have different perspective on the sources of potential carbon intensity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; DEA; Metafrontier; Performance decomposition","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Carbon intensity; Carbon intensity reductions; Empirical studies; Evaluation criteria; Management factors; Metafrontier; Potential sources; Production technology; Benchmarking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998655213

However, they are under threat by climate change and anthropogenic activities. The Sunda Banda Seascape (SBS), Indonesia, is among the world’s richest regions of mangrove biomass and biodiversity. To inform current and future management strategies, it is critical to provide estimates of how mangroves will respond to climate change in this region. Therefore, this paper utilized spatial analysis with model-based climatic indicators (temperature and precipitation) and mangrove distribution maps to estimate a benchmark for the mangrove biomass of the SBS in six scenarios, namely the Last Inter-glacial Period, the current scenario (1950–2000) and all four projected Representative Concentration Pathways in 2070 due to climate change. Despite mangroves gaining more biomass with climate change (the increase in CO2 concentration), this paper highlighted the great proportion of below-ground biomass in mangrove forests. It also showed that the changes in spatial distribution of mangrove biomass became more variable in the context of climate change. As mangroves have been proposed as an essential component of climate change strategies, this study can serve as a baseline for future studies and resource management strategies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biomass; climate change; GIS; IPCC; Mangrove forests; natural resources","Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate models; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Natural resources; Spatial distribution; Anthropogenic activity; Climatic indicators; Climatic scenarios; Economic and social development; IPCC; Management strategies; Mangrove forest; Resource management; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; belowground biomass; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone management; ecological modeling; mangrove; resource management; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; vegetation dynamics; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975142529

In order to understand China's carbon science research and reduction policies, it is crucial to benchmark CO2 emission estimates from different sources at multiple administrative levels. Therefore, this paper firstly compares the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), and the China High Resolution Emission Gridded Data (CHRED) against energy census data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) at the province level. Results revealed that CHRED—today's finest resolution and most bottom-up approach of CO2 emission estimation in China—is the most consistent dataset with NBSC among the three (with both Pearson's R and Kendall's τ of 0.86). Secondly, EDGAR and FFDAS are compared with CHRED at the prefectural level. Finally, empirical models were developed to reconcile EDGAR and FFDAS with CHRED at both province and prefectural levels to facilitate future longitudinal studies of CO2 emissions in China. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmark; China; CHRED; CO2; EDGAR; FFDAS","Benchmarking; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Population statistics; Atmospheric research; China; CHRED; Data assimilation systems; EDGAR; FFDAS; Fossil fuel combustion; High-resolution emission; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014867818

This will impact the power system. However, appropriate charging and discharging of EVs through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations could also provide support for the power system and benefits for EV owners. This raises the questions of when and how EV battery storage should be dispatched, taking into account both vehicle users' and power system's requirements and priorities, as well as the constraints of the battery system. This paper proposes a novel decentralized dispatch strategy based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), taking into account the relative importance of the different criteria, including cost, battery state of charge (SOC), power system contingency, and load leveling. The proposed AHP-based dispatch strategy was tested on an IEEE Reliability Test System with different EV numbers and capacities to investigate the efficacy of such an approach.

Studies on shallow-water HTVs have not only facilitated understanding of the influences of vents on local ecosystems but also helped to extend the knowledge on deep-sea vents. In this study, the diversity of bacterial communities in the sediments of shallow-water HTVs off Kueishan Island, Taiwan, was investigated by examining the 16S ribosomal RNA gene as well as key functional genes involved in chemoautotrophic carbon fixation (aclB, cbbL and cbbM). In the vent area, Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas of Epsilonproteobacteria appeared to dominate the benthic bacterial community. Results of aclB gene analysis also suggested involvement of these bacteria in carbon fixation using the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. Analysis of the cbbM gene showed that Alphaproteobacterial members such as the purple non-sulfur bacteria were the major chemoautotrophic bacteria involving in carbon fixation via the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle. However, they only accounted for <2% of the total bacterial community in the vent area. These findings suggest that the rTCA cycle is the major chemoautotrophic carbon fixation pathway in sediments of the shallow-water HTVs off Kueishan Island. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","aclB; Epsilonproteobacteria; Hydrothermal sediment; rTCA cycle; Sulfurimonas; Sulfurovum","RNA 16S; sea water; sulfur; Alphaproteobacteria; chemistry; chemoautotrophy; classification; Epsilonproteobacteria; genetics; hydrothermal vent; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; sediment; Taiwan; Alphaproteobacteria; Chemoautotrophic Growth; Epsilonproteobacteria; Geologic Sediments; Hydrothermal Vents; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sulfur; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000893871

Equity is the foundation of cooperation, and therefore, this study proposed a new dynamic carbon permit allocation scheme based on four principles: equality, historical responsibility, capability, and future development opportunities. Decision makers could have different preferences for allocating carbon permits, therefore, four equity rules or indicators (equality, responsibility, capacity, and sovereignty) were assigned different weights. Based on the global carbon budget of the 2 °C target, emission permits were calculated and relevant economic implications analyzed using the Global Change Assessment Model. Results indicated that developed countries should reduce emissions immediately, while allowances for developing regions could permit an initial increase in emissions until peaking. Applying different weights to the indicators resulted in multifarious regional allowances. Developed regions would benefit from the “preferring sovereignty” scenario and most developing countries would benefit under the “preferring responsibility” and “preferring capacity” scenarios. Compared with the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, this study found that in the short term, developed countries might insist on sovereignty as the preferred indicator. However, preferring sovereignty would place substantial mitigation pressures on developing countries in the long term. Therefore, in addressing global climate change, a dynamic choice in the weighting distribution for different indicators might be conducive to international agreement. Furthermore, a market-based trading instrument could help all participants both mitigate global climate change by reducing regional and global costs and facilitate mitigation capital flow from developed to less developed regions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Allocation scheme; Carbon budget; Climate change; Equity; Policy cost","capital flow; carbon budget; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; economic instrument; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; equity; global climate; global warming; international agreement; sovereignty; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949521332

However, excessive nutrients must be efficiently removed to prevent eutrophication. Compared with other means of advanced wastewater treatment, microalgae-based processes display overwhelming advantages including efficient and simultaneous N and P removal, no requirement of additional chemicals, O2 generation, CO2 mitigation, and potential value-added products from harvested biomass. One particular challenge of microalgae-based advanced municipal wastewater treatment compared to treatment of other types of wastewater is that concentrations of nutrients and N:P ratios in secondary municipal effluent are much lower and imbalanced. Therefore, there should be comprehensive considerations on nutrient removal from this specific type of effluent. Removal of nutrients and organic substances, and other environmental benefits of microalgae-based advanced municipal wastewater treatment systems were summarized. Among the existing studies on microalgal advanced nutrient removal, much information on major parameters is absent, rendering performances between studies not really comparable. Mechanisms of microalgae-based nitrogen and phosphorus removal were respectively analyzed to better understand advanced nutrient removal from municipal secondary effluent. Factors influencing microalgae-based nutrient removal were divided into intrinsic, environmental, and operational categories; several factors were identified in each category, and their influences on microalgal nutrient removal were discussed. A multiplicative kinetic model was integrated to estimate microalgal growth-related nutrient removal based majorly on environmental and intrinsic factors. Limitations and prospects of future full-scale microalgae-based advanced municipal wastewater treatment were also suggested. The manuscript could offer much valuable information for future studies on microalgae-based advanced wastewater treatment and water reuse. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Advanced municipal wastewater treatment; Influencing factors; Kinetics; Microalgae; Nutrient removal; Water reuse","Algae; Carbon dioxide; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Enzyme kinetics; Eutrophication; Microorganisms; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Reclamation; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water treatment; Influencing factors; Micro-algae; Municipal wastewater treatment; Nutrient removal; Water reuse; Wastewater treatment; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; water; waste water; water pollutant; bioremediation; concentration (composition); environmental factor; growth rate; microalga; municipal solid waste; nutrient dynamics; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; recycling; wastewater treatment; biochemical oxygen demand; environmental factor; human; microalga; nonhuman; nutrient; Review; waste component removal; waste water recycling; biomass; chemistry; growth, development and aging; kinetics; microalga; microbiology; physiology; procedures; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Biomass; Kinetics; Microalgae; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013077375

However, the influence of metal decoration on the electrolysis of the reverse reaction of ORR, that is, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is seldom reported. Moreover, further improving the bifunctional activity and corrosion tolerance for carbon-based materials remains a big challenge, especially in OER potential regions. Here, bimetal-decorated, pyridinic N-dominated large-size carbon tubes (MM′-N/C) are proposed for the first time as highly efficient and durable ORR and OER catalysts. FeFe-N/C, CoCo-N/C, NiNi-N/C, MnMn-N/C, FeCo-N/C, NiFe-N/C, FeMn-N/C, CoNi-N/C, MnCo-N/C, and NiMn-N/C are systematically investigated in terms of their structure, composition, morphology, surface area, and active site densities. In contrast to conventional monometal and N-decorated carbon, small amounts of bimetal (≈2 at%) added during the one-step template-free synthesis contribute to increased pyridinic N content, much longer and more robust carbon tubes, reduced metal particle size, and stronger coupling between the encapsulated metals and carbon support. The synergy of those factors accounts for the dramatically improved ORR and OER activity and stability. By comparison, NiFe-N/C and MnCo-N/C stand out and achieve superior bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance, exceeding most of state-of-the-art catalysts. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, we review the spatio-temporal distribution of PM2.5 mass concentration and components in China and the effect of control measures on PM2.5 concentrations. Annual averaged PM2.5 concentrations in Central-Eastern China reached over 100 μg m− 3, in some regions even over 150 μg m− 3. In 2013, only 4.1% of the cities attained the annual average standard of 35 μg m− 3. Aitken mode particles tend to dominate the total particle number concentration. Depending on the location and time of the year, new particle formation (NPF) has been observed to take place between about 10 and 60% of the days. In most locations, NPF was less frequent at high PM mass loadings. The secondary inorganic particles (i.e., sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) ranked the highest fraction among the PM2.5 species, followed by organic matters (OM), crustal species and element carbon (EC), which accounted for 6–50%, 15–51%, 5–41% and 2–12% of PM2.5, respectively. In response to serious particulate matter pollution, China has taken aggressive steps to improve air quality in the last decade. As a result, the national emissions of primary PM2.5, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOX) have been decreasing since 2005, 2006, and 2011, respectively. The emission control policies implemented in the last decade could result in noticeable reduction in PM2.5 concentrations, contributing to the decreasing PM2.5 trends observed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. However, the control policies issued before 2010 are insufficient to improve PM2.5 air quality notably in future. An optimal mix of energy-saving and end-of-pipe control measures should be implemented, more ambitious control policies for NMVOC and NH3 should be enforced, and special control measures in winter should be applied. 40–70% emissions should be cut off to attain PM2.5 standard. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical speciation; China; Control policies; Metropolitan regions; PM2.5","Air quality; Biogeochemistry; Chemical speciation; Emission control; Energy conservation; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; China; Control policy; Metropolitan regions; New particle formation; Particle number concentration; Particulate matter pollution; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal distributions; Quality control; ammonia; carbon; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; organic matter; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; particulate matter; policy analysis; pollution control; pollution policy; speciation (chemistry); air analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; chemical composition; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; energy conservation; environmental policy; geographic distribution; particle size; particulate matter; Review; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027934663

With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, it is important to develop and deploy low-NOx combustion technologies for pulverized coal boilers burning low-volatile coal. The objective of this study was to investigate a novel decoupling combustion system for low-volatile coal via experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The combustion system includes horizontal fuel-rich/lean low-NOx burners (LNB) and the associated air distribution system for a polygonal tangentially fired boiler (PTFB). The effects of coal particle diameter and coal feeding rate on the gas/particle flow characteristics of the burner, and the cold state aerodynamic field of the PTFB were analyzed in detail. The structural design of the LNB results in advantageous gas/particle flow characteristics and the PTFB improved the distribution of the flow field. The CFD models and simulation results were validated by comparing with those of cold experiments data. The simulation results demonstrated that this low-NOx combustion technology enhances staged combustion at different scales, which can reduce NOx generation significantly. In the industrial application on a 300 MW pulverized coal boiler, installation of the LNBs improved the stability of low-volatile coal combustion and reduced NOx emissions significantly. These research findings provide valuable guidance to the design of low-NOx combustion system for pulverized coal boilers using low volatile coal. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Decoupling combustion; Low-NOx burner; Low-volatile coal; Tangentially fired boiler","Boilers; Coal; Computational fluid dynamics; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fire tube boilers; Fuel systems; Industrial emissions; Pulverized fuel; Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Structural design; Two phase flow; Air distribution systems; Combustion systems; Combustion technology; Decoupling combustions; Experimental research; Low volatile coal; Pulverized coal boilers; Tangentially-fired boilers; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85004010436

In this paper we present illustrative evidence on cross-country and cross-industry differences of the firm-level mitigation targets among some of the largest corporations in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) with regard to five aspects, i.e., target adoption, target metric, target scope, target stringency, and target completion. We find that overall 25% of the firms have not set up emission targets. The EU firms are significantly more likely to use intensity targets than the US firms. The EU firms are twice as likely as the US firms to incorporate indirect emissions from the supply chain into the scope of their targets. The Energy and Materials sectors in the EU set significantly more stringent targets than their US counterparts. The energy sectors of the EU and the US in general have not made satisfactory progress toward accomplishment of the targets. Based on these findings, we discuss the most pressing issues that should be addressed by policymakers and firm managers in different regions and sectors with regard to target-setting. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Corporate; GHG emission; Mitigation target","carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; corporate strategy; emission control; European Union; firm size; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy making; supply chain management; technology adoption; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017384768

Xinjiang, an important Chinese energy production base, is currently going through a period of strategic opportunities for rapid development. Ensuring stable socio-economic development while achieving energy savings and meeting emission reductions targets, is the key issue currently facing the region. This paper is based on the input-output theory, and conducts a structural decomposition analysis on the factors affecting energy-related carbon emissions in Xinjiang from 1997 to 2007; this analysis employs a hybrid input-output analysis framework of “energy - economy - carbon emissions”. (1) Xinjiang’s carbon emissions from energy consumption increased from 20.70 million tons in 1997 to 40.34 million tons in 2007; carbon emissions growth was mainly concentrated in the production and processing of energy resources, the mining of mineral resources, and the processing industry. (2) The analysis of the direct effects of the influencing factors on carbon emissions showed that the change in per capita GDP, the final demand structure, the population scale, and the production structure were the important factors causing an increase in carbon emissions, while the decrease in carbon emission intensity during this period was the important influencing factor in stopping the growth of carbon emissions. This showed that while the sizes of Xinjiang’s economy and population were growing, the economic structure had not been effectively optimized and the production technology had not been efficiently improved, resulting in a rapid growth of carbon emissions from energy consumption. (3) The analysis of the indirect effects of the influencing factors of carbon emission showed that the inter-provincial export, fixed capital formation, and the consumption by urban residents had significant influence on the changes in carbon emissions from energy consumption in Xinjiang. (4) The growth of investments in fixed assets of carbon intensive industry sectors, in addition to the growth of inter-provincial exports of energy resource products, makes the transfer effect of inter-provincial “embodied carbon” very significant. © 2016, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon emissions; influencing factors; input output-structural decomposition analysis; Xinjiang",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006355893

In this study, we elucidate the effects of elevated CO2 and water regimes on two species of shrubs which were Melastoma malabathricum and Clidemia hirta. The factor of water stress was also included whereby for each CO2 treatment, the amount of water was given once or twice daily. The treatment of elevated CO2 was at 800 ppm, where the plants were exposed for two hours daily and ambient CO2 at 400 ppm as the control. The growth of plants was monitored through their height, leaf area and biomass that were recorded fortnightly for six months. The physiological changes were determined via stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate. The results revealed that each species responded differently to the CO2 treatments. The growth parameters of height and leaf area index showed positive responses on elevated CO2 and twice watering for both species. As for biomass, M. malabathricum exhibited higher below ground biomass compared to above ground biomass in the elevated CO2. In contrast, C. hirta showed the opposite trend. The results of the three physiological parameters demonstrated a bell shape trend for both treatments with the highest rate at the fifth month. © 2017, Malaysian Society of Applied Biology.

Red spruce-dominated forests once covered over 600,000 ha in the southeastern US, yet currently occupy a small fraction of their historical range due largely to logging that began in the nineteenth century. To combat this loss, restoration groups have emerged to actively improve the health and areal extent of red spruce. This study was conducted to (1) predict how suitable habitat for red spruce in the southeastern US is expected to change by the year 2100 in response to increasing global temperatures and (2) illustrate how these predictions can be used, in concert with local-scale information, to support efforts to restore red spruce in this region. Red spruce currently occupies a small fraction of the area indicated by our model to be suitable. The area of habitat supportive of red spruce was projected to decline from present day to the year 2100, but the magnitude of this decline depended on the level of carbon emissions, and there was considerable variability between climate models. In our case-study watershed, suitability for red spruce is predicted to decline by 2100, but may still support red spruce under optimistic to moderate emissions scenarios. At this scale, restoration strategies should also take into account locally varying conditions such as the current distribution of red spruce and competitive shrubs that may inhibit growth. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Pedomemory; Picea rubens; Restoration","climate change; dominance; endemic species; environmental restoration; evergreen tree; home range; logging (timber); nineteenth century; population decline; rare species; Canada; North Carolina; United States; Picea rubens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006927619

The federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov) has faced population declines throughout its range, most recently in 2012 following a severe drought throughout the Great Lakes region. This research builds upon previous work to understand what microclimate and biotic factors predict L. m. samuelis site occupancy. To gain an understanding of what habitat characteristics are conducive to L. m. samuelis survival during severe stochastic weather events, previously occupied sites were compared with currently occupied and restored sites in Allegan State Game Area, Michigan and the Oak Openings region of Ohio using variables significant in a predictive model. The heat load variable accounted for 64–67% of the variation in the model alone while individual biotic variables accounted for <5% of the model variation individually. The density of flowering lupine, ant entrance densities and heat load were higher in occupied sites while formerly occupied sites had higher woody stem density and canopy cover. These data show that site microclimate and factors affecting L. m. samuelis larval growth and reproduction affect distribution and persistence in stochastic environments. These findings can be incorporated in habitat management plans to create climate resilient refugia for current populations and increase the probability of reintroduction success in restored areas. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ant mutualism; Conservation; Endangered species; Heat load; Host plant quality; Lepidoptera; Lupinus perennis","ant; biotic factor; butterfly; endangered species; habitat; habitat management; heating; host plant; microclimate; mutualism; persistence; savanna; species conservation; Michigan; Oak Openings; Ohio; United States; Lepidoptera; Lupinus perennis; Lycaeides melissa samuelis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016024526

Furthermore, states have traditionally been depicted as the main subjects of international climate politics. Only in 2010, concrete references to human rights were incorporated into UN climate agreements. This has a double binding force: First, states thereby re-emphasize the principal validity of those standards that they have acknowledged—qua signature and/or ratification—as guiding their actions: the social and political rights that are captured in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two binding human rights covenants. Second, the incorporation of human rights norms into UN climate agreements officially and formally broadens the normative scope of negotiating and implementing these policies. However, after 2010, states have neither substantiated this engagement nor further built on it argumentatively. In contrast, human rights references are—again—mostly absent from states’ positioning in UNFCCC politics. In this article, we aim at explaining this empirical puzzle. In the first part, we elaborate our theoretical approach and carve out the functional, political and legal linkages between human rights and climate politics. Building upon participatory observation, expert interviews and analysis of primary and secondary documents, this will then be followed by explaining parties’ anew reluctance to further apply a human rights-based approach in climate politics. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Frame alignment; Human rights; International negotiations; Linkages; UNFCCC","climate change; environmental policy; environmental politics; human rights; implementation process; international agreement; negotiation process; perception; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951922972

The plant was built in 2013 and continues to operate to date, processing urban food waste and generating biogas for use in a community café. The plant was monitored for a period of 319 days during 2014, during which the operational parameters, biological stability and energy requirements of the plant were assessed. The plant processed 4574 kg of food waste during this time, producing 1008 m3 of biogas at average 60.6% methane. The results showed that the plant was capable of stable operation despite large fluctuations in the rate and type of feed. Another innovative aspect of the plant was that it was equipped with a pre-digester tank and automated feeding, which reduced the effect of feedstock variations on the digestion process. Towards the end of the testing period, a rise in the concentration of volatile fatty acids and ammonia was detected in the digestate, indicating biological instability, and this was successfully remedied by adding trace elements. The energy balance and coefficient of performance (COP) of the system were calculated, which concluded that the system used 49% less heat energy by being housed in a greenhouse, achieved a net positive energy balance and potential COP of 3.16 and 5.55 based on electrical and heat energy, respectively. Greenhouse gas emissions analysis concluded that the most important contribution of the plant to the mitigation of greenhouse gases was the avoidance of on-site fossil fuel use, followed by the diversion of food waste from landfill and that the plant could result in carbon reduction of 2.95 kg CO2eq kW h−1 electricity production or 0.741 kg CO2eq kg−1 waste treated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia inhibition; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Food waste; Micro-scale; Urban organic waste","Ammonia; Biogas; Carbon; Energy balance; Fatty acids; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Trace elements; Volatile fatty acids; Waste management; Wastes; Ammonia inhibition; Biological instability; Coefficient of Performance; Electricity production; Food waste; Micro-scale; Operational parameters; Organic wastes; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; biogas; volatile fatty acid; biofuel; ion; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; assessment method; biogas; fatty acid; food; solid waste; waste management; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; concentration (parameters); controlled study; England; food waste; gas waste; organic waste; urban area; waste management; anaerobic growth; devices; equipment design; food; greenhouse effect; metabolism; pilot study; prevention and control; procedures; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Ammonia; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Equipment Design; Food; Greenhouse Effect; Ions; London; Pilot Projects; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011593456

His main approach was to compare his observations with other researchers’ observations of recent palsa formation and degradation, and the use of relevant palaeoclimatic data. A more than 10 km2 large palsa mire complex in Sør-Varanger Municipality, northern Norway, was studied in terms of vegetation and stratigraphy 50 years ago, and then observed between 2005 and 2015, when the final palsa thawing occurred. The decisive climatic factor for the maintenance of existing palsas–annual mean temperatures below -1 °C, stated earlier by researchers–seemed to be valid also in the studied case. However, the results showed that new palsa formation may require a series of consecutive years with temperatures between -1 and -2 °C in annual mean temperatures. There is a possibility of detecting former palsas (i.e. since thawed) by stratigraphic investigations in cases of lateral erosion of palsas. Stratigraphic corings and field observations in the selected study area did not indicate earlier periods of palsa thawing prior to the modern one. The author concludes that the present thawing thus reflects a reversal of the final cooling stage of the present interstadial (Holocene). © 2017 Norwegian Geographical Society.","Northern Norway; palsa thawing; sporadic permafrost","mire; paleoclimate; palsa; permafrost; thawing; Finnmark; Norway; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018986633

As current control methods do not provide long-term, sustainable solutions, research has been conducted to find biological control agents. Ceutorhynchus assimilis is one of the currently investigated candidates. Known as oligophagous in the literature, a specialist clade of this root-galling weevil exists in southern Europe. This raised the question of its ability to survive in colder climates in the target range. We investigated the phenology of C. assimilis in the field in southern France (specialist clade) and Romania (generalist clade) and measured various temperature-dependent parameters in the laboratory. In both ranges, weevils were univoltine. Oviposition in autumn started later in France compared to Romania, while mature larvae exited galls (to pupate in the soil) earlier the following year. On average, 25% and 32% of galls from France and Romania were completely below the soil surface, respectively, and this appeared to depend on soil substrate. Weevils transported from France to Romania were able to develop, but at a much lower rate than Romanian weevils. Mortality of overwintering larvae of both clades increased with decreasing temperature and exposure time. At −5°C, lethal times Lt50 and Lt95 were 15 and 42 days for the specialist clade and 26 and 72 days for the generalist clade. A higher proportion of third instar larvae compared to first and second instar larvae survived. Pupation time at different temperatures did not differ between weevils from France or Romania. A climate match model (comparing winter temperatures) indicated that the specialist clade of C. assimilis from France has the potential to establish in some parts of the target range (e.g. Washington, Oregon, California). However, temperature extremes and winters without snow cover will likely limit its establishment unless rapid adaptive evolution takes place. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","cold hardiness; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; weed management","beetle; cold tolerance; herb; local adaptation; pest species; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; potential biocontrol agent; temperature effect; weed control; California; District of Columbia; France; Oregon; Romania; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]; Brassicaceae; Curculionidae; Draba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970965972

As a step toward answering this question, we evaluated N cycling processes and aspects of their regulation on a climate gradient on Kohala Volcano, Hawaii, USA. The gradient extends from sites receiving &lt;300 mm/yr of rain to those receiving &gt;3,000 mm/yr, and the pedology and dynamics of rock-derived nutrients in soils on the gradient are well understood. In particular, there is a soil process domain at intermediate rainfall within which ongoing weathering and biological uplift have enriched total and available pools of rock-derived nutrients substantially; sites at higher rainfall than this domain are acid and infertile as a consequence of depletion of rock-derived nutrients, while sites at lower rainfall are unproductive and subject to wind erosion. We found elevated rates of potential net N mineralization in the domain where rock-derived nutrients are enriched. Higher-rainfall sites have low rates of potential net N mineralization and high rates of microbial N immobilization, despite relatively high rates of gross N mineralization. Lower-rainfall sites have moderately low potential net N mineralization, relatively low rates of gross N mineralization, and rates of microbial N immobilization sufficient to sequester almost all the mineral N produced. Bulk soil δ15N also varied along the gradient, from +4‰ at high rainfall sites to +14‰ at low rainfall sites, indicating differences in the sources and dynamics of soil N. Our analysis shows that there is a strong association between N cycling and soil process domains that are defined using soil characteristics independent of N along this gradient, and that short-term controls of N cycling can be understood in terms of the supply of and demand for N. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","climate gradient; Hawaii; isotope dilution; nitrogen availability; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen mineralization; soil fertility; δ15N","biomineralization; environmental gradient; isotopic analysis; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; nutrient availability; soil nitrogen; Hawaii [United States]; United States; nitrogen; climate; Hawaii; nitrogen cycle; soil; Climate; Hawaii; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017232929

This paper describes an elaborated logic model to structure the evaluation of a climate services program, which we demonstrate in a case study of the Caribbean Agrometeorological Initiative (CAMI). Moving beyond the “loading dock” model of scientific information application, this logic model helps evaluators to address all elements of the provision of climate services – including the quality of weather and climate forecasts and agronomic advisories, the distribution of that information, the uptake of that information, and actions taken by farmers (See Fig. 1). Our logic model links the provision of information on weather, climate, and agriculture with decision making, and ultimately with improved social and economic outcomes. While such a logic model necessarily simplifies the full context of any climate services program, it also makes project evaluation much more tractable and generalizable across contexts. Furthermore, this simple logic model can serve to deconstruct conventional thinking about climate services by explicitly addressing the social and process dimensions of climate services that are sometimes neglected in project design, implementation, and evaluation. CAMI partner countries are developing climate outlook bulletins to communicate a three-month seasonal forecast. Despite these high quality seasonal forecasts, we note shortcomings regarding the dissemination of that information, its uptake by farmers, or the ability or willingness of farmers to act on that information. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Caribbean; Climate services; Program evaluation; Project evaluation; Seasonal forecast","agricultural application; agrometeorology; agronomy; climate effect; climate modeling; decision making; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; governance approach; information system; seasonal variation; weather forecasting; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025828548

However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public’s perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public’s perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research- and previous studies-suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.","Cross-country survey; Human values; Moral hazard; Public perception; Solar radiation management; Tampering with nature","Decision support systems; Global warming; Regression analysis; Risk management; Solar radiation; Surveys; Human values; Moral hazard; Public perception; Radiation management; Tampering with nature; Climate change; climate change; decision support system; global warming; interdisciplinary approach; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; solar radiation; World Wide Web; Canada; China; Germany; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018798465

Because bryophytes in grasslands are low-statured, and because plant height is a key functional trait governing plant responses to resource gradients, their responses to these factors could resemble those of better-studied small vascular plants. Alternatively, traits unique to bryophytes could lead to qualitatively different responses than those of small vascular plants. In a semi-arid Californian grassland system, where bryophytes are at relatively low abundance and their ecology has been little studied, we compared changes in cover and species richness of bryophytes and short-statured vascular plants in response to 5 years of experimental fertilization, springtime watering and fertilization + watering, which produced strong gradients in vascular plant biomass. Supporting our hypotheses, the cover and richness of both bryophytes and short vascular plants were negatively related to total community biomass and tall vascular plant cover, and declined in response to the fertilization + watering treatment, in which the cover of tall vascular plants most strongly increased. Two divergent responses were also observed as follows: watering alone increased the cover of bryophytes but not short vascular plants, while fertilization alone reduced the cover of short vascular plants but not bryophytes. Bryophytes and short-statured vascular plants in grasslands both may be expected to decline under projected global changes in climate and nutrient deposition that enhance total community biomass and competitive pressure. However, shifts in either precipitation or eutrophication regimes alone may have differential effects on bryophytes and short vascular plants in grasslands, and organism-specific plant functional traits must also be considered.

Recent studies of coal and shale gas systems have characterized in situ microbial communities and provided stable isotope data (δD-CH4, δD-H2O, δ13C-CH4, and δ13C-CO2) from a wider range of environments than available previously. Here we review the principal biogenic methane-yielding pathways in coal beds and shales and the isotope effects imparted on methane, document the uncertainties and inconsistencies in established isotopic fingerprinting techniques, and identify the knowledge gaps in understanding the subsurface processes that govern H and C isotope signatures of biogenic methane. We also compare established isotopic interpretations with recent microbial community characterization techniques, which reveal additional inconsistencies in the interpretation of microbial metabolic pathways in coal beds and shales. Collectively, the re-assessed data show that widely-utilized isotopic fingerprinting techniques neglect important complications in coal beds and shales. Isotopic fingerprinting techniques that combine δ13C-CH4 with δD-CH4 and/or δ13C-CO2 have significant limitations: (1) The consistent ~ 160‰ offset between δD-H2O and δD-CH4 could imply that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the dominant metabolic pathway in microbial gas systems. However, hydrogen isotopes can equilibrate between methane precursors and coexisting water, yielding a similar apparent H isotope signal as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, regardless of the actual methane formation pathway. (2) Non-methanogenic processes such as sulfate reduction, Fe oxide reduction, inputs of thermogenic methane, anaerobic methane oxidation, and/or formation water interaction can cause the apparent carbon isotope fractionation between δ13C-CH4 and δ13C-CO2 (α13CCO2-CH4) to differ from the true methanogenic fractionation, complicating interpretation of methanogenic pathways. (3) Where little-fractionating non-methanogenic bacterial processes compete with highly-fractionating methanogenesis, the mass balance between CH4 and CO2 is affected. This has implications for δ13C values and provides an alternative interpretation for net C isotope signatures than solely the pathways used by active methanogens. (4) While most of the reviewed values of δD-H2O - δD-CH4 and α13CCO2-CH4 are apparently consistent with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis as the dominant pathway in coal beds and shales, recent microbial community characterization techniques suggest a possible role for acetoclastic or methylotrophic methanogenesis in some basins. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biogenic gas; Carbon isotopes; Coalbed methane; Hydrogen isotopes; Stable isotopes","Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Shale; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Biogenic gas; Carbon isotope fractionation; Carbon isotopes; Hydrogen isotope; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Microbial community characterizations; Stable isotopes; Methane; biodegradation; carbon isotope; coal seam; hydrogen isotope; isotopic fractionation; metabolism; methane; microbial community; natural gas; shale; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013059669

What is more, recognizing the diversity of aspirations that may never be reconciled into a consensus, might some innovations and policy interventions be nevertheless more privileged than others, in being non-foreclosing? How might we discover this? These questions are addressed through a computational case study of London. The city's metabolism is modeled as the set of interacting, cross-sectoral (water, food, energy, waste) flows of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), water, and energy. Given various degrees of target improvements in an accompanying set of metabolic performance metrics, and given four candidate technological innovations in the water sector, an inverse (or “backcasting”) analysis is implemented in order to identify the key technological, policy, social, and climate-related features determining whether the community's aspirations — through the surrogates of the metabolic performance metrics — are attainable (or not), under substantial uncertainty. From this, the paper proceeds to examine which businesses are currently marketing some of the so-identified key technological innovations. It closes with a brief review of the related status of the economic justifications and social changes that may either promote or stifle the opportunities for London to move towards a higher niveau of sustainability. © 2016 The Authors","Backcasting; Inverse analysis; Resource-flow model; Sensitivity analysis; Urban metabolism; Water-food-energy nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007495737

However, even in buildings with the same level of yearly generation and consumption the mismatch between the demand and photovoltaic generation profiles leads to large power flows between the household and the grid. Such situation creates problems to the electrical grid management and can be a source of economic losses to the end-user. This paper presents an energy storage system designed in the context of residential buildings with photovoltaic generation. The objective of such system is to increase the matching between the local generation and consumption, as well as to decease the energy bill, using lithium-ion batteries as a storage device. Such system was modelled and simulated using real data of solar radiation and energy consumption from a typical residential household in Coimbra (Portugal). The results show that the designed system was able to reduce the energy sent to and consumed from the grid in 76% and in 78.3%, respectively, as well as the energy bill in 87.2%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery management system; Energy storage; Photovoltaic energy; Residential buildings; Zero-energy buildings","Battery management systems; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Housing; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Losses; Solar power generation; Virtual storage; Electrical grids; Energy storage systems; Energy targets; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic generation; Residential building; Solar photovoltaic generations; Zero energy building (ZEB); Buildings; building; demand analysis; economic activity; energy use; equipment component; photovoltaic system; power generation; residential location; solar power; solar radiation; Coimbra [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998812278

Despite the proliferation of studies delving into the properties of pomegranate from a medical and dietary perspective, its analysis from an environmental perspective has yet to be carried out in depth. Hence, the present study aims at understanding the life cycle environmental impacts in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions derived from the cultivation, processing and distribution abroad of fresh pomegranate grown at an innovative farm in a hyper-arid area in the region of Ica (Peru). Methods: The international standards for life cycle methodologies were considered in order to obtain the overall carbon footprint (CFP) of fresh pomegranate cultivation, processing and distribution. Data acquisition was performed at the cultivation site and supported by the ecoinvent® database, whereas GHG emissions were modelled using the IPCC 2007 method. In addition, biogenic carbon sequestration was included in the assessment, using two distinct models, a first one to model the aerial carbon sequestered by the pomegranate trees and a second, using the IPCC Soil Carbon Tool for soil storage. Results and discussion: Annual results show that on-site GHG emissions can be mitigated to a great extent in the first years of production thanks to biogenic carbon sequestration. However, through time, this tendency is reverted, and in years of maximum pomegranate productivity, GHG emissions are estimated to outweigh those linked to sequestration, despite the relevant minimization of emissions when using innovative irrigation schemes as compared to the conventional flood irrigation in the region. Conclusions: Despite the threat in terms of water depletion and security, the expansion of Peru’s agricultural frontier in hyper-arid areas appears to be a feasible strategy for carbon fixation, although current agricultural practices, such as the use of machinery or electricity, need to be optimized to make positive the carbon balance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; Horticultural products; Land use changes; Life cycle assessment; Pomegranate","carbon; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; coastal waters; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; farming system; horticultural species; life cycle; life cycle assessment; methodology; nonhuman; Peru; plant growth; pomegranate; species cultivation; species distribution; standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016308174

Even though stricter emission regulations have been implemented, NOx emissions are dependent on specific, short-duration driving events which are difficult to control, therefore high concentrations of these pollutants are still being measured in European cities. Under certification procedures, vehicle emissions compliance is evaluated through standards, recurring to driving cycles performed on chassis dynamometer under controlled laboratory conditions. Different countries use different standard cycles, with the US basing their certification cycle on FTP-75 and Europe using NEDC (Euro 5/6c)/WLTP (Euro 6d). However, the representativeness of standard driving cycles has been under discussion and, consequently, new updates on the light duty regulation from the European Commission include a Real Driving Emissions (RDE) Regulation, establishing that vehicle emissions must be measured on the road with a Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS). However, RDE tests have shown weak points, namely regarding testing boundary conditions and data analysis methods. Moreover, reproducibility of tests is hardly achievable and both dynamic and environmental boundaries (such as ambient condition, route, etc.) are unique for a specific geographical location, which can be representative for one location but not for another test-site. On-road data analysis methodology is defined by the European Commission, with two main methods are being tested: the Moving Averaging Window (MAW); and the Power Binning (PB). As result, the scope of this study was to evaluate the RDE data analysis methods, including the Vehicle Specific Power methodology (used on MOVES model), applied to 1 Hz on-road data from 3 vehicle propulsion technologies (spark-ignition, compression-ignition and hybrid), collected in Lisbon, Portugal. This approach allowed analyzing and identifying the differences between the methods for each vehicle propulsion technology. Regarding total CO2 emissions and NOx emissions, the application of the methods indicates that the MAW provides an overall difference of around 7% for CO2 and 10% for NOx comparing with the PB method. The PB is conceptually similar to VSP, although an overall 10% for CO2 and 19% for NOx difference was found. Differences on the methods results are due to the use of different approaches and, consequently, lead to different results, which are more explained on this paper.

This study compared Brazos River stable isotope (δ18O and δD) and electrical conductivity values with reservoir, creek and aquifer samples in the Brazos watershed, the largest watershed in Texas. The combination of tributaries, rainfall and the Brazos River Alluvium Aquifer, on the one hand, and the Lake Whitney reservoir, on the other hand, represent endmembers of dilute run-off water and evaporated saline water, respectively. A simple isotope mixing model that uses monthly river discharge, Lake Whitney discharge, historical monthly precipitation δ18O and pan evaporation accurately reconstructs river δ18O (±0.5‰ on average). Data and isotope balance modelling support continued evaporation of 18O-enriched Lake Whitney water as it flows downstream, although the most evaporation took place in Lake Whitney. The difference between river and precipitation δ18O, or Δ18ORIV-PPT, here a measurement of degree of evaporation, ranged from −0.1‰ for a small creek, to 1.7‰ for the Brazos River, to at least 2.7‰ in Lake Whitney. This study indicates that drought in regulated rivers may enhance reservoir discharge dominance in river flows during peak drought conditions when combined run-off and baseflow dominance would be expected in a similar undammed river.

The 2015 Paris Agreement includes (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions, so-called (I)NDCs, outlining the contribution of different Parties to the overall target of the agreement to limit global mean temperature increase to well below 2 °C. Here, we assess emission trajectories and the energy system transition of 11 major economies (in the remainder: countries) projected by integrated assessment models (IAMs) for baseline and cost-optimal 450 ppm CO2 eq mitigation scenarios and compare the results with the (I)NDCs. Limiting global temperature increase to below 2 °C implies a substantial reduction of the estimated available carbon budget for each country. The national carbon budgets between 2010 and 2100 showed reductions between the baseline and the 2 °C consistent mitigation scenario ranging from 52% in South Korea to 95% in Brazil. While in the baseline scenario, the share of low-carbon primary energy sources is projected to remain around 15% (with Brazil being a notable exception, reaching 30%); in themitigation scenarios, the share of low-carbon energy is projected to increase to over 50% in 2050 in nearly all countries, with the EU, Japan and Canada reaching the largest shares. Comparison with the (I)NDCs shows that in Brazil, Canada, the EU, Mexico (conditional target), South Korea and the USA, the emission reduction targets of the NDCs are closer to the mitigation requirement of the 2 °C scenario; in other countries, however, there is still a large gap. The national detail of the indicators adds to the literature on low-carbon emission pathways, assists the assessment of the Paris Agreement and provides support to national policymakers to identify focus areas for climate policy in the coming years. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Emission reduction targets; Global temperatures; Global-mean temperature; Integrated assessment models; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon emissions; Primary energy source; Substantial reduction; Budget control; carbon emission; comparative study; cost analysis; emission control; emission inventory; energy resource; environmental policy; European Union; international agreement; temperature; Brazil; Canada; Federal District [Mexico]; Japan; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; South Korea; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018804927

The governance of transboundary flood risk management calls for solidarity among riparians, as climate change will make river basins more prone to flooding. ‘Solidarity’ means that individuals act to support members of a particular community to which they belong. Recently, the solidarity principle has become institutionalized due to its formalization in the EU Floods Directive. However, it is not clear what solidarity means in the upstream–downstream practices of transboundary flood risk management. Understanding the meaning of solidarity is important for the development of cross-border climate adaptation governance. This article discusses the conceptualization of the solidarity principle and explores its meaning for international cooperation in the Dutch North Rhine–Westphalian border region. Our critical case study reveals that although all actors understand the importance of solidarity, they interpret it differently, often based on self-interest related to their position in the catchment. The formal inclusion of the solidarity principle in the Floods Directive can best be seen as a step in the continuous development of transboundary flood risk governance, as no striking changes in practice have been identified after its formalization. Policy relevance As climate change increasingly puts pressure on river basins and other shared resources, cross-border cooperation and solidarity are seen as increasingly important. This article discusses the meaning of solidarity in practice and reveals how this normative principle may contribute to transboundary climate adaptation governance. Understanding its meaning is important for future cross-border climate adaptation governance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","climate adaptation; Dutch North Rhine–Westphalian border region; flood risk management; solidarity principle; transboundary governance","adaptive management; border region; catchment; climate change; environmental policy; flood control; governance approach; risk assessment; river basin; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939544941

Information on clustering of cases across locations and time periods is vital for disease surveillance and timely control. OBJECTIVES: The objective is to study spatiotemporal clustering of dengue cases and their climatic and physioenvironmental correlates in Thiruvananthapuram district during 2010-2014. METHODS: Health department data on reported cases of dengue were obtained from January 2011 to June 2014. Cases were individually geocoded, using Google Earth. Moran's I index was estimated to analyze spatial autocorrelation using GeoDa software. Space-time clustering across 178 geo-divisions within the district was analyzed using SaTScan software. Correlation analysis was done for space-time clustering with climatic variables. RESULTS: Definite spatial and temporal trends were found on analysis of a total of 8279 dengue cases. Significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.32, P< 0.01) and space-time clusters with very high log-likelihood ratios (P < 0.01) were found across geo-divisions. Pallichal panchayat was the most likely cluster in every year. The monthly incidence of dengue cases showed a significant positive association (P < 0.05) with a 2-month lag of mean minimum temperature (ρ = 0.39), 1-month lag of rainfall (ρ = 0.33), and 1-month lag of humidity (ρ = 0.38). Dengue occurrences showed an inverse association (P < 0.01) with mean maximum temperatures of the respective months (ρ= -0.48). CONCLUSION: Spatial analysis using epidemiological tools reveals spatial and temporal clustering of dengue cases within the district and their association with climatic parameters. This information can be used in controlling outbreaks in the future.

Our goal is to understand the world peatland degradation and it's possible CO2 emissions for two time periods: 2025 and 2050. First we modeled the future degradation of peatlands and the associated carbon emissions. Second, a conceptual representation was developed to understand the most important socio-political factors behind the observed peatland degradation. We found an increase of the degraded peatland surfaces by 17% till in the period of 2008–2025 (summing cca 559,519 km2) and 26% till 2050 (summing 626,048 km2). The highest degradation levels expected for Asia (about 472,197 km2 until 2050). The global carbon emission resulting from peatland degradation was 1,052.79 Mtone in 1990 and 1298 Mtone in 2008, the differences being largely related to the Asian emissions (47.8% increase from 345 Mtone in 1990 to 722 Mtone in 2008). We expect an increase of carbon emission due to peatland degradation from 2008 to 1582 Mtone until 2025 and to 2118 Mtone until 2050.

The article’s central argument is that although co-productive strategies can enhance service user participation, the degree to which co-production is achievable in penal supervision is perhaps uncertain, and has received insufficient theoretical or empirical attention. To address the gap in knowledge, the article draws on the data generated from a study of compliance in Wales, United Kingdom, and employs the Bourdieusian concepts of habitus, field, and capital to argue that the convergence of two key factors undermines the viability of co-productive strategies in penal settings. One factor is the service users’ habitus of powerlessness which may breed passivity rather than active participation. The second also relates to the power dynamics that characterize penal supervision contexts. Within these contexts, practitioners are statutorily empowered to implement and enforce the requirements of community orders. In the current target-focused policy climate in England and Wales, practitioners may prioritize measurable compliance over forms of compliance that stem from service user participation and engagement perhaps because these are not readily quantifiable. © 2016, © 2016 Georgia State University.","community-based supervision; compliance; corrections; parole; probation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012914575

In Europe, this has included the Rural Development Programme, which aims to tackle multiple social, economic and environmental objectives in rural areas, and the integration of climate change objectives adds another strand of complexity to the decision making process. When formulating policies determining the likely effectiveness of any particular measure can be challenging, especially with respect to the spatial and temporal variability of greenhouse gas emissions. This is a challenge faced by all countries and regions around the world. This study uses Europe as an example to explore this issue. It highlights the variability in emissions from land use operations that may be encountered under different conditions and time horizons and considers this in the context of policy formulation. The Optimal Strategies for Climate change Action in Rural Areas software has been adapted to derive net greenhouse gas emissions for rural development operations for all regions in Europe. Operations have been classified into five categories based on their benefit/burden over different time horizons. The analysis shows that it is important to understand the time period over which benefits or burdens are realised and determine how this fits with policy instruments, such as land management agreements and the permanency of actions. It also shows that in some regions an operation can have benefits, but in other regions it has burdens; thus, location can be critical. Finally, in the context of developing operations to meet multiple social, economic and environmental objectives, it is important to acknowledge that seeking options that only reduce emissions may not always be practical or possible. In some instances, we may have to accept an increase in emissions in order to meet other objectives. It is important that we evaluate the net greenhouse gas emissions of all operations, not just those aimed at climate change mitigation. We can then select those with the least burden in the process of developing optimal solutions to meet multiple objectives. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use; Rural development; Spatial and temporal variability","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; emission control; greenhouse gas; land management; land use; rural development; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939227779

As a consequence, past studies of serpentinites have reported low cellular abundances and limited microbial diversity. Establishment of the Coast Range Ophiolite Microbial Observatory (California, U.S.A.) allowed a comparison of microbial communities and physicochemical parameters directly within serpentinization-influenced subsurface aquifers. Samples collected from seven wells were subjected to a range of analyses, including solute and gas chemistry, microbial diversity by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metabolic potential by shotgun metagenomics, in an attempt to elucidate what factors drive microbial activities in serpentinite habitats. This study describes the first comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis of microbial communities in hyperalkaline groundwater directly accessed by boreholes into serpentinite rocks. Several environmental factors, including pH, methane, and carbon monoxide, were strongly associated with the predominant subsurface microbial communities. A single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) of Betaproteobacteria and a few OTUs of Clostridia were the almost exclusive inhabitants of fluids exhibiting the most serpentinized character. Metagenomes from these extreme samples contained abundant sequences encoding proteins associated with hydrogen metabolism, carbon monoxide oxidation, carbon fixation, and acetogenesis. Metabolic pathways encoded by Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, in particular, are likely to play important roles in the ecosystems of serpentinizing groundwater. These data provide a basis for further biogeochemical studies of key processes in serpentinite subsurface environments. © 2017 Twing, Brazelton, Kubo, Hyer, Cardace, Hoehler, McCollom and Schrenk.","Alkaliphile; Borehole; Extremophile; Groundwater; Serpentinization","carbon monoxide; ground water; hydrogen; methane; RNA 16S; adaptation; amplicon; Article; carbon fixation; cell count; chemical reaction; Clostridia; DNA extraction; environmental factor; epifluorescence microscopy; gas chromatography; gene function; geochemical analysis; geochemistry; metagenomics; microbial diversity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidation; pH; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; serpentinization; taxonomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016616512

The region has major industrial plants including lignite-fired power plants and open-cast mining activities, residential areas, and traffic sources. To obtain and quantify the sector-wise anthropogenic emissions and spatial distribution of the major pollutants including SO2, NOx, PM10, and CO, a comprehensive emission inventory with 1-km spatial resolution was prepared for the year of 2014, and the AERMOD dispersion model was used to predict ambient air concentrations in a domain of 140 km by 110 km. Validation of the model results was also done referring to in situ routine measurements at two monitoring stations located in the study area. Total emissions of SO2, PM10, NOx, and CO in the study area were calculated as 64,399, 9770, 24,627, and 29,198 tons/year, respectively. The results showed that industrial plants were the largest sources of SO2, NOx, and PM10 emissions, while residential heating and road traffic were the most contributing sectors for CO emissions. Three major power plants in the region with total annual lignite consumption of 10 million tons per year were main sources of high SO2 concentrations, while high PM10 concentrations mainly originated from two major open-cast lignite mines.

CFD modeling method considering RANS equations and detailed reaction mechanism (GRI-Mech 2.11) are used for such purpose. Results show that, in MILD combustion regime, peak temperature under oxy-fuel condition (diluted by CO2 and H2O) is reduced as compared to air-fuel condition (diluted by N2) from both physical and chemical effects of the diluents. However, in the conventional combustion regime, chemical effect of the diluents on suppressing the peak temperature is weakened, resulting in the predominance of its physical effect. As for the flame ignition behavior, the dilution with CO2 or H2O causes flame liftoff according to OH appearance. More noticeably, the liftoff distance is even larger in H2O diluted case than CO2 diluted case. On the other hand, by calculating the Damköhler number in the computational domain, MILD combustion region is found well under reaction-controlled status. However, as compared to CO2, H2O plays a weakened role on the reaction-controlled status, suggesting that CO2 might be preferable to H2O in realizing oxy-MILD combustion. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Computational domains; Conventional combustions; Detailed reaction mechanisms; Flame characteristics; Jet in hot coflow; Oxyfuel combustion; Peak temperatures; Physical effects; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016952374

Taking account of national geography, the approach is based on the decentralisation of energy production, use and storage, and on new uses of communication, transport and the location of food, water and mineral resources. Revitalised regional centres could be connected, through new energy and transport solutions, by a national transport arc and electrified highways. The use of infrastructure funding to support low-carbon regional development would avoid the 'tragedy of the commons', transcending incremental, cumulative approaches based on compensation and incentives for household, business and sectoral abatement efforts.

Knowledge of in-cylinder pressures is a key requirement for closed-loop combustion control. Adaptive cylinder pressure reconstruction offers a realistic alternative to direct sensing, which is otherwise necessary as legislation requires continued reductions in CO2 and exhaust emissions. Direct sensing, however, is expensive and may not prove adequately robust. A new approach is developed for in-cylinder pressure reconstruction on gasoline engines. The approach uses time-delay feedforward artificial neural networks trained with the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The same approach can be applied to reconstruction via measured crank kinematics obtained from a shaft encoder or measured engine cylinder block vibrations obtained from a production knock sensor. The basis of the procedure is initially justified by examination of the information content within measured data, which is considered to be equally important as the network architecture and training methodology. Key hypotheses are constructed and tested using data taken from a three-cylinder (direct injected spark ignition) engine to reveal the influence of the data information content on reconstruction potential. The findings of these hypotheses tests are then used to develop the methodology. The approach is tested by reconstructing cylinder pressure across a wide range of steady-state engine operation using both measured crank kinematics and block accelerations. The results obtained show a very marked improvement over previously published reconstruction accuracy for both crank kinematics and cylinder block vibration-based reconstruction using measurements obtained from a multi-cylinder engine. This article shows that by careful processing of measured engine data, a standard neural network architecture and a standard training algorithm can be used to very accurately reconstruct engine cylinder pressure with high levels of robustness and efficiency. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.","block vibration; crank motion; Cylinder; pressure; reconstruction","Closed loop control systems; Combustion; Cylinders (shapes); Damage detection; Delay control systems; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Engines; Feedforward neural networks; Gasoline; Image reconstruction; Kinematics; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pressure; Time delay; Timing circuits; block vibration; crank motion; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; In-cylinder pressures; Information contents; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Reconstruction accuracy; Time delay neural networks; Cylinder blocks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015328382

In addition, the small amount of rain falls as heavy storms in very short periods of time leading to water losses by runoff which in turn causes a lot of erosion. The two phenomena therefore call for a combination of both strategic (combating erosion) and tactical (coping with inter- and intra-annual rainfall variability) measures to cope with the production uncertainties in such risk-prone environment. As opposed to most farmers' practice of using the same variety, a tactical solution of using varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns was thought to be worth testing. Varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns were combined with a well-known soil and water conservation practice which is the contour ridge tillage (CRT). The combined effects of the two measures on the production of different varieties of sorghum and millet as well as on soil water content were assessed in on-farm participatory trials in five villages. The experiment was run during three consecutive years (2012, 2013 and 2014). Results: A key finding of this research is that regardless of the yearly rainfall amount and provided CRT is used, there were large differences in yields between improved varieties and local ones. This is a result of higher soil water conservation and better response of the improved varieties. Conclusion: The use of CRT increases considerably the yields of improved varieties of the most important staple crops of the Cinzana commune which are millet and sorghum. Thus, the use of these early maturing improved varieties, along with CRT, could be an accessible adaptation strategy to climate variability by farmers. © 2017 The Author(s).","Climate variability; Improved varieties; Mitigation; Soil moisture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015750807

Globally, some of these regions are experiencing declining precipitation yet are simultaneously becoming greener, partly due to vegetation feedbacks associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Reduced precipitation together with increasing rates of actual evapotranspiration diminishes streamflow, especially base flow, a critical freshwater dry-season resource. Here we assess recent changes in base flow in Australia from 1981–2013 and 1950–2013 and separate the contribution of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and other factors on base flow trends. Our findings reveal that these other factors influencing the base flow trends are best explained by an increase in photosynthetic activity. These results provide the first robust observational evidence that increasing atmospheric CO2 and its associated vegetation feedbacks are reducing base flow in addition to other climatic impacts.

Urban forests have been shown to provide countless ecosystem benefits with many addressing climate change issues, such as sequestering carbon, reducing air pollution, and decreasing the heat island effect. Individual groups within the American public may not respond to the issue of climate change in the same way, thus engaging each group in climate change solutions will require different approaches. It is therefore important to understand how the public perceives climate change, their values and preferences, and barriers that might constrain their engagement to policy solutions. A mail survey was implemented, focused on households’ willingness to support and pay for urban forests as a climate change mitigation method. Atlanta, Georgia, USA was selected for this study given its environmental issues such as heat island effect and land cover changes, including conversion of forestland, that come with rapid population growth and urban sprawl. A Tobit model was used to model willingness-to-pay as a function of several variables derived from survey results; and a multivariate weighting strategy was used to address nonresponse issues. The analysis showed that Atlanta households are willing to pay $1.05 million to $1.22 million per year, or $5.24 to $6.11 million over a five-year period. The WTP amount was significantly related with the residents’ income, media source from where they received climate information, and the relative coverage of tree canopy around their residence. Results are relevant to city managers who are interested in understanding the public value of urban greening programs and developing strategies or policies to expand urban forests as part of a climate change strategy. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Contingent valuation method; Mail survey; Tobit model; Willingness-to-pay","adaptive management; climate change; contingent valuation; data acquisition; ecosystem service; heat island; land cover; population growth; statistical analysis; urban forestry; urban sprawl; willingness to pay; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013286554

Most current assessments of SOC stocks and the guidelines given by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focus on the top 30 cm of soil. Our research shows that, when considering only total quantities, most of the SOC stocks are found in this top layer. However, not all forms of SOC are equally valuable as long-term stable stores of carbon: the majority of SOC is available for mineralisation and can potentially be re-emitted to the atmosphere. SOC associated with micro-aggregates and silt plus clay fractions is more stable and therefore represents a long-term carbon store. Our research shows that most of this stable carbon is located at depths below 30 cm (42% of subsoil SOC is located in microaggregates and silt and clay, compared to 16% in the topsoil), specifically in soils that are subject to clay illuviation. This has implications for land management decisions in temperate grassland regions, defining the trade-offs between primary productivity and C emissions in clay-illuviated soils, as a result of drainage. Therefore, climate smart land management should consider the balance between SOC stabilisation in topsoils for productivity versus sequestration in subsoils for climate mitigation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017187844

Efforts in the road sector have traditionally focused on vehicle emissions and infrastructure is typically not included in the emissions account. Road environmental impact is estimated to increase by 10% if the stages of road design, construction, and operation were considered. Previous literature has widely study sustainable practices in pavement design and construction, with little attention paid to maintenance. Current state of practice reveals that pavement managers barely consider environmental performance and their evaluations solely rely on technical and economic criteria. This situation creates the need to incorporate, in an integrated manner, technical, economic, and environmental aspects in the design of maintenance programs. The main objective of this research is to develop a tool for the optimal design of sustainable maintenance programs. Given a maintenance budget, the tool aims to maximize the long-term effectiveness of the network while minimizing GHG emissions derived from the application of maintenance treatments. The capability of the proposed tool is analyzed in a case study dealing with an urban pavement network. In comparison to the traditional maintenance policy, the proposed tool designs maintenance programs that increase the average network condition by up to 22% and reduces GHG emissions by 12%. This application also analyzes the effect of different budgetary scenarios in the technical and environmental performance of the network. This application helps pavement managers in the trade-off between budget and network performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; Long-term effectiveness; Optimization; Pavement management; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainability","Budget control; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Highway planning; Maintenance; Managers; Motor transportation; Optimization; Pavements; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Transportation; Environmental aspects; Environmental performance; Long-term effectiveness; Maintenance programs; Maintenance treatments; Pavement management; Sustainable maintenance; Sustainable practices; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014855861

The characterizations by XRD, UV–vis DRS, Raman, and XPS demonstrate that Ti species highly dispersed as nanoclusters or mono-sites on the HZSM-5 zeolite surface. Compared with the common TiO2-HZSM-5 composite sample, the as-prepared Ti-HZSM-5 sample exhibits an enhanced activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to higher concentration of excited state electrons and faster electron transfer rate. The Ti-HZSM-5 sample with 0.99 wt% of Ti content is observed to have the highest rate for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. And the characterization results of photocurrent and ESR reveal that Ti species and Fe species work synergistically upon UV-light irradiation, therefore, we propose a possible reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction on Ti-HZSM-5.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst the staff of eleven Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China to gauge their perceptions regarding the impacts of climate change on malaria transmission and its control and prevention. Descriptive analysis was performed to study CDC staff’s knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and suggestions for malaria control in the face of climate change. Results: A majority (79.8%) of CDC staff were concerned about climate change and 79.7% believed the weather was becoming warmer. Most participants (90.3%) indicated climate change had a negative effect on population health, 92.6 and 86.8% considered that increasing temperatures and precipitation would influence the transmission of vector-borne diseases including malaria. About half (50.9%) of the surveyed staff indicated malaria had re-emerged in recent years, and some outbreaks were occurring in new geographic areas. The main reasons for such re-emergence were perceived to be: mosquitoes in high-density, numerous imported cases, climate change, poor environmental conditions, internal migrant populations, and lack of health awareness. Conclusions: This study found most CDC staff endorsed the statement that climate change had a negative impact on infectious disease transmission. Malaria had re-emerged in some areas of China, and most of the staff believed that this can be managed. However, high densities of mosquitoes and the continuous increase in imported cases of malaria in local areas, together with environmental changes are bringing about critical challenges to malaria control in China. This study contributes to an understanding of climate change related perceptions of malaria control and prevention amongst CDC staff. It may help to formulate in-house training guidelines, community health promotion programmes and policies to improve the capacity of malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change in China. © 2017 The Author(s).","Capacity building; Climate change; Imported cases; Infectious diseases; Malaria; Perception","adult; Article; attitude to health; awareness; China; climate change; cross-sectional study; environmental temperature; female; health care personnel; high temperature; human; knowledge; major clinical study; malaria; malaria control; male; perception; precipitation; public health; risk factor; risk reduction; vector control; attitude to health; communicable disease control; disease transmission; government; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; malaria; middle aged; organization and management; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; China; Climate Change; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Female; Government Agencies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Malaria; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016455362

Such predictions present opportunities for improved LMR management and industry operations, as well as new research avenues in fisheries science. LMRs respond to climate variability via changes in physiology and behavior. For species and systems where climate-fisheries links are well established, forecasted LMR responses can lead to anticipatory and more effective decisions, benefitting both managers and stakeholders. Here, we provide an overview of climate prediction systems and advances in seasonal to decadal prediction of marine-resource relevant environmental variables. We then describe a range of climate-sensitive LMR decisions that can be taken at lead-times of months to decades, before highlighting a range of pioneering case studies using climate predictions to inform LMR decisions. The success of these case studies suggests that many additional applications are possible. Progress, however, is limited by observational and modeling challenges. Priority developments include strengthening of the mechanistic linkages between climate and marine resource responses, development of LMR models able to explicitly represent such responses, integration of climate driven LMR dynamics in the multi-driver context within which marine resources exist, and improved prediction of ecosystem-relevant variables at the fine regional scales at which most marine resource decisions are made. While there are fundamental limits to predictability, continued advances in these areas have considerable potential to make LMR managers and industry decision more resilient to climate variability and help sustain valuable resources. Concerted dialog between scientists, LMR managers and industry is essential to realizing this potential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Climatology; Fisheries; Forecasting; Managers; Marine biology; Natural resources; Oceanography; Climate forecasts; Climate prediction; Climate variability; Climate variables; Decadal predictions; Dynamic environments; Environmental variables; Industry operations; Climate models; climate change; climate prediction; decadal variation; decision making; ecosystem management; environmental conditions; fishery management; marine environment; marine resource; research work; seasonal variation; stakeholder; sustainable development; weather forecasting",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013393551

The NHC catalyst exhibited good performance for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as demonstrated by means of electrochemical studies and evaluation when integrated into the oxygen electrode of a regenerative fuel cell. The activities observed for both the ORR and the OER were comparable to those achieved by state-of-the-art Pt and Ir catalysts in alkaline environments. We have further identified the critical role of carbon defects as active sites for electrochemical activity through density functional theory calculations and high-resolution TEM visualization. This work highlights the potential of NHC to replace commercial precious metals in regenerative fuel cells and possibly metal-air batteries for cost-effective storage of intermittent renewable energy.

The secondary reduction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the sarcolemma reduces NO production and bioavailability. As NO modulates glucose uptake, metabolism, and mitochondrial bioenergetics, we investigated whether an 8-week nitrate supplementation regimen could overcome metabolic dysfunction in the mdx mouse. Dystrophin-positive control (C57BL/10) and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were supplemented with sodium nitrate (85 mg/l) in drinking water. Following the supplementation period, extensor digitorum longus and soleus were excised and radioactive glucose uptake was measured at rest (basal) and during contraction. Gastrocnemius was excised and mitochondrial respiration was measured using the Oroboros Oxygraph. Tibialis anterior was analyzed immunohistochemically for the presence of dystrophin, nNOS, nitrotyrosine, IgG and CD45+ cells, and histologically to assess areas of damage and regeneration. Glucose uptake in the basal and contracting states was normal in unsupplemented mdx muscles but was reduced following nitrate supplementation in mdx muscles only. The mitochondrial utilization of substrates was also impaired in mdx gastrocnemius during phosphorylating and maximal uncoupled respiration, and nitrate could not improve respiration in mdx muscle. Although nitrate supplementation reduced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide emission, it induced mitochondrial uncoupling in red gastrocnemius, increased muscle fiber peroxynitrite (nitrotyrosine), and promoted skeletal muscle damage. Our novel data suggest that despite lower nNOS protein expression and likely lower NO production in mdx muscle, enhancing NO production with nitrate supplementation in these mice has detrimental effects on skeletal muscle. This may have important relevance for those with DMD. © 2016, The Author(s).","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Glucose uptake; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Nitrate supplementation","3 nitrotyrosine; CD45 antigen; cytochrome c; drinking water; dystrophin; hydrogen peroxide; immunoglobulin G; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; nitrate; peroxynitrite; reactive oxygen metabolite; sodium; sodium nitrate; dystrophin; glucose; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; nitric acid derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical assessment; controlled study; diet supplementation; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; extensor digitorum longus muscle; gastrocnemius muscle; glucose transport; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; male; metabolic disorder; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; mouse; muscle cell; muscle contraction; muscle injury; muscle regeneration; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling; priority journal; protein expression; respiration control; respiratory chain; skeletal muscle; soleus muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; animal; C57BL mouse; deficiency; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; electron transport; metabolism; physiology; skeletal muscle; X chromosome linked muscular dystrophic mouse; Animals; Dystrophin; Electron Transport; Glucose; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred mdx; Mitochondria; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Nitrates; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Reactive Oxygen Species",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002375437

Because these limit values cover both short- (day) and long-term (year) effects, air quality plans also follow these two formats. In this work, we propose a methodology to analyze modeled air quality forecast results, looking at emission reduction for different sectors (residential, transport, agriculture, etc.) with the aim of supporting policy makers in assessing the impact of short-term action plans. Regarding PM10, results highlight the diversity of responses across European cities, in terms of magnitude and type that raises the necessity of designing area-specific air quality plans. Action plans extended from 1 to 3 days (i.e., emissions reductions applied for 24 and 72 h, respectively) point to the added value of trans-city coordinated actions. The largest benefits are seen in central Europe (Vienna, Prague) while major cities (e.g., Paris) already solve a large part of the problem on their own. Eastern Europe would particularly benefit from plans based on emission reduction in the residential sectors; while in northern cities, agriculture seems to be the key sector on which to focus attention. Transport is playing a key role in most cities whereas the impact of industry is limited to a few cities in south-eastern Europe. For NO2, short-term action plans focusing on traffic emission reductions are efficient in all cities. This is due to the local character of this type of pollution. It is important, however, to stress that these results remain dependent on the selected months available for this study. © 2016, The Author(s).","Air quality modeling; Air quality planning; Emission scenarios; Forecast; NO2; PM10","action plan; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; forecasting method; nitrous oxide; particulate matter; policy making; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986325257

The aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate and recommend an optimum Urban Green Space (UGS) area for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA); and (2) to quantify potential renewable resources including electricity generation and potential nutrient recovery from generated ash. Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions from the management of Green Residues (GR) produced in a recommended UGS expansion are estimated and compared with those from the existing BMA waste management practice. Results obtained from this study indicate that an increase in UGS from its current 2.02% to 22.4% of the BMA urban area is recommended. This optimum value is primarily due to the area needed as living space for its population. At this scale, GR produced of about 334 kt·y−1 may be used to generate electricity at the rate of 206 GWh·y−1 by employing incineration technology. Additionally, instead of going to landfill, phosphorus (P) contained in the ash of 1077 t P·y−1 could be recovered to produce P fertilizer to be recycled for agricultural cultivation. Income earned from selling these products is found to offset all of the operational cost of the proposed GR management methodology itself plus 7% of the cost of BMA's Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) operations. About 70% of the current GHGs emission may be reduced based on incineration simulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Green residues; Greenhouse gases; Phosphorus recycling; Renewable energy; Thailand; Urban green space","Cultivation; Electric power generation; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Phosphorus; Recovery; Recycling; Urban growth; Urban planning; Waste incineration; Green residues; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Renewable energies; Sustainable urban development; Thailand; Urban green spaces; Waste management practices; Waste management strategies; Waste management; phosphate fertilizer; phosphorus; fertilizer; alternative energy; emission control; greenhouse gas; greenspace; phosphorus; recycling; urban area; waste management; waste technology; Article; ash; carbon footprint; controlled study; electricity; energy recovery; green residue; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; recycling; renewable energy; Thailand; tillage; urban area; urban green space; waste; city; greenhouse effect; prevention and control; procedures; recycling; tree; waste management; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; Cities; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Phosphorus; Recycling; Renewable Energy; Thailand; Trees; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008187219

Two systems with high percentage (up to 70%) biomass co-gasification (based on previously validated steady state models) are discussed: (I) a SOFC retrofitted IGCC system with partial oxy-fuel combustion CO2 capture (II) a redesigned highly efficient integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) system with full oxy-fuel CO2 capture. It is concluded that existing IGCC power plants could be operated without major plant modifications and relatively high electrical efficiencies of more than 40% (LHV) by retrofitting SOFCs and partial oxy-combustion CO2 capture. In order to apply full scale CO2 capture, major process modification and redesign needs to be carried out, particularly in the gas turbine unit and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). A detailed exergy analysis has also been presented for both the systems indicating significant efficiency improvement with the utilization of SOFCs. Additional discussions have also been presented on carbon deposition in SOFCs and biomass CO2 neutrality. It is suggested that scaling up of the SOFC stack module be carried out gradually, synchronous with latest technology development. The thermodynamic analysis and results presented in this article are also helpful to further evaluate design challenges in retrofitted IGCC power plant systems for near future implementation, gas turbine part load behaviour, to devise appropriate engineering solutions and for techno-economic evaluations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 capture; Exergy; IGCC; Retrofit; SOFC","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Combustion; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Exergy; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Gas turbines; Gasification; Retrofitting; Steam generators; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Waste heat; Efficiency improvement; Heat recovery steam generators; IGCC; Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants; Process modifications; Retrofit; Techno-economic evaluation; Thermo dynamic analysis; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001889686

Their performance was assessed with respect to the analysis of N2O emissions from wastewater treatment plants. For this purpose, the local N2O emissions of a wastewater treatment bioreactor was sampled by a dedicated mobile sampling device, and the total N2O emissions were analyzed in the gastight headspace of the bioreactor. We found that the use of a quantum-cascade laser emitting at about 4.53 μm, operated in a wavelength modulation mode, in combination with a conventional longitudinal PA cell yielded the highest sensitivity (&lt;100 ppbv). However, we also observed a strong cross-sensitivity to humidity, which can be explained by increased V-T relaxation. This observation in combination with the limited dynamic range (max conc. ∼ 3000 ppmv) led us to the use of the less-sensitive but spectroscopically more robust 2.9 μm laser. A detection limit below 1 ppmv, a dynamic range of more than 4 orders of magnitude, no influence of humidity or any other substance relevant to the off-gas analysis, as well as a comparable low price of the laser source made it the ideal tool for N2O analyses of the off-gas of a wastewater treatment plant. Such a system was implemented successfully in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. The results regarding the comparison of different PA setups can be transferred to other systems, and the optimum performance can be selected according to the specific demands.

InMAP estimates annual-average changes in primary and secondary fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations - the air pollution outcome generally causing the largest monetized health damages-attributable to annual changes in precursor emissions. InMAP leverages pre-processed physical and chemical information from the output of a state-of-the-science chemical transport model and a variable spatial resolution computational grid to perform simulations that are several orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than comprehensive model simulations. In comparisons run here, InMAP recreates comprehensive model predictions of changes in total PM2 5 concentrations with population-weighted mean fractional bias (MFB) of -17% and population-weighted R2 = 0.90. Although InMAP is not specifically designed to reproduce total observed concentrations, it is able to do so within published air quality model performance criteria for total PM2.5. Potential uses of InMAP include studying exposure, health, and environmental justice impacts of potential shifts in emissions for annual-average PM2 5. InMAP can be trained to run for any spatial and temporal domain given the availability of appropriate simulation output from a comprehensive model.

Addressing this, we conducted surveys and interviews with civil servants from numerous agencies and three levels of government working on climate change–related policy in the state of New York. We examined the effect of two network properties on mutual learning on climate change–related issues: the extent to which interagency communication takes places through formal and informal channels, and the distribution of two dimensions of trust (“fair play” and “relational comfort”) across the network. Our analysis revealed that formal communication among staff at different agencies was utilized more often than informal and that interagency relationships were more characterized by a feeling of “fair play” than by “relational comfort,” yet informal communication and Relational Comfort were the most important in facilitating interagency collaboration. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","adaptation; collaborative networks; environmental change; environmental management; innovation; interagency; knowledge; public administration; social capital","adaptive management; climate change; environmental change; environmental management; environmental policy; innovation; knowledge; public administration; social capital; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013419036

However, the impact of these practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and crop yields is not well defined, particularly in dry climates. A rainfed 2-year field-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of three long-term (17–18 years) tillage systems (Conventional Tillage (CT), Minimum Tillage (MT) and No Tillage (NT)) and two cropping systems (rotational wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) preceded by fallow, and wheat in monoculture), on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, during two field campaigns. Soil mineral N, water-filled pore space, dissolved organic carbon (C) and grain yield were measured and yield-scaled N2O emissions, N surplus and Global Warming Potentials (GWP) were calculated. No tillage only decreased cumulative N2O losses (compared to MT/CT) during campaign 1 (the driest campaign with least fertilizer N input), while tillage did not affect CH4 oxidation. The GWP demonstrated that the enhancement of C stocks under NT caused this tillage management to decrease overall CO2 equivalent emissions. Monoculture increased N2O fluxes during campaign 2 (normal year and conventional N input) and decreased CH4 uptake, as opposed to rotational wheat. Conversely, wheat in monoculture tended to increase soil organic C stocks and therefore resulted in a lower GWP, but differences were not statistically significant. Grain yields were strongly influenced by climatic variability. The NT and CT treatments yielded most during the dry and the normal campaign, and the yield-scaled N2O emissions followed the same tendency. Minimum tillage was not an adequate tillage management considering the GWP and the yield-scaled N2O emissions (which were 39% lower in NT with respect to MT). Regarding the crop effect, wheat in rotation resulted in a 32% increase in grain yield and 31% mitigation of yield-scaled N2O emissions. Low cumulative N2O fluxes (&lt;250 g N2O-N ha−1 campaign−1) highlighted the relevance of soil organic C and CO2 emissions from inputs and operations in rainfed semi-arid cropping systems. This study suggests that NT and crop rotation can be recommended as good agricultural practices in order to establish an optimal balance between GHGs fluxes, GWP, yield-scaled N2O emissions and N surpluses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 emission; N2O emission; Rotation; Tillage; Winter wheat; Yield","agricultural practice; crop rotation; crop yield; dissolved organic carbon; flux measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pore space; rainfed agriculture; semiarid region; soil nitrogen; tillage; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007453790

Increasing evidence indicates that these changes-summarized by the term ocean acidification (OA)-can significantly affect marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles. However, current scientific knowledge is largely based on laboratory experiments with single species and artificial boundary conditions, whereas studies of natural plankton communities are still relatively rare. Moreover, the few existing community-level studies were mostly conducted in rather eutrophic environments, while less attention has been paid to oligotrophic systems such as the subtropical ocean gyres. Here we report from a recent in situ mesocosm experiment off the coast of Gran Canaria in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic, where we investigated the influence of OA on the ecology and biogeochemistry of plankton communities in oligotrophic waters under close-to-natural conditions. This paper is the first in this Research Topic of Frontiers in Marine Biogeochemistry and provides (1) a detailed overview of the experimental design and important events during our mesocosm campaign, and (2) first insights into the ecological responses of plankton communities to simulated OA over the course of the 62-day experiment. One particular scientific objective of our mesocosm experiment was to investigate how OA impacts might differ between oligotrophic conditions and phases of high biological productivity, which regularly occur in response to upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water in the study region. Therefore, we specifically developed a deep water collection system that allowed us to obtain 85 m3 of seawater from 650 m depth. Thereby, we replaced 20% of each mesocosm's volume with deep water and successfully simulated a deep water upwelling event that induced a pronounced plankton bloom. Our study revealed significant effects of OA on the entire food web, leading to a restructuring of plankton communities that emerged during the oligotrophic phase, and was further amplified during the bloom that developed in response to deep water addition. Such CO2-related shifts in plankton community composition could have consequences for ecosystem productivity, biomass transfer to higher trophic levels, and biogeochemical element cycling of oligotrophic ocean regions. © 2017 Taucher, Bach, Boxhammer, Nauendorf, The Gran Canaria KOSMOS Consortium, Achterberg, Algueró-Muñiz, Arístegui, Czerny, Esposito, Guan, Haunost, Horn, Ludwig, Meyer, Spisla, Sswat, Stange and Riebesell.","Ecological effects of high CO2; Marine biogeochemistry; Mesocosm experiment; Ocean acidification; Plankton community composition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020098659

The UK's risk assessment was used tactically rather than instrumentally at all levels of government to garner political legitimacy for various policy portfolios. The tactical or political use of evidence occurred overtly, as an aid during policy advocacy, and covertly through the politicisation of expert knowledge. However, the linear-rationalist assessment method was largely inadequate for characterising climate change problems, for making instrumental use of climate science and suppressed broader institutional learning about climate-related policy-making. © The Author 2016.","Climate change adaptation; Evidence-based policy; Policy appraisal; Politicisation; Risk assessment","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; local government; policy analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019673669

As the biogas migrates to the surface, the soil through which it flows is expected to reach a higher temperature than the surrounding environment; thus, measuring the thermal footprint of the landfill soil surface could allow the detection of biogas leakages and spots suitable for the gas extraction. Close-range aerial infrared thermography is an innovative approach able to identify thermal anomalies with a good resolution over a large region of the landfill surface. A simple procedure to deduce the biogas flow rate emerging from the soil into the atmosphere, based on infrared thermography measurements, is presented. The approach has been applied to a case study concerning a large landfill located in Genoa (Italy).

Most relevant studies conducted in the NCP lasted only 1–2 years without sufficiently addressing the temporal variations of weather conditions and farming practices over different seasons. Thus, a 4-year (2008–2012) field experiment was conducted for a wheat–maize cropping system in a typical intensive agricultural region of the NCP. The three N application rates were (a) control without N application (CK); (b) farmers’ conventional N fertilization (CON), i.e., 600 kg N ha−1 yr−1; and (c) optimized N fertilization (OPT), i.e., 420 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), N uptake and crop production were measured. Compared with CON, the annual cumulative N2O emissions from OPT decreased by 40.9%, 7.2%, and 22.3% during the 2008–2009, 2009–2010 and 2011–2012 rotation years, respectively. Basal N fertilization in the wheat season was the critical period for N2O mitigation, although the maize season contributed 51%–89% of the annual N2O emission. CH4 uptake (CO2-equivalent) via soil accounted for 60%–96% of N2O in CK treatment and 4%–48% in fertilization treatments, indicating that CH4 should be considered in the overall GHG emissions from crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly improved N efficiency by 46%–52% for wheat and maize and maintained a similar or higher crop yield. Improvements in N efficiency should focus on the maize season. Water saving practices exhibited high potential to reduce indirect GHG emissions for the entire life cycle of crop production. Compared with CON, OPT significantly reduced the GHG intensity, particularly in the wheat season. Future long-term field experiments are required to account for considerable variations in GHG emissions and crop production under field conditions in the NCP. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming potential; N2O; North China Plain; Optimized N fertilization; Winter wheat–summer maize","agricultural emission; agricultural management; crop production; cropping practice; farming system; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; optimization; wheat; China; North China Plain; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009232037

According to the lack of post-assessment studies in the literature, this study assessed the effectiveness of the SO2 emission control policies on power plants after the 11th FYP (2006–2010) by modeling emission control scenarios. The idealized emission control policy (the PS90 scenario with assumption of 90% SO2 emission reduction from power plants) could reduce the SO2 and SO4 2− concentrations by about 51 and 14%, respectively, over the Yangtze River Delta region. While the actual emission control condition (the P2010 scenario based on the actual emissions from power plants in 2010) demonstrated that the actual reduction benefits were 30% of SO2 and 9% of SO4 2−. On the city scale, the P2010 scenario imposed positive benefits on Shanghai, Nanjing, Nantong, and Hangzhou with SO2 reductions of about 55, 12, 30, and 21%, respectively, while an 11% increase of SO2 concentration was found in Ningbo. The number of days exceeding China’s National Ambient Air Quality Standard of Class I daily SO2 concentration was estimated to be 75, 52, 7, 77, and 40 days for Shanghai, Nanjing, Nantong, Ningbo, and Hangzhou under the real SO2 control condition (P2010). The numbers could be decreased by 16, 11, 2, 21, and 11% if the control effect reaches the level of the PS90 scenario. This study serves as a scientific basis to design capable enforcement of emission control strategies in China in the future national plans. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","11th Five-Year Plan; Air quality modeling; Post-assessment; SO2 emission control; WRF/CMAQ; Yangtze River Delta","air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; emission control; pollution policy; power plant; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; China; Yangtze Delta; air pollutant; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; city; computer simulation; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; legislation and jurisprudence; river; theoretical model; weather; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Rivers; Sulfur Dioxide; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011573681

Recent studies showed that such landforms are able to support plant and arthropod life and could act as warm-stage refugia for cold-adapted species due to their microclimate features and thermal inertia. However, integrated research comparing active rock glaciers with surrounding landforms to outline their ecological peculiarities is still scarce. We analysed the abiotic (ground surface temperature and humidity, soil physical and chemical parameters) and biotic (plant and arthropod communities) features of two Alpine active rock glaciers with contrasting lithology (silicate and carbonate), and compared them with the surrounding iceless landforms as reference sites (stable slopes and active scree slopes). Our data show remarkable differences between stable slopes and unstable landforms as a whole, while few differences occur between active scree slopes and active rock glaciers: such landforms show similar soil features but different ground surface temperatures (lower on active rock glaciers) and different occurrence of cold-adapted species (more frequent/abundant on active rock glaciers). Both plant and arthropod species distributions depend mainly on the geographical context as a function of soil pH and on the contrast between stable slopes and unstable landforms as a function of the coarse debris fraction and organic matter content, while the few differences between active scree slopes and active rock glaciers can probably be attributed to microclimate. The role of active rock glaciers as potential warm-stage refugia for cold-adapted species is supported by our data; however, at least in the European Alps, their role in this may be less important than that of debris-covered glaciers, which are able to host cold-adapted species even below the climatic tree line. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

However, little is known about the abundance or temporal variation of major ions in urban runoff. This study explores the spatio-temporal variation of major dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3, and SO4) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in cold climate urban stormwater. Three watersheds with varying degrees of urban land use intensity and imperviousness (from 36% to 66%) in Helsinki, Finland, were continuously monitored for 5 years using an automated sampling procedure to obtain stormwater discharge and ion concentrations and, thus, loadings. High-resolution datasets, including long-term continuous discharge, both measured and simulated (using Storm Water Management Model), and automatic water quality sampling enabled the accurate calculation of loads of ions and TDS. Water quality was related to explanatory watershed characteristics (e.g., watershed physiography and sampling time) using hierarchical clustering, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical partitioning methods. Urban land use contributed to increased ion concentrations and loads year-round. This study highlights how stormwater ion concentrations are elevated across seasons, indicating chronic pollution phenomena. The greatest loads occurred during summer (except for Na and Cl), while the highest variation in loads was observed in autumn. Significant clusters among ions were found in the hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting similar temporal patterns and sources for the ions in each cluster. The importance of land use was evident, though in the most urbanized watershed, concentrations were not linked to any of the investigated watershed characteristics. Based on our results, only Na and Cl are manageable by alternative winter road antiskid practices, whereas other ions resulted from diffuse pollution sources, being therefore more difficult to control. Finally, this study contributes to an increased understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of ions in stormwater and highlights the need for consistent time series data for ion monitoring under cold climatic conditions in order to enable reliable estimates of their loads to adjacent water bodies. Finally, year-round stormwater treatment is highly recommended.

Ag-NPs were photo-deposited over the TiO2 NWs and characterized by XRD, TEM, N2-adsorption-desorption, XPS, UV-vis and PL spectroscopy. Ag-NPs in metal-state were successfully coated on the TiO2 NWs surface, producing core-shell hetero-junction. Ag-NPs coated over TiO2 NWs exhibited strong absorption of visible light due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation, trapped electrons and hindered charges recombination rate. The synergistic effect of Ag-NPs coated over TiO2 NWs for CO2 conversion was evaluated in a gas-phase system under UV and visible light irradiation. The plasmonic Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs demonstrated excellent photoactivity in the reduction of CO2 into CO, CH4 and CH3OH under visible light irradiation. The results show that 3wt.% Ag-NPs-loaded TiO2 NWs was found to be the most active, giving the highest CO evolution of 983μmole-g-catal.−1h−1 at selectivity 98%. This amount of CO produced was 23 times more than the TiO2 NWs and 109 times larger than the yield of CO produced over the pure TiO2. More importantly, the quantum yield was substantially enhanced for CO evolution. The LSPR excitation and synergic effect of Ag-NPs which can effectively accelerate the charge separation was proposed to be responsible for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The photo-stability of Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs evidenced in cyclic runs for selective CO production under visible light, yet photoactivity declined over the irradiation time under UV-light.

Most studies directly referring to urban ecosystem services are conducted on a local scale or for selected cities. There are few studies which focus on temporal changes of the provision of ecosystem services across a large number of cities. This paper analyzes selected land use type (forest, green urban area), soil sealing, selected ecosystem services (food provisioning, climate regulation, recreation), and biodiversity potential in 85 large cities (over 100,000 citizens) from the Continental (Central and Eastern) biogeographical region in Europe. We used the Corine Land Cover (CLC) data for 1990, 2000, 2006, and 2012. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The increase of forest areas was the highest in 2006-2012, and of urban green areas in 2000-2006, mostly in cities in Germany and the western part of the Czech Republic; (2) The process of soil sealing growth occurred in all studied cities and the rate was the most intense in Polish cities; (3) There was a decrease of food production and biodiversity potential in all the analyzed cities; (4) climate regulating services experienced only slight changes; (5) There was a very positive trend of the recreation indicator in most core zones of the cities in Germany and several cities in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Denmark. Moreover, our results of the temporal changes of land use and ES in European cities in the Continental biogeographical region indicate how important it is to monitor CLC and ES for potential spatial planning and regional policy interventions. © 2017 by the authors.","Core city; Corine Land Cover; Ecosystem services; European cities; Large urban zone","biodiversity; biogeographical region; ecosystem service; environmental indicator; food production; land cover; regional policy; spatial planning; temporal variation; urban area; urban ecosystem; Czech Republic; Denmark; Germany; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018373356

It should be reasonable and it should consider the access to available energy sources. The crucial issue revolves around minimizing the negative influence of power generation sector on the environment. At the same time, recent years have proven the united stand of world policies toward power generation. Poland has also attempted to determine a new model of power generation strategy. This strategy ought to consider the needs of both the recipients and climate challenges. But there is a crucial question of the shape of the new strategy for development of power system within the next years in the light of requirements of convention on climate change. During the Climate Conference in Paris in December 2015 - 195 countries accepted the first world agreement related to climate preservation. The agreement determines a world action plan, which is to prevent climate change as the result of climate warming. One of the goals is a quick reduction of emissions including power generation sector. This overview presents a current state of National Power System, availability of primary energy sources and various power technologies of future strategy for power system development. The technologies are described in view of their possible use for power generation and their applicability for the reduction of emissions of harmful substances to the atmosphere. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016496398

Yet the extent to which topography regulates montane forest carbon uptake and storage remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we compared forest aboveground carbon loading to topographic metrics describing energy balance and water availability across three headwater catchments of the Boulder Creek Watershed, Colorado, USA. The catchments range from 1800 to 3500 m above mean sea level with 46-102 cm/yr mean annual precipitation and -1.2° to 12.3°C mean annual temperature. In all three catchments, we found mean forest carbon loading consistently increased from ridges (27 ± 19 Mg C ha) to valley bottoms (60 ±28 Mg C ha). Low topographic positions held up to 185 ± 76 Mg C ha, more than twice the peak value of upper positions. Toe slopes fostered disproportionately high net carbon uptake relative to other topographic positions. Carbon storage was on average 20-40 Mg C ha greater on north to northeast aspects than on south to southwest aspects, a pattern most pronounced in the highest elevation, coldest and wettest catchment. Both the peak and mean aboveground carbon storage of the three catchments, crossing an 11°C range in temperature and doubling of local precipitation, defied the expectation of an optimal elevation-gradient climatic zone for net primary production. These results have important implications for models of forest sensitivity to climate change, as well as to predicted estimates of continental carbon reservoirs. © 2017 Swetnam et al.","Carbon; Climate change; Eco-hydrology; Forests; Lidar; Microclimate; Topography",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018241179

At the age of climate change, however, the implementation of the policy faces greater challenges. Empirical observation gives rise to a question as to why do the climate change mitigation programs fail to bring about favorable effect to poverty reduction? The paper employs an intermestic approach to critically explaining the underlying problems concerning climate change and poverty reduction in Indonesia. The argument is that the political economy of climate change accelerates the existing structural factors which alienate the government from the poor people, and annihilates the moral relationships between the ruler and the ruled. To clarify this position, the discussion proceeds in two main parts. The first section outlines the significant use of the intermestic approach to analyzing the disconnection between climate change and the Indonesian government’s economic policy to reduce poverty. The second section goes on to discern the structural factors which exacerbate the circumstances under which poverty reduction becomes a trivial issue in the ostensibly development policy directed to achieve economic progress. The concluding section reflects what can be learnt from the ongoing situation; on how to bring the state back into the right direction. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.","Climate Change; Indonesia; Policy Redirection; Poverty Reduction; Structural Factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018272552

Studies were conducted on the soils of monitoring plots subjected to Novocherkassk regional power plant emissions. Monitoring plots were established at different distances from the Novocherkassk regional power plant (1.0–20.0 km). Regularities in the accumulation and distribution of benzo[a]pyrene in chernozemic, meadow-chernozemic, and alluvial soils under the effect of aerotechnogenic emissions from the Novocherkassk regional power plant have been revealed on the basis of long-term monitoring studies (from 2002 to 2011). The tendencies in the distribution and accumulation of BaP in the studied soils coincided during the 10 years of monitoring studies. It has been found the 5-km zone to the northwest from the power station, which coincides with the predominant wind direction, is most subjected to contamination by benzo[a]pyrene, with the maximum accumulation at a distance of about 1.6 km from the source. Dynamics of pollutant accumulation in soils depends on number of Novocherkassk regional power plant emissions. The content of benzo[a]pyrene in the soil is an indicator of the technogenic load impact on the areas, for which the combustion products of hydrocarbon fuel are the major pollutants. A gradual decrease of the pollutant content in the soils was revealed during the period from 2002 to 2011. It explained by the significant decrease in the volume of pollutant emissions from the plant and the self-purification capacity of soils and mechanisms of benzo[a]pyrene degradation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Benzo[a]pyrene; Extraction; Monitoring; Pollution; Regional power plant; Soil","Electric power system interconnection; Extraction; Hydrocarbon refining; Monitoring; Pollution; Pyrene; Soils; Benzo [a] pyrene; Combustion products; Hydrocarbon fuel; Long term monitoring; Pollutant emission; Power-plant emissions; Self-purification; Wind directions; Soil pollution; aromatic hydrocarbon; combustion; degradation; extraction method; geoaccumulation; organic pollutant; pollution monitoring; power plant; purification; soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961184064

The intention is to provide livelihood support in exchange for local stakeholder involvement in protecting forests. Eleven years after the launch of REDD+ at COP 11 in Montreal, the degree of success in meeting well-being and income goals is examined in six countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, Vietnam) at 22 initiatives, 149 villages, and approximately 4000 households through a counter-factual approach. Half the villages and households are inside and half are outside the sphere of REDD+. Measurements are made at two points in time (2010-2012, and 2013-2014). This paper focuses on measurement of the subjective perception of local stakeholders. The study finds that REDD+ has not contributed significantly to perceived well-being and income sufficiency, in spite of the fact that most households have not only engaged with REDD+ interventions, but view them favorably. REDD+'s limited achievement to date is due to unavailability of funding, among other obstacles. Recommendations are made for enhanced attention to well-being and income sufficiency in the event that REDD+ eventually takes off. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Deforestation; Difference-in-difference; Forest; Income; Livelihood; REDD+; Subjective well-being; Well-being","Deforestation; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Rural areas; Difference-in-differences; Forest; Income; Livelihood; REDD; Well being; Climate change; climate change; deforestation; emission control; income; livelihood; perception; quality of life; stakeholder; Deforestation; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Tropical Atmospheres; Brazil; Cameroon; Canada; Indonesia; Montreal; Peru; Quebec [Canada]; Tanzania; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018522379

To inform management decisions, climate projections must be paired with hydrologic models to develop quantitative estimates of watershed scale water regime changes. Such modeling approaches often involve downscaling climate model outputs, which are generally presented at coarse spatial scales. In this study, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate model projections were analyzed to determine models representing severe and conservative climate scenarios for the study watershed. Based on temperature and precipitation projections, output from GFDL-ESM2G (representative concentration pathway 2.6) and MIROC-ESM (representative concentration pathway 8.5) were selected to represent conservative (ΔC) and severe (ΔS) change scenarios, respectively. Climate data were used as forcing for the soil and water assessment tool to analyze the potential effects of climate change on hydrologic processes in a mixed-use watershed in central Missouri, USA. Results showed annual streamflow decreases ranging from −5.9% to −26.8% and evapotranspiration (ET) increases ranging from +7.2% to +19.4%. During the mid-21st century, sizeable decreases to summer streamflow were observed under both scenarios, along with large increases of fall, spring, and summer ET under ΔS. During the late 21st century period, large decreases of summer streamflow under both scenarios, and large increases to spring (ΔS), fall (ΔS) and summer (ΔC) ET were observed. This study demonstrated the sensitivity of a Midwestern watershed to future climatic changes utilizing projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models and presented an approach that used multiple climate model outputs to characterize potential watershed scale climate impacts.

The selection of candidate agents remains a critical step in a biocontrol program before more elaborate and time-consuming experiments are conducted. Here, we propose a biogeographic approach to identify candidates and combinations of candidates to potentially cover a large range of the invader. We studied Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), native to North America (NA) and invasive worldwide, and six NA biocontrol candidates for the introduced Europe (EU) range of ragweed, both under current and future bioclimatic conditions. For the first time, we constructed species distribution models based on worldwide occurrences and important bioclimatic variables simultaneously for a plant invader and its biocontrol candidates in view of selecting candidates that potentially cover a large range of the target invader. Ordination techniques were used to explore climatic constraints of each species and to perform niche overlap tests with ragweed. We show a large overlap in climatic space between candidates and ragweed, but a considerable discrepancy in geographic range overlap between EU (31.4%) and NA (83.3%). This might be due to niche unfilling and expansion of ragweed in EU and the fact that habitats with high ragweed occurrences in EU are rare in NA and predicted to be unsuitable for the candidates. Total geographic range of all candidates combined is expected to decrease under climate change in both ranges, but they will respond differently. The relative geographic coverage of a plant invader by biocontrol candidates at home is largely transferable to the introduced range, even when the invader shifts its niche. Our analyses also identified which combination of candidates is expected to cover the most area and for which abiotic conditions to select in order to develop climatically adapted strains for particular regions, where ragweed is currently unlikely to be controlled. © 2017 Sun et al.","Ambrosia artemisiifolia; Biological invasions; Climate change; Niche overlap; Species distribution model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018965247

The key to support green transportation is to discover real-time shortest path for drivers. A time-dependent traffic graph, generated from history traffic data can be used to predict the traveling time and to find the shortest path for drivers dynamically. There are two different types of queries on shortest paths: Query_FiST for starting at a fixed time and reaching the destination as early as possible and Query_BeST for choosing the best starting time to avoid the rush hours. Taking advantage of traffic graph's characteristics of sparsity and hierarchy, we propose two algorithms: Heap-based Bellman–Ford algorithm for Query_FiST and Extended Bellman–Ford algorithm for Query_BeST respectively. We prove the correctness of the algorithms and discuss their time complexity.

Recently, Strava, a popular website and mobile app dedicated to tracking athletic activity (cycling and running), began offering a data service called Strava Metro, designed to help transportation researchers and urban planners to improve infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. Strava Metro data has the potential to promote studies of cycling and health by indicating where commuting and non-commuting cycling activities are at a large spatial scale (street level and intersection level). The assessment of spatially varying effects of air pollution during active travel (cycling or walking) might benefit from Strava Metro data, as a variation in air pollution levels within a city would be expected. In this paper, to explore the potential of Strava Metro data in research of active travel and health, we investigate spatial patterns of non-commuting cycling activities and associations between cycling purpose (commuting and non-commuting) and air pollution exposure at a large scale. Additionally, we attempt to estimate the number of non-commuting cycling trips according to environmental characteristics that may help identify cycling behavior. Researchers who are undertaking studies relating to cycling purpose could benefit from this approach in their use of cycling trip data sets that lack trip purpose. We use the Strava Metro Nodes data from Glasgow, United Kingdom in an empirical study. Empirical results reveal some findings that (1) when compared with commuting cycling activities, non-commuting cycling activities are more likely to be located in outskirts of the city, (2) spatially speaking, cyclists riding for recreation and other purposes are more likely to be exposed to relatively low levels of air pollution than cyclists riding for commuting, and (3) the method for estimating of the number of non-commuting cycling activities works well in this study. The results highlight: (1) a need for policymakers to consider how to improve cycling infrastructure and road safety in outskirts of cities, and (2) a possible way of estimating the number of non-commuting cycling activities when the trip purpose of cycling data is unknown. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution exposure; Crowdsourced data; Cycling purpose; Particulate matter; Strava metro","atmospheric pollution; commuting; cycle transport; particulate matter; pedestrian; pollution exposure; public health; World Wide Web; air pollution; city; controlled study; empiricism; exposure; human; human experiment; particulate matter; recreation; safety; scientist; speech; travel; United Kingdom; walking; crowdsourcing; cycling; environmental exposure; mobile application; Scotland; traffic and transport; Glasgow [Glasgow (ADS)]; Glasgow [Scotland]; Scotland; United Kingdom; Air Pollution; Bicycling; Cities; Crowdsourcing; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mobile Applications; Scotland; Transportation; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014771609

Because of the uncertainty in predictions of soil carbon storage, understanding the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of terrestrial carbon sinks and sources is difficult. Methods: In this study, the response of soil carbon to future climate change scenarios, which were provided by 10 general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario, was explored with the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) model for a North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC). Additionally, the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameters (CNOP-P) approach was used to provide two scenarios to evaluate the possible maximal uncertainties of soil carbon response to future climate change. Results: Based on the 10 GCMs from 2011 to 2100, the mean soil carbon was from 75.6 Gt C to 86.7 Gt C. As a result of the two climate change scenarios using the CNOP-P approach, soil carbon stocks were respectively 93.1 Gt C and 84.1 Gt C, which were larger than those using the 10 GCMs. The primary difference was determined by the difference in middle and high latitudes (30o N-35o N; 40o N-45o N) of the NSTEC region according to zonal analysis. Soil carbon associated with different plant functional types was also analyzed. The primary contributors to the augmentation of soil carbon under the CNOP-P-type scenario were the increases in soil carbon for temperate broad-leaved summer-green trees and temperate grasslands. Conclusions: As these numerical results indicated, uncertainty was found in the predictions of soil carbon, and the future soil carbon will increase in NSTEC region compared to 1961–1990.

The objective of this study was to quantify SOC accumulation and identify the primary drivers of belowground C dynamics in a zero-tillage production system of tropical perennial C4 grasses grown for biofuel feedstock in Hawaii. Specifically, the quantity, quality, and fate of soil C inputs were determined for eight grass accessions – four varieties each of napier grass and guinea grass. Carbon fluxes (soil CO2 efflux, aboveground net primary productivity, litterfall, total belowground carbon flux, root decay constant), C pools (SOC pool and root biomass), and C quality (root chemistry, C and nitrogen concentrations, and ratios) were measured through three harvest cycles following conversion of a fallow field to cultivated perennial grasses. A wide range of SOC accumulation occurred, with both significant species and accession effects. Aboveground biomass yield was greater, and root lignin concentration was lower for napier grass than guinea grass. Structural equation modeling revealed that root lignin concentration was the most important driver of SOC pool: varieties with low root lignin concentration, which was significantly related to rapid root decomposition, accumulated the greatest amount of SOC. Roots with low lignin concentration decomposed rapidly, but the residue and associated microbial biomass/by-products accumulated as SOC. In general, napier grass was better suited for promoting soil C sequestration in this system. Further, high-yielding varieties with low root lignin concentration provided the greatest climate change mitigation potential in a ratoon system. Understanding the factors affecting SOC accumulation and the net greenhouse gas trade-offs within a biofuel production system will aid in crop selection to meet multiple goals toward environmental and economic sustainability. © 2016 The Authors.

However, if states, utilities, and the largest energy users maintain their own clean energy goals, the spirit and aims of the CPP will be met with or without actual implementation. The CPP requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from existing generating units that utilize fossil fuels and encouraging states to reach a specific carbon reduction target. Many states have already started to create their own carbon emission-reduction targets and plans, fulfilling CPP's goals on their own terms. For example, New York has continued with its plans to lower carbon emissions, investing in solar, smart power grids, electric car charging stations, and offshore wind farms to eventually achieve a 100% renewable energy goal.

In East China Sea, the largest coastal hypoxic zone was observed in the world. This region is also strongly impacted by ocean acidification as receiving much nutrient from Changjiang and Qiantangjiang, and organisms can experience great short-term natural variability of DO and pH in this area. In order to evaluate the defense responses of marine mussels under this scenario, the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus were exposed to three pH/pCO2 levels (7.3/2800 μatm, 7.7/1020 μatm, 8.1/376 μatm) at two dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO, 2.0, 6.0 mg L-1) for 72 h. Results showed that byssus thread parameters, such as the number, diameter, attachment strength and plaque area were reduced by low DO, and shell-closing strength was significantly weaker under both hypoxia and low pH conditions. Expression patterns of genes related to mussel byssus protein (MBP) were affected by hypoxia. Generally, hypoxia reduced MBP1 and MBP7 expressions, but increased MBP13 expression. In conclusion, both hypoxia and low pH induced negative effects on mussel defense responses, with hypoxia being the main driver of change. In addition, significant interactive effects between pH and DO were observed on shell-closing strength. Therefore, the adverse effects induced by hypoxia on the defense of mussels may be aggravated by low pH in the natural environments. © 2017 Sui, Liu, Zhao, Dupont, Hu, Wu, Huang, Li, Lu and Wang.","Byssus; Defense response; Hypoxia; Mussel; pH","carbon dioxide; dissolved oxygen; acidification; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; defense mechanism; down regulation; gene; gene expression regulation; hypoxia; MBP1 gene; MBP13 gene; MBP7 gene; Mytilus; Mytilus coruscus; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; pH measurement; salinity; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016149435

The text shows how OLEV systems can achieve their three linked important goals: reduction of CO2 produced by ground transportation; improved energy efficiency of ground transportation; and contribution to the amelioration or prevention of climate change and global warming. SMFIR provides power to the OLEV by wireless transmission from underground cables using an alternating magnetic field and the reader learns how this is done. This cable network will in future be part of any local smart grid for energy supply and use thereby exploiting local and renewable energy generation to further its aims. In addition to the technical details involved with design and realization of a fleet of vehicles combined with extensive subsurface charging infrastructure, practical issues such as those involved with pedestrian safety are considered. Furthermore, the benefits of reductions in harmful emissions without recourse to large banks of batteries are made apparent. Importantly, the use of Professor Suh's axiomatic design paradigm enables such a complicated transportation system to be developed at reasonable cost and delivered on time. The book covers both the detailed design and the relevant systems-engineering knowledge and draws on experience gained in the successful implementation of OLEV systems in four Korean cities. The introduction to axiomatic design and the in-depth discussion of system and technology development provided by The On-line Electric Vehicle is instructive to graduate students in electrical, mechanical and transportation engineering and will help engineers and designers to master the efficient, timely and to-cost implementation of large-scale networked systems. Managers responsible for the running of large transportation infrastructure projects and concerned with technology management more generally will also find much to interest them in this book. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

At the same time, however, investment is persistently falling well short of the levels required to prevent dangerous climate change, suggesting that economically attractive mitigation opportunities are being missed. To understand whether and where these opportunities exist, this article contrasts macro-level analyses of climate finance with micro-level bottom-up analyses of the scale and composition of low-carbon investment opportunities in four case study developing world cities. This analysis finds that there are significant opportunities to redirect existing finance streams towards more cost-effective, lower-carbon options. This would mobilize substantial new investment in climate mitigation. Two key explanations are proposed for the failure to exploit these opportunities. First, the composition of cost-effective measures is highly context-specific, varying from place to place and sector to sector. Macro-level analyses of climate finance flows are therefore poor indicators of the micro-level landscape for low-carbon investment. Specific local research is therefore needed to understand the opportunities for cost-effective mitigation at that level. Second, many opportunities require enabling governance arrangements that are not currently in place. Mobilizing new low-carbon investment and closing the ‘climate finance gap' therefore requires attention to policy frameworks and financing mechanisms that can facilitate the exploitation of cost-effective low-carbon options. Policy relevance The importance of increasing investment in climate mitigation, especially in developing nations, is well established. This article scrutinizes four city-level studies of the scope for cost-effective low-carbon investment, and finds that significant opportunities are not being exploited in developing world cities. Enabling governance structures may help to mainstream climate considerations into investments by local actors (households, businesses and government agencies). While climate finance distributed through international bodies such as the Green Climate Fund may not always be a suitable vehicle to invest directly in disaggregated, local-level measures, it can provide the incentives to develop these governance arrangements. © 2015 The Author(s).

A model was developed in the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP) with 23 energy efficiency improvement scenarios associated with space heating and cooling, lighting, auxiliary equipment, and water heating in the commercial and institutional sector. The scenarios analyzed in this study quantified the reduced demand in energy use and GHG emissions as well as the abatement costs for fast (2013–2030) and slow (2013–2050) penetration periods. Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) and efficient boilers for space heating, efficient lighting, and high-insulation in building envelopes are identified as having significant potential for GHG mitigation and have low abatement costs.

It is possible to identify 4 climatic regions in the Sierra Madre Oriental, but we do not know their relationships with the biodiversity. We propose to evaluate its climatic variability in order to determine the climatic domains characterizing its territory and their relationships with the floristic richness represented by the family Asteraceae. The definition of climatic domains was through multivariate analyses, using climatic data obtained from estimates of 19 climatic parameters obtained from the WorldClim database analyzed with the ANUCLIM software to 1 km2 resolution. After an initial non-hierarchical classification, a hierarchical re-classification was made using the Gower's metrics and a clustering method (UPGMA); 277 climatic domains were identified along the Sierra Madre Oriental. They were later used to explain their relationships with the main biomes found in the mountain chain, as well as to determine the richness (alpha) in each of these climatic domains. Temperate forest is the biome with the greatest wealth of 29 species and has a high geographical correlation with one of the climatic domains obtained.

To address this data gap, we applied the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM) across 88 watersheds spanning a highly constrained, 4500 mm mean annual rainfall (MAR) gradient on Hawai‘i Island to quantify stream flow at 3-h time-steps for eight years in response to the independent and interactive effects of (1) large observed decrease in MAR; (2) projected warming and altered precipitation; and (3) four scenarios of forest invasion by the high water-demanding non-native tree species Psidium cattleianum. The model captured 62% of variability in measured flow at daily time scales, 95% at monthly time scales, and 98% at annual time scales. We found that low DHSVM modeled flow (Q90) and storm flow (Q10) responses to observed declines in rainfall dwarfed those of projected temperature increase or invasion, with flow decline positively correlated with MAR. As a percentage of streamflow, temperature and invasion reductions were negatively correlated with MAR. By comparison, warming alone had little effect on Q90 or Q10, but both decreased with increasing P. cattleianum cover, and projected effects of declining MAR were accentuated when combined with P. cattleianum and warming. Restoration mitigated some effects of climate warming by increasing stream base flows, with the relative effects of restoration being larger in drier versus wetter watersheds. We conclude that potential changes in climate in tropical environments are likely to exert significant effects on streamflow, but managing vegetation can provide mitigating benefits. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","climate change; DHSVM; Hawai‘i; invasive species; Psidium cattleianum; restoration; streamflow","baseflow; climate change; hydrology; invasive species; rainfall; restoration ecology; streamflow; tropical environment; vegetation structure; watershed; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Psidium cattleianum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988733898

Opportunities in Australian schools for teaching climate change mitigation and adaptation are critically examined. Climate change should be understood as a complex social as well as scientific issue characterized by uncertain and context-specific knowledge. This demands educators engage in inquiry and co-learning with students. The lack of time and the reported curriculum opportunities to address climate change in the classroom suggest a need for using co-curricular and community initiatives for student investigations and learning.

Contrary to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, there is no insample income turning point after which growth reduces pollution concentrations. Though the EKC was originally developed to model the ambient concentrations of pollutants, most subsequent applications focused on pollution emissions. Despite this, previous research suggests that it is more likely that economic growth could eventually reduce the concentrations of local pollutants than emissions.

The Indonesian government is implementing several Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiatives to help support the conservation of tropical forests, but the eastern part of Indonesia has yet to be included in this effort. Tropical forests growing on limestone are a prominent feature of that region, but little is known about their ecology and management, and only limited research has been conducted on biomass and the associated carbon storage capacity of these secondary forests. Here, we estimate the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) in an old secondary forest on limestone in Seram, the Moluccas, East Indonesia. We destructively sampled all aboveground vegetation in 0.04 ha forest and developed a local allometric model (n = 25; diameter-range of 10.4–41.7 cm). We tested and compared the performance of our locally developed model with existing local models and a recent pantropical model (Chave et al., 2014) at our site. Total AGB in the 1-ha forest plot was estimated at 177 Mg ha−1, of which 141 Mg ha−1 (80%) was allocated in trees ⩾10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), 33 Mg ha−1 (19%) in trees &lt;10 cm dbh and 2 Mg ha−1 (1%) in lianas and non-woody vegetation. Both our locally developed and the pantropical model estimated the biomass of harvested trees accurately (local model: bias = 0.1%, CV = 15.5%; pantropical model: bias = −7.7%, CV = 17.7%), while other local models had much lower performance (bias = −57.1 to −7.3%, CV = 59.2 to 75.8%). At plot-level, the AGB estimate of the pantropical model approached the estimate of our local model, while other local models considerably underestimated actual AGB. Together, our findings confirm that trees &lt;10 cm dbh can store a large fraction of total AGB in secondary forests, and highlight the robustness of generic models. These results provide further guidance for accurate assessments of forest carbon stocks in Indonesia and more generally for REDD+ initiatives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground biomass; Allometric model; Destructive sampling; Indonesia; Limestone; Secondary forest","Biodiversity; Biomass; Deforestation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Limestone; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Allometric models; Destructive sampling; Indonesia; Secondary forests; Forestry; aboveground biomass; allometry; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; comparative study; deforestation; degradation; ecosystem service; estimation method; forest management; performance assessment; secondary forest; tropical forest; Biomass; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forests; Indonesia; Plants; Maluku [Indonesia]; Moluccas; Seram",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007290540

This paper carries out a systematic assessment on the sensitivity of Computable General Equilibrium models to technological and geographical scales in evaluating the economic impacts of carbon mitigation policies. In particular, we examine the impacts of sub-national details and technological details of power generation on the estimate of carbon price and economic cost. Taking Italy as an example, we find that the estimation for carbon price and the economic cost of a de-carbonization pathway by means of a model with technological and regional details can be lower than a model without such details by up to 40%. Additionally, the effect of representing regional details appears to be far more important than the effect of representing the details of electricity technology in both the estimated carbon prices and the estimated economic impacts. Our results for Italy highlight the importance of modeling uncertainties of these two key assumptions, which should be appropriately acknowledged when applying CGE models for policy impact assessment. Our conclusions can be generalized to different countries and policy scenarios not in terms of absolute numbers but in terms of economic explanations. In particular, intra-national trade and the sub-national sectoral/technological specialization are important variables for understanding the economic dynamics behind these outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon mitigation policy; Computable General Equilibrium; Model uncertainty; Sensitivity; Sub-national regions; Technology","Carbon; Carbonization; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon mitigation policies; Computable general equilibrium; Model uncertainties; Sensitivity; Sub-national regions; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; emission control; pollution policy; sensitivity analysis; technology; uncertainty analysis; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013188020

A prevailing response of crops to rising [CO2] is an increase in leaf area. This is especially marked in soybean, the world's fourth largest food crop in terms of seed production, and the most important vegetable protein source. Is this increase in leaf area beneficial, with respect to increasing yield, or is it detrimental? It is shown from theory and experiment using open-air whole-season elevation of atmospheric [CO2] that it is detrimental not only under future conditions of elevated [CO2] but also under today's [CO2]. A mechanistic biophysical and biochemical model of canopy carbon exchange and microclimate (MLCan) was parameterized for a modern US Midwest soybean cultivar. Model simulations showed that soybean crops grown under current and elevated (550 [ppm]) [CO2] overinvest in leaves, and this is predicted to decrease productivity and seed yield 8% and 10%, respectively. This prediction was tested in replicated field trials in which a proportion of emerging leaves was removed prior to expansion, so lowering investment in leaves. The experiment was conducted under open-air conditions for current and future elevated [CO2] within the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment facility (SoyFACE) in central Illinois. This treatment resulted in a statistically significant 8% yield increase. This is the first direct proof that a modern crop cultivar produces more leaf than is optimal for yield under today's and future [CO2] and that reducing leaf area would give higher yields. Breeding or bioengineering for lower leaf area could, therefore, contribute very significantly to meeting future demand for staple food crops given that an 8% yield increase across the USA alone would amount to 6.5 million metric tons annually. © 2016 The Authors.

A decrease in precipitation with time is also seen at all elevation ranges from the year 2040–2070, with the lowest elevation levels seeing a bigger decrease than the higher levels. Thus, irrigation-induced increases in growing degree days and modifications to surface fluxes are shown in the basin and it is critical to consider when planning both crop and water management. © 2016","Climate change; Irrigation; Modeling; Surface fluxes","anthropogenic effect; atmospheric modeling; boundary layer; climate change; climate feedback; energy flux; flux measurement; future prospect; growing season; irrigation system; land surface; research program; surface energy; water management; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007190539

Hér.). Eucalypt species occur from high rainfall to semi-arid zones and from the tropics to latitudes as high as 43°S. Despite several morphological and metabolomic characterizations, little is known regarding gene expression differences that underpin differences in tolerance to environmental change. Using species of contrasting taxonomy, morphology and physiology (E. globulus and E. cladocalyx), this study combines physiological characterizations with 'second-generation' sequencing to identify key genes involved in eucalypt responses to medium-term water limitation. Results: One hundred twenty Million high-quality HiSeq reads were created from 14 tissue samples in plants that had been successfully subjected to a water deficit treatment or a well-watered control. Alignment to the E. grandis genome saw 23,623 genes of which 468 exhibited differential expression (FDR<0.01) in one or both ecotypes in response to the treatment. Further analysis identified 80 genes that demonstrated a significant species-specific response of which 74 were linked to the 'dry' species E. cladocalyx where 23 of these genes were uncharacterised. The majority (approximately 80%) of these differentially expressed genes, were expressed in stem tissue. Key genes that differentiated species responses were linked to photoprotection/redox balance, phytohormone/signalling, primary photosynthesis/cellular metabolism and secondary metabolism based on plant metabolic pathway network analysis. Conclusion: These results highlight a more definitive response to water deficit by a 'dry' climate eucalypt, particularly in stem tissue, identifying key pathways and associated genes that are responsible for the differences between 'wet' and 'dry' climate eucalypts. This knowledge provides the opportunity to further investigate and understand the mechanisms and genetic variation linked to this important environmental response that will assist with genomic efforts in managing native populations as well as in tree improvement programs under future climate scenarios. © 2017 The Author(s).","Ecotype; Eucalyptus; Homeostasis; Transcriptomic; Water deficit","phytohormone; transcriptome; transcriptome; Article; cell metabolism; controlled study; ecotype; environmental change; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus dadocalyx; Eucalyptus globulus; Eucalyptus grandis; gene expression; gene identification; gene sequence; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; photosynthesis; plant metabolism; plant response; plant stem; signal transduction; sunlight protection; water deficit; biology; drought; Eucalyptus; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; molecular genetics; physiological stress; plant leaf; procedures; Computational Biology; Droughts; Ecotype; Eucalyptus; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Plant Leaves; Signal Transduction; Stress, Physiological; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018625191

Habitat and diet during molt can have important consequences for the development of the ornamental signals used in these contexts. When molt occurs away from the breeding grounds (e.g., pre-alternate molt on the wintering grounds, or stopover molt), discerning the influence of habitat and diet can be particularly important, as these effects may result in important carryover effects that influence territory acquisition or mate choice in subsequent seasons. Several species of songbirds in western North America, including the Bullock's oriole (Icterus bullockii), migrate from the breeding grounds to undergo a complete prebasic (post-breeding) molt at a stopover site in the region affected by the Mexican monsoon climate pattern. This strategy appears to have evolved several times independently in response to the harsh, food-limited late-summer conditions in the arid West, which contrast strongly with the high productivity driven by heavy rains that is characteristic of the Mexican monsoon region. Within this region, individuals may be able to optimize plumage coloration by molting in favourable areas characterized by high resource abundance. We used stable isotope analysis (δ13C, δ15N) to ask whether the diet and molt habitat/location of Bullock's orioles influenced their expression of carotenoid-based plumage coloration as well as plumage carotenoid content and composition. Bullock's orioles with lower feather δ15N values acquired more colorful plumage (orange-shifted hue) but had feathers with lower total carotenoid concentration, lower zeaxanthin concentration, and marginally lower canthaxanthin and lutein concentration. Examining factors occurring throughout the annual cycle are critical for understanding evolutionary and ecological processes. Here, we demonstrate that conditions experienced during a stopover molt, occurring hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the breeding grounds, influence the production of ornamental plumage coloration, which may carryover to influence inter- and intrasexual signaling in subsequent seasons. © 2017 The Authors.

One potential solution for reducing fuel consumption is to increase the wing aspect-ratio as it improves the lift-to-drag ratio. However, higher aspect-ratio wings result in higher deflections which in turn may lead to nonlinear aeroelastic behavior. In this work, the aeroelastic behavior of a conventional regional aircraft with high aspect-ratio wings is investigated. Aeroelastically scaled models using different scaling methodologies have been evaluated and compared. These methodologies use scaling factors derived from the governing aeroelastic equations of motion to set the target values to be matched through the optimization of the scaled model structure. Two linear scaling approaches were used: the first method consists of a direct modal response matching; while the second method uncouples the mass and stiffness distribution to achieve the modal response. An alternative nonlinear aeroelastic scaling methodology using equivalent static loads is presented, which uses two different optimization routines to match the nonlinear static response and the mode shapes of the full model. The aeroelastic response agreement was found to be considerably better when the nonlinear approach is applied and the accuracy is noticeably better than the results obtained using the traditional linear scaling methods. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aeroelastic scaling; Geometric nonlinearities; High aspect-ratio wings; Nonlinear aeroelasticity","Aeroelasticity; Control nonlinearities; Equations of motion; Lift drag ratio; Aeroelastic scaling; Equivalent static loads; Geometric non-linearity; High-aspect ratio wing; Linear scaling method; Nonlinear aeroelasticity; Optimization routine; Stiffness distributions; Aspect ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010378601

PM2.5 is one of the most important reasons for hazy weather. Understanding the PM2.5 emission characteristics from different types of heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) is valuable in policies and regulations to improve urban air quality and mitigate vehicle emission in China. The investigation and analysis on HDT population and PM2.5 emission in BTH region are carried out. The results show that the population and PM2.5 emission of HDTs in BTH has risen for the last four consecutive years, from 404 thousand and 1795 tons in 2012 to 551 thousand and 2303 tons in 2015. The PM2.5 emission from HDTs in Hebei is about 10 times more than that of Beijing and 9 times more than that of Tianjin. The proportion of natural gas HDTs is about 5%; however, its PM2.5 emission only accounts for 0.94% in 2015, which indicates the utilization of HDTs powered by natural gas facilitate PM2.5 mitigation more than diesel in BTH. The tractor and pickup trucks are the main source of PM2.5 emission from different types of HDT, while special and dump trucks are relatively clean.

However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of PM2.5 have not been clarified. Here, we show that exposure to PM2.5 induces sustained activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in human airway epithelial Beas–2B (B2B) cells. In addition, PM2.5 exposure significantly decreased miR-331 expression in B2B cells, which was abrogated by inhibition of ROS or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Induction of miR-331 overexpression attenuated the PM2.5 exposure-induced NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, IL-6 and IL-8 expression in B2B cells. Furthermore, miR-331 targeted the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase beta (IKK-β) by down-regulating the IKK-β-regulated luciferase activity in HEK293 cells. Moreover, induction of miR-331 over-expression inhibited IKK-β expression while induction of IKK-β over-expression prevented the inhibition of miR-331 on the PM2.5 exposure-induced NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, IL-6 and IL-8 expression in B2B cells. Therefore, PM2.5 exposure decreased miR-331 expression via the ROS/PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in an increase in the IKK-β expression and sustained NF-κB activation in human airway epithelial cells. Our findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of PM2.5 exposure and aid in design of new therapeutic strategies to prevent PM2.5-induced toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharide; microRNA; NF-κB; PM2.5; Reactive oxygen species","I kappa B kinase beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; microRNA; microRNA 331; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor RelA; unclassified drug; I kappa B kinase; IKBKB protein, human; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; microRNA; MIRN331 microRNA, human; particulate matter; reactive oxygen metabolite; 3' untranslated region; airway epithelium cell; Article; binding site; controlled study; cytokine production; down regulation; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; enzyme phosphorylation; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; oxidative stress; particle size; particulate matter; protein expression; protein localization; RNA binding; signal transduction; cell line; cytology; drug effects; epithelium cell; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; particulate matter; toxicity; Cell Line; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation; HEK293 Cells; Humans; I-kappa B Kinase; MicroRNAs; NF-kappa B; Particulate Matter; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012066381

Climate projections for Lao PDR predict increased rainfall and hot weather, with more intense rainfall events and more frequent and severe droughts and floods. Under climate change, reductions in the amount and quality of groundwater are two critical problems. Reductions of the groundwater level will restrict the access of local people to groundwater resources, thereby posing a threat to food security and livelihoods. Lao PDR suffers from a limited number of human resources with the requisite skills to perform groundwater investigations and provide sustainable management. For the successful implementation of groundwater management plans, limitations associated with funding and technology should be resolved via support from the government and international cooperation. Advanced action plans for capacity building and training courses should be established to strengthen administrative and individual capacities.

Nonetheless, there are few facilities available in those regions of the world for in vivo measurement of methane production in cattle. The aim of the present work was to describe the design, construction and operation of respiration chambers for in vivo measurement of methane production in cattle in Mexico. Locally available materials were used in the construction. Walls, roof and doors were constructed of thermic panels with two windows of acrylic at the front so the animal can be observed at all times. Chambers have an air volume of 9.97 m3. Air is drawn from the chamber at a rate of 500 L/min by the effect of mass action flow generators. Methane was measured in air samples with an infrared analyzer. Chambers operate under a slight negative pressure of around-500 Pa. Air temperature inside the chambers is kept at 23 °C with an air conditioner, while relative humidity is maintained at 55 % with a dehumidifier. Functioning of the chambers was evaluated in Bos indicus, Nelore cattle fed Taiwan grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and a concentrate (18 % crude protein), and measurements were made during runs of 23 h duration. Methane production was on average 173.2 L per day, while the emission factor was 17.48 L methane per kilogram o dry matter consumed.

The speed of the induction response of photosynthesis in high light affects the cumulative carbon gain of the plant and could impact growth and yield. The photosynthetic induction response and its relationship with the photosynthetic capacity under steady-state conditions (Pmax) were evaluated in 37 diverse soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] genotypes. The induction response of leaf photosynthesis showed large variation among the soybean genotypes. After 5 min illumination with strong light, genotype NAM23 had the highest leaf photosynthetic rate of 33.8 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1, while genotype NAM12 showed the lowest rate at 4.7 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1. Cumulative CO2 fixation (CCF) during the first 5 min of high light exposure ranged from 5.5 mmol CO2 m−2 for NAM23 to 0.81 mmol CO2 m−2 for NAM12. The difference in the induction response among genotypes was consistent throughout the growth season. However, there was no significant correlation between CCF and Pmax among genotypes suggesting that different mechanisms regulate Pmax and the induction response. The observed variation in the induction response was mainly attributed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activation, but soybean lines differing in the induction response did not differ in the leaf content of Rubisco activase α- and β-proteins. Future studies will be focused on identifying molecular determinants of the photosynthetic induction response and determining whether this trait could be an important breeding target to achieve improved growth of soybeans in the field. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Photosynthetic capacity; Photosynthetic induction response; Rubisco activase; Soybean [Glycine max (L.)

We compare the use of harvest residues for local heat and electricity production relative to a base case scenario and estimate the climate change mitigation potential at the forest management unit level. Results demonstrate large differences between and within provinces and territories across Canada. We identify regions with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future and regions where no net benefit would occur over the 33-year study horizon. The cumulative mitigation potential for regions with positive mitigation was predicted to be 429 Tg CO2e in 2050, with 7.1 TgC yr −1 of harvest residues producing bioenergy that met 3.1% of the heat demand and 2.9% of the electricity demand for 32.1 million people living within these regions. Our results show that regions with positive mitigation produced bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, with emissions intensities that ranged from roughly 90 to 500 kg CO2e MWh−1. Roughly 40% of the total captured harvest residue was associated with regions that were predicted to have a negative cumulative mitigation potential in 2050 of −152 Tg CO2e. We conclude that the capture of harvest residues to produce local bioenergy can reduce GHG emissions in populated regions where bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, offsets fossil fuel sources (fuel oil, coal and petcoke, and natural gas). © 2016 The Authors.

The concentration of N2O in the atmosphere was fairly constant until the beginning of the industrial age, but has gone up by 20% since. This is because of increased anthropogenic emissions, of which about 60% come from agricultural soil. The cause is the increased use of synthetic fertilizer nitrogen globally to meet the demands for increased production of food and biofuels. This review examines the isotopic evidence for this role of fertilizer N, the main mechanisms for microbial production of N2O in soil, the key soil physical and other variables that greatly affect the magnitude of emissions, and the spatial and temporal variation in emissions and the associated problems of measurement. The review also considers the methodology devised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to enable countries to compile national inventories of their emissions, direct and indirect, that arise from anthropogenic activity related to agriculture and land use. This methodology also enables modellers to make ‘bottom-up’ global estimates of N2O emissions. These estimates agree quite well at the global scale with ‘top-down’ estimates based on the relation between reactive nitrogen newly introduced into agricultural ecosystems and increases in the global atmospheric concentration of N2O, but not with some recent regional-scale emission measurements. The discrepancy may be related to problems of estimating indirect emissions. Top-down estimates indicate that N2O emissions from crop-based biofuels are too great to comply with national and international environmental regulations. Finally, possible future trends in emissions and possible mitigation measures are discussed. Highlights: Evidence for increasing N2O in the atmosphere suggests it is caused by fertilizer N use. Agreements and inconsistencies in assessments of N2O emissions are considered. The main cause of increasing N2O is the use of synthetic N fertilizers on agricultural soil worldwide. Indirect emissions from waters receiving leached N may be a major cause of assessment uncertainties. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science",,"agricultural soil; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; concentration (composition); emission inventory; environmental management; global change; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; nitrous oxide; pollution control; soil amendment; soil emission; spatial analysis; top-down approach",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011292109

Across landscapes, remote sensing can provide information about aboveground states of forests and this information can be linked to models to estimate carbon cycling in forests close to steady state. For aggrading forests this approach is more challenging and has not been demonstrated. Here we apply a Bayesian approach, linking a simple model to a range of data, to evaluate their information content, for two aggrading forests. We compare high information content analyses using local observations with retrievals using progressively sparser remotely sensed information (repeated, single, and no woody biomass observations). The net biome productivity of both forests is constrained to be a net sink with &lt;2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 variation across the range of inputs. However, the sequestration of particular carbon pool(s) varies with assimilated biomass information. Assimilation of repeated biomass observations reduces uncertainty and/or bias in all ecosystem C pools not just wood, compared to analyses using single or no stock information. As verification, our repeated biomass analysis explains 78–86% of variation in litter dynamics at one forest, while at the second forest total dead organic matter estimates are within observational uncertainty. The uncertainty of retrieved ecosystem traits in the repeated biomass analysis is reduced by up to 50% compared to analyses with less biomass information. This study quantifies the importance of repeated woody observations in constraining the dynamics of both wood and dead organic matter, highlighting the benefit of proposed remote sensing missions. ©2017.

Although almost 250 fellows have graduated from the program, many of whom have assumed leadership roles within the osteopathic medical profession, the HPF has, to the authors’ knowledge, never been subjected to scholarly analysis. Objective: To understand the HPF’s professional significance as a health policy and leadership training program that has enrolled mostly osteopathic physicians. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with graduates supplemented by interviews with other professionals involved with the HPF. Using an inductive grounded theory approach, we coded interviews for major themes. Results: Forty-three interviews were conducted, 38 of which were with graduates of the program and 5 of which were with HPF staff. The data suggest that although the content of the HPF is applicable to all medical professionals, the program’s language and structure are designed to accommodate specific needs of osteopathic professionals. Specifically, the language of the fellowship emphasizes the “high ground” (considering multiple perspectives on an issue), and the structure of the fellowship allows fellows to continue in their jobs but travel to several COMs and to Washington, DC, throughout the year. Conclusion: Closer examination of the HPF helped convey the relevance of this program, and perhaps programs like it, for a minority medical profession still finding its voice within the policy climate of US health care. © 2017 American Osteopathic Association.","Fellowship; Health policy; Osteopathic identity","climate; District of Columbia; grounded theory; health care policy; human; human experiment; identity; language; medical profession; semi structured interview; staff; travel; voice; education; evaluation study; female; health personnel attitude; interview; leadership; male; medical education; organization and management; osteopathic medicine; procedures; program evaluation; United States; Attitude of Health Personnel; Education, Medical, Graduate; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Fellowships and Scholarships; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Leadership; Male; Osteopathic Medicine; Program Evaluation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013873659

We asked whether a mechanism similar to the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis could explain the diversity of four large genera (Protea, Moraea, Banksia, and Hakea) with distributions within and adjacent to the Greater Cape Floristic Region (South Africa) or the Southwest Floristic Region (Australia). Using phylogenetic and spatial data we estimated the environmental niche of each species, and reconstructed the mode and dynamics of niche evolution, and the geographic history, of each genus. For three genera, there were strong positive relationships between the diversity of clades within a region and their inferred length of occupation of that region. Within genera, there was evidence for strong evolutionary constraint on niche axes associated with climatic seasonality and aridity, with different niche optima for hotspot and nonhotspot clades. Evolutionary transitions away from hotspots were associated with increases in niche breadth and elevated rates of niche evolution. Our results point to a process of “hotspot niche conservatism” whereby the accumulation of plant diversity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems results from longer time for speciation, with dispersal away from hotspots limited by narrow and phylogenetically conserved environmental niches. © 2017 The Author(s).

A stability assessment method which can consider the impact of seasonal changes like freeze-thaw action, snowmelt water infiltration etc. is of utmost importance and considered to be an immediate requirement for geotechnical practitioners, in order to properly predict the slope stability. In this study, a slope stability assessment approach based on two-dimensional numerical modelling is recommended which considers the water content changes of the soil induced by the seasonal climatic effects i.e. freeze-thaw action, snowmelt water infiltration etc. Two case studies of slope failures in Hokkaido have been studied using the recommended approach. In order to visualise the climatic parameters of most influence on slope stability, parametric studies have been performed through which many useful results in view of the soil slope stability in seasonal cold regions have been obtained. It is found that the freeze-thaw action has a considerable impact on the soil water content and slope stability. On the other hand, the snowmelt water infiltration has a very significant impact on soil slope stability. The recommended numerical modelling approach is found to be very useful in analysing the soil slope stability in seasonal cold regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Freeze-thaw action; Non-isothermal seepage; Seasonal cold regions; Slope stability; Snowmelt water","Freezing; Infiltration; Numerical models; Snow melting systems; Soil moisture; Soils; Stability; System stability; Thawing; Climatic effects; Climatic parameters; Cold regions; Freeze thaw actions; Nonisothermal; Snowmelt water; Soil water content; Stability assessment; Slope stability; climate effect; cold region; freeze-thaw cycle; infiltration; seasonal variation; slope stability; snowmelt; Hokkaido; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015791286

Analysis results showed that the barrier height (BH) and ideality factor of the MIS diode are found to be improved compared to the MS diode. This indicates that the effective BH is modified by the PVP interlayer since it creates physical barrier between the Ti metal and the p-InP substrate. It is noted that the evaluated BH by Cheung’s and ψS-V plots is in good concurrence with one another. Also, the series resistance of the MS and MIS diodes is estimated by Cheung’s functions. The insertion of the PVP interlayer led to a decrease of the interface state density in the Ti/p-InP MS diode. In addition, the relevant junction mechanisms are explained by feasible energy level band diagrams. The Poole–Frenkel emission is the governing conduction mechanism in the Ti/p-InP MS diode.

Theoretical charge-density calculations have been performed to study the nature and strength associated with the existence of this intermolecular F...O contact, wherein the F atom is attached to an sp3-hybridized C atom in the case of A1 and to an sp2 hybridized carbon in the case of A2. The crystal packing of the former contains two 'electronically different' Csp3 - F...O contacts which are present across and in between the layers of molecules. In the latter case, it is characterized by the presence of a very 'short' (2.708 Å) and 'highly directional' (168° at C4 - F1...O1 and 174° at C10 - O1...F1) Csp2 - F...O contact. According to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) study, it is a rare example in molecular crystals. Topological features of F...O contacts in the solid state were compared with the gas-phase models. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional static deformation density obtained from theoretical multipole modeling confirm the presence of a charge depleted region on the F atoms. Minimization of the electrostatic repulsion between like charges are observed through subtle arrangements in the electronic environment in two of the short intermolecular F...O contacts. These contacts were investigated using inputs from pair energy decomposition analysis, Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), Hirshfeld surface analysis, delocalization index, reduced density gradient (RDG) plot, electrostatic potential surface and distributed atomic polarizability. The intermolecular energy decomposition (PIXEL) and RDG-NCI (non-covalent interaction) analysis of the F...O contacts establish the interaction to be dispersive in nature. The mutual polarization of an O atom by fluorine and viceversa provides real physical insights into the role of atomic polarizability in interacting atoms in molecules in crystals. We report the experimental observation of a 'unique' and 'rare' F...O interaction, involving two electronegative atoms, having the characteristics of 'short interatomic distance' and 'high directionality' that provide robustness to the crystal packing. The characterization of these F...O contacts via different computational procedures establish the interaction to be dispersive in nature and the mutual polarization of an O atom by F and viceversa provides real physical insights into the role of atomic polarizability in interacting atoms in molecules in crystals. © International Union of Crystallography, 2017.","atomic polarizability; charge density; intermolecular interactions; organic fluorine; QTAIM","Carbon; Characterization; Charge density; Computation theory; Crystal structure; Electrostatics; Fluorine; Molecular crystals; Molecules; Polarization; Quantum theory; Surface analysis; Atomic polarizability; Cambridge structural database; Electrostatic potential surface; Energy decomposition analysis; Intermolecular interactions; Organic fluorine; QTAIM; Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017127805

Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, India, during rainy season 2012 to 2014 to explore possible outcomes of sustainable production of organic basmati rice in terms of productivity, water use efficiency and methane emission reduction in North Western Himalayas of India. Six sets of nutrient management and production technology treatments were taken in randomized block design (RBD) with three replications. Traditional basmati rice variety type 3 popularly known as Dehraduni Basmati was taken for study. Dry matter production, crop growth rate and effective tillers were found higher in green manuring (GM) + vermicompost (VC) during all the 3 years. Overall highest grain yield of basmati rice (average over 3 years) was found in GM + VC with Sesbania aculeate (3209 kg ha−1) followed by System of Rice Intensification (SRI) (3174 kg ha−1), while lowest grain yield of basmati rice was recorded in organic control (2871 kg ha−1). However, only four treatments were considered to quantify methane (CH4) flux. Maximum CH4 flux was observed at panicle initiation stage (55 days after transplanting (DAT)). Across the crop growth period, GM + VC, farmyard manure (FYM) + VC, SRI and chemical control produced an average CH4 flux of 20.19, 13.00, 9.83 and 5.53 mg m−2 h−1, respectively. This shows that among the nutrient sources, CH4 emission was higher in organically fertilized plots as compared to chemically fertilized with urea at initial stages; however, at later stages, not much variation was observed in CH4 emission for different nutrient sources. Even with in organic system, less CH4 was emitted from SRI field where water was maintained through alternate wetting and drying system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Basmati rice; Crop growth rate; Farmyard manure; Methane flux; Sesbania aculeate; Vermicompost; Water use efficiency; Yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013663649

In this study, first a large eddy simulation of a non-premixed planar methane jet flame with artificial neural network -based chemical kinetics is performed. To consider the effects of turbulence on the evolution of the thermo-chemical state space, the artificial neural network training patterns are obtained by solving the unsteady reaction-diffusion equations of linear eddy mixing sub-grid combustion model. The optimization procedure for selecting the optimum neural network architecture is discussed in detail. A flow field analysis and a comparison between a non-reactive jet with the same velocity boundary conditions with the flame jet are performed. It is shown that the non-reactive jet is more turbulent and vortical structures of the non-reactive jet occur closer to the jet exit compared to the flame jet. Second, in a first attempt to quantify the influence of different chemical kinetics methods, large eddy simulation computations are performed with other methods used to represent the chemical kinetics such as direct integration and look-up table. A comparative study is performed between the averaged, instantaneous and fluctuation profiles of the scalar field and flame structures obtained by each method. Although all large eddy simulation results are very close to each other, the main discrepancy is observed for CO mass fractions obtained by artificial neural network and look-up table-based chemical kinetics simulations. It is also shown that the averaged scalar field and the conditional averaged values of the flame are overestimated by look-up table based chemical kinetics large eddy simulation computations. Moreover, the potential savings of artificial neural network in computational costs in comparison with other chemistry approaches are illustrated. © IMechE 2015.","artificial neural network; chemical kinetics; large eddy simulation; non-premixed flame; Turbulent combustion","Combustion; Computational chemistry; Fighter aircraft; Kinetics; Linear equations; Methane; Network architecture; Neural networks; Reaction kinetics; Table lookup; Training aircraft; Chemical kinetics model; Chemical kinetics simulation; Neural network training; Non-premixed flame; Optimization procedures; Reaction diffusion equations; Turbulent combustion; Velocity boundary condition; Large eddy simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015226188

Results show that, except in summer, an unconstrained transmission grid can meet the load at five build-out levels spanning 7–70 GW of capacity, with the addition of at most 1–8 GW of reserves. In the summer, the combination of high load and variable winds is challenging. The simulated grid can handle up through build-out level 3 (36 GW of offshore wind capacity), with 8 GW of reserves and without any generation shortage. For comparison, when Smart-ISO is run with perfect forecasts, all five build-out levels, up to 70 GW of wind, can be integrated in all seasons with at most 3 GW of reserves. This reinforces the importance of accurate wind forecasts. At build-out level 3, energy from wind would satisfy between 11 and 20% of the demand for electricity and settlement prices could be reduced by up to 24%, though in the summer peak they could actually increase by up to 6%. CO2 emissions are reduced by 19–40%, SO2 emissions by 21–43%, and NOx emissions by 13–37%. This study finds that integrating up to 36 GW of offshore wind is feasible in the PJM grid with today's generation fleet and planning policies, with the addition of 8 GW of reserves.

Productivity gains in livestock have been pointed out as a promising alternative to achieve that goal. Thus, this paper analyses the economic impacts of a policy of productivity gains in the Brazilian livestock. Besides, we evaluate if the policy may conciliate agricultural growth and deforestation control, bearing in mind the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use changes. The analysis was carried out through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, tailored to represent land-use changes, GHG emissions and removals. Besides, it made progress modeling the heterogeneity of climate, soils, and emissions in inter-regional models with many regions. The results show that productivity gains can effectively “save” land and thus avoid deforestation, especially in the Amazon and Cerrado (savannah) biomes. The policy also may boost the economic growth, spreading it to other regions of Brazil, like Centre-West and North, and increasing income and consumption in those places. However, as a climate policy, focused on the reduction of GHG emissions, the results may be counterproductive. The net amount issued may increase, as a result of the positive stimulus of the policy on the economy, and GHG emissions are directly related to the economic growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CGE model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use changes; Livestock; Productivity","computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; emission; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; land use change; livestock; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008608325

This has been an expectation and a hotly contested issue in REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) since its inception. While the core purpose of REDD+ is to reduce carbon emissions, its legitimacy and success also depend on its impacts on local well-being. To effectively safeguard against negative impacts, we need to know whether and which well-being outcomes can be attributed to REDD+. Yet, distinguishing the effects of choosing particular locations for REDD+ from the effects of the interventions themselves remains a challenge. The Global Comparative Study (GCS) on REDD+ employed a quasi-experimental before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study design to address this challenge and evaluate the impacts of 16 REDD+ pilots across the tropics. We find that the GCS approach allows identification of control groups that represent the counterfactual, thereby permitting attribution of outcomes to REDD+. The GCS experience belies many of the common critiques of the BACI design, especially concerns about collecting baseline data on control groups. Our findings encourage and validate the early planning and up-front investments required to evaluate the local impacts of global climate change mitigation efforts with confidence. The stakes are high, both for the global environment and for local populations directly affected by those efforts. The standards for evidence should be concomitantly high. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Conservation and development; Impact evaluation; REDD+; Well-being","baseline survey; carbon emission; climate change; conservation; design; emission control; environmental impact assessment; experimental study; global climate; mitigation; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014311481

The local wind energy industry, as an alternative to replace fuel, witnessed a politically-sponsored take-off in both countries in terms of global market share as well as domestically-installed wind energy capacity in the late 2000s. In particular, the current governments have taken the issue seriously on both the local and international levels. China and India ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015 and their national climate objectives. The puzzle of rapidly growing and politically supported wind energy sectors in these two countries in which environmental protection is strategically ignored in favour for economic growth has to be understood in the terms of the bigger picture of Beijing and New Delhi fostering external and internal legitimation by transforming norms and values to measureable outcomes.

Yet prey preferences of the wolf have been poorly evaluated in situations of complex predator/prey systems because such ecological situations are extremely rare in Europe. In particular, the role of beaver is poorly known due to the extreme decline in its range and population over the last few centuries. We conducted a 15-year study (1999–2014) of wolf Canis lupus diet in the Naliboki forest of central-western Belarus to determine the dietary responses of the wolf population in a context of a rich prey supply (beaver 650 inds/100 km2, elk 47 inds/100 km2, red deer 98 inds/100 km, roe deer 398 inds/100 km2, wild boar 234 inds/100 km2). The bison, although present, is not preyed on. We compared the seasonal and annual diet variations of both wolf adults and pups, by scat analysis and hair identification. In winter 2012–2013, the winter was quite harsh with a long period of snow, which severely affected the roe deer and wild boar populations. Five severe summer droughts also occurred (1999, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2013), greatly decreasing the water level in rivers and canals. We took advantage of these stressful events to evaluate the diet responses of the wolves. In “normal” years, we identified 11 food categories, essentially beaver and medium-sized ungulates (66%), and large ungulates to a lesser extent (9% in summer, 20% in winter). The adults were found to selectively supply pups with beaver, probably because of its easy transportability. Beaver consumption also increased during summer droughts when water levels were very low. After the harsh winter of 2012–2013, which was followed by a sharp decline in medium-sized prey, we observed a shift in the winter diet breadth of the wolves towards greater consumption of both large wild ungulates and small carnivores. We concluded that: 1. Beaver is a functional element in wolf ecology, as a primary food for adults and pups; 2. A large range of available prey species is important to maintaining a viable wolf population in cases of extreme climatic events. © 2016","Beaver; Belarus; Cold winter; Drought; Forest; Rich predator/prey system; Wolf","canid; climate effect; dietary overlap; drought; feces; feeding behavior; forest ecosystem; hair; home range; population decline; predator-prey interaction; prey selection; ungulate; winter; Belarus; Eurasia; Bison; Canidae; Canis lupus; Capreolus; Cervus elaphus; Mammalia; Sus scrofa; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007273940

Vulnerability to climate change, however, differs spatially within the country owing to regional differences in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The study uses the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM-ES) climate projections to assess the dynamics in vulnerability across four climate change exposure scenarios developed using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The analysis was carried out at subnational (district) level; the results were interpreted and reported for their corresponding agro-ecological zones. Vulnerability of each district was quantified using indicators capturing climatic variability, ecological and demographic sensitivity, and socio-economic capacity. Our analysis further assigns probabilities to vulnerability classes of all the 579 districts falling under different agro-ecological zones. The results of the vulnerability profile show that Western plains, Northern plains, and central highlands of the arid and semi-arid agro-ecological zones are the most vulnerable regions in the current scenario (1950–2000). In the future scenario (2050), it extends along districts falling within Deccan plateau and Central (Malwa) highlands, lying in the arid and semi-arid zones, along with regions vulnerable in the current scenario, recording the highest vulnerability score across all exposure scenarios. These regions exhibit highest degree of variation in climatic parameters, ecological fragility, socio-economic marginality, and limited accessibility to resources, generating conditions of high vulnerability. The study emphasizes on the priority to take up adaptive management actions in the identified vulnerable districts to not only reduce risks of climate change, but also enhance their inherent capacity to withstand any future changes in climate. It provides a systematic approach to explicitly identify vulnerable regions, where regional planners and policy makers can build on existing adaptation decision-making by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach in the context of global change scenario. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agro-ecological zones; Climate change; HadGEM-ES; RCPs; Vulnerability assessment","action plan; adaptive management; agroecology; climate change; climate modeling; concentration (composition); global change; interdisciplinary approach; policy making; regional planning; upland region; vulnerability; Deccan; India; Malwa; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939619502

Research reports related to effector crosstalk in phytonematodes for successful parasitism of the host tissue is yet underexplored. In view of this, we have used in planta effector screening approach to understand the possible interaction of pioneer genes (msp-18 and msp-20, putatively involved in late and early stage of M. incognita parasitism, respectively) with other unrelated effectors such as cell-wall modifying enzymes (CWMEs) in M. incognita. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) strategy was used to generate the transgenic eggplants expressing msp-18 and msp-20, independently. Putative transformants were characterized via qRT-PCR and Southern hybridization assay. SiRNAs specific to msp-18 and msp-20 were also detected in the transformants via Northern hybridization assay. Transgenic expression of the RNAi constructs of msp-18 and msp-20 genes resulted in 43.64-69.68% and 41.74-67.30% reduction in M. incognita multiplication encompassing 6 and 10 events, respectively. Additionally, transcriptional oscillation of CWMEs documented in the penetrating and developing nematodes suggested the possible interaction among CWMEs and pioneer genes. The rapid assimilation of plant-derived carbon by invading nematodes was also demonstrated using 14C isotope probing approach. Our data suggests that HIGS of msp-18 and msp-20, improves nematode resistance in eggplant by affecting the steady-state transcription level of CWME genes in invading nematodes, and safeguard the plant against nematode invasion at very early stage because nematodes may become the recipient of bioactive RNA species during the process of penetration into the plant root. © 2017 Shivakumara, Chaudhary, Kamaraju, Dutta, Papolu, Banakar, Sreevathsa, Singh, Manjaiah and Rao.","14C isotope; CWME; Higs; Msp-18; Msp-20; QRT-PCR; RNAi",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017317791

Due to this difficulty of imaging assessment on mild TBI patients, there has been much emphasis on the development of diffusion imaging modalities such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, basic science research in TBI shows that many of the functional and metabolic abnormalities in TBI may be present even in the absence of structural damage. Moreover, structural damage may be present at a microscopic and molecular level that is not detectable by structural imaging modality. The use of functional and metabolic imaging modalities can provide information on pathological changes in mild TBI patients that may not be detected by structural imaging. Although there are various differences in protocols of positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) methods, these may be important modalities to be used in conjunction with structural imaging in the future in order to detect and understand the pathophysiology of mild TBI. In this review, studies of mild TBI patients using these modalities that detect functional and metabolic state of the brain are discussed.

The cuticular surfaces of female Callosobruchus seed beetles contain a contact sex pheromone, which elicits copulatory behavior in congeneric males. Asymmetric cross-copulatory behavior was observed between C. maculatus and C. rhodesianus despite considerable differences in the structures of their contact sex pheromones. C. maculatus uses dicarboxylic acid, whereas C. rhodesianus uses two ketone compounds in conjunction with similar synergistic cuticular hydrocarbon blends in both cases. Male C. maculatus exhibited copulatory behavior with females of both C. maculatus and C. rhodesianus, but male C. rhodesianus mated only with congeneric females. To establish the reasons for the asymmetric cross-copulatory behavior of C. maculatus, we tried to identify the heterospecific mate-eliciting compounds in the cuticles collected from virgin C. rhodesianus females. The compounds were fractionated using acid-base partitioning and chromatography techniques and then assayed for their ability to elicit male copulatory activity. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the active acidic fraction revealed the presence of three dicarboxylic acids: 2-methylsuberic acid (2-methyloctanedioic acid) (1), 3-methylsuberic acid (3-methyloctanedioic acid) (2), and nonanedioic acid (3). The synergistic effect was compared using synthetic standards and natural hydrocarbons. When the compounds were combined with the natural hydrocarbons, compounds 1 and 2 elicited significant copulatory activity in male C. maculatus. In contrast, relative to the effect of natural hydrocarbons alone, compound 3 did not exhibit significant copulatory activity when combined with natural hydrocarbons. The results demonstrated that the asymmetric cross-copulatory behavior of C. maculatus is induced by the presence of contact sex pheromone analogs on the cuticular surface of female C. rhodesianus. In combination with previous reports, although a saltational evolution was hypothesized for the contact sex pheromones of C. rhodesianus, this species continues to produce dicarboxylic acids functioning as pheromones that are structurally similar to those secreted by closely related species. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.","2-Methylsuberic acid; 3-Methylsuberic acid; Callosobruchus maculatus; Callosobruchus rhodesianus; Contact sex pheromone; Pheromone evolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014035461

This engine is the smallest product in the new Honda VTEC TURBO engine series (1), and it is intended to be used in small to medium-sized passenger car category vehicles, enhancing both fuel economy through downsizing, state-of-the-art friction reduction technologies such as electrically controlled variable displacement oil pump and timing belt in oil system, and also driving performance through turbocharging with an electrically controlled waste gate. This developed engine has many features in common with other VTEC TURBO engines such as the 1.5 liter I4 turbocharged engine (2) (3), which has been introduced already into the market. Some of these are the rapid combustion concept realized by high tumble intake port design and the optimized combustion chamber configuration combined with a side mounted multi-hole direct injection system. In addition to VTC (valve timing control system), the VTEC (Variable valve timing and lift electronic control system) has been used in the intake valve system in order to realize an Atkinson cycle to reduce fuel consumption in low valve lift mode. Investigation results show that side-mounted direct injection has potential comparable to that of central-mounted direct injection in terms of mixture homogeneity and combustion chamber wall wetting, while no disadvantage in combustion performance was observed. Through such technologies, this developed engine achieved top level of fuel consumption characteristics in this class, contributing to improve the fuel economy by 26% from the previous engine in NEDC (new European driving cycle) mode.

The present study focuses on two types of resident vehicular PM2.5 reduction behaviors (taking public transportation and purchasing electric vehicles) and examines their key predictors and influencing mechanism based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data was collected from Chinese urban residents who lived in heavy haze areas. The results indicated that attitude, subjective norm and moral norm have positive effects on each vehicular PM2.5 reduction intention. It was highlighted that the differentiated perceived behavioral control components (self-efficacy and perceived control) and their moderating effects were inconsistent across two behaviors. Regarding to the behavior of taking public transportation, self-efficacy affected the intention positively and directly, while perceived control affected intention indirectly by moderating the relationship between subjective norm and intention. For purchasing electric vehicles, self-efficacy and perceived control didn't affect intention directly. Instead, self-efficacy moderated the relationship between moral norm and intention, and perceived control moderated the relationship between subjective norm and intention. The results confirm the appropriateness of the extended TPB model in predicting resident intentions to participate in vehicular PM2.5 reduction behaviors.

Regulating household PM2.5-reduction behavior is a beneficial measure for PM2.5 emission control in urban areas. The current research examines the determinants that affect household PM2.5-reduction behavioral intention, and an integrative model of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), incorporated with Norm Activation Theory (NAM), was used. An effective sample of 418 urban households who lived in heavy haze areas of China was collected. The empirical results revealed that household attitude toward PM2.5-reduction, perceived behavioral control and descriptive norm all significantly affected PM2.5-reduction intention, while subjective norm was not. Furthermore, in addressing severe haze pollution, household environmental concern indirectly and significantly affects their moral norm and intention. In addition, there was a moderating effect of perceived behavioral control (stemming from TPB) on the relationship between household moral norm (stemming from NAM) and PM2.5-reduction intention. The results confirm the appropriateness of the integrative model in predicting household intention to participate in PM2.5-reduction behavior.

At present, due to the emission charges and the emissions trading policy failed to effectively prompt enterprises to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Therefore, improving air quality through regional negotiations and cooperation may be feasible and effective. In this study, which was based on game theory, a transboundary air pollution model was established to conduct an empirical study on the cost-effectiveness of cooperative SO2 reduction in three cities of Hunan province in China. Four gain allocation mechanisms, i.e., the nucleolus, Nash-Harsanyi allocation solution, Shapley value and Separable Cost Remaining Benefit (SCRB) principle, were employed to allocate the gains of cooperation, and the fairness and stability of the different allocation mechanisms were also analyzed. The results show that if a gain-sharing mechanism can reasonably allocate the gain from full cooperation, it is then feasible and effective for the three cities to fully cooperate to reduce SO2 emissions. Among the four gain allocation methods investigated in this empirical study, the stabilities of gain allocation for full cooperation using SCRB principle and Nash-Harsanyi allocation method were higher than those using the other two allocation methods. The results provide clear empirical evidence that regional gain allocation may affect the sustainability of cooperation. Therefore, although it was desirable to reduce SO2 emissions through cooperation, the long-term sustainability of cooperation should be taken into account in developing relevant policies. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Cooperation gain allocation; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Fairness; Stability; Transboundary SO2 pollution control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994531681

The main finding of this research is that influential corporations, such as leading wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers or state-owned electricity utility companies, have played an important role in the renewable energy policy process by framing the strategic preferences and policy priority, and by negotiating and coordinating with state actors at both central and local level. Therefore, in China's climate governance domain, instead of a traditional perception of a state-led governance mode in which state officers are often believed to be the only crucial actors to steer climate-related policies, this study reveals that the government's autonomy in the policy process is increasingly constrained by the rising industrial interest groups who possess considerable resources and institutional power in China's renewable energy policy subsystem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy governance; Interest group politics; Policy community; Political economy; Renewable energy policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006160288

To investigate the variations of air pollutants and the sources and mixing state of size-resolved aerosols in response to the emission controls, trace gases (O3, SO2, NO2, and CO), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and single particle aerosols were measured in Jiaxing, China during December 11–25, 2015. During the WIC (from 00:00 on Dec. 16 to 16:00 on Dec. 18, 2015), the average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO in Jiaxing were 38.7, 75.0, and 43.5 μg m−3 and 0.7 mg m−3 and were decreased by 62.1%, 47.1%, 31.2%, and 41.7% and 60.0%, 45.7%, 34.7%, and 41.7% compared to before and after the WIC, respectively. These changes were caused mainly by strict measurement of traffic restrictions and industrial emission reductions. By using the single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), 8,350,772 particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 μm were identified. Of these particles, 877,397 were successfully ionized. The aerosol particles collected for SPAMS data analysis employed 96.0% of the hit particles to recognize 5 major particle classes: K-rich particles (K-CN, K-Secondary, and K-mixed Elemental Carbon (K-EC)), sodium particles, carbon-rich particles (EC-Nitrate, EC-Secondary, and Organics and Elemental Carbon (OCEC)), ammonium particles, and heavy-metal particles (Fe-Secondary, Pb, and Cu-V). Signals from 23[Na]+ were uniformly observed among these 11 types of particles, which may have been affected by sea salt particles in the coastal city of Jiaxing. During the WIC, the proportions of K-EC (4.5%), EC-Secondary (2.0%), Fe-Secondary (1.9%), EC-Nitrate (0.5%), and Ammonium (0.7%) decreased, the proportions of K-CN (15.2%), OCEC (27.5%), and Cu-V (16.8%) increased significantly, and the proportions of K-Secondary (17.2%), sodium (11.6%), and Pb (2.0%) changed slightly. During the WIC, the peaks representing different particle classes shifted to fine particle segments at 0.5–0.6 μm, and the peak width was relatively narrowed compared to before and after the WIC. The reduction of air pollutant emissions significantly influenced the K-CN, OCEC, Cu-V, EC-Secondary, Fe-Secondary, and K-EC particles with sizes of 0.4–1.4 μm. The information obtained on variations of air pollutants, the mixing state, and the temporal variation of particle types is essential for developing an understanding of air quality assurance control for subsequent WICs and of the origin and evolution processes of atmospheric aerosols. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2nd World Internet Conference; Air pollutants; Jiaxing; Mixing state; Source","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Copper; Emission control; Heavy metals; Industrial emissions; Ionization of gases; Lead; Mixing; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Quality assurance; Quality control; Reduction; Sulfur dioxide; 2nd World Internet Conference; Air pollutants; Jiaxing; Mixing state; Source; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015730070

By applying observed relationships of PM2.5 and meteorology to the IPCC Coupled Model Intercomparision Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archives, we bypass some of the uncertainties inherent in chemistry-climate models. Our approach uses both the relationships between PM2.5 and local meteorology as well as the synoptic circulation patterns, defined as the singular value decomposition (SVD) pattern of the spatial correlations between PM2.5 and meteorological variables in the surrounding region. Using an ensemble of 19 global climate models (GCMs) under the RCP4.5 scenario, we project an increase of 0.4-1.4μgm-3 in annual mean PM2.5 in the eastern US and a decrease of 0.3-1.2μgm-3 in the Intermountain West by the 2050s, assuming present-day anthropogenic sources of PM2.5. Mean summertime PM2.5 increases as much as 2-3μgm-3 in the eastern United States due to faster oxidation rates and greater mass of organic aerosols from biogenic emissions. Mean wintertime PM2.5 decreases by 0.3-3μgm-3 over most regions in the United States, likely due to the volatilization of ammonium nitrate. Our approach provides an efficient method to calculate the potential climate penalty on air quality across a range of models and scenarios. We find that current atmospheric chemistry models may underestimate or even fail to capture the strongly positive sensitivity of monthly mean PM2.5 to temperature in the eastern United States in summer, and they may underestimate future changes in PM2.5 in a warmer climate. In GEOS-Chem, the underestimate in monthly mean PM2.5-temperature relationship in the east in summer is likely caused by overly strong negative sensitivity of monthly mean low cloud fraction to temperature in the assimilated meteorology (∼-0.04-1) compared to the weak sensitivity implied by satellite observations (±0.01K-1). The strong negative dependence of low cloud cover on temperature in turn causes the modeled rates of sulfate aqueous oxidation to diminish too rapidly as temperatures rise, leading to the underestimate of sulfate-temperature slopes, especially in the south. Our work underscores the importance of evaluating the sensitivity of PM2.5 to its key controlling meteorological variables in climate-chemistry models on multiple timescales before they are applied to project future air quality. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol; air quality; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; global climate; particulate matter; statistical analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016582916

Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of climatic and socioeconomic indicators on malaria transmission and to predict malaria transmission risk until 2025 for all the southeastern endemic counties in Iran. Methods: The aggregated data from indigenous malaria cases, as well as, climatic and socioeconomic indicators of malaria endemic areas were collected on the monthly basis from each county between 2005 and 2015. The collected variables were, then, estimated until 2025 using time series analysis. Considering the nature of these data, two different multilevel models were implemented for vivax and falciparum based on the socioeconomic variable that was used. Finally, applying two different models, two sets of estimates were obtained for malaria transmission risk in each county. Results: The annual decline of malaria transmission was estimated to be 17% based on model 1, and 25% based on the model 2 for vivax (P < 0.001). These estimates were 13% and 21% for falciparum (P < 0.001), respectively. For every increased unit in the wealth index, malaria transmission for vivax and falciparum decreased by 33% (P = 0.001) and 12% (P = 0.54), respectively. Also, for every increase in the mean years of schooling, the transmission decreased by 65% (P < 0.001) and 57% (P = 0.001) for vivax and falciparum. Conclusions: The results of this study, using climatic variables along with socioeconomic variables, indicated the obvious influence of socioeconomic status improvement on decreasing malaria transmission. According to the results, malaria transmission risk will considerably diminish in the next few years. The pattern of malaria transmission decline was consistent with the declining trend of malaria incidence which will move from the west to the east and from the north to the south in the years to come. The transmission risk for falciparum was considerably lower than that of vivax and the endemic areas of falciparum move towards 0 faster than vivax. © 2017, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.","Geographic information systems; Iran; Malaria; Multilevel analysis; Risk","adult; Article; climate change; disease elimination; disease surveillance; disease transmission; endemic disease; female; geographic distribution; health program; human; incidence; Iran; major clinical study; malaria; malaria falciparum; male; medical education; multilevel analysis; Plasmodium vivax; probability; risk factor; socioeconomics; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018437070

As the variety and complexity of these tools increases, there is a need for comparative studies across a range of settings, allowing users to make an informed choice. Using examples of provisioning and regulating services (water supply, carbon storage and nutrient retention), we compare three spatially explicit tools – LUCI (Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator), ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs). Models were parameterised for the UK and applied to a temperate catchment with widely varying land use in North Wales. Although each tool provides quantitative mapped output, can be applied in different contexts, and can work at local or national scale, they differ in the approaches taken and underlying assumptions made. In this study, we focus on the wide range of outputs produced for each service and discuss the differences between each modelling tool. Model outputs were validated using empirical data for river flow, carbon and nutrient levels within the catchment. The sensitivity of the models to land-use change was tested using four scenarios of varying severity, evaluating the conversion of grassland habitat to woodland (0–30% of the landscape). We show that, while the modelling tools provide broadly comparable quantitative outputs, each has its own unique features and strengths. Therefore the choice of tool depends on the study question. © 2017 The Authors","ARIES; Carbon; InVEST; LUCI; Nutrient retention; Water supply","Carbon; Digital storage; Forestry; Land use; Nutrients; Runoff; Water supply; Alternative management; ARIES; Comparative studies; Ecosystem services modelling; InVEST; LUCI; Nutrient retention; Valuation of ecosystem services; Ecosystems; carbon; artificial intelligence; comparative study; ecosystem service; nutrient; retention; strength; water supply; Article; artificial intelligence for ecosystem service; catchment; ecosystem; empirical research; environmental management; forest; grassland; habitat; integrated valuation of ecosystem service; intermethod comparison; land use; land utilisation and capability indicator; nutrient; river; United Kingdom; water supply; North Wales; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010661774

Based on the survey data, this paper used a biomass conversion function method to evaluate the carbon stores and carbon density of China's arboreal forests. The results showed that: (1) By age group, the largest portion of carbon stores in China's arboreal forests are in middle-aged forests. Over-mature forests have the least carbon storage; (2) By origin, natural forests of all age groups have higher carbon storage and carbon density than man-made forest plantations. The carbon density of natural forests and forest plantations increases gradually with the age of the trees; (3) By type (dominant tree species), the 18 most abundant types of arboreal forest in China account for approximately 94% of the nation's total arboreal forest biomass and carbon storage. Among these, broadleaf mixed and Quercus spp. form the two largest portions. Taxus spp. forests, while comprising a very small portion of China's forested area, have very high carbon density; (4) By region, the overall arboreal forest carbon storage is highest in the southwest part of China, and lowest in the northwest. However, because of differences in land use and forest coverage ratios, regions with arboreal forests of high carbon density are not necessarily the same regions that have high overall carbon storage; (5) By province, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Tibet, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Jilin have rather high carbon storage. The arboreal forests in Tibet, Jilin, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hainan have a rather high carbon density. This paper's evaluation of carbon storage in China's arboreal forests is a valuable reference for interpreting the role and function of Chinese ecosystems in coping with global climate change. © 2017 by the authors.","Arboreal forests; Biomass; Carbon density; Carbon storage; Forest resource inventory","Bioconversion; Biomass; Climate change; Digital storage; Function evaluation; Land use; Natural resources; Surveys; Arboreal forests; Biomass conversion; Carbon density; Carbon storage; Forest plantation; Forest resource inventory; Global climate changes; National surveys; Forestry; assessment method; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; forest resource; plantation forestry; Biomass; Carbon; Density; Forests; Inventory Control; China; Quercus; Taxus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017394567

Our results indicate that reef growth was more active in the middle Miocene than in any earlier periods, decreased in the late Miocene, revitalized in the Pliocene, and active again in the Pleistocene interglacial periods. Unlike those limestone-rich intervals, the late Miocene succession in well XK1 is characterized by dolomitized limestones with a low deposition rate (30–60 m/Ma post-compaction). These late Miocene rocks also contain relative high MgO (~ 20%), more ∑ REE, abundant algae and some small sized foraminifera, but rare larger benthic foraminifera, very low land-sourced brGDGTs (0–0.5 ng/20 g), low BIT index (0.1–0.5), and low TEX86-derived sea temperature (~ 20–25 °C), indicating limited active reef growth in relative cooler mesophotic environments at > 30 m water depths. Similar dolomitized limestones of late Miocene age also occur in other carbonate platform areas including the Nansha (Spratly) Islands in the southern South China Sea. Together, these South China Sea records provide regional evidence of a recession in global carbonate platform development starting from the late Miocene. While carbonate platform reduction in other regions may have been triggered by global cooling and changing oceanic chemistry, accelerated basin subsidence coupled with monsoon cooling are considered as the main factors causing the reef decline in the late Miocene South China Sea. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Geochemical elements; Reef carbonate platform; South China Sea; Xisha Islands","Biomarkers; Carbonation; Deposition rates; Geochemistry; Lime; Limestone; Magnesia; Reefs; Benthic foraminifera; Carbonate platforms; Geochemical elements; Interglacial periods; Lithostratigraphy; South China sea; Southern South China Sea; Xisha Islands; Stratigraphy; benthic foraminifera; biomarker; carbonate platform; cooling; depositional sequence; geochemical method; geochemical survey; Miocene; Pleistocene; reef; sea surface temperature; Pacific Ocean; Paracel Islands; South China Sea; algae; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012173260

We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010-2012). Near 95% of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5% at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared ~50% of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn - G) and H indicated a ""cooling effect"" feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","available energy; cooling effect; ecosystem function; ecosystem stability; eddy-covariance; energy balance; energy partitioning; land use change; latent heat; net radiation; sensible heat; soil heat","desert soil; eddy covariance; energy balance; global climate; grazing; land use change; latent heat flux; leaf area index; net radiation; sensible heat flux; soil temperature; steppe; vapor pressure; Mongolian Plateau; rain; animal; animal husbandry; China; desert climate; ecosystem; feeding behavior; grassland; physiology; procedures; season; sheep; time factor; Animal Husbandry; Animals; China; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Grassland; Rain; Seasons; Sheep; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014527044

Forests degradation and deforestation aggravate global warming, and the LU/LC information obtained from satellite data is now very essential for global environmental conservation and ecosystem. Especially the typical example of getting the accurate LU/LC information is the reducing emission from forest deforestation and degradation. The LU/LC information is valuable because it can be obtained on regular basis even across the vast areas like natural forests. Different researchers used different methods and tools for LU/LC classification such as Parallelepiped, Minimum Distance, Binary Encoding, Spectral Angle Mapper, Spectral Information Divergence as supervised classifiers. All these methods used for different purposes and with different parameters. This research is formulated to evaluate the performance of the Artificial Neural Network & Support Vector Machine for Land Use and Land Cover (LU/LC) classification using different parameters such as (Training Rate, Training Threshold Contribution, Training Momentum) in ANN and (Penalty Parameter, Pyramid Level) in SVM using ENVI 4.7. The Abbottabad test patch is used for LU/LC classification. Five classes Agriculture Land, Settlements, Water Bodies, Forest and Barren Land are used in this research. The ANN & SVM classifiers are applied to the Abbottabad test patch using different parameters and evaluate the best classifier according to their accuracy in confusion matrix. The ANN gives the overall accuracy of 99.35% and SVM gives the overall accuracy of 99.88%.

A recent study translates Markowitz's risk-diversification strategy from finance to conservation settings, enabling conservation agents to use this diversification strategy for allocating conservation and restoration investments across space to minimize the risk associated with such uncertainty. However, this method is information intensive and requires a large number of forecasts of ecological outcomes associated with possible climate-change scenarios for carrying out fine-resolution conservation planning. We developed a technique for iterative, spatial portfolio analysis that can be used to allocate scarce conservation resources across a desired level of subregions in a planning landscape in the absence of a sufficient number of ecological forecasts. We applied our technique to the Prairie Pothole Region in central North America. A lack of sufficient future climate information prevented attainment of the most efficient risk-return conservation outcomes in the Prairie Pothole Region. The difference in expected conservation returns between conservation planning with limited climate-change information and full climate-change information was as large as 30% for the Prairie Pothole Region even when the most efficient iterative approach was used. However, our iterative approach allowed finer resolution portfolio allocation with limited climate-change forecasts such that the best possible risk-return combinations were obtained. With our most efficient iterative approach, the expected loss in conservation outcomes owing to limited climate-change information could be reduced by 17% relative to other iterative approaches. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology","diversificación; diversification; incertidumbre; manejo de recursos naturales; natural resource management; optimal reserve-site selection; optimización del portafolio; portfolio optimization; selección del sitio óptimo de reserva; uncertainty","biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; natural resource; optimization; resource allocation; resource management; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Prairie Pothole Region; Central America; climate; climate change; environmental protection; forecasting; human; North America; Central America; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forecasting; Humans; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003486023

Despite a large number of existing wells in the area studied in this paper, the depositional environments and the stratigraphic architecture were still poorly known. In order to improve the geological understanding, we propose a workflow to assess the remaining reservoir potential of mature hydrocarbon areas, integrating cores, cuttings, well-logs, biostratigraphy and seismic data. This workflow was developed for and is exemplified with the northwest of the Lower Saxony Basin (LSB), a mature hydrocarbon province in northwest Germany, but can be applied in a similar fashion to other areas. Systematic integration of lithofacies analysis, chrono- and sequence stratigraphy, combined with electrofacies analysis and modern digital methods like neural network-based lithology determination and 3D facies modelling provides a high-resolution understanding of the spatial facies and reservoir architecture in the study area. Despite widely correlatable litho-units in the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous in the LSB, complex heterogeneous sedimentary systems can be found in the basin’s marginal parts. Two new play types were determined in the study area, showing a remaining potential for stratigraphic hydrocarbon traps. The results of this exploration scale study also provide the basis for re-evaluations on a field development scale. On a basin scale, this study may encourage further data acquisition and re-evaluations to discover previously unknown reservoirs. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electrofacies; Facies and reservoir modelling; Integrated workflow; Lower Saxony Basin; LSB; Malm; Mature hydrocarbon basin; Neural networks; Remaining reservoir potential; Sequence stratigraphy; Upper Jurassic","data acquisition; facies analysis; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary; sequence stratigraphy; thermal maturity; three-dimensional modeling; trap (geological structure); Germany; Lower Saxony Basin; North German Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976291182

Research has mainly focused on climatic controls of channel incision rates, while the climatic influence on planform geometry has often been overlooked. Here we analyze nearly one million digitally mapped river junctions throughout the contiguous United States and show that branching angles vary systematically with climatic aridity. In arid landscapes, which are thought to be dominated by surface runoff erosion, junction angles average roughly 45° in the driest places. Branching angles are systematically wider in humid regions, averaging roughly 72°, which is the theoretically predicted angle for network growth in a diffusive field such as groundwater seepage. The correlation of mean junction angle with aridity is stronger than with topographic gradient, downstream concavity, or other geometric factors that have been proposed as controls of junction angles. Thus, it may be possible to identify channelization processes from stream network geometry in relict landscapes, such as those on Mars. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

We provide a comparative application of these models to carbon dioxide emission allowance prices from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and evaluate their performance with up-to-date model comparison tests based on out-of-sample forecasts of future volatility and value-at-risk. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Backtesting; Carbon dioxide emission allowance prices; Encompassing test; FIGARCH; GARCH; Markov-switching GARCH; Multifractal processes; SPA test","Commerce; Costs; Emission control; Fractals; Global warming; International law; Losses; Risk management; Value engineering; Backtesting; Carbon dioxide emissions; FIGARCH; GARCH; Markov switching; Multifractal process; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997207456

Many factors, including drought, climate change, reduced water allocations, and land-use changes could worsen salinity conditions there, and in other agricultural lands in the state. Mapping soil salinity at regional and state levels is essential for identifying drivers and trends in agricultural soil salinity, and for developing mitigation strategies, but traditional soil sampling for salinity does not allow for accurate large-scale mapping. We tested remote-sensing modeling to map root zone soil salinity for farmland in the WSJV. According to our map, 0.78 million acres are salt affected (i.e., ECe > 4 dS/m), which represents 45% of the mapped farmland; 30% of that acreage is strongly or extremely saline. Independent validations of the remote-sensing estimations indicated acceptable to excellent correspondences, except in areas of low salinity and high soil heterogeneity.

Heat stress is expected to further increase due to urbanization, an aging population, and global warming. Previous research has identified correlations between extreme heat and mortality. However, the underlying physical, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors remain largely unknown and comprehensive quantitative investigation on an individual level is lacking. We conducted a new cross-sectional household questionnaire survey to analyze individual heat impairment (self-assessed and reported symptoms) and a large set of potential risk factors in the city of Berlin, Germany. This unique dataset (n = 474) allows for the investigation of new relationships, especially between health/fitness and urban heat stress. Our analysis found previously undocumented associations, leading us to generate new hypotheses for future research: various health/fitness variables returned the strongest associations with individual heat stress. Our primary hypothesis is that age, the most commonly used risk factor, is outperformed by health/fitness as a dominant risk factor. Related variables seem to more accurately represent humans' cardiovascular capacity to handle elevated temperature. Among them, active travel was associated with reduced heat stress. We observed statistical associations for heat exposure regarding the individual living space but not for the neighborhood environment. Heat stress research should further investigate individual risk factors of heat stress using quantitative methodologies. It should focus more on health and fitness and systematically explore their role in adaptation strategies. The potential of health and fitness to reduce urban heat stress risk means that encouraging active travel could be an effective adaptation strategy. Through reduced CO2 emissions from urban transport, societies could reap double rewards by addressing two root causes of urban heat stress: population health and global warming. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","active travel; climate change adaptation; individual heat stress; mortality; self-assessed health risk; socio-environmental survey; urban health","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Health; Heating; Risk assessment; Surveys; Thermal stress; Urban transportation; active travel; Climate change adaptation; Environmental surveys; Heat stress; mortality; Urban health; Health risks; adaptive management; aging population; climate change; environmental assessment; future prospect; health risk; health survey; heat wave; impact; mortality; questionnaire survey; research work; risk factor; urban climate; Berlin; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018528414

Here we report on a recent mesocosm CO2 perturbation study (Raunefjorden, Norway), with a focus on organic matter and phytoplankton dynamics. Cell numbers of three phytoplankton groups were particularly affected by increasing levels of seawater CO2 throughout the entire experiment, with the cyanobacterium Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes (prasinophytes) profiting, and the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (prymnesiophyte) being negatively impacted. Combining these results with other phytoplankton community CO2 experiments into a data-set of global coverage suggests that, whenever CO2 effects are found, prymnesiophyte (especially coccolithophore) abundances are negatively affected, while the opposite holds true for small picoeukaryotes belonging to the class of prasinophytes, or the division of chlorophytes in general. Future reductions in calcium carbonate-producing coccolithophores, providing ballast which accelerates the sinking of particulate organic matter, together with increases in picoeukaryotes, an important component of the microbial loop in the euphotic zone, have the potential to impact marine export production, with feedbacks to Earth's climate system. © 2017 Schulz, Bach, Bellerby, Bermúdez, Büdenbender, Boxhammer, Czerny, Engel, Ludwig, Meyerhöfer, Larsen, Paul, Sswat and Riebesell.","CO2; Coccolithophores; Community composition; Ocean acidification; Phytoplankton; Picoeukaryotes; Prymnesiophytes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017360689

In a national probability survey experiment of U.S. adults (n = 1212), we find that brief exposure to Pope Francis influenced the climate-related beliefs of broad segments of the public: it increased perceptions of climate change as a moral issue for the overall sample (and among Republicans in particular) and increased felt personal responsibility for contributing to climate change and its mitigation (among Democrats). Moreover, prior awareness of the pope’s views on climate change mattered, such that those who indicated greater awareness of the pope’s position showed stronger treatment effects, consistent with a priming account of these effects.

The new RDE regulation is focused on measuring nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate number (PN) emissions of both light-duty gasoline and diesel vehicles under real world conditions. A supplemental RDE test procedure was developed for European type approval, which includes on-road testing with cars equipped with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). This new regulation will significantly affect the engine calibrations and the exhaust gas aftertreatment. In this study the impact of the new RDE regulation on two recent EU 6b certified turbocharged direct injected gasoline vehicles has been investigated. A comparison of several chassis dyno drive cycles with two new defined on-road RDE cycles was performed. Moreover, different exhaust aftertreatment systems including state of the art three-way catalyst (TWC) and catalyzed gasoline particulate filter (cGPF) technologies were investigated under real world conditions.

Based on vein traits of 55 species of pantropical Ochnaceae, stomata and climatic niche data, and a dated molecular phylogeny, we unveil major structural shifts in vein networks through deep time, relationships between leaf size, vein and stomata traits, and their interplay with climate. Dense 2° veins, reduction of minor veins and the associated breakdown of vein–leaf size scaling evolved multiple times independently in Ochnaceae. In spite of the drastic changes in vein architecture in this venation type, vein and stomatal densities remain correlated. Our study demonstrates that shortening the major vein–stomata distance is economically not less advantageous than by increasing minor vein density, as illustrated by the same degree of coordination between vein and stomatal densities and the similar construction costs across networks with dense 2° veins and those with ‘normally’ spaced 2° veins. © 2016 The Authors.

To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Abu Dhabi; Arthrocnemum macrostachyum; Avicennia marina; blue carbon; carbon pools; carbon stocks; Halodule uninervis; Halophila ovalis; Halophila stipulacea; United Arab Emirates","aboveground biomass; arid region; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; coastal zone; humid environment; mangrove; sabkha; salinity; seagrass; shrub; soil carbon; temperate environment; temperature effect; tropical environment; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates; Arthrocnemum macrostachyum; Avicennia marina; Halodule uninervis; Halophila ovalis; Halophila stipulacea; Rhizophoraceae; Tracheophyta; Alismatales; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; physiology; United Arab Emirates; wetland; Alismatales; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; United Arab Emirates; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017160341

If the green technology is relatively unproductive, higher IPRs promote the dirty technology while pollution is increasing. As households are due to subsistence consumption subject to a hierarchy of needs, the level of IPR enforcement as well as the level of abatement measures depends on the state of technology and is increasing during economic development. Thus, if the incentive to enforce IPRs is low the level of abatement measures is also low.

The provision of public transit, and specifically urban rail transit, is widely seen as a useful tool for reducing urban transportation GHG emissions. There is, however, limited understanding of the net impact of new metro rail infrastructure on urban emissions. This paper examines the net GHG emissions the Sheppard Subway Line in Toronto, Canada. The GHG emissions associated with construction, operation, ridership and changes in residential density associated with the provision of the new metro rail infrastructure are assessed. These components are then combined and compared to calculate the net GHG impact across the study period, which extends from opening in 2002 through 2011. The GHG payback period is calculated. After nine years of operation, the Sheppard Subway Line is found to have nearly paid back its initial GHG investment in the optimistic case. The payback was due to the calculated mode shift from automobiles and changes in residential density and associated energy savings in the station pedestrian catchment areas. The payback period is very sensitive to the potential for induced demand to backfill the mode shifted automobile kilometres. © 2017","Greenhouse gas emissions; Lifecycle impact; Metro rail","Catchments; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Housing; Investments; Light rail transit; Railroads; Subways; Urban transportation; Lifecycle impacts; Rail infrastructure; Residential density; Toronto , Canada; Total emissions; Transportation sector; Urban emissions; Urban rail transit; Greenhouse gases; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; metro system; urban transport; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011961650

Aftermarket manufacturers are sought by customers primarily for their ability to replace an OES (Original Equipment Supplier) for a fraction of the cost. This forces the manufacturers to yield on performance abilities to get a share in the market place. The TWC system in gasoline vehicles not only acts as an emissions reduction device but is an integral part of the overall vehicle performance itself, especially since the introduction of OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) II systems in 1995. An inefficient catalyst not only leads to excessive tailpipe emissions but also acts detrimental to vehicle fueling and hence overall performance. The aftermarket catalyst industry which is regulated by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) and CARB (California Air Resource Board) for gasoline engines is subject to meeting a mandatory performance standard for the same reason. There are several advancements in catalyst technologies to gain performance but this may or may not apply to the aftermarket manufacturers. This paper will discuss three established coating techniques in TWC (Three Way Catalyst) catalyst and their influence on PGM (Precious Group Metal) reduction, emissions performance, and cost reduction and production feasibility. The first method is referred to as slurry coating and possibly the easiest coating method, PGM+WC (Wash Coat) slurry where all precious metals and the supporting washcoat is mixed and applied as one slurry. The second method is referred to as layer coating where the Palladium is in the slurry solution with the washcoat and coated as the first layer on the substrate and then the Rhodium is layered on top as a metal impregnation. The third method is referred to as zone coating where the palladium is in the slurry with the washcoat and it is coated in the inlet of the substrate, while the Rhodium is in the slurry with the washcoat and it is coated in the outlet of the substrate.

In this study, we evaluate the costs of a gradual transition towards a new power system in which the oldest coal plants are replaced with low-carbon power plants. We developed the Wind Energy Integration Cost Advisor Model (WEICAM) to analyze different strategies for this energy transition and determine the most cost-effective roadmap, with and without externalities. The test case is the PJM Interconnection, one of the power systems in the United States with the largest fraction of coal. Different strategies to replace coal plants are evaluated: 1) installing only new, high-efficiency, natural-gas combined-cycle plants (control case), 2) installing new wind farms in combination with natural-gas combined-cycle plants used as spinning reserves (wind case), and 3) same as the wind case but boosting up the production of existing baseload plants that work with a capacity factor between 50% and 60%–80% before installing new wind farms. All three strategies have similar costs (∼54 $/MWh), but the latter is slightly more cost-effective, with a total of 19 GW of coal capacity decommissioned and an increase in the levelized cost of electricity from 49.1 to 53.6 $/MWh (without externalities). In addition, selecting the windiest sites – even far away from the PJM region – is cheaper than selecting local but less windy sites. When externalities due to human health and environmental pollution are accounted for, the two wind-based strategies become the most advantageous, reducing the levelized cost below 104 $/MWh from the initial 110 $/MWh. We conclude that adding new wind farms from the windiest locations, accompanied by a better management of existing plants and a small addition of new natural-gas reserve capacity, is the most economic and the most environmentally responsible pathway to replace retiring coal-fired power plants in PJM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal plants; Decommission; Externalities; Levelized cost of electricity; PJM; Wind energy integration","Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Combined cycle power plants; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum deposits; Pollution; Proven reserves; Small power plants; Wind power; Coal plants; Decommission; Externalities; Levelized cost of electricities; Wind energy integration; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013678100

Here, we describe Mn toxicity symptoms and Mn toxicity responses in soybean plants. Soybean plants exposed to excess Mn showed reductions in the CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance, which in turn resulted in decreased shoot biomass. Furthermore, peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity were higher in plants grown with the highest Mn concentration. The Mn doses increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, POD, and SOD. The toxicity symptoms presented by the leaves included hypertrophying of the adaxial epidermis and the formation of necrotic areas with purple-colored veins. Dramatic movement of calcium from the healthy region to the purple-colored necrotic region was observed, as was the exit of potassium from the necrotic area to the healthy region of the tissue.

This will exacerbate the already high cost incurred by utility companies and communities due to damage to distribution systems by hurricanes. Consequently, long-term investment in critical civil infrastructure systems, such as distribution systems, requires long-term planning that incorporates the potential impact of climate change. This can only be achieved through a comprehensive risk analysis framework for evaluating the impact of climate change and studying the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. This paper presents a framework for incorporating the potential impact of climate change in the reliability analysis of power distribution systems subject to hurricane hazards. The framework incorporates a time-dependent hurricane hazard model, time-dependent fragility model, system reliability evaluation, and a life cycle cost analysis for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies.

However, precise quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from drinking water reservoirs on the regional or national scale is still challenging. We calculated CO2 fluxes for 39 German drinking water reservoirs during a period of 22 years (1991–2013) using routine monitoring data in order to quantify total emission of CO2 from drinking water reservoirs in Germany and to identify major drivers. All reservoirs were a net CO2 source with a median flux of 167 g C m− 2 y− 1, which makes gaseous emissions a relevant process for the carbon budget of each reservoir. Fluxes varied seasonally with median fluxes of 13, 48, and 201 g C m− 2 y− 1 in spring, summer, and autumn respectively. Differences between reservoirs appeared to be primarily caused by the concentration of CO2 in the surface water rather than by the physical gas transfer coefficient. Consideration of short term fluctuations of the gas transfer coefficient due to varying wind speed had only a minor effect on the annual budgets. High CO2 emissions only occurred in reservoirs with pH &lt; 7 and total alkalinity &lt; 0.2 mEq l− 1. Annual CO2 emissions correlated exponentially with pH but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). There was significant correlation between land use in the catchment and CO2 emissions. In total, German drinking water reservoirs emit 44000 t of CO2 annually, which makes them a negligible CO2 source (&lt; 0.005% of national CO2 emissions) in Germany. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide flux; Gas transfer coefficient; Greenhouse gases; pCO2; pH; Wind","Alkalinity; Budget control; Catchments; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Organic carbon; pH; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Surface waters; Water; Wind; Atmospheric CO; Carbon dioxide flux; Dissolved organic carbon; Gas transfer coefficients; pCO2; Routine monitoring; Total alkalinities; Total emissions; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; organic carbon; surface water; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; drinking water; greenhouse gas; pH; reservoir; alkalinity; Article; autumn; carbon footprint; catchment; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental monitoring; gas diffusion; Germany; hydrodynamics; land use; pH; priority journal; spring; summer; velocity; water supply; wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008385980

It is the need of hour to monitor air quality in order to reduce air pollution. Exposure to air pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which is estimated to be the cause for 620,000 early deaths in 2010, and the impact on health due to air pollution in India has been calculated at 3 percent of its GDP. In recent years, air pollution has acquired critical dimensions and the air quality in most cities that monitor outdoor air pollution fail to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels. Air pollution is a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings which need to be controlled. With the advancements in technology, several innovations have been made in the field of communications that are transitioning to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. In this paper, we are proposing the deployment of WSN sensor nodes in public transport buses for the constant monitoring of air pollution. The data regarding the air pollution particles such as emissions, smoke, and other pollutants will be collected via sensors on the public transport bus and the data will be aggregated and transmitted to the nearest sink node. Using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) the collected data will be uploaded on the cloud server also called as the IoT cloud where a large amount of the data is stored. This data can then be accessed at any point to analyze and accurate measures can be taken to map the air pollution. © 2017 ACM.","Air pollution; Internet of Things (IoT); Smart City; Wireless Sensor Networks","Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Bus transportation; Buses; Cloud computing; Pollution control; Pollution detection; Sensor nodes; Smart city; Wireless sensor networks; Air quality monitoring; Cardio-vascular disease; Environmental change; Environmental conditions; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Outdoor air pollution; Public transport bus; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044625938

Using solid-state CPMAS 13C and 15N NMR, it was found that the skeletal framework of PA-XX was a statistical copolymer of polyamide, polyurea, polyimide, and of the primary condensation product of the two reactants, a carbamic-anhydride adduct. Stepwise pyrolytic decomposition of those components yielded carbon aerogels with both open and closed microporosity. The open micropore surface area increased from &lt;15 m2 g-1 in PA-XX to 340 m2 g-1 in the carbons. Next, reactive etching at 1,000 °C with CO2 opened access to the closed pores and the micropore area increased by almost 4× to 1150 m2 g-1 (out of 1750 m2 g-1 of a total BET surface area). At 0 °C, etched carbon aerogels demonstrated a good balance of adsorption capacity for CO2 (up to 4.9 mmol g-1), and selectivity toward other gases (via Henry's law). The selectivity for CO2 versus H2 (up to 928:1) is suitable for precombustion fuel purification. Relevant to postcombustion CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS), the selectivity for CO2 versus N2 was in the 17:1 to 31:1 range. In addition to typical factors involved in gas sorption (kinetic diameters, quadrupole moments and polarizabilities of the adsorbates), it is also suggested that CO2 is preferentially engaged by surface pyridinic and pyridonic N on carbon (identified with XPS) in an energy-neutral surface reaction. Relatively high uptake of CH4 (2.16 mmol g-1 at 0 °C/1 bar) was attributed to its low polarizability, and that finding paves the way for further studies on adsorption of higher (i.e., more polarizable) hydrocarbons. Overall, high CO2 selectivities, in combination with attractive CO2 adsorption capacities, low monomer cost, and the innate physicochemical stability of carbon render the materials of this study reasonable candidates for further practical consideration. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","aerogels; carbon aerogels; carboxylic acid; CO2 sequestration; copolymer; polyamide; polyimide; polyurea; pryomellitic acid","Adsorption; Aerogels; Carboxylic acids; Copolymers; Fuel purification; Microporosity; Polyamides; Polyimides; Surface reactions; Adsorption capacities; Carbon aerogels; Condensation product; Physico-chemical stability; Polyureas; Pyrolytic decomposition; Quadrupole moments; Statistical copolymers; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018487277

Consequently, energy retrofitting of existing buildings has become a common climate action initiative around the world. Building owners are keen to assess the technical and financial feasibility of energy retrofitting in pre-project planning stages. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) involves assessment of the economic cost of an asset or a service. LCCA, which is a data-intensive process, is heavily affected by data uncertainties; however, traditional deterministic LCCA models are oblivious to data uncertainty and this can have a significant effect on the final decision. As a solution, this paper proposes a novel LCCA approach for building energy retrofits. The proposed approach calculates life cycle cost (LCC) by adopting fuzzy set theory. In order to illustrate the proposed methodology, a case study was conducted for a public building operated in the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. Two energy retrofit alternatives − a major retrofit and a deep retrofit − were compared using the proposed fuzzy set theory-based approach and the traditional deterministic LCCA approach. Even though the deterministic result had a strong membership to the fuzzy membership function of the LCC, the range of possible LCC is wide. Use of the fuzzy-based approach would enable the forecasting of possible future LCC as a result of changes in macro-economic factors. This information would allow building managers to plan for adverse future scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Built environment; Energy retrofits; Fuzzy set theory; Life cycle cost analysis","Buildings; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Fuzzy sets; Life cycle; Membership functions; Retrofitting; Set theory; British Columbia , Canada; Built environment; Economic evaluations; Energy retrofit; Energy-performance standards; Fuzzy membership function; Life cycle cost analysis; Life cycle costs (LCC); Fuzzy set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009989732

Previous research suggested that the age of occupants may significantly affect the dwelling time and use of air conditioners, thus should be considered during low carbon oriented residential community planning. In this study, an energy related occupant behavior survey recently conducted in Qingdao city is presented. Through this survey, the thermal preference, dwelling time, and air conditioners usage behavior of three different family structures (young couple family, old couple family, and couple with parents family) are analyzed. These information, together with urban planning parameters (floor area ratio, building coverage ratio, aspect ratio, etc.) are then fed into energy simulation models, to investigate the role of occupant behavior in low carbon oriented residential community planning. The results show that the energy demand of old couple family is more affected by community planning. Aspect ratio is more important than height in terms of space cooling and heating demand. The optimal aspect ratio strongly depends on the type of occupants and HVAC system. In general, aged occupants need more heating energy, thus are better located in buildings with lower aspect ratio. Communities with district heating system and decentralized cooling system need lower aspect ratio than that with other types of HVAC systems. The results have important implications to low carbon oriented residential community planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Low carbon; Occupant behavior; Residential community; Urban planning","Air conditioning; Buildings; Climate control; Cooling systems; District heating; Domestic appliances; Housing; Surveys; Urban planning; Building coverage ratios; Decentralized cooling; District heating system; Low carbon; Occupant behavior; Planning parameters; Residential communities; Thermal preferences; Aspect ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009945367

The results showed high influence of gasoline vehicles on CO emission. In the annual scale, CO concentration decreased due to improvements in emission technology, despite the increasing number of vehicles. CO emission showed a seasonal, weekly and diurnal cycle associated to meteorological conditions and emission patterns.

The objective of this study is to compare several approaches for deriving FPI from satellite data to assess whether better relationships with forage productivity can be attained. The approaches assess pasture productivity using as five input factors estimated from remote sensing and ancillary data, i.e.: (1) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR); (2) radiation use efficiency estimates; (3) PAR estimates; (4) leaf senescence modelling; and (5) growing season modelling. All the possible combinations from these five factors, including different modalities to estimate some of them, lead to 768 models. Model outputs are compared to reference grassland production estimates provided by a mechanistic model (Information et Suivi Objectif des Prairies–ISOP–system) for a sample of 25 forage regions across France for the years 2003, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2012 (containing one humid, two normal, and two dry years). Results revealed that: (1) the baseline model based on the fraction of green vegetation cover (fCover) seasonal integral has a reasonable linear relationship to production estimates (standardized root mean square error–SRMSE = 0.57 and coefficient of determination–R2 = 0.68); (2) performance of the baseline model improved with a quadratic function (SRMSE = 0.54 and R2 = 0.71); (3) 34 models outperform the baseline model. We, therefore, suggest to replace the baseline model with the best-performing model (SRMSE = 0.42 and R2 = 0.83) in the insurance product.

In addition, the spatial and temporal progression of ion intercalation has been made visible. Data gained from these experiments can be used to determine reaction kinetics and improve electrochemical battery models. This can directly benefit battery research as a novel method for materials characterization in the laboratory. As a next step, we propose a complementary sensor system for commercial battery cells, where an optical fiber is placed between cell electrodes as an evanescent field sensor.

The utilization of EVs and EHPs could be a way to boost MCHP profitability and micro-cogeneration systems can also help in reducing the potential negative effects of EVs and EHPs on electric distribution networks.

This study was conducted in such seasonally ice-covered lake (Lake Limnopolar, Byers Peninsula, Livingston Is., Antarctica), which exhibits a microbial dominated pelagic food web. An important feature is also the occurrence of benthic mosses (Drepanocladus longifolius) covering the lake bottom. Plankton dynamics were investigated during the ice-thawing transition to the summer maximum. Both bacterioplankton and viral-like particles were higher near the lake's bottom, suggesting a benthic support. When the lake was under dim conditions because of the snow-and-ice cover, autotrophic picoplankters dominated at deep layers. The taxa-specific photopigments indicated dominance of picocyanobacteria among them when the light availability was lower. By contrast, larger and less edible phytoplankton dominated at the onset of the ice melting. The plankton size spectra were fitted to the continuous model of Pareto distribution. Spectra evolved similarly at two sampled depths, in surface and near the bottom, with slopes increasing until mid-January. However, slopes were less steep (i.e., size classes more uniformly distributed) at the bottom, thus denoting a more efficient utilization of resources. These findings suggest that microbial loop pathways in the lake are efficiently channelized during some periods to the metazoan production (mainly the copepod Boeckella poppei). Our results point to that trophic interactions may still occur in these lakes despite environmental harshness.

We undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to illuminate this relationship and found a limited scientific basis for policymaking. Our results indicate that knowledge on the sustainable development impacts of bioenergy production is concentrated in a few well-studied countries, focuses on environmental and economic impacts, and mostly relates to dedicated agricultural biomass plantations. The scope and methodological approaches in studies differ widely and only a small share of the studies sufficiently reports on context and/or baseline conditions, which makes it difficult to get a general understanding of the attribution of impacts. Nevertheless, we identified regional patterns of positive or negative impacts for all categories – environmental, economic, institutional, social and technological. In general, economic and technological impacts were more frequently reported as positive, while social and environmental impacts were more frequently reported as negative (with the exception of impacts on direct substitution of GHG emission from fossil fuel). More focused and transparent research is needed to validate these patterns and develop a strong science underpinning for establishing policies and governance agreements that prevent/mitigate negative and promote positive impacts from bioenergy production. © 2016 The Authors.

An altered climate creates both challenges and opportunities for improving the management of protected areas in networks. Increasingly, quantitative tools like species distribution modeling are used to assess the performance of protected areas and predict potential responses to changing climates for groups of species, within a predictive framework. At larger geographic domains and scales, protected area network units have spatial geoclimatic properties that can be described in the gap analysis typically used to measure or aggregate the geographic distributions of species (stacked species distribution models, or S-SDM). We extend the use of species distribution modeling techniques in order to model the climate envelope (or ""footprint"") of individual protected areas within a network of protected areas distributed across the 48 conterminous United States and managed by the US National Park System. In our approach we treat each protected area as the geographic range of a hypothetical endemic species, then use MaxEnt and 5 uncorrelated BioClim variables to model the geographic distribution of the climatic envelope associated with each protected area unit (modeling the geographic area of park units as the range of a species). We describe the individual and aggregated climate envelopes predicted by a large network of 163 protected areas and briefly illustrate how macroecological measures of geodiversity can be derived from our analysis of the landscape ecological context of protected areas. To estimate trajectories of change in the temporal distribution of climatic features within a protected area network, we projected the climate envelopes of protected areas in current conditions onto a dataset of predicted future climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the climate envelopes of some parks may be locally unique or have narrow geographic distributions, and are thus prone to future shifts away from the climatic conditions in these parks in current climates. In other cases, some parks are broadly similar to large geographic regions surrounding the park or have climatic envelopes that may persist into near-term climate change. Larger parks predict larger climatic envelopes, in current conditions, but on average the predicted area of climate envelopes are smaller in our single future conditions scenario. Individual units in a protected area network may vary in the potential for climate adaptation, and adaptive management strategies for the network should account for the landscape contexts of the geodiversity or climate diversity within individual units. Conservation strategies, including maintaining connectivity, assessing the feasibility of assisted migration and other landscape restoration or enhancements can be optimized using analysis methods to assess the spatial properties of protected area networks in biogeographic and macroecological contexts. © 2017 Robinson, Fordyce.

The aim of this work is to report on issues that have arisen from the use of the latest generation models DustTrak DRX (8533 and 8534) in the BREATHE, UPTECH and IMPROVE projects that can compromise data quality. The main issue we encountered was the occurrence of sudden artefact jumps in PM concentration, which can involve an increase from a few to some hundreds of μg·m− 3. These artefact jumps can sometimes be easily recognised (“obvious jump”), while others can be difficult to identify because the difference in the concentrations before and after the jump might be just few μg·m− 3 (“possible jump”) or because the jump is sustained over the whole monitoring period and only detectable if PM concentrations are simultaneously measured by other instruments (“hidden jump”). Moreover, in areas of relatively low PM levels, the unit reported concentration of 0 μg·m− 3 for ambient PM concentration or even negative concentration values which may seriously compromise the dataset. These data suggest issues with the detection of low PM concentrations, which could be due to an incorrect instrument offset or the factory calibration setting being inadequate for these PM concentrations. The upward and downward artefact jumps were not related to especially dusty or clean conditions, since they have been observed in many kinds of environments: indoor and outdoor school environments, subway stations and in ambient urban background air. Therefore, PM concentration data obtained with the TSI DustTrak DRX models should be handled with care and meticulously revised before being considered valid. To prevent these issues the use of auto zero module is recommended, so the DustTrak monitor is automatic re-zeroed without requiring the presence of any user. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mass concentration; Performance; PMx; Portable instrument; TSI DustTrak","Aerosols; Subway stations; Concentration values; DustTrak; Mass concentration; Monitoring periods; Particulate Matter; Performance; Portable instrument; Real-time instrument; Particulate emissions; aerosol; concentration (composition); particulate matter; performance assessment; ambient air; Article; artifact; calibration; gas analysis equipment; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; portable equipment; railway; school; Spain; urban area; aerosol; article; data quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028259592

In fact, the consequences of the combustion in poor mode are the appearance of local or global flame extinctions, energy loss by radiation and change in flame structure. The flammability limits of the diffusion methane flame can be resolved by the enrichment of the combustion air with oxygen or the use of the pure oxygen as oxidant as well as the addition to hydrogen in natural gas. Moreover, the use of oxygen and hydrogen as previously mentioned allow working in low ranges of richness while maintaining good flame stability. For a constant burner power of 15 kW, the reduction of the richness involves an increase in the oxidizer flow rate injected into the combustion reaction. In this present study, the variation of the richness, the fuel enrichment with hydrogen and the oxidant enrichment with oxygen are shown as major parameters where they have direct influences on the flow dynamic, the flame structure and the pollutant emissions. The Chemiluminescence of OH* radical and the PIV (Particle image velocimetry) are used in this work to characterize the flame structure, the stability and the dynamics of the flame. The measurement of pollutant emissions effected by a gas analyzer. The enrichment in oxygen and hydrogen provides a stable flame, which is well attached to the burner for the following richness values: 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.

However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-The-Art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fire; Forest models; Forest productivity-disturbances-climate change interactions; Insects; Storms; Trade-offs","Climate models; Economic and social effects; Fires; Forestry; Productivity; Storms; Climate change impact; Forest disturbances; Forest models; Forest productivity; Insects; Productivity changes; Resource competitions; Trade off; Climate change; climate change; disturbance; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; forest fire; forestry; insect; plant; storm; trade-off; Europe; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021024065

However, biodiversity could be disadvantaged if not properly accounted for, particularly under climate change, where high carbon gains do not coincide spatially with biodiversity priorities. While globally there is congruence for species richness and carbon stocks, adequate conservation needs to incorporate more refined measures of biodiversity – and consideration of the impact of future climate change. We investigated the spatial trade-off for carbon and biodiversity priorities in north-eastern Australia based on current and projected climate, using the Zonation prioritisation software. By iteratively weighting carbon against biodiversity we found that prioritising land based on biodiversity value (for 697 vertebrates) included priority areas for potential carbon sequestration (Maximum Potential Biomass). However, if prioritisation was based on carbon sequestration potential alone, substantial areas important for biodiversity would be lost. Policy frameworks need to be strengthened to remove barriers from landholder participation in carbon storage projects that have biodiversity benefits, and to require that both carbon and biodiversity gains are additional. Properly accounting for biodiversity in land-based carbon sequestration and storage prioritisation in this region is likely to generate substantial benefits for both biodiversity and carbon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity prioritisation; Carbon; Cobenefits; Systematic conservation planning; Trade-offs; Zonation","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation planning; conservation status; endemic species; local participation; policy analysis; prioritization; restoration ecology; risk assessment; software; species richness; strategic approach; zonation; Australia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009836999

Most studies of traffic emissions have applied spatial models to achieve more accurate exposure assessments. Spatial analysis is a technique that takes into account various geographic phenomena, providing data that can be communicated to potentially affected people and government agencies considering policies to reduce exposure and adverse health effects. In Brazil, only a few studies have evaluated air pollution and no studies have conducted a spatial analysis of traffic emissions across the entire country. Brazil is a large continental region with 200 million inhabitants, where traffic emissions present a critical health challenge. In this study, we used three geostatistical approaches (Getis-Ord Gi*, K means, and spatial regression) to assess the spatial patterns of traffic emissions for all 5570 municipal districts in Brazil. We identified five groups of municipal districts (spatial clusters) with distinct patterns of traffic emissions based on six variables: population, gross domestic product, urbanization rate, length of highways, human development index, and distance from the state capital. One group represents municipal districts in the Northeast and Northwest regions, which have lower income, traffic, and emissions. In contrast, the others groups represent regions with high income, traffic, and emissions. Finally, we found a significant association between emissions inventories and the six variables used to evaluate spatial clusters. Our results can help inform the design of targeted, cost effective air pollution control strategies to reduce the adverse health effects of traffic emissions in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Spatial analysis; Spatial patterns; Traffic emissions","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Health; Health risks; Pollution; Pollution control; Adverse health effects; Environmental threats; Geostatistical approach; Gross domestic products; Human development index; Spatial analysis; Spatial patterns; Traffic emissions; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014869952

Processes and elements of the hydrological cycle have changed dramatically in China due to both upper boundary (climate change) and lower boundary (landuse/ cover change, population growth, increasing water supply, socioeconomic development activities). These factors increase hydrological uncertainty. In semi-arid regions, hydrological processes are complex, and the effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes are significantly more sensitive. Research on hydrological process in semi-arid regions can help understand and solve local water crises and water disaster problems. This chapter focuses on the response mechanism and modeling methodology of hydrological processes in semi-arid regions in changing environments. Four aspects are addressed. Firstly, basin-scaled evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated by using MODIS images and validated by a hydrological model. Secondly, runoff parameterization schemes with spatial heterogeneity were compared across different temporal scales. Thirdly, the authors calculated re-direction of blue water into green water owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Finally, we quantified the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff using three different methods. Four conclusions can be drawn from the research: 1) ET values estimated from MODIS images based on the surface energy balance scheme and the modified Priestley-Taylor equation are applicable and operational for mapping daily actual ET over the study area; 2) in semi-arid regions the hybrid mechanism of runoff generation is better than the single mechanism of runoff generation over a short-term timescale; 3) LULC changes lead to redirection from blue flow to green water; 4) climate change and human activities have made a great reduction in runoff production over the Laohahe catchment, where human activities are the main factors. These conclusions will hopefully be a reference for the awareness of hydrological changes in semi-arid regions in China. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of PES schemes that incorporates multi-level governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers’ preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around 2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of CO2 equivalent from 11.18 to 15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively.

In spark ignition engines one strategy which can be used to reach this goal is the full utilization of fuel octane number. Octane number is the fueĺs knock resistance and is characterized as research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON). Engine knock is caused by the undesired self-ignition of the fuel air mixture ahead of the flame front initiated by the spark. It leads to pressure fluctuations that can severely damage the engine. Modern vehicles utilize different strategies to avoid knock. One extreme strategy assumes a weak fuel quality and, to protect the engine, retards the spark timing at the expense of combustion efficiency. The other extreme carefully detects knock in every engine cycle and retards the spark timing only when knock is detected. Therefore as fuel octane number improves, the spark is advanced to the knock boundary of that fuel; a process known as knock limited spark advance or KLSA. By employing this strategy the engine is always able to operate at the highest efficiency the fuel permits. Over the last 20 years Shell has been active in measuring the octane appetite of modern gasoline engines and has published extensively in this area. The latest fleet test program evaluated the octane response of 20 modern gasoline vehicles equipped with a wide variety of engine technologies. Using a selection of vehicles targeting the most popular models and brands across Europe in 2013, vehicle performance and ignition timing were measured in response to fuels with different octane qualities at wide open throttle acceleration and different steady state conditions. The majority of the 20 vehicles showed performance benefits when running on higher RON fuels. The highest statistically significant (95% confidence) full speed gated acceleration time benefit was 1.9%, whilst the highest power benefit was 3.9% at 2500 rpm for a RON98 versus RON95 comparison. Comparing the different steady state conditions, greatest benefits were generally found at 2500 rpm; an engine speed that is highly representative of real-world driving.

There were no differences in baseline clinical or treatment characteristics or any of the survival outcomes examined between the 2 groups. These results suggest that routine PET/CT imaging after definitive radiation treatment for locally-advanced NSCLC confers no benefit in early detection of recurrence. Background There are few data to support the use of varying imaging modalities in evaluating recurrence in non&#x2013;small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We compared the efficacy of surveillance positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) versus CT scans of the chest in detecting recurrences after definitive radiation for NSCLC. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed 200 patients treated between 2000 and 2011 who met the inclusion criteria of stage III NSCLC, completion of definitive radiation treatment, and absence of recurrence within the initial 6 months. These patients were then grouped on the basis of the use of PET/CT imaging during postradiation surveillance. Patients who received &#x2265; 1 PET/CT scans within 6 months of the end of radiation treatment were placed in the PET group whereas all others were placed in the CT group. We compared survival times from the end of treatment to the date of death or last follow-up using log rank tests. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with decreased survival. Results In the entire cohort, median event-free survival (EFS) was 26.7 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 41.2 months. The CT group had a median EFS of 21.4 months versus 29.4 months for the PET group (P = .59). There was no difference in OS between the CT and PET groups (median OS of 41.2 and 41.3 months, respectively; P = .59). There was also no difference in local recurrence-free survival or distant metastases-free survival between the CT-only and PET/CT groups (P = .92 and P = .30, respectively). Similarly, in multivariate analysis, stratification into the PET group was not associated with improved EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.34; P = .60) or OS (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.83-1.7; P = .34). Conclusions In stage III NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiation and without early recurrence, PET/CT scan surveillance did not result in decreased time to detection of locoregional or distant recurrence or improved survival. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","CT; Lung cancer; PET/CT; Radiation; Recurrence; Surveillance","antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; bone metastasis; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; distant metastasis; distant metastasis free survival; event free survival; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; induction chemotherapy; local recurrence free survival; log rank test; lung adenocarcinoma; lung scintiscanning; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; retrospective study; risk factor; salvage therapy; squamous cell lung carcinoma; survival time; thorax; treatment duration; adenocarcinoma; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; pathology; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; prognosis; radiotherapy dosage; survival rate; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prognosis; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007410684

Global anthropogenic emissions are around 20% higher than natural emissions and the amount of mercury released into the atmosphere has increased since the industrial revolution. In 2005 the European Union and the United States adopted measures to reduce mercury use, in part to offset the impacts of increasing emissions in industrialising countries. The changing regional emissions of mercury have impacts on a range of spatial scales. Here we report 4 years (December 2011-December 2015) of total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements at the Cape Verde Observatory (CVO), a global WMO-GAW station located in the subtropical remote marine boundary layer. Observed total gaseous mercury concentrations were between 1.03 and 1.33 ngm-3 (10th, 90th percentiles), close to expectations based on previous interhemispheric gradient measurements. We observe a decreasing trend in TGM (-0.05±0.04 ngm-3 yr-1, -4.2%±3.3%yr-1) over the 4 years consistent with the reported decrease of mercury concentrations in North Atlantic surface waters and reductions in anthropogenic emissions. The decrease was more visible in the summer (July-September) than in the winter (December-February), when measurements were impacted by air from the African continent and Sahara/Sahel regions. African air masses were also associated with the highest and most variable TGM concentrations. We suggest that the less pronounced downward trend inclination in African air may be attributed to poorly controlled anthropogenic sources such as artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in West Africa. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air mass; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; carbon emission; concentration (composition); measurement method; mercury (element); Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018872962

One option for reducing emissions into the atmosphere is to capture and sequester the released carbon dioxide in geological formations. However, potential geological storage first requires a risk assessment of carbon dioxide escaping to overlying layers and back to the atmosphere through leakage pathways in the formation. This, in turn, requires an understanding of fluid flow through the leakage pathways. In this study, the effect of leakage pathways on the flow of a gravity current was investigated, using an analogue system, a Hele-Shaw cell. Fluid was introduced through the top edge of the cell and flowed out through one or more holes in its impermeable base. The height of the accumulated fluid above the base of the cell at various points along its length and the outflow rate of fluid through the holes was measured. This measurement was conducted with varying conditions of the location, number and strength of source as well as the location and number of holes. At steady state, the fluid motion was in accordance with Darcy's law for horizontal flow in a long thin current. In another set of experiments, in which inflow was stopped and the fluid was allowed to drain out of a single open hole, the outflow rate was in accordance with Darcy's law for one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction until the fluid height above the hole fell below a certain limit. This threshold height was found to be 1.3 cm, which was similar in magnitude to the length of the hole. A time series of photographs tracked the flow of colored dye. The photographs demonstrated that at steady state the fluid traveled for some distance beyond the hole before draining through it. This implies that contaminants may be transported in a formation even beyond an outlet before finally draining out through it. The photographs also documented the shape of the interface between the newly introduced dye and the ambient fluid in the cell. These shapes were found to be different in a cell placed horizontally versus one placed on an incline, suggesting that the geometry and flow conditions in a formation affecting the transport of an injected fluid. These findings may be used as a basis for predicting behavior of a fluid injected into a fractured formation in the subsurface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Darcy's law; Discrete sinks in subsurface leakage; Hele-Shaw cell","Carbon dioxide; Cells; Cytology; Earth (planet); Fluid dynamics; Geology; Groundwater flow; Impurities; Photography; Porous materials; Risk assessment; Seepage; Transport properties; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon sequestration; Darcy's law; Fractured formations; Geological formation; Hele-Shaw cells; Onedimensional flow; Subsurface formations; Flow of fluids; anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; Darcy law; emission control; experimental design; hydrological modeling; leakage; one-dimensional modeling; photograph; porous medium; risk assessment; subsurface flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013343990

In this regard, the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended periodic leak detection and repair surveys at oil and gas facilities using optical gas imaging technology. This regulation requires an operator to fix all detected leaks within a set time period. Whether such 'find-all-fix-all' policies are effective depends on significant uncertainties in the character of emissions. In this work, we systematically analyze the effect of facility-related and mitigation-related uncertainties on regulation effectiveness. Drawing from multiple publicly-available datasets, we find that: (1) highly-skewed leak-size distributions strongly influence emissions reduction potential; (2) variations in emissions estimates across facilities leads to large variability in mitigation effectiveness; (3) emissions reductions from optical gas imaging-based leak detection programs can range from 15% to over 70%; and (4) while implementation costs are uniformly lower than EPA estimates, benefits from saved gas are highly variable. Combining empirical evidence with model results, we propose four policy options for effective methane mitigation: performance-oriented targets for accelerated emission reductions, flexible policy mechanisms to account for regional variation, technology-agnostic regulations to encourage adoption of the most cost-effective measures, and coordination with other greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce unintended spillover effects. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","energy policy; EPA; GHG emissions; methane; Paris Agreement","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Gas industry; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Imaging techniques; Leak detection; Methane; Uncertainty analysis; Cost-effective measures; Emissions reduction; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Implementation cost; Leak detection and repair; Optical gas imaging; Performance-oriented; Gas emissions; data set; emission control; energy policy; environmental legislation; environmental policy; environmental protection; gas industry; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; international agreement; leakage; methane; mitigation; natural gas; spillover effect; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018461181

Therefore, the need for strategies that allow managing combustion towards lower emissions, that require a precise control of the combustion outputs, is definitely increasing. Acoustic emission of internal combustion engines contains a large amount of information related to engine behavior and working conditions. Mechanical noise and combustion noise are usually the main contributions to the noise produced by an engine. In particular, recent research from the same authors of this paper demonstrated that combustion noise can be used as an indicator of the combustion that is taking place inside the combustion chamber and therefore as a reference for the control strategy. Previous works showed the correlations existing between in cylinder combustion and the acoustic emission radiated by the engine, and presented a possible approach to use this signal in the engine management system for control purposes. In this work, additional experiments were carried out, in order to further investigate how to design the optimal injection pattern. The application was tested by running several experimental tests, in steady state conditions, on a Diesel engine mounted in a test cell. Tests have been run in order to identify the correlation existing between the different injection/combustion patterns that can be operated on the engine and the corresponding acoustic emission, to be used in the closed- loop combustion control based on engine noise feedback. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Acoustic emissions; Diesel engines; Real time control; Combustion chambers; Engine cylinders; Engines; Internal combustion engines; Additional experiments; Combustion control; Control strategies; Emission regulation; Engine management systems; In-cylinder combustion; Injection patterns; Steady-state condition; Acoustic noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040522530

It plays a large role not only on the households' food security but also on their source of income. As the leading producer of strawberry with an annual production of 1300-1500 t in the Analamanga Region, the Commune of Tsiafahy within the District of Atsimondrano is the study area. This research aims to analyse the socio-economic structure of the strawberry and the dynamism of the farmers. The methods adopted have followed three independent steps: the system approach which studies the farming system of the small scale farmers, the finance analysis enabling to highlight the economic importance of the strawberry compared mainly to rice production, and the diagnosis of the strawberry value chain. The results show the existence of three types of producers: landowner vegetable producers, organic strawberry producers, and the producers associating the production of vegetable, horticulture and food crop. The strawberry remains the important production (88% of the surveyed population), followed by rice and maize (66%). Strawberry production is entirely for selling, income main source. The organic producer's yields are important (13 t ha-1) compared to the first and to the third type. They are respectively 9.5 and 11 t ha-1. The added value of strawberry is around ten times more important from than rice. Its economic contribution for the smallholder farmers remains significantly low; the main reasons are the still rudimentary farming technique and the difficulty in access to inputs, worsened by the adverse impacts of climate changes. Smallholder farmers' strategies facing the hazards of strawberry production and its economic role compared to the potential speculations in the area have been assessed. The bottlenecks of the value chain have been highlighted and some appropriate recommendations suggested.","Diagnosis of strawberry value chain; Finance analysis; Systemic approach",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019894061

The MaxEnt modelling delineated the potential distribution of F. cirrhosa and L. nepalense. The current suitability is projected towards Central and Eastern Hilly/Mountainous regions. Both species gain maximum suitability in RCP 4.5 which decline towards other trajectories for L. nepalense. Overall, both the focal species shift towards the north-west, losing their potential habitat in hilly and lower mountainous regions by 2050 across all trajectories. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on two threatened and valuable species. The results can be further useful to initiate farming of these medicinally and economically important species based on climatically suitable zone and for designing a germplasm conservation strategy. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Commercial exploitation; Conservation; Fritillaria cirrhosa; Lilium nepalense; Lily; MaxEnt modelling; Species distribution","climate change; conservation management; conservation status; ecological modeling; endangered species; herb; herbarium; hill; medicinal plant; mountain region; population distribution; software; species conservation; traditional medicine; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014462997

Yet trade-offs and synergies that exist between supporting livelihoods, protecting plant diversity and maintaining forest ecosystem services are poorly documented. We used forest inventory data and community-group records to assess trade-offs and synergies between carbon, plant diversity and forest products in 19 community forests managed under REDD+ in Nepal. Trade-offs were prevalent for carbon, whereby community forests with relatively high carbon values had relatively low values for plant diversity or forest products provision, and vice versa. Synergies occurred between plant diversity and forest products provision (fuelwood and fodder), suggesting that forests with relatively high plant diversity values were also important for providing critical forest products to local communities. This study shows that conserving forests for carbon should not impinge greatly on the flow of forest resources to at least some local communities; however, promoting carbon storage will not necessarily protect plant diversity.

How integration should be achieved is nevertheless a matter of international law development. At the regional level, a tendency seems to progressively emerge to ground integration in the fundamental right to a sustainable environment. Against such a background, it is argued in this article that a third generation environmental claim simplifies the complex establishment of a causal nexus between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and first and second generation fundamental rights. This would allow international human rights protection mechanisms to be triggered based on (minimum) reduction targets under the UNFCCC regime. The international recognition of a human right to a sustainable environment therefore emerges as fundamental to determining human rights responsibility for climate change, with particular regard to States. It thus facilitates systemically integrating fundamental rights into climate change regulation and taking consequential institutional action. This argument adds strings to the bow of those scholars who support the idea of intergenerational environmental justice on legal and moral grounds. © The Author(s) 2017.","(tripartite) human rights; Basic right to a sustainable environment; Causation; Climate change regulation; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement; Systemic integration; UN and regional human rights protection systems; UNFCCC regime",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033803383

Emissions from motor vehicles have been found to be one main sources of air pollution. Although the Chinese government has undertaken numerous green policies to mitigate harmful emissions from road transport sector, it is still uncertain for both policy makers and researchers to know whether the policies are effective in the short and long terms. We propose a new concept of ""pollution rebound effect"" (PRE) to estimate the effectiveness of green traffic policies. We estimate direct air PRE as a measure of the effectiveness of the policies of reducing air pollution from the transport sector based on time-series data from the period 1986-2014. We find that the short-term direct air PRE is -0.4105, and the corresponding long-run PRE is -0.246. The negative results indicate that the direct air PRE does not exist in the road passenger transport sector in China, both in the short term and in the long term during the period 1986-2014. This implies that the Chinese green transport policies are effective in terms of harmful emissions reduction in the transport sector. This research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to quantify the effectiveness of the green transport policies in the transitional period that China is currently undergoing. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; Direct rebound effect; Policy effectiveness; Road passenger transport","atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental policy; pollution control; reduction; road transport; state role; traffic emission; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015847725

This is an intrinsic obstacle to creating a more equitable, democratic and effective global climate or environmental governance system. Criticism of international carbon politics and its “ecological imperialism,” based on traditional “green-left” theories from Marxist philosophy and political economy, provides a theoretical basis for seeking an alternative way to cope with global climate change effectively. As a responsible developing country, China’s response to climate change is not only an internal requirement for the promotion of its own sustainable development, but also reflects its responsibility to create a community of shared future for mankind. This rationale for our time determines that it is necessary for China to become a world leader in coping with global climate change and environmental governance through a leadership which lies in making a contribution rather than fighting for hegemony. © 2017 Social Sciences in China Press.","carbon politics; ecological imperialism; green-left theories; Paris Agreement; socialist ecological civilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017543774

This work builds a framework to estimate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from China's shale gas system and compares them with GHG emissions from coal used in the power, residential, and industrial sectors. We find the mean lifecycle carbon footprint of shale gas is about 30-50% lower than that of coal in all sectors under both 20 year and 100 year global warming potentials (GWP20 and GWP100). However, primarily due to large uncertainties in methane leakage, the upper bound estimate of the lifecycle carbon footprint of shale gas in China could be approximately 15-60% higher than that of coal across sectors under GWP20. To ensure net GHG emission reductions when switching from coal to shale gas, we estimate the breakeven methane leakage rates to be approximately 6.0%, 7.7%, and 4.2% in the power, residential, and industrial sectors, respectively, under GWP20. We find shale gas in China has a good chance of delivering air quality and climate cobenefits, particularly when used in the residential sector, with proper methane leakage control. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Coal; Emission control; Energy security; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Methane; Shale gas; Uncertainty analysis; Air pollutants; Carbon reduction; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Industrial sector; Methane leakage; Residential sectors; Upper Bound; Shale; carbon; coal; fossil fuel; methane; natural gas; air pollutant; carbon; natural gas; air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; coal; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; shale gas; uncertainty analysis; air pollutant; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; combustion; comparative study; cooking; energy consumption; fracking; gas; gas field; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; practice guideline; shale gas; surface mining; United States; China; United States; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; China; Coal; Greenhouse Effect; Natural Gas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019121916

To improve its computational efficiency, we have developed a GPU-oriented fast MC package named goCMC, for carbon therapy. goCMC simulates particle transport in voxelized geometry with kinetic energy up to 450 MeV u-1. Class II condensed history simulation scheme with a continuous slowing down approximation was employed. Energy straggling and multiple scattering were modeled. δ-electrons were terminated with their energy locally deposited. Four types of nuclear interactions were implemented in goCMC, i.e. carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen and carbon-calcium inelastic collisions. Total cross section data from Geant4 were used. Secondary particles produced in these interactions were sampled according to particle yield with energy and directional distribution data derived from Geant4 simulation results. Secondary charged particles were transported following the condensed history scheme, whereas secondary neutral particles were ignored. goCMC was developed under OpenCL framework and is executable on different platforms, e.g. GPU and multi-core CPU. We have validated goCMC with Geant4 in cases with different beam energy and phantoms including four homogeneous phantoms, one heterogeneous half-slab phantom, and one patient case. For each case carbon ions were simulated, such that in the region with dose greater than 10% of maximum dose, the mean relative statistical uncertainty was less than 1%. Good agreements for dose distributions and range estimations between goCMC and Geant4 were observed. 3D gamma passing rates with 1%/1 mm criterion were over 90% within 10% isodose line except in two extreme cases, and those with 2%/1 mm criterion were all over 96%. Efficiency and code portability were tested with different GPUs and CPUs. Depending on the beam energy and voxel size, the computation time to simulate carbons was 9.9-125 s, 2.5-50 s and 60-612 s on an AMD Radeon GPU card, an NVidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU card and an Intel Xeon E5-2640 CPU, respectively. The combined accuracy, efficiency and portability make goCMC attractive for research and clinical applications in carbon ion therapy. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","carbon ion therapy; GPU; Monte Carlo","Bioinformatics; Charged particles; Computational efficiency; Exchange interactions; Graphics processing unit; Ion engines; Ions; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Program processors; Carbon ion therapy; Clinical application; Directional distributions; Fundamental physics; Inelastic collision; Secondary neutral particles; Secondary particles; Statistical uncertainty; Monte Carlo methods; carbon; electron; human; imaging phantom; ion therapy; Monte Carlo method; procedures; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; Carbon Radioisotopes; Electrons; Heavy Ion Radiotherapy; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017415568

To date, the major determinant climatic factors of the disease in the region have remained largely unknown, making it difficult to effectively target countermeasures for avian cholera surveillance and control. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between climatic variables and cases of avian cholera in subtropical areas of China. Data relating to local meteorological variables and notified cases of avian cholera were supplied by the relevant authorities between January 2006 and December 2015. Spearman correlation, co-linearity statistics and cross-correlation analysis were applied to the data, controlling for co-linearity and lag effects. A time-series Poisson regression analysis was conducted to examine the degree of correlation between the climate variables and avian cholera transmission. The results indicated that monthly mean temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and the multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index, with 2-3 months lag, were correlated with avian cholera incidence. The final model had good predictive ability for the occurrence of avian cholera. Overall, the findings indicate that climate variability plays an important role in avian cholera transmission in Guangxi province. Adoption of the model presented in this study could usefully inform avian cholera surveillance strategies, making them significantly simpler and more effective. The model could also serve as a decision support tool for veterinary professionals and health authorities. © 2017, Fundacao APINCO de Ciencia e Tecnologia Avicolas.

For example, powertrain-related technologies improve fuel efficiency by optimizing the powertrain operations in response to different driving conditions (e.g., energy management system for plugin hybrid electric vehicles); another technology dimension lies in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which improve vehicle fuel efficiency by optimizing the vehicle dynamics or speed under different traffic conditions (e.g., eco-speed harmonization and eco-approach and departure). However, very little effort has been made to investigate the combined benefit of integrating both powertrain and ITS technology dimensions together. In this paper, an integrated and connected eco-driving assistance system with co-optimization of vehicle dynamics and powertrain operations for PHEVs is proposed.

Many stream classifications are based on an inductive approach using hydrologic data from minimally disturbed basins, but this approach may underrepresent streams from heavily disturbed basins or sparsely gaged arid regions. An alternative is a deductive approach, using watershed climate, land use, and geomorphology to classify streams, but this approach may miss important hydrological characteristics of streams. We classified all stream reaches in California using both approaches. First, we used Bayesian and hierarchical clustering to classify reaches according to watershed characteristics. Streams were clustered into seven classes according to elevation, sedimentary rock, and winter precipitation. Permutation-based analysis of variance and random forest analyses were used to determine which hydrologic variables best separate streams into their respective classes. Stream typology (i.e., the class that a stream reach is assigned to) is shaped mainly by patterns of high and mean flow behavior within the stream's landscape context. Additionally, random forest was used to determine which hydrologic variables best separate minimally disturbed reference streams from non-reference streams in each of the seven classes. In contrast to stream typology, deviation from reference conditions is more difficult to detect and is largely defined by changes in low-flow variables, average daily flow, and duration of flow. Our combined deductive/inductive approach allows us to estimate flow under minimally disturbed conditions based on the deductive analysis and compare to measured flow based on the inductive analysis in order to estimate hydrologic change.

These interactions shape the decision context that can enable or constrain effective adaptation. To illustrate the operationalisation of this ‘values-rules-knowledge’ (VRK) framework we developed biophysical adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Australia, which are expected to become warmer and drier under climate change. We used the VRK framework to identify potential constraints to implementing the pathways. Drawing on expert knowledge, published literature, biodiversity modelling and stakeholder workshops we identified potential adaptation pathways for (1) the production matrix, (2) high conservation value remnant eucalypt woodlands, and (3) woodland trees. Adaptation options included shifts from mixed cropping-grazing to rangeland grazing or biomass enterprises; promoting re-assembly of native ecological communities; and maintaining ecosystem services and habitat that trees provide. Across all pathways, applying the VRK framework elucidated fifteen key implementation constraints, including limits to farm viability, decreasing effectiveness of environmental legislation and conflicting values about exotic plants. Most of the constraints involved interactions among VRK; 13 involved rules, eight involved values, and seven involved knowledge. Value constraints appeared most difficult to address, whereas those based on rules or knowledge were more tangible. The lower number of knowledge constraints may reflect the scale of our analysis (which focused on decision points in pre-defined pathways); new knowledge and participatory approaches would likely yield a richer set of scenarios. We conclude that the VRK framework helps connect the biophysical knowledge-based view of adaptation with a perspective on the need for changes in social systems, enabling targeting of constraints to adaptation. Our focus on pathways and decision points in different sectors of the multi-use landscape highlighted the importance of group and higher level planning and policy for balancing the collective outcomes of multiple decisions by many land managers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural landscapes; Biomass enterprises; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Decision context; Temperate eucalypt woodlands; Wheat-sheep belt","adaptive management; agricultural land; biophysics; climate change; cropping practice; dicotyledon; ecosystem service; environmental legislation; knowledge; planning practice; rangeland; sheep; stakeholder; temperate forest; wheat; woodland; Australia; Ovis aries; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014701060

Using a simple model of the population dynamics of competing benthic species in a coastal ocean, we found that alongshore variability in dispersal can lead to clustering of species range boundaries for species whose dispersal is dominated by coastal currents. Furthermore, species can be absent from areas where they would have a relative competitive advantage because the presence or absence of a species is determined not only by local conditions but also by propagule supply, which is often affected by larval transport from far upstream. Our model demonstrates the quantitative linkages between alongshore variation in coastal currents, spatial gradients in competitive strength, and the geographic extent of a species. We show that the predictions of the model are consistent with observed species distributions in the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight, USA. A mechanism for extensive coexistence of competing species where range boundaries cluster is described. The implication of the clustering highlighted by our model suggests that for species whose dispersal is dominated by long-distance planktonic periods, climate change induced changes in the relative competitiveness of species will lead to abrupt changes in species range boundaries and not gradual range extension. © 2017 Inter-Research.","Range limits • Drift paradox • Biogeography • Dispersal • Advection • Larvae","advection; benthos; biogeography; biological drift; climate change; coexistence; competitive ability; dispersal; home range; larva; larval transport; oceanic current; population dynamics; range expansion; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Middle Atlantic Bight; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020386502

The efficiency and emission reduction of the engine were an important point of view from study charge compression ignition. Furthermore, the greater adoption of the diesel engine has been inhibited by the increasing public awareness on pollution as well as the rising cost associated with the relatively high number of particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) of its emission. The increase of compression-ignition (CI) engine fuel efficiency accompanied by lower emissions has encouraged intensive studies on the improvements of the diesel engine. In this paper, we describe the recent progress achieved in the research of advanced combustion and fuels to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel or CI engines. An Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system was arranged to be fitted in the engine. The study on the prospect of EGR application in lowering the engine-out NOx emissions in a heavy-duty diesel engine has been conducted by employing a refined 1D fluid-dynamic engine model generated in Boost Software Tools and the control of engine cycle parameters.

A 21-year Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation for the continental United States provided the basis for the RFM developed in this study. Predictors included the principal component scores (PCS) of emissions and meteorological variables, while the predictand was the monthly mean of daily maximum 8-h CMAQ ozone for the ozone season at each model grid. The PCS form an orthogonal basis for RFM inputs. A few PCS incorporate most of the variability of emissions and meteorology, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the source-receptor problem. Stochastic kriging was used to estimate the model. The RFM was used to separate the effects of emissions and meteorology on ozone concentrations. By running the RFM with emissions constant (ozone dependent on meteorology), or constant meteorology (ozone dependent on emissions). Years with ozone-conducive meteorology were identified, and meteorological variables best explaining meteorology-dependent ozone were identified. Meteorology accounted for 19%–55% of ozone variability in the eastern US, and 39%–92% in the western US.

Detailed knowledge about Guatemala's past, current, and future climate is therefore critical to the well-being of a country so reliant on agriculture. Relatively little information about Guatemala's climate exists, though, due to sparse instrumental records and limited high-resolution paleoclimate data. Given this situation, the development of climate data is the necessary first step toward facilitating improved decision making and robust adaptation in the face of predicted future climate change. Here we document how we successfully used tree rings to produce an annually resolved paleoclimate record from Guatemala stretching back to the late seventeenth century. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the range of natural variability in local and regional hydroclimate.

In order to ameliorate the interpretation of evidence into policies, environmental scientists and public health practitioners need innovative methods to emphasize messages concerning adverse health effects to state and local policymakers. In this study, three different types of health risk assessment models categorized by exposure pathways. Namely, ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation were quantitatively evaluated using intensive monitoring data of 51 PM2.5-bound metals that were collected on three consecutive days, from 17 November 2010 to 30 April 2011 in the heart of Bangkok. Although different exposure pathways possess different magnitudes of risk for each PM2.5-bound metal, it can be concluded that ingestion of dust causes more extensive risk to residents compared with inhalation and dermal contact. The investigation of enrichment factors reveals the overwhelming influences of vehicular exhausts on 44 selected metal concentrations in Bangkok. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that highlight the role of public transportation and urban planning in air pollution control. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"aluminum; arsenic; bromine; cadmium; calcium; chlorine; chromium; cobalt; gallium; heavy metal; iron; lead; magnesium ion; manganese; molybdenum; niobium; palladium; potassium; rubidium; scandium; silicon; silver; sodium; strontium; titanium; unindexed drug; vanadium; yttrium; zinc; zirconium; air pollutant; metal; particulate matter; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; health risk; particulate matter; public health; risk assessment; seasonality; urban planning; Article; atmosphere; concentration (parameters); dust; environmental exposure; health hazard; health impact assessment; ingestion; inhalation; particulate matter; priority journal; risk assessment; seasonal variation; Thailand; time series analysis; urban area; X ray fluorescence; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; statistics and numerical data; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Metals; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014114721

The observational dataset describes a region poorly covered by international climate databases and it is believed that most of its data have not been used in the data assimilation procedures of the climate models. This paper therefore provides a fresh look at the performance of these climate re-analysis datasets in a vast area where distance and civil war have hindered ground monitoring efforts. The re-analysis exercises offer better temperature estimates than precipitation estimates. When offered, the evaporation estimates from all three products are very poor. The three products are able to describe the main features of the spatial distribution of average annual precipitation and temperature, but struggle to reproduce the temporal changes of these variables. The results from a set of performance criteria show that the correlation between the observed ground measurements and re-analysis estimates is poor overall and the NSE values indicate that the average measured value at each location is usually a better estimate than the re-analysis estimate.

We quantified the abundance of thermokarst lakes in the continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost zones of the western Siberian Lowland (WSL) using Landsat-8 scenes collected over the summers of 2013 and 2014. In a territory of 105 million ha, the total number of lakes >0.5 ha is 727,700, with a total surface area of 5.97 million ha, yielding an average lake coverage of 5.69% of the territory. Small lakes (0.5-1.0 ha) constitute about one third of the total number of lakes in the permafrost-bearing zone of WSL, yet their surface area does not exceed 2.9% of the total area of lakes in WSL. The latitudinal pattern of lake number and surface coverage follows the local topography and dominant landscape zones. The role of thermokarst lakes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and most trace element storage in the territory of WSL is non-negligible compared to that of rivers. The annual lake storage across the WSL of DOC, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Al constitutes 16%, 34%, 37%, 57%, and 73%, respectively, of their annual delivery by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean from the same territory. However, given that the concentrations of DOC and metals in the smallest lakes (<0.5 ha) are much higher than those in the medium and large lakes, the contribution of small lakes to the overall carbon and metal budget may be comparable to, or greater than, their contribution to the water storage. As such, observations at high spatial resolution (<0.5 ha) are needed to constrain the reservoirs and the mobility of carbon and metals in aquatic systems. To upscale the DOC and metal storage in lakes of the whole subarctic, the remote sensing should be coupled with hydrochemical measurements in aquatic systems of boreal plains. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon; Metal; Remote sensing; Size; Surface; Thermokarst; Volume","Budget control; Carbon; Greenhouse gases; Lead; Metals; Organic carbon; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Surfaces; Trace elements; Dissolved organic carbon; Greenhouse gas exchange; High spatial resolution; Hydrochemical measurement; Size; Sporadic permafrosts; Thermokarst; Volume; Lakes; carbon budget; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; Landsat; landscape structure; permafrost; remote sensing; size distribution; solute transport; spatial resolution; subarctic region; surface area; thermokarst; topography; trace element; volume; water storage; Arctic Ocean; Russian Federation; Siberian Lowland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016050740

This is despite the existing scientific and political consensus to fight human-induced climate change. To reverse this trend, viable, cost-effective decarbonization pathways are needed. We focus on the European power supply system and demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of reaching the EU's mitigation targets by 2050. We show that a transition from conventional to renewable-based power supply systems is possible for the EU even with a politically driven nuclear power phase-out. We provide a guideline for European stakeholders that shows how to transform their power generation systems. By following our recommendations, the EU can be a role model for other countries and regions moving towards decarbonization. Our work is guided by two main motivations: • How can the transition of Europe's power system be modeled adequately? • What is the techno-economically optimal transition pathway for meeting the EU GHG power sector emission targets by 2050? A comparison of power system models has revealed a need for a combined short and long-term simulation tool that includes the principal power generation, storage and transmission technologies being considered in Europe. We adapted and applied the linear model elesplan-m to simulate a techno-economically optimized decarbonization pathway for 18 interconnected European regions and found that meeting the EU's reduction targets, i.e. reducing the GHG emissions from 1300 to 24 Mt CO2eq per year by 2050, can be achieved by large-scale capacity investment in renewable energy sources (RES). The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) would increase from 6.7 to 9.0 ctEUR/kWh and investments of 403 billion EUR would be necessary during the 34 year period analyzed. In 2050, the resulting power supply system is largely composed of wind power (1485 GW) and PV (909 GW), which are supported by 150 GW hydro power and 244 GW gas power. In addition, 432 GW of storage and 362 GW of transmission capacity are required to temporally and spatially distribute electricity. This work provides not only a feasible concept for a decarbonized power supply system, but shows also the implementation steps necessary to make the transition to that system cost-effective. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; GHG emission mitigation; Power system modeling; Renewable energies; Transition pathway","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric power transmission; Emission control; Energy policy; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Ghg emission mitigations; Levelized cost of electricities; Power generation systems; Power system model; Renewable energies; Techno-economic feasibility; Transition pathway; Transmission technologies; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996993143

The aim of the study was to investigate whether it is possible to improve air quality while controlling pollution emission by introducing changes in the organization of air traffic control at the airport. For this purpose, mathematical models of emissions were created. These concern the movement of aircraft near the airport and emission of carbon dioxide and the spread of human health related substances emitted from a landing airplane's engine. The first case refers to the possibility of using different arrival procedures. The second case was to adapt the Pasquill formula by treating landing aircraft as a sequence of point-source emissions. As a result of applying the designed models and software tools, it was proven that both a change in the arrival trajectory and a change of the runway can contribute to a reduction of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. The emission maps created for different aircraft approach profiles show the ability to control the local concentration of harmful emissions. The study clearly shows that the current approach of maximizing throughput is not beneficial to air quality. ATM services should consider the use of other variants of air traffic organization, particularly during periods of reduced traffic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Air quality at the airport; air traffic management; environmental factor in air traffic; human health related emissions; pollution dispersion model","Advanced traffic management systems; Air pollution control; Air quality; Airports; Aviation; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Environmental management; Landing; Pollution; Pollution control; Quality control; Traffic control; Air Traffic Management; Air traffic organizations; Air traffics; Environmental factors; Human health; Point source emissions; Pollution dispersion; Pollution emissions; Air traffic control; air quality; air traffic control; airport; emission control; environmental factor; numerical model; public health; traffic management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009231385

This study focuses on the effect of selective felling (thinning) at a managed forest site. Previous statistical analyses of eddy covariance data at the study site had found that disturbance from thinning resulted in no significant change to net ecosystem carbon uptake. In order to better understand the effect of thinning on carbon fluxes, we use the mathematical technique of four-dimensional variational data assimilation. Data assimilation provides a compelling alternative to more common statistical analyses of flux data as it allows for the combination of many different sources of data, with the physical constraints of a dynamical model, to find an improved estimate of the state of a system. We develop new observation operators to assimilate daytime and nighttime net ecosystem exchange observations with a daily time step model, increasing observations available by a factor of 4.25. Our results support previous analyses, with a predicted net ecosystem carbon uptake for the year 2015 of 426 ± 116 g C m−2 for the unthinned forest and 420 ± 78 g C m−2 for the thinned forest despite a model-predicted reduction in gross primary productivity of 337 g C m−2. We show that this is likely due to reduced ecosystem respiration postdisturbance compensating for a reduction in gross primary productivity. This supports the theory of an upper limit of forest net carbon uptake due to the magnitude of ecosystem respiration scaling with gross primary productivity. ©2017.

In order to be developed sustainably, it is important that its costs and benefits are adequately set and distributed. Different mechanisms, such as royalties, can be used for this purpose. Governments have usually kept hydropower royalty rates low, without internalizing negative externalities. This strategy is inefficient because it leads to larger electricity production and consumption, and hence exacerbates environmental impacts. This paper reviews the criteria proposed and used to set hydropower royalties. It also compares practices of the four main hydropower producers in the world: China, Brazil, Canada and the United States.

In Italy, the Veneto Region was the first to establish a subsidies scheme aimed at promoting the adoption of NT practices. This program encourages farmers to perform direct seeding, alternate autumn and winter crops and maintain soil cover throughout the year by leaving crop residues or sowing cover crops. The goals of this study were to: (i) compare the CO2 emission and soil C sequestration patterns of agricultural soils under CT and NT management practices in the Veneto region and (ii) analyse the potential mid-term benefits (2010–2025) of NT management in terms of soil organic C dynamics and CO2 balance. Agronomic data and soil organic carbon levels were measured from 2010 to 2014 in eight farms in the Veneto region that had adopted CT and NT techniques. Field measurements were used to calibrate first and then validate the SALUS model to compare the mid-term impact of CT and NT practices using climate projections. SOC carbon pools in the model were initialized using the procedure described in Basso et al. (2011c). This is the first study to employ a model using such an extensive dataset at the farm level to assess the CT and NT strategies within this region. Results of this research will assist farmers and policy makers in the region to define the tillage systems most suited to improve soil C stocks and thereby minimize CO2 emissions from agricultural soils. Overall, simulations indicated that SOC stocks can decrease under both CT and NT regimes, however SOC oxidation rates were substantially lower under NT. Critically, the greatest reduction in CO2 emission was observed when NT was adopted in soil with high levels of SOM. This highlights the benefits of NT adoption in terms of soil fertility preservation and CO2 emissions mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Conventional tillage; Crop model; No tillage; Soil organic carbon","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Organic carbon; Seed; Soils; Conservation agricultures; Conservation measures; Conventional tillage; Crop model; Emissions mitigation; Management practices; No tillage; Soil organic carbon; Soil conservation; agricultural modeling; agricultural soil; calibration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; conservation tillage; crop residue; data set; emission control; model validation; policy making; soil carbon; soil conservation; soil cover; soil fertility; soil organic matter; zero tillage; Italy; Veneto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013191679

However, in current Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, crop rotation effects are insufficiently considered, since these effects are difficult to measure. LCA studies from crop production typically take only one vegetation period into account. As a result, the consideration of how the assessed crop is influenced by the previous crop (crop rotation effects) including: (1) nutrient carryover, (2) reduction in operational requirements and (3) different intensity and timing of farming activities, is outside of the system boundary. However, ignoring these effects may lead to incorrect interpretation of LCA results and consequently to poor agricultural management as well as poor policy decisions. A new LCA tool called the “Model for integrative Life Cycle Assessment in Agriculture (MiLA)” is presented in this work. MiLA has been developed to assess GHG emissions and cumulative energy demands (CED) of cropping systems by taking the characteristics of crop cultivation in rotation into account. This tool enables the user to analyze cropping systems at farm level in order to identify GHG mitigation options and energy-efficient cropping systems. The tool was applied to a case study, including two crop rotations in two different regions in Germany with the goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of this tool on LCA results. Results show that including crop rotation effects can influence the GHG emission result of the individual crop by − 34% up to + 99% and the CED by − 16 up to + 89%. Expanding the system boundary by taking the whole crop rotation into account as well as providing the results based on different functional units improves LCA of energy crop production and helps those making the assessment to draw a more realistic picture of the interactions between crops while increasing the reliability of the LCA results. © 2016 The Authors","Biogas production; Carbon footprint; Crop rotation effects; Farm-focused; Life Cycle Assessment","agricultural management; biogas; crop production; crop rotation; demand analysis; emission inventory; energy crop; energy efficiency; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007188772

Slash and stumps have been suggested to replace fossil fuels in district heating plants. Stump/root removal from clear-cuts will reduce the amount of decomposable substrate in the soil and thus decrease soil CO2 emission, but stump lifting is also supposed to stimulate CO2 efflux and counteract CO2 reduction. To determine the effects of stump/root harvesting in relation to site preparation (stumps retained) on pools and fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) after a period of 20–30 years, soil sampling was performed in four pairs of stump/root harvesting (S) and patch scarification (P) stands in central Sweden in 2009. Stump/root harvesting resulted in a significantly lower soil C pool in the humus layer. Annual heterotrophic respiration (RH) in the whole soil profile was significantly lower after the S than after the P treatment, the mean difference being 38 ± 23 g CO2–C m−2 year−1 (95% CI). This difference was larger than corresponding data from stump/root decomposition models (11–18 g CO2–C m−2 year−1), but both empirical and model data showed that stump/root harvesting will reduce heterotrophic soil CO2 emissions to the atmosphere during the actual period. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decomposition; heterotrophic respiration; net N mineralisation; patch scarification; Soil layer","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Harvesting; Lakes; Nitrogen; Decomposition model; District-heating plants; Forest management practices; Heterotrophic respiration; Long-term effects; N mineralisation; patch scarification; Soil layer; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983036814

Amorphous oxides of magnetite/maghemite and crystalline CuO and Cu2O oxides obtained by different methodologies were also studied. Previously, the efficiency of the catalysts for the hydrogen formation was evaluated in 0.1 M NaHCO3 since it takes place as a competitive reaction during CO2 reduction in aqueous electrolytes. By comparison of the voltammograms in the absence and presence of CO2, an inhibition of the hydrogen evolution was showed for all (metal and oxide-based) catalysts due to the adsorption of species from CO2 reduction (CO2,red). Interestingly, the CO2,red formation on Co and Fe-surfaces operating under these conditions has not been stated before.

In this concern, solar energy is viewed as being indefinitely environmental friendly, carbon-free, beneficial nature with appreciated cost potentials and is witnessing fast progressing. Following the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, the volume of gases emitted by greenhouses has to be cut down by 20% by all the European Union (EU) member countries in order to enhance energy performance by 20% and raise the renewable energy rate to 20% by 2020. Solar energy on building roofs plays a crucial aspect in renewable and sustainable energy consumption of high-density human habitats. A merest energy should be allocated to provide hot water service from solar sources, as other European norms for new buildings by the Spanish Technical Building Code, similarly to other European regulation on achievement objectives. The climate zone and the overall demand of hot water in the building regulate this minimal amount needed. This manuscript use a new methodology for automatic detection of geometric patterns from aerial or space images using a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm. In this way, an automatic method for the identification of building roofs in order to assess the opportunities available to install solar thermal systems in small urban areas has been developed. As case of study: a village with 7000 inhabitants was analyzed in the South of Spain. The maximum overall accuracy obtained among the different classifications made was 98.05%, avoiding problems related to the use of images with high spatial resolution, as in the salt-and-pepper noise effect. This approach contributes reducing the generated carbon and GHG emissions and open new perspectives for energy savings strategies to optimize the energy efficiency of buildings.

Consequently, climate change adaptation (CCA) strategies should be devised to minimize its negative and maximize its positive impacts. In response to the needs for developing CCA strategies, climate risk assessment should be conducted as an approach to identify contributed factors to the climate risks in a region with which the adaptation strategies can be devised. This study focused on modeling prone areas to drought over a specialized area called Agropolitan located in Malang district. The model was developed based on the concept of drought in combination with spatial analysis. The model includes climate component (i.e., rainfall and evapotranspiration) and biophysical component (i.e., land cover/use, green open space, slope/elevation). The regional climate data for the baseline and future condition were processed using the gridded datasets of WorldClim, which also included the outputs of six global climate models, namely: BCC, CCCMA, CSIRO, GISS, MIROC and NCAR, for projecting future climate of the study region. The analysis shows that prone areas to drought in Malang district was projected to be larger under future climate scenarios. The expanded prone areas were Kalipare sub-district and Pagak sub-district, which prone areas were expanded towards to the south. For the sub-districts of Donomulyo, Bantur, Singosari, and Gedangan, the prone areas were expanded towards to the north. The prone areas of drought in Poncokusumo sub-district remained constant. The prone areas showed within the Agropolitan areas of Poncokusumo were in the villages of Ngadas, Gubukklakah, Pajaran, Argosuko, Ngebruk and Jambesari, and were projected to expand under future climate scenarios. This assessment was an essential step for further study focusing on defining proper CCA strategies for the study region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agropolitan; climate change; drought; extreme; malang","Agriculture; Climate models; Drought; Regional planning; Risk assessment; Adaptation strategies; agropolitan; Climate change adaptation; extreme; Future climate scenarios; Global climate changes; Global climate model; malang; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018716172

We detected a rare triple-peak H α emission phase in 59 Cyg and a rapid decrease in the emission strength of H α in OT Gem, which are used to understand their circumstellar disks. We find that 59 Cyg is likely to be rapid rotator, rotating at a fractional critical rotation of ∼0.80. The radius of the H α emission region for 59 Cyg is estimated to be Rd/R∗ ∼ 10.0, assuming a Keplerian disk, suggesting that it has a large disk. We classify stars which have shown triple-peaks into two groups and find that the triple-peak emission in 59 Cyg is similar to ζ Tau. OT Gem is found to have a fractional critical rotation of ∼0.30, suggesting that it is either a slow rotator or viewed in low inclination.

The Himalayan country Nepal has been at the forefront of CBF for over four decades, with almost 40% of the total population directly involved in protecting and managing more than 32% of the country's forested land. However, in the past, the focus of CBF in Nepal was the provision of goods for local subsistence, and there has been limited analysis of the role of CBF in providing ecosystem services (ES) from restored forest landscapes. Based on material drawn from a literature review and a stakeholders’ workshop, this paper analyses changes in Nepalese forest policies to provide a more holistic framework for CBF that provides a wider range of ES and to potentially underpin payments for ecosystem services in Nepal. The analysis indicates that Nepal's forest policy and practices are still dominated by a narrowly conceived notion of forest management that does not accommodate the holistic concept of ES. The study illustrates that CBF provides many ES from local to global benefits as result of forest restoration. For example, timber, firewood, food, and water have local importance, while climate regulation, flood/erosion control, and habitat improvement have global importance. Many innovative cases are emerging in the long journey of CBF in Nepal that demonstrate more diverse management strategies, new forms of tenure rights and autonomy in institutional spaces. These can potentially provide a catalytic platform for the wider adoption of the ES framework in CBF regimes, in order to focus and reward forest management more directly for the provision of services such as water, biodiversity, climate regulation and recreation. Consequently, this study discusses the issues and challenges that are impeding the implementation of the ES concept in Nepal and suggests some ways forward. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity conservation; Community forestry; Ecosystem services; Environmental policy; Livelihoods; Sustainability","biodiversity; community forestry; conservation management; ecosystem service; environmental policy; forest management; livelihood; stakeholder; sustainability; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012074549

Some studies have shown that real world driving emissions are much higher as compared to laboratory measurements. The difference was caused by two important factors, i.e. ambient conditions (temperature and altitude) and actual real-world driving cycles. For this reason, the European Commission had constituted a working group which developed a complementary Real-Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure using the Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). RDE test will verify gaseous pollutant and particle number emissions during a wide range of normal operating conditions on the road. In RDE test specific boundary conditions of the temperatures, classified as moderate (0 ≤Tamb &lt; 30), Extended (low): -7 ≤Tamb &lt; 0 and Extended (high): 30 &lt;Tamb ≤35 to cover a wide range of real-world driving in Europe. In India, emission regulations have been implemented from ECE regulation without much customization to Indian ambient conditions and driving cycles. In this study, ambient temperature and humidity of twelve Indian cities were collected, which are having the significant share of the total on-road vehicle population. These ambient conditions were compared with the chassis dynamometer test cell standard condition of 20-30° C and absolute humidity 5.5-18 g/H2O (two-wheelers and passenger cars). The new temperature and humidity limits were recommended for Indian base homologation test. The standard and new limits were simulated using International vehicle emission model, and emission deviations were estimated for a most representative two-wheeler category of Indian automotive market. The analysis revealed that Delhi was the worst (within Indian metropolitan) and Bengaluru was the best in all the cities considering the ambient data following within standard limits. In the case of Delhi, around 80% and Bengaluru around 10% data were observed outside the limits of standards boundary conditions.

The driving cycles are expected to represent actual driving pattern and energy requirements. However, recent studies showed that the gap between real world driving conditions and the standard driving cycle is widening, as the traffic pattern and vehicle population is varying dynamically and the change in the emission procedures is not synchronized with the same pace. More so, as the process of harmonization of emission legislations is in progress to narrow down the country specific variation of emission regulation, as this will help in the smooth globalization of the automotive business process. The new regulation for in-service conformity is being considered to reduce the emissions in real-world driving. It is important that the new procedure should represent the on-road driving and energy requirements in a better way than the current procedures. This study compares the potential of presently used Modified Indian Driving Cycle (MIDC) and proposed (WLTC) emission test cycle towards assessment of key real-world driving parameters like positive kinetic energy, relative positive acceleration, and speed acceleration pattern, etc. The real world driving trips were performed in the urban area in the different traffic conditions of the day. The impact of real world driving trips on the unregulated emissions (Benzene, aldehydes, and butadienes, etc.) was estimated by International Vehicle Emission models. The Emission results of the currently used driving cycle and the new world harmonized cycle are also compared with the real world estimation to evaluate the potential of both the cycles for the representation of the real world driving and unregulated emissions from gasoline-fuelled light duty passenger cars, considering urban traffic conditions. Driving parameters were mathematically calculated and compared with standard test cycles. Real world driving trips were found dispersed in wide acceleration/deceleration range and runs at lower average speed than both the standard cycles. The WLTC shows around 50% less deviation of relative positive acceleration (RPA) with real world driving as compared to MIDC. However, the average speed of MIDC was observed about 8% closer to real world driving average speed in comparison to WLTC. The butadienes emission were observed around 60~80% higher in real world driving condition as compared to MIDC and WLTC cycles. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Automotive industry; Behavioral research; Butadiene; Fuel economy; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Motor transportation; Acceleration/deceleration; Emission legislation; Energy requirements; Positive kinetic energy; Real-world drivings; Speed accelerations; Unregulated emissions; Vehicle emission models; Road vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018270478

In this study principal socio-economic drivers such like GDP (Gross domestic product) and population are taken from used Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The impact of efficient technologies on future CO2 emissions is evaluated using the AIM (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model)/Enduse, a technology bottom-up optimization model integrated with bottom-up service demand models. Three future scenarios are also designed to conduct future evaluation on CO2 emissions growth and potential mitigation measures to meet the emissions target. From the results, impact of each technology was shown to vary across regions. Heating devices, water-heaters and cooking ranges with higher efficiencies are the most effective efficient technologies for both countries. Achieving a 30% CO2 emissions reduction goal requires the combination of various technologies across various regions due to differences in climate and economic circumstances. © 2017 The Authors.","carbon emissions; climate and economic disparity; climate change; energy efficient technology; Residential sector","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy utilization; Housing; Optimization; Sustainable development; Asia-pacific integrated models; Carbon emissions; climate and economic disparity; Economic circumstances; Energy efficient technology; Gross domestic products; Optimization modeling; Residential sectors; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017265936

Energy is an essential component of life in the cities, as it supports the whole spectrum of their economic activities and secures a certain level of quality of life to residents. To meet public policy objectives under these circumstances, cities need to change and develop in a smart way, without disregarding the issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a Decision Support Framework able to assess and optimize the energy use in Smart Cities. The proposed methodology is addressed to the cities local authorities, so as to optimize the energy use in their premises and achieve significant reduction of CO2 emissions. The novel Framework includes two pillars: 'Assessment' and 'Optimization'. The 'Assessment' pillar highlights the strengths, the underperforming sectors and the potentials of a city in terms of energy optimization. The 'Optimization' pillar includes a number of targeted action plans that can be used by the building energy managers of a city. The proposed actions in this pillar derive from the DSS for Energy Management component of the Framework that offers short-term scenarios in a weekly basis, and from the DSS for Energy Efficiency component that offers long-term scenarios in a yearly basis. Moreover, these two pillars combine a number of web based components. The 'Assessment' pillar uses The Smart City Energy Assessment Framework tool (e-SCEAF), which can provide fruitful results for assessing the energy behavior and performance of a city. The 'Optimization' pillar uses the Thermal Comfort Validator (TCV) with the relevant action plan and a Toolset for Assessing the Energy use of Buildings. TCV can assist the energy managers in adjusting thermal comfort parameters, in such a way as to optimize energy use and maintain comfort levels in accepted ranges. The Toolset for Assessing the Energy use of Buildings is able to collect real energy consumption data and calculate automatically the energy savings from a list of improvement scenarios. The novelty of the proposed Framework lies on the merging of multidisciplinary data sources from the following domains: weather, building monitoring, users' feedback, energy prices and energy production. © 2017 The Authors.","Decision Support; Energy Assessment Framework; Energy Optimization; Local Authorities; Multidisciplinary Data Sources; Smart Cities; Sustainable Energy","Buildings; Decision support systems; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Managers; Network function virtualization; Smart city; Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; Data-sources; Decision supports; Energy assessment; Energy optimization; Local authorities; Sustainable energy; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017279173

Recent political discussions have mainly revolved around the question of the most effective and efficient renewable energy sources target and how to achieve it. In this context, European and national policy makers have to address difficult issues: On the one hand, how to support the successful achievement of renewable energy targets in the short and medium term and in a time horizon up to 2030, and, on the other hand, how to share the efforts required among individual entities such as single European Member States or groups of European Member States. This paper presents a multi-criteria approach based on an extension of the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution for group decision support in order to evaluate alternative policy scenarios for achieving the 2030 renewable energy target. Different effort-sharing arrangements among Member States are evaluated to determine the optimal burden sharing of the common renewable energy target among countries.

The focus on reducing oil emission is thus particularly growing in the context of stricter emissions limits for the automotive industry. To reach this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the genesis of oil emission in a combustion engine. In order to determine oil emission caused specifically by the piston group, part of the exhaust gas flow is taken and analyzed using a mass spectrometer directly downstream of the exhaust valve in the exhaust manifold. In the process, the mass spectrometer is operated in high-pass filter mode to detect long-chain hydrocarbons associated with the lubricating oil. In order to make differentiated and detailed statements about oil emission mechanisms, oil emission and blow-by in steady-state and transient engine operation are determined for specific design parameters of the piston group. A highly transient test cycle developed specially for this purpose is used when investigating transient engine operation. Using a standardized and fully automated evaluation tool, characteristic key figures can be calculated for oil emission and blow-by. They reflect the influence of various piston and ring designs on oil emission. This article describes the measurement system, the proprietary test cycle, and the influence of piston designs, such as oil drain holes in the area of the oil control ring and breaks along the third piston groove lower flank on oil emission and blow-by. A better understanding of mechanisms can contribute to more effectively minimizing oil emission and consequently CO2 emissions. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Exhaust manifolds; Flow of gases; Mass spectrometers; Pistons; Combustion engines; Design parameters; Engine operations; Long chain hydrocarbons; Measurement system; Oil control rings; Steady state and transients; Turbocharged gasoline engines; High pass filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018350932

Rebuilding healthy and resilient soils in such environments along with complex above- and below-ground biota for maintenance of ecosystem is required for establishment, growth, productivity and desired trajectories of succession of native plant communities at restoration sites. Complex networks that connect above- and below-ground ecosystems involve the rhizosphere in processes of mineralization and nutrient cycling. Such massive efforts need to be monitored by studying changes over time in native vegetation cover using on ground and remote sensing-based methods, changes in soil conditions and succession in bulk and rhizospheric microbial communities. These communities respond to the plant and soil types in which they occur and their interactions likely involve utilization of plant exudates, carbon sequestration, and available matter through detritus, etc. This chapter provides a brief insight into need for ecologically restoring sites, factors influencing them, the choice or selection of species for undertaking such a work, indicators of ecological restoration that can be applied for monitoring purposes and some of the popular models of ecological restoration in India that have been successfully established, and the techniques used in these models. In the end, it briefly summarizes the importance of soil microbial diversity as a driver of above- and below-ground biodiversity and the linkages between them. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Biodiversity; Complex networks; Forestry; Microorganisms; Remote sensing; Restoration; Soils; Carbon sequestration; Desired trajectories; Ecological restoration; Microbial communities; Monitoring purpose; Nutrient cycling; Restoration sites; Soil microbial diversity; Ecosystems",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033352471

Averaging concentrations in space and time is commonly carried out, but little is known about how robust the estimated health effects are to different aggregation functions. A second under researched question is what impact air pollution is likely to have in the future. Methods: We conducted a study for England between 2007 and 2011, investigating the relationship between respiratory hospital admissions and different pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2); ozone (O3); particulate matter, the latter including particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), and less than 10 micrometers (PM10); and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Bayesian Poisson regression models accounting for localised spatio-temporal autocorrelation were used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of pollution on disease risk, and for each pollutant four representative concentrations were constructed using combinations of spatial and temporal averages and maximums. The estimated RRs were then used to make projections of the numbers of likely respiratory hospital admissions in the 2050s attributable to air pollution, based on emission projections from a number of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). Results: NO2 exhibited the largest association with respiratory hospital admissions out of the pollutants considered, with estimated increased risks of between 0.9 and 1.6% for a one standard deviation increase in concentrations. In the future the projected numbers of respiratory hospital admissions attributable to NO2 in the 2050s are lower than present day rates under 3 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, which is due to projected reductions in future NO2 emissions and concentrations. Conclusions: NO2 concentrations exhibit consistent substantial present-day health effects regardless of how a representative concentration is constructed in space and time. Thus as concentrations are predicted to remain above limits set by European Union Legislation until the 2030s in parts of urban England, it will remain a substantial health risk for some time. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Present day and future health effects; Spatio-temporal ecological study","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; aggregation; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); European Union; health impact; health risk; nitrogen dioxide; particle size; particulate matter; respiratory disease; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlational study; England; health hazard; hospital admission; human; particle size; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract disease; sensitivity analysis; temperature; air pollutant; analysis; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; hospitalization; Respiratory Tract Diseases; risk; statistics and numerical data; England; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; England; Environmental Monitoring; Hospitalization; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016295868

The tractive energy requirements are determined by the vehicle's mass, aerodynamic drag, tire rolling resistance, and parasitic drag. The energy conversion efficiency of the propulsion system is dictated by the tractive efficiency, non-tractive energy use, kinetic energy recovery, and parasitic losses. The energy source determines the mobile source CO2 emissions. For current vehicles, tractive energy requirements and overall energy conversion efficiency are readily available from the decomposition of test data. For future applications, plausible levels of mass reduction, aerodynamic drag improvements, and tire rolling resistance can be transposed into the tractive energy domain. Similarly, by combining thermodynamic, mechanical efficiency, and kinetic energy recovery fundamentals with logical proxies, achievable levels of energy conversion efficiency can be established to allow for the evaluation of future powertrain requirements. Combining the plausible levels of tractive energy and efficiency provides a means to compute sustainable vehicle and propulsion system scenarios that can achieve future regulations. Using these principles, the regulations established in the United States (U.S.) for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are evaluated. Fleet-level scenarios are generated and compared to the technology deployment assumptions made during rule-making. When compared to the rule-making assumptions, the results indicate that a greater level of advanced vehicle and propulsion system technology deployment will be required to achieve the model year (MY) 2025 U.S. standards for fuel economy and CO2 emissions. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Aerodynamic drag; Aerodynamics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Conversion efficiency; Decomposition; Drag; Energy conversion; Fuel economy; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mobile power plants; Propulsion; Rolling resistance; Vehicles; Energy requirements; Foundational elements; Future applications; Mechanical efficiency; Propulsion system; Regulatory standards; Technology deployment; Tractive efficiency; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018365869

This paper reports findings of a survey of farmers into the role of agroforestry or ‘agroecological intensification’ for reducing climate change vulnerability. The survey was conducted in the Tehri-Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, a Himalayan State of India. Existing traditional agroforestry was found to provide ecosystem services to farmers at various scales ranging from the global to household level, contributing to the livelihoods and resilience of the farmers to climate change. The strategies of farmers for adaptating to climate change include adoption of agroforestry due to its diversified agricultural and forest products and services. The analysis suggests that policies should consider agroforestry as a tool for improving the livelihood and resilience to climate change of farmers. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Climatic extremes; Ecosystem services; Multi-species plantation; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agroecology; agroforestry; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem service; plantation; smallholder; strategic approach; vulnerability; Himalayas; India; Tehri Garhwal; Uttarakhand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974806760

The timing of flowering and fruiting (phenology) is often temperature dependent and tends to advance as the climate warms. Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations can provide historical phenology records and have been used, on a localised scale, to predict species’ phenological sensitivity to climate change. Conducting similar localised studies in the Canadian Arctic, however, poses a challenge where the collection of herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have been temporally and spatially sporadic. We used flowering and seed dispersal times of 23 Arctic species from herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across the 2.1 million km2 area of Nunavut, Canada, to determine (1) which monthly temperatures influence flowering and seed dispersal times; (2) species’ phenological sensitivity to temperature; and (3) whether flowering or seed dispersal times have advanced over the past 120 years. We tested this at different spatial scales and compared the sensitivity in different regions of Nunavut. Broadly speaking, this research serves as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology–climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales. Flowering times and seed dispersal time were most strongly correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively. Seed dispersal times have advanced at double the rate of flowering times over the past 120 years, reflecting greater late-summer temperature rises in Nunavut. There is great diversity in the flowering time sensitivity to temperature of Arctic plant species, suggesting climate change implications for Arctic ecological communities, including altered community composition, competition, and pollinator interactions. Intraspecific temperature sensitivity and warming trends varied markedly across Nunavut and could result in greater changes in some parts of Nunavut than in others. © 2017 The Authors.

These analyses require species trait data compiled from the literature and floras or original field measurements. Gathering such data makes trait-based research time intensive at best and impracticable in some cases. To support trait-based analysis of vegetation along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon, a data set of 20 biological traits and ecological affinities for 179 species occurring in that study area was compiled. This diverse flora shares species with many riparian areas in the western USA and includes species that occur across a wide moisture gradient. Data were compiled from published scientific papers, unpublished reports, plant fact sheets, existing trait databases, regional floras, and plant guides. Data for ordinal environmental tolerances were more readily available than were quantitative traits. More publicly available data are needed for traits of both common and rare southwestern U.S. plant species to facilitate comprehensive, traitbased research.

This study presents a new time-based function of spaceborne soil moisture as an efficient indicator. Bundelkhand of Central India, a frequently agricultural drought affected region, was used as the study area. Rabi agricultural season (October–May) being the dominant agricultural return period, was chosen as the study period. Coarse resolution soil moisture (SMc) obtained from European space agency under climate change initiative program was spatially downscaled (SMd) to meet spatial scale at sub-regional level with overall root-mean-square error under 0.065 cm3/cm3. Indirect validation of SMd was done using temporal impact of rainfall/dry spell on SMd and spatiotemporal impact of SMd on vegetation condition. SMd was found to agree with phenomenon as expected in natural processes and hence it was assumed to be validated. The time-based function derived from spatiotemporal SMd (FSMs) was found to be better related with fluctuations in seasonal crop yield (Ys) at district level as compared to a similar function (FVCIs) derived using vegetation condition index (VCI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. FSMs outperformed FVCIs having better correlation coefficient (R ≥0.8) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) than FVCIs for most of the districts. Unlike FVCIs, it also efficiently detected the lowest and highest Ys for majority of the districts representing better association with agricultural drought. Subsequently, frequent soil moisture deficit areas were mapped by using FSMs to visualize the spatiotemporal severity of agricultural drought in the region during Rabi season. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agricultural drought; effective drought index (EDI); satellite soil moisture; spatial downscaling; vegetation condition index (VCI)","downscaling; drought; environmental indicator; satellite imagery; soil moisture; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation index; visualization; Bundelkhand; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011915301

About 90% of the Brazilian LDVs run on ethanol or gasohol. The HDVs form a relatively low fraction of the total fleet but account for 90% of the PM from road vehicles.

The emission control programs (e.g., PROCONVE) have been successful in reducing the vehicular exhaust emissions, but the non-exhaust vehicular sources such as evaporative losses during refueling of vehicles as well as wear from the tyre, break, and road surface have increased in line with the increase in the vehicle fleet. The national inventories show the highest annual mean PM2.5 (28.1 μg m–3) in the MASP that has the largest vehicle fleet in the country.

Global climate projections are not consistent with changes in observations at the regional or local level of the Niger basin, making management of hydrological projects in the basin uncertain. This study evaluates the potential of using the quantile mapping bias correction to improve the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) outputs for use in hydrological impact studies. Rainfall and temperature projections from 8 CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCM) were bias corrected using the quantile mapping approach. Impacts of climate change was evaluated with bias corrected rainfall, temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The IHACRES hydrological model was adapted to the Niger basin and used to simulate impacts of climate change on discharge under present and future conditions. Bias correction with quantile mapping significantly improved the accuracy of rainfall and temperature simulations compared to observations. The mean of six efficiency coefficients used for monthly rainfall comparisons of 8 GCMs to the observed ranged from 0.69 to 0.91 and 0.84 to 0.96 before and after bias correction, respectively. The range of the standard deviations of the efficiency coefficients among the 8 GCMs rainfall data were significantly reduced from 0.05-0.14 (before bias correction) to 0.01-0.03 (after bias correction). Increasing annual rainfall, temperature, PET and river discharge were projected for most of the GCMs used in this study under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. These results will help improving projections and contribute to the development of sustainable climate change adaptation strategies. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; IHACRES model; Quantile mapping; Rainfall; Runoff",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025450523

The south of the country is much more of a concern. Rainfall is projected to decrease between 10% in the north and 30% in the south over the same period. In the province of Médenine, in Southern Tunisia, where the bio-climate is dry (rainfall ranging from 100 to 200 mm), rain-fed olive tree cropping dominates (more than 80%) the land-use system. The aim of this work is to conduct a prospective study on the potential impacts of climate change on the spatial distribution of olive growing orchard areas to be used as guidelines for decision-making in climate change-related adaptation programs. Presently, 73% of olive groves are located in highly suitable conditions, but this figure will drop to only 8.5% by 2020 and 7.9% in 2050, while groves located in moderately suitable conditions will change from its current 19.3% to 78.2% and then 67.4%, in the same time frame. Orchards found in low to marginal conditions, which represents only 7.7% today, will increase to 13.3% and further to 24.7%, in 2020 and 2050 respectively. Although the olive tree is well known for being able to grow in harsh environments, climate change is expected to negatively influence the potential for expanding the plantation of these trees under exclusively rain-fed conditions. Therefore, planners and decision-makers need to discourage farmers from growing olive trees in large areas of the province where the rainfall amount is expected to fall by large amounts in the coming decades. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054945783

The formation of these salts can reduce the availability of NH3 for NOx conversion, block active catalyst sites, and result in the formation of N2O, a regulated Greenhouse Gas (GHG).

Solar PV technology is deemed to be the most suitable renewable energy resources in agro-food industry. The continuously decreasing market prices in solar technologies are highlighted with strong effort by the Malaysian government through various policies. The 2MWp project has been in operation since January 2015 with the expected annual energy outcome reaching 5,840 MWh and RM 5.635 million energy sales under the Malaysia Feed-in-Tariff scheme. The carbon credit scheme from the PV operation at site is expected to produces a surplus of 2.9% out of the total energy sales. The main contribution of the study is the cultivation of cooling mechanism via herbal plots under each of the PV arrays. The herbal plant surrounding temperature is 0.85°C much lower as compared to the mid-air temperature thus effectively reducing the PV module temperature. This cooling approach is expected to increase the annual energy generation up to 2.77% which initiates handsome monetary benefits of RM 156 k year-1.

Using the UK as a case study we review and critically evaluate a broad range of evidence to assess how this considerable potential can be enhanced despite financial, contractual and public opinion constraints. Reduced mowing frequency and other alterations would enhance biodiversity, aesthetics and pollination services, whilst delivering costs savings and potentially being publically acceptable. Retaining mature trees and planting additional ones is favourable to residents and would enhance biodiversity, pollution and climate regulation, carbon storage, and stormwater management. Optimising these services requires improved selection of tree species, and creating a more diverse tree stock. Due to establishment costs additional tree planting and maintenance could benefit from payment for ecosystem service schemes. Verges could also provide areas for cultivation of biofuels and possibly food production.

This study proposes a generic framework-based hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) and two approaches, to comprehensively assess the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate variability on runoff over the representative Hutuo River Basin (HRB), China. Results showed that SWAT performed well in capturing the runoff trend in HRB; however, it exhibited better performance for the calibration period than for the validation. During 1961-2000, about 26.06% of the catchment area was changed, mainly from forest to farmland and urban, and the climate changed to warmer and drier. The integrated effects of the anthropogenic activities and climate variability decreased annual runoff in HRB by 96.6 mm. Direct human activities were responsible for 52.16% of runoff reduction. Climate (land use) decreased runoff by 45.30% (2.06%), whereas the combined (land use+ climate) impact resulted in more runoff decrease, by 47.84%. Land use-climate interactive effect is inherent in HRB and decreased runoff by 1.02%. The proposed framework can be applied to improve the current understanding of runoff variation in river basins, for supporting sustainable water resources management strategies. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Environmental change; Integrated assessment; Interactive effect; Runoff; SWAT","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Climatology; Land use; Rivers; Runoff; Water conservation; Watersheds; Anthropogenic activity; Environmental change; Hydrological modeling; Integrated assessment; Interactive effect; Soil and water assessment tool; Sustainable water resources; SWAT; Water resources; assessment method; climate effect; climate variation; environmental change; human activity; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; performance assessment; river basin; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016643255

Based on a new direct land-sea comparison in SW Iberian margin IODP Site U1385 we examine the climatic variability between 1100 and 1050 ka including the “super interglacial” MIS 31, a period dominated by the 41-ky obliquity periodicity. Pollen and biomarker analyses at centennial-scale-resolution provide new insights into the regional vegetation, precipitation regime and atmospheric and oceanic temperature variability on orbital and suborbital timescales. Our study reveals that atmospheric and SST warmth during MIS 31 was not exceptional in this region highly sensitive to precession. Unexpectedly, this warm stage stands out as a prolonged interval of a temperate and humid climate regime with reduced seasonality, despite the high insolation (precession minima values) forcing. We find that the dominant forcing on the long-term temperate forest development was obliquity, which may have induced a decrease in summer dryness and associated reduction in seasonal precipitation contrast. Moreover, this study provides the first evidence for persistent atmospheric millennial-scale variability during this interval with multiple forest decline events reflecting repeated cooling and drying episodes in SW Iberia. Our direct land-sea comparison shows that the expression of the suborbital cooling events on SW Iberian ecosystems is modulated by the predominance of high or low-latitude forcing depending on the glacial/interglacial baseline climate states. Severe dryness and air-sea cooling is detected under the larger ice volume during glacial MIS 32 and MIS 30. The extreme episodes, which in their climatic imprint are similar to the Heinrich events, are likely related to northern latitude ice-sheet instability and a disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In contrast, forest declines during MIS 31 are associated to neither SST cooling nor high-latitude freshwater forcing. Time-series analysis reveals a dominant cyclicity of about 6 ky in the temperate forest record, which points to a potential link with the fourth harmonic of precession and thus low-latitude insolation forcing. © 2017","Early Pleistocene; Iberian margin; Land-sea comparison; Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 31; Mediterranean vegetation; Millennial-scale climate variability; Obliquity and precession forcing; Pollen analysis; Precession harmonics; Super interglacial","Forestry; Glacial geology; Global warming; Incident solar radiation; Isotopes; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Climate variability; Early pleistocene; Iberian margin; Marine isotope stages; Mediterranean vegetation; Obliquity and precession forcing; Pollen analysis; Precession harmonics; Super interglacial; Oceanography; biomarker; climate variation; cyclicity; harmonic analysis; insolation; interglacial; land-sea interaction; marine isotope stage; meridional circulation; obliquity; orbital forcing; palynology; Pleistocene; precession; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; temperate forest; temperature profile; vegetation cover; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Iberian Margin; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013218323

We analyzed local climatic records to assess potential climatic changes in Yasuní National Park, Ecuador, and compared two censuses (1995, 2012) of a palm community to assess changes in community structure and composition. Over 17 years, the structure and composition of this palm community remained remarkably stable. Soil humidity was significantly lower and canopy conditions were significantly more open in 2012 compared to 1995, but local climatic records showed that no significant changes in precipitation, temperature or river level have occurred during the last decade. Thus, we found no evidence of recent directional shifts in climate or the palm community in Yasuní. The absence of changes in local climate and plant community dynamics in Yasuní contrasts with recent findings from eastern Amazon, where environmental change is driving significant changes in ecosystem dynamics. Our findings suggest that until now, local forests in the northwest Amazon may have escaped pressure from climate change. The stability of this rich palm community embedded in the hyperdiverse Yasuní National Park underlines its uniqueness as a sanctuary for the protection of Amazonian diversity from global change impacts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arecaceae; biodiversity; climate change; climatic records; community ecology; directional changes; forest dynamics; forest monitoring; global change; Yasuní National Park","angiosperm; biodiversity; climate change; community dynamics; community ecology; environmental change; forest dynamics; global change; Amazonia; Ecuador; Napo [Ecuador]; Yasuni National Park; Arecaceae; soil; climate change; ecosystem; Ecuador; forest; soil; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Ecuador; Forests; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994796881

Scleractinian corals vary in their sensitivity to these variables, suggesting species composition will influence how reef communities respond to future climate change. Because data are lacking for many species, most studies that model future reef growth rely on uniform scleractinian calcification sensitivities to temperature and ocean acidification. To address this knowledge gap, calcification of twelve common and understudied Caribbean coral species was measured for two months under crossed temperatures (27, 30.3 °C) and CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) (400, 900, 1300 μatm). Mixed-effects models of calcification for each species were then used to project community-level scleractinian calcification using Florida Keys reef composition data and IPCC AR5 ensemble climate model data. Three of the four most abundant species, Orbicella faveolata, Montastraea cavernosa, and Porites astreoides, had negative calcification responses to both elevated temperature and pCO2. In the business-as-usual CO2 emissions scenario, reefs with high abundances of these species had projected end-of-century declines in scleractinian calcification of &gt;50% relative to present-day rates. Siderastrea siderea, the other most common species, was insensitive to both temperature and pCO2 within the levels tested here. Reefs dominated by this species had the most stable end-of-century growth. Under more optimistic scenarios of reduced CO2 emissions, calcification rates throughout the Florida Keys declined &lt;20% by 2100. Under the most extreme emissions scenario, projected declines were highly variable among reefs, ranging 10–100%. Without considering bleaching, reef growth will likely decline on most reefs, especially where resistant species like S. siderea are not already dominant. This study demonstrates how species composition influences reef community responses to climate change and how reduced CO2 emissions can limit future declines in reef calcification. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biomineralization; calcification; climate change; coral reefs; dissolution; Florida Reef Tract; ocean acidification; precipitation; scleractinia; warming","biomineralization; calcification; climate change; community composition; community response; coral reef; dissolution; ocean acidification; precipitation (climatology); warming; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; United States; Anthozoa; Montastraea cavernosa; Porites astreoides; Scleractinia; Siderastrea siderea; sea water; animal; Anthozoa; Caribbean; climate change; coral reef; Florida; population dynamics; Animals; Anthozoa; Caribbean Region; Climate Change; Coral Reefs; Florida; Population Dynamics; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988845017

Referring to this, we discuss the neutral hydrogen gas around the Perseus cloud in the present paper. By using the J-band extinction data, we found that τ353 increases as a function of the 1.3th power of column number density of the total hydrogen (NH), and this implies dust evolution in high density regions. This calibrated τ353-NH relationship shows that the amount of the H I gas can be underestimated to be ∼60% if the optically thin H I method is used. Based on this relationship, we calculated the optical depth of the 21 cm line (τH I) and found that 〈τH I〉 ∼ 0.92 around the molecular cloud. The effect of τH I is still significant, even if we take into account the dust evolution.

However, because the Kyoto Protocol considered HFCs as greenhouse gases, and their impact on climate change has been increasing, major developed countries have been strengthening existing regulations on the use of HFCs as refrigerants. South Korea has also passed various legislations related to refrigerant management. However, reports indicate that implementation of these regulations has been ineffective, due to the absence of a specific system for managing the production, use, and disposal phases of refrigerants. To identify and resolve these issues, this study investigates the current state of refrigerant management in South Korea for those three phases. Refrigerant management policies are compared between different legislatures, using the examples of the European Union, United States, and Japan. Based on the findings, five types of measures are suggested to reduce the production and consumption of refrigerants, and to improve refrigerant management regulations in ways that are most appropriate to the South Korean context. © 2015, Springer Japan.","CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons); Comparative policy analysis; Emissions trading; GHG (greenhouse gas); HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons); HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons); Refrigerant management","Chlorofluorocarbons; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Ozone layer; Refrigerants; Emissions Trading; GHG (greenhouse gas); Hydrochlorofluorocarbons; Hydrofluorocarbons; Policy analysis; Fluorocarbons; CFC; comparative study; emissions trading; European Union; greenhouse gas; hydrochlorofluorocarbon; Kyoto Protocol; policy analysis; policy implementation; regulatory framework; waste management; Europe; Japan; South Korea; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951975509

This decline in coral reefs is possibly considered to be due to global environmental changes, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by anthropogenic sources. The extra atmospheric CO2 is leading to increased seawater surface temperature (SST) as well as surface ocean acidification. This study investigates the relationship between the coral calcification rate and four different controlling factors, seawater pH, aragonite saturation state (Oarag), temperature, and light intensity. Seawater temperature, pH, and Oarag are all being directly affected by the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide occurring. In this study, coral reef observations were performed in Jicchaku, Okinawa, Japan. A medium sized tide-pool (250 X 225 cm2, average water depth = 22.6 cm) was utilized for experimental observation periods. Two different types of trials were also run. Normal pH (~8.2) trials were run with no alteration to the seawater. Low pH trials were run after adding ~20 mL of 12M HCl to lower the pH in the tide-pool to a pH of ~7.8. During each trial run, a seawater sample was taken once at the beginning and end of the trial run and once during the trial run. In the laboratory, the samples collected from the field were utilized to determine pH and salinity. Total alkalinity (TA) was determined using the Gran plot method that uses a titration pH curve to determine TA. Seawater Oarag was calculated using a computer program called CO2SYS. The calcification rate was calculated using the change in TA over the change in time. Data from a daytime normal pH trial at the tide-pool showed TA decreased in relation to time for this trial indicating that calcification was occurring at that time. Data from a nighttime showed TA increased in relation to time for the trial indicating that calcium carbonate dissolution was occurring during nighttime. We also observed that there is a positive relationship between light intensity and the calcification rate suggesting 'light-enhanced' calcification. It could be observed that there is little correlation between the temperature and calcification rate. This suggests that temperature had no effect on changes in the calcification rate for the tide-pool experiments. On the other hand, seawater pH and Oarag were observed to have a strong influence on the calcification rate. From the field experiments we suggest that coral reef calcification is closely coupled to seawater CO2 pH and Oarag, and reduced coral calcification is predicted in the near future when atmospheric CO2 further increases. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Two major cultivars of ginkgo, Kyuju (K) and Tokuro (T), were evaluated for their potential as a feed additive for ruminants. In batch culture, we incubated a mixture of hay and concentrate in diluted rumen fluid with or without 1.6% (fruit equivalent) ginkgo fruit extract. We conducted another series of batch culture studies to determine the dose response of fermentation. We also conducted continuous culture using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) with cultivar K and carried out a pure culture study to monitor the sensitivity of 17 representative rumen bacterial species to ginkgo extract and component phenolics. Although both K and T extracts led to decreased methane and increased propionate production, changes were more apparent with K extract, and were dose-dependent. Total gas production was depressed at doses ≥3.2%, suggesting that 1.6% was the optimal supplementation level. In RUSITEC fermentation supplemented with 1.6% ginkgo K, methane decreased by 53% without affecting total gas or total VFA production, but with decreased acetate and increased propionate. Disappearance of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were not affected by ginkgo, but ammonia levels were decreased. Quantitative PCR indicated that the abundance of protozoa, fungi, methanogens, and bacteria related to hydrogen and formate production decreased, but the abundance of bacteria related to propionate production increased. MiSeq analysis (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) confirmed these bacterial changes and identified archaeal community changes, including a decrease in Methanobrevibacter and Methanomassiliicoccaceae and an increase in Methanoplanus. Pure culture study results supported the findings for the above bacterial community changes. These results demonstrate that ginkgo fruit can modulate rumen fermentation toward methane mitigation and propionate enhancement via microbial selection. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association","ginkgo fruit extract; methane reduction; rumen fermentation; rumen microbiota","methane; animal; animal food; biosynthesis; fermentation; fruit; Ginkgo biloba; metabolism; microflora; rumen; Animal Feed; Animals; Fermentation; Fruit; Ginkgo biloba; Methane; Microbiota; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009517324

This short communication provides a preliminary assessment of the quantity, distribution and economic value of key ecosystem services as well as geological resources such as oil and minerals provided by Arctic ecosystems to beneficiaries in the Arctic region and globally. Using biophysical and economic data from existing studies, preliminary estimates indicate that the Arctic currently provides about 281 billion per year (in 2016 US) in terms of food, mineral extraction, oil production, tourism, hunting, existence values and climate regulation. However, given predictions of ice-free summers by 2037, many of the ecosystem services may be lost. We hope that this communication stimulates discussion among policy-makers regarding the value of ecosystem services and such geological resources as minerals and oil provided by the Arctic region, and the potential ecosystem losses resulting from Arctic melt, so as to motivate decisions vis a vis climate change mitigation before Arctic ice disappears completely. © 2017","Arctic; Climate change; Ecosystem; Valuation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014424624

This is mainly due to the fact that they are relevant in addressing multiple challenges associated with rural development, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and sustainable forest management. However, there are concerns about the implications of strategic and practical steps taken in this context on forest-dependent communities. Thus, there is need to reconcile local socio-economic vulnerabilities and forest-based climate change intervention initiatives. In the current study, socio-economic factors influencing households’ dependence on forest resources and associated implications on climate change interventions were investigated. Proportionate stratified random sampling was used to select 366 households from forest-based rural communities in Vhembe District of South Africa. A structured questionnaire was administered to household heads in 21 villages. The Pearson’s chi-square test was used to analyse the factors that influence household dependence on forest. The effects of household socio-economic characteristics on households’ forest dependence influencing factor were determined using the binary logit model. Up to 97% of the respondents depended on the forest resources predominantly because of low costs associated with using them. It was observed that socio-economic characteristics of households such as farm husbandry skills, years of residence (53–65) in the community and age of respondents (≤38–65) significantly (P < 0.05) influenced use of the forest resources. Thus, effectiveness and sustainability of forest-based climate change intervention initiatives can be promoted if the socio-economic conditions prevailing within households in areas next to forests are improved. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","household; livelihood; rural community; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011593462

However, because of aerosols' complex physical, optical, and dynamical properties, aerosols are one of the most uncertain aspects of climate modeling. Fortunately, aerosol measurement networks over the past few decades have led to the establishment of long-Term observations for numerous locations worldwide. Further, the availability of datasets from several different measurement techniques (such as ground-based and satellite instruments) can help scientists increasingly improve modeling efforts. This study explores the value of evaluating several model-simulated aerosol properties with data from spatially collocated instruments. We compare aerosol optical depth (AOD; total, scattering, and absorption), single-scattering albedo (SSA), Ångström exponent (<i>α</i>), and extinction vertical profiles in two prominent global climate models (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, GFDL, CM2.1 and CM3) to seasonal observations from collocated instruments (AErosol RObotic NETwork, AERONET, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization, CALIOP) at seven polluted and biomass burning regions worldwide. We find that a multi-parameter evaluation provides key insights on model biases, data from collocated instruments can reveal underlying aerosol-governing physics, column properties wash out important vertical distinctions, and <q>improved</q> models does not mean all aspects are improved. We conclude that it is important to make use of all available data (parameters and instruments) when evaluating aerosol properties derived by models. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol property; anthropogenic source; climate change; comparative study; computational fluid dynamics; ground-based measurement; optical depth; satellite imagery; vertical profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017000390

Under severe resource limitation, it has been suggested that facilitation may revert to competition, and identifying the presence as well as determining the magnitude of this shift is important for predicting the effect of climate change on biodiversity and plant community dynamics. In this study, we perform a meta-analysis to compare temporal differences of species diversity and productivity under a nurse plant (Retama sphaerocarpa) with varying annual rainfall quantity to test the effect of water limitation on facilitation. Furthermore, we assess spatial differences in the herbaceous community under nurse plants in situ during a year with below-average rainfall. We found evidence that severe rainfall deficit reduced species diversity and plant productivity under nurse plants relative to open areas. Our results indicate that the switch from facilitation to competition in response to rainfall quantity is nonlinear. The magnitude of this switch depended on the aspect around the nurse plant. Hotter south aspects under nurse plants resulted in negative effects on beneficiary species, while the north aspect still showed facilitation. Combined, these results emphasize the importance of spatial heterogeneity under nurse plants for mediating species loss under reduced precipitation, as predicted by future climate change scenarios. However, the decreased water availability expected under climate change will likely reduce overall facilitation and limit the role of nurse plants as refugia, amplifying biodiversity loss. © 2017 The Authors.

But the path to this target remains unclear due to a lack of information on its economics and implementation challenges. Here, we begin to fill this gap by developing a spatially-explicit model for Minas Gerais state that estimates the costs and benefits of native vegetation regeneration under different restoration approaches. Our results show that 36% (0.7 million ha) of the Forest Code debt in Minas Gerais can be restored using only passive restoration, at a cost of US$ 175 ± 47 million. Adding low-cost assisted natural regeneration would increase that number to 75% (1.5 million ha) at a cost of US$ 776 ± 137 million over a 20 yr period. This would result in a potential sequestration of 284 MtCO2e. However, including the intensive planting methods needed to restore the remaining 25% of highly degraded areas - to fully solve the Forest Code debt and result in a potential sequestration of 345 MtCO2e - would more than double the costs to US$ 1.7 ± 0.3 billion.

Electrification reduces tailpipe emissions and emissions from petroleum refining, transport, and storage, but increases electricity demand. The Electrification Case assumes approximately 17% of light duty and 8% of heavy duty vehicle miles traveled and from 17% to 79% of various off-road equipment types considered good candidates for electrification is powered by electricity. The Electrification Case raises electricity demand by 5% over the 2030 Base Case but nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions decrease by 209 thousand tons (3%) overall. Emissions of other criteria pollutants also decrease. Air quality benefits of electrification are modest, mostly less than 1 ppb for ozone and 0.5 μg m-3 for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), but widespread. The largest reductions for ozone and PM occur in urban areas due to lower mobile source emissions. Electrifying off-road equipment yields more benefits than electrifying on-road vehicles. Reduced crude oil imports and associated marine vessel emissions cause additional benefits in port cities. Changes in other gas and PM emissions, as well as impacts on acid and nutrient deposition, are discussed.

Within these forest trees, density is quite variable. We studied the forest structure, stand dynamics and carbon density at two different sites to know the main factors which drives carbon sequestration process in old forests by considering the following questions: How much is the carbon density in these forest trees of different DBH (diameter at breast height)? How much carbon potential possessed by dominant species of these forests? How vegetation carbon is distributed in these forests? Which species shows high carbon sequestration? What are the physiochemical properties of soil in these forests? Five-year (2005–2010) tree growth data from permanently established plots in the AMNR was analysed for species composition, density, stem diameter (DBH), height and carbon (C) density both in aboveground and belowground vegetation biomass. Our study indicated that among two comparative sites, overall 54 species of 16 different families were present. The stem density, height, C density and soil properties varied significantly with time among the sites showing uneven distribution across the forests. Among the dominant species, L. xylocarpus represents 30% of the total carbon on site 1 while C. wattii represents 50% of the total carbon on site 2. The average C density ranged from 176.35 to 243.97 t C ha−1. The study emphasized that there is generous degree to expand the carbon stocking in this AMNR through scientific management gearing towards conservation of old trees and planting of potentially high carbon sequestering species on good site quality areas. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon density; Dynamics in composition; Forest structure; Pristine forest; SW China","angiosperm; carbon sequestration; community composition; growth rate; nature reserve; phytomass; pristine environment; stand dynamics; stand structure; subtropical region; Ailao Mountains; China; Yunnan; Castanopsis wattii; Fagaceae; Lithocarpus xylocarpus; carbon; soil; biomass; carbon sequestration; chemistry; China; Fagaceae; forest; growth, development and aging; plant stem; soil; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Fagaceae; Forests; Plant Stems; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011299384

To date, inoculants made up of different microsymbionts are widely utilized for production of legumes and cereal crops. Key among these is the Rhizobia spp. targeted for legumes, arbuscular mycorrhizae of Glomus, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota spp., which can infect a range of crops and trees and atoxigenic Aspergillus flavus fungi for managing aflatoxin in maize and groundnuts. This chapter discusses the importance of rhizobia, mycorrhizae, and atoxigenic fungi in enhancing crop yield and food safety.A significant number of investments in inoculant production for biofertilizer and biosafety organisms have increased in the past 10. years. There prospects are bright, given the widespread use of inoculants on legumes to increase nitrogen fixation and the efficient use of fertilizers; growing mycorrhizae for nutrient and water acquisition and pest and disease protection in roots and aflatoxigenic fungi to reduce maize and groundnut contamination has increased the importance of starch (maize products) and protein (groundnut and other legumes) in human diets. Legumes also contribute directly to the nitrogen budget and cycle of mixed cropping systems on smallholder farms. Efficient and combined use of microbial symbionts in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and mycorrhiza technologies can contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emission from farmlands, an important step in mitigating climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, because NG is mostly methane, reduced combustion efficiency associated with traditional NG fueling strategies can result in significant levels of methane emissions which offset the CO2 advantage due to reduced efficiency and the high global warming potential of methane. To address this issue, the unique co-direct injection capability of the Westport HPDI fuel system was leveraged to obtain a partially-premixed fuel charge by injecting NG during the compression stroke followed by diesel injection for ignition timing control. This combustion strategy, referred to as DI2, was found to improve thermal and combustion efficiencies over fumigated dual-fuel combustion modes. In addition, DI2 provided significant thermal efficiency improvement over the baseline diffusion-controlled combustion strategy (HPDI) where NG injection occurs after diesel injection. The DI2 combustion process was analyzed using 3D-CFD and indicated that additional CH4 reductions from the crevice region may be possible by reducing the NG nozzle spray angle. To evaluate the potential reduction available, modified injection nozzles with narrow NG spray angles were tested on the engine. This paper reports the CFD and experimental results obtained with the modified injection nozzles which confirmed that significant CH4 emission reductions can be achieved while maintaining high BTE with DI2.

There is a pressing need to reduce the gap between actual and potential maize yield/ha, especially among farmers in semi-arid regions. This present study examines the potential role of supplemental irrigation and its differential impact on maize yield in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. In this study, maize yield data were generated from information recorded over a period of 20 years by farmers in Ntabankulu through cross-sectional interviews with 124 randomly-selected farming households. Maize yields for interviewed farmers were analysed for each of the experienced climatic hazards, for yield decline per ha and preferable adaptation strategies. Maize yield analyses show a maximum ceiling/attainable yield of 0.234 t/ha and average farm yield of 0.146 t/ha. Floods or hailstorms cause 75% decline in maize yield/ha and there was no significant difference between farmers practising irrigation and those practising dryland farming (P > 0.05). Low/no rains throughout the season; delay or low onset of rainfall and a rain-break for a week or more in a season results in 75%; 54% and 50.5% decline in maize yield/ha, respectively. On a scale of 1 to 10, farmers highly rank practicing supplementary irrigation (8.4) and change of planting date (7.8) as important adaptation strategies. Rescheduling planting date from the traditional planting times to earlier or later planting dates, assisted by use of weather reports and forecasting, to some extent curbs the impact of delays or slow onset of rainfall on yield. Supplemental irrigation is instrumental in reducing the impact of mid-season drought (rains break for a week) and light rainfall throughout the season. Analyses of actual yields and yield decline against each of the experienced climatic hazards provided insight into management possibilities to stabilize maize output. © 2017, South African Water Research Commission.

Moreover, architectural and landscaping constraints related to listed buildings are further limitations to possible interventions. When listed buildings are used as museum, achieving the same effectiveness level of typical energy efficiency measures is very difficult and, if possible, very expensive. In order to couple preservation of cultural heritage and CO2 emission reduction, the approach would move to energy supply rather than modifications in building envelope or installation of new HVAC components. So, this study focuses on the opportunity to green NG supply of existing heating systems by means of Power to Gas option at district level. Thus, the recent advancements in Hydrogen enriched Natural Gas produced by RES electricity excess offer a zero-impact strategy to decarbonize the listed buildings using existing energy infrastructures. At the same time, the absence of changes in building features and the introduction of a renewable share in the supply address the sustainability issues of cultural heritage. In conclusion, a first original attempt was made towards the future crucial task of museum's deep energy refurbishment. © 2017 The Authors.","cultural heritage; energy efficiency; energy transition; existing building; historical buildings; Power to Gas","Buildings; Emission control; Gas emissions; Historic preservation; Museums; Sustainable development; CO2 emission reduction; Cultural heritages; Efficiency measure; Energy transitions; Energy-efficiency strategies; Existing energies; Historical buildings; Sustainability issues; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019273486

Nevertheless, the mechanism of carbon dioxide reduction is still unclear and the information available is not sufficient for developing it into large scale applications, possibly because of the invariable hurdles associated with the reduction process. The reductive photocatalytic conversion of CO2 involves all the redox reactions occurring at the interface of the semiconductor such as water splitting, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, photo-oxidation reactions and reactions of radical intermediates. The overall product yield is highly dependent on the extent of these competing reactions. Herein, we discuss our perceptions and current status of the interface reactions and their involvement in the fundamental mechanistic aspects of the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.","Anion radicals; Carbon dioxide activation; Carbon dioxide anion radical; Carbon dioxide reduction; Photocatalysis; Reaction mechanism; Reactive oxygen species; Sacrificial reagents; Solar energy conversion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026400403

In this respect, the Dual Fuel concept has already proven to be a viable solution, industrially implemented for several applications in the heavy duty engines category. An experimental research activity was devoted to the analysis of the potentiality offered by the application of a Dual Fuel Diesel-CNG configuration on a light duty 2L Euro 5 automotive diesel engine, equipped with an advanced control system of the combustion. The experimental campaign foresaw to test the engine in dynamic and steady state conditions, comparing engine performance and emissions in conventional Diesel and Dual Fuel combustion modes. To this aim, dynamic engine tests were performed adopting the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) while eight steady-state operative test points, representative of the engine working during the homologation cycle, were chosen to analyze specific aspects of the Dual Fuel combustion process. The engine was fully instrumented for indicating signal analysis and pollutant emission measurements. The study confirmed the generally assessed results in terms of strong smoke and CO2 reduction and significant total hydrocarbon emissions (mainly methane) increment when a gaseous fuel is burned in Dual Fuel mode. Due to the high methane emissions at low loads that limits the CNG substitution ratio with diesel, the application of the DF concept is still critical for automotive engines. Moreover, the combustion analysis gave important information on the critical and beneficial aspects of the management engine control technology when this innovative combustion concept is adopted.

It is required to have both high durability and reduced CO2 from the viewpoint of global environment conservation. Therefore lubricating oils for transmission and axle/differential gear box are required to have excellent protection and longer drain intervals. However, it is also necessary that the gear oil maintain suitable friction performance for the synchronizers of the transmission. Even with such good performance, both transmission and axle/differential gear box lubricants must balance cost and performance, in particular in the Asian market. The development of gear oil additives for high reliability gear oil must consider the available base oils in various regions as the additive is a global product. In many cases general long drain gear oils for heavy duty vehicles use the group III or IV base oils, but it is desirable to use the group I/II base oils in terms of cost and availability. The main key technologies for group I/II oil-based gear oils are the additive components chosen and the formulation balance to achieve anti-wear optimum protection and extreme pressure conditions. This paper describes development focused on the evaluation of anti-wear and extreme pressure components using tests, the improvement of the extreme pressure properties, the provision of corrosion inhibition on the gear tooth surface, and the maintaining of friction properties for the synchronizers in the transmission.

Although upgraded, pipeline-quality biogas can augment the NG market supply in the United States of America (USA), researchers and energy industry experts have little studied its long-term potential. This report estimates (1) levelized costs of energy for biogas production facilities operating with landfill waste, animal manure, wastewater sludge, and biomass residue feedstocks, (2) feedstock and technology pathway-specific biogas supply functions, and (3) the aggregate national biogas supply potential for the USA by 2040. Under a range of specified assumptions, generation of biogas could be expanded to approximately 3–5 % of the total domestic NG market at projected prices of $5–6/MMBtu, with the largest potential source coming from thermal gasification of agriculture and forest residues and biomass. As market signals have not spurred widespread adoption of biogas in the USA, policy incentives, similar to those used in the European Union (E.U.), may be necessary to increase its production and use. Bioenergy policy in the E.U. and the resulting market penetration achieved there therefore provides important lessons for how biogas markets in the USA can overcome barriers to market expansion and, in doing so, provide substantial climate mitigation benefits. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anaerobic; Biomass; Digestion; Gasification; Methane","anaerobic digestion; biogas; biomass; crop residue; European Union; greenhouse gas; incentive; manure; methane; pipeline; sludge; wastewater; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940885687

But the southern part of India does not have any perennial rivers and depend on monsoon leading to a high risk of crop failures. By using Human Excreta to produce biogas, both the problems of fuel and sanitation can be tackled simultaneously. People consider the human excreta to be dirty and are reluctant in using any fuel produced from it.

Such a structure is the smaller example resembling an isolated-pentagon motif, as a relevant fragment in fullerene chemistry. Here, we explored the differences between bowl and planar conformations involving both energetic and 13C NMR properties, for the neutral and tetraanionic species by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. This allows us to understand the variation of the chemical environment at the carbon atoms upon planarization of this representive motif. Our results reveal that the variation of the chemical shift comes about from the variation of different main components of the shielding tensor, according to the relative position of the carbon atoms in the structure (i.e., rim, hub, and protonated), which is more relevant for both hub and protonated sites, in contrast to the rim carbon remaining almost unshifted. Interestingly, the planar transition state exhibits a more favorable bonding situation than the bowl-shaped conformation; however, the higher strain is enough to overcome this extra stabilization. Upon reduction to the tetraanionic counterpart (C20H104-), a lesser strain in the planar conformation is observed, decreasing the inversion barrier. In addition, the formation of the concentric aromatic ring systems in C20H104-, results in a more axially symmetric chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor for the hub carbons, accounting in a local manner, for the concentric aromatic behavior in such structure in contrast to the neutral parent. These observations can be useful to evaluate the aromatic behavior of teh isolated-pentagon rule (IPR) motif in fullerene cages. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Anisotropy; Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Chemical bonds; Computation theory; Conformations; Density functional theory; Fullerenes; Ground state; Isomers; Protonation; Tensors; Aromatic ring system; Chemical environment; Chemical shift anisotropy; Computational studies; Density functional theory methods; Isolated-pentagon rules; Planar conformations; Planar transition state; Chemical shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019578884

N2O and NO emissions exhibit high intra- and inter-annual fluctuations, which are also highly influenced by land-use change. In this study we investigated how land-use change between grassland and cornfield affects soil N2O and NO emissions using long-term field measurements in a mollic andosol soil in Southern Hokkaido, Japan. Soil N2O and NO emissions were monitored for 5 years in a 30-year old grassland (OG), which was then plowed and converted to a cornfield for 3 years and then converted back to grassland (new grassland, NG) for another 3 years. We established four treatment plots: control, without any nitrogen (N) input (CT plot); chemical fertilizer only (F plot); chemical fertilizer and manure (MF plot); and manure only (M plot). Changing land use from OG to cornfield increased annual N2O emissions by 6–7 times, while the change from cornfield to NG resulted in a 0.3–0.6 times reduction in annual N2O emissions. N2O emissions in the newly established grassland were 2–5 times higher than those in the 30-year old grassland. Soil mineral N (NO3 − and NH4 +) was higher in cornfield, followed by NG and lowest in OG, while water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) did not significantly change with changing land use but tended to be higher in OG and NG than in cornfield. The ratio of WEOC to soil NO3 − was the most important explanatory variable for differences in N2O emissions as land use changed. High N input, surplus soil N, and precipitation and low soil pH led to increased N2O emissions. N2O emissions in fertilizer- and/or manure-amended plots were 3–4, 2–5 and 1.4–2 times higher than those in the control treatment in OG, cornfield and NG, respectively. NO emissions were largely influenced by soil mineral N and N addition, and showed less response to changing land use. There were high inter-annual variations in both NO and N2O emissions in all plots, including the control treatment, highlighting the need for long-term measurements when determining local emission rates. © 2017 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","cornfield; grassland; land-use change; manure and fertilizer; N2O emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015635056

However, a lack of an extensive historical rainfall record has long served as an obstacle to furthering the understanding of tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Advances have been made in the last few decades in rainfall observational techniques, allowing for the development of robust statistical tropical cyclone rainfall models. However, these current models are unable to capture statistical variability in rainfall intensities (i.e., only mean rainfall rates can be predicted) or they cannot simulate rainfall over land. A new tropical cyclone rainfall model is developed herein using satellite rainfall observations, in which the tropical cyclone rainfall is modeled through a Weibull distribution conditioned upon maximum surface wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST). Satellites are able to capture rainfall observations in the most extreme events, unlike surface rain gauges, which tend to fail under high winds, thereby allowing for the consideration of the rainfall climatology of stronger tropical cyclone events. The rainfall model developed herein was then coupled with state-of-the-art probabilistic tropical cyclone models and future projected climate change scenarios, allowing for the concomitant characterization of tropical cyclone hazards (wind speed, rain rate, and storm size) and the assessment of possible changes in the tropical cyclone hazards in a future climate state. In results obtained from tropical cyclone simulations performed herein under a postulated future climate scenario, in which no technology or policies have been implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, tropical cyclones are projected to intensify. The intensification seen in the simulation results is accompanied by a reduction in size, meaning the magnitude of the extreme wind and rainfall hazards are projected to increase, whereas the affected area is projected to decrease. Additionally, this simulated intensification implies events that are considered extreme in the current climate will occur more frequently in the future climate scenario, paving the way for possible exceedance of critical design values. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate change; Natural hazard; Probabilistic; Rainfall; Risk; Structural safety and reliability; Tropical cyclone simulation","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Gages; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Hurricanes; Oceanography; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Rain gages; Risks; Storms; Surface waters; Tropics; Weibull distribution; Wind; Climate change scenarios; Future climate scenarios; Natural hazard; Probabilistic; Sea surface temperature (SST); Statistical variability; Structural safety; Tropical cyclone; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014415068

In this work, we quantitatively investigate the swapping behavior from injection of pure carbon dioxide and the (CO2 + N2) binary gas mixture through artificial hydrate-bearing sandstone samples by use of a core-flooding experimental apparatus. A total of 13 experimental runs were performed to examine the influence of operating conditions on methane production by CO2/(CO2 + N2) injection in the temperature range of 274.15-277.15 K and 7.039-10.107 MPa pressure. Our results show that the use of the (CO2 + N2) binary gas mixture is advantageous compared to the use of pure carbon dioxide in swapping methane from its hydrate phase; the methane recovery efficiency in brine water systems is enhanced relative to pure water systems. The replenishment of a fresh (CO2 + N2) gas mixture into the vapor phase can be considered as an efficient extraction method because 46.32% of methane was displaced from its hydrate phase with the (CO2 + N2) binary gas mixture after 341.75 h of exposure to the (CO2 + N2) gas mixture. During the CH4-(CO2 + N2) swapping process, gas chromatography analysis and calculations demonstrated that nitrogen molecules can take the place of some methane in small hydrate cages, as long as the equilibrium formation pressure of (CO2 + N2) binary gas hydrate is below that of methane hydrate, even though adding nitrogen to carbon dioxide reduces the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of a new hydrate. When other conditions are similar, the methane gas recovery efficiency increases with the increase of the driving force for the swapping process. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Bins; Carbon dioxide; Chromatography; Efficiency; Gas chromatography; Gas mixtures; Gases; Hydration; Methane; Molecules; Nitrogen; Oil well flooding; Waterworks; Binary gas mixture; Equilibrium formation; Experimental apparatus; Gas chromatography analysis; Natural gas hydrate reservoir; Operating condition; Pure carbon dioxide; Thermodynamic driving forces; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020231903

System dynamics simulation was used to build a model and conduct policy analysis for a simulation period over the years 2000-2050. The model was built with a focus on the interaction among three factors: damage restoration costs from heavy rains, heat waves, and sea level rise; the total cost of food imports due to decreases in arable land and agricultural productivity; and changes in the government budget to respond to climate change problems. A policy experiment was conducted with the model under four scenarios mainly based on the government budget for climate change. The results indicated, firstly, that the climate budget needs to be increased to at least 13 trillion KoreanWon (US $11.6 billion) per year. Secondly, an earlier budget increase would more effectively reduce the total disaster restoration cost than a delayed budget increase. Third, if an earlier budget increase is difficult, the next best alternative would be to allocate a greater fraction of the climate budget to urban rather than to rural areas. Lastly, an early response to climate change would more effectively reduce food import costs, maintain agricultural productivity, and improve infrastructure for climate change adaptation than a delayed response. In conclusion, an earlier increase in the climate change budget would be more effective than a delayed budget increase of the same amount, and allocating a larger fraction of the climate budget to urban areas could be more cost-effective than increasing the budget, if urban and rural parties could agree on the method of allocation. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change policy; Risk management; System dynamics simulation; Urban and rural areas","adaptive management; agricultural production; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; cost analysis; environmental policy; government; heat wave; mitigation; policy analysis; rainfall; risk assessment; rural area; urban area; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017365552

The incorporation of earth-abundant heteroelements (K, P, and O) (i) introduced the negative surface charge over the entire pH range through surface functionalization by phosphate species, (ii) increased the lifetime of the transient species to a picosecond time scale via the formation of charge separation states, (iii) facilitated the interfacial electron transfer to dioxygen, and (iv) inhibited the decomposition of in situ generated H2O2. As a result, the modified CN showed apparent quantum yields (Φ, for H2O2 production) that are enhanced by about 25 and 17 times (Φ420 = 8.0%; Φ320 = 26.2%) from those of bare CN (Φ420 = 0.32%; Φ320 = 1.55%) under monochromatic irradiation of 420 and 320 nm, respectively.

Relative permeability is a flow parameter particularly critical for accurate forecasting of the multiphase behavior of CO2 in the subsurface. The relative permeability relationship assumed and especially the residual saturation of the gas phase greatly impacts predicted CO2 trapping mechanisms and long-term plume migration behavior. A primary goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of the selection of relative permeability formulations on the efficacy of regional-scale CO2 sequestration models. To accomplish this, we selected the San Rafael Swell area of East-central Utah as a case study to evaluate the impact of relative permeability formulations on CO2 plume movement and behavior. A 2D vertical cross section model was built to simulate injection of CO2 into a brine aquifer for 30 years followed by 970 years of post-injection monitoring. We evaluated five different relative permeability relationships to quantify their relative impacts on forecasted flow results of the model, with all other parameters maintained uniform and constant. Because of the interdependence between phase saturation and relative permeability in numerical simulations we expected to see some variation in phase behavior, phase distribution, and CO2 trapping mechanisms. An almost 60% difference in residually trapped gas was observed across the different relative permeability relationships. Large variations of up to 40% in the saturation of both dissolved phase and mobile supercritical phase CO2 were also observed. The pressure buildup and decay observed was not significantly affected by the relative permeability formulation until after injection pressures have dissipated. Results of this analysis suggest that CO2 plume movement and behavior are significantly dependent on the specific relative permeability formulation assigned, including the assumed residual saturation values of CO2 and brine. More specifically, different relative permeability relationships translate to significant differences in CO2 plume behavior and corresponding trapping mechanisms. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon capture and storage; geologic carbon storage; numerical simulation; relative permeability; supercritical CO2","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Computer simulation; Emission control; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Numerical models; Phase behavior; Risk assessment; Geologic carbon storages; Injection pressures; Multi-phase behavior; Relative permeability; Residual saturation; Supercritical CO2; Supercritical phase; Trapping mechanisms; Petroleum reservoir engineering; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; forecasting method; numerical model; permeability; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979232566

An equation defined in IEC 61400-21 [1] is used to estimate the total harmonic current emission of the park at the PCC prior to installation. The equation uses the harmonic emission of a single inverter to predict the spectrum of the total current for a given number of identical inverters connected in parallel at the PCC. This paper considers the interaction of parallel operated inverters and the grid impedance. It proposes an approach based on the so called “equivalent grid impedance”, to improve the performance of summation law for evaluation of the current harmonics emissions at the PCC of PV parks.

In this study, a modified parameter called ""Homogeneity Factor of in-cylinder charge (HF)"" has been applied to analyze the air-fuel mixing and combustion processes. For this purpose, the simulated results has been firstly compared with the experimental data and a good agreement has been achieved for simulating the in-cylinder pressure and the amount of pollutant emissions. Then, nine different strategies based on two variables (the amount of fuel mass in pilot and main injection as well as the dwell between two injections) have been investigated. The results show that employing pilot injection results in higher in-cylinder temperature and shorter auto-ignition delay which causes a rapid increase in the rate of NOx formation in early stage of combustion process. It has been found that, pilot fuel quantity has a significant impact on soot emission while its timing could mainly control NOx formation. In addition, by advancing the start of pilot injection timing, the maximum amount of Homogeneity Factor (HF) during pilot injection, is achieved at an earlier time. As a result, for earlier SOP timing, a sufficient mixing is available to achieve a more homogeneous, locally fuel-lean in-cylinder mixture at the time of ignition to form a large portion of premixed mixture. This suggests, by 0.5 mg pilot fuel injection and also retarding the injection timing by 10 crank angle degree, the amount of NOx and soot emissions have been considerably decreased compared to the baseline case. However, increasing the amount of the ISFC (for about 2.5 %) and decreasing the indicated mean effective pressure (for about 2.2 %) should be considered as two negative factors.

Among renewables, the Central and State Governments have set aspirational targets for on-grid solar electricity and legislated several supporting policies to realise these targets. As a result of the favourable political environment, the development of on-grid solar, in terms of the rate of growth in installed capacity, has been increasing in the recent years, and it is expected to continue in the future. This paper aims to investigate the impact of historical transitions of India's electricity sector on the ongoing development of on-grid solar electricity and to explore the prospect of solar sector development in the future. First of all, we investigate how the historical transformation of governmental intervention's approach intertwined with the gradual shift of the source of generation has paved the way for the current achievements in on-grid solar electricity. Second, we envision the future challenges and opportunities for the development of solar sector by looking ahead and discussing the continuity of government's support and the prospective competitions between different sources. We conclude the paper with some required steps to be taken in order to secure the achievement of the targets in solar electricity in the future. © 2016","India; On-grid solar electricity; Renewable electricity; Sustainability transitions","Emission control; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Emissions reduction; Governmental intervention; Historical transition; India; Renewable electricity; Solar electricity; Supporting policies; Sustainability transition; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996866548

Despite being a relatively young topic, negative emission technologies (NETs) have attracted growing attention in climate change research over the last decade. A sizeable body of evidence on NETs has accumulated across different fields that is by today too large and too diverse to be comprehensively tracked by individuals. Yet, understanding the size, composition and thematic structure of this literature corpus is a crucial pre-condition for effective scientific assessments of NETs as, for example, required for the new special report on the 1.5 °C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this paper we use scientometric methods and topic modelling to identify and characterize the available evidence on NETs as recorded in the Web of Science. We find that the development of the literature on NETs has started later than for climate change as a whole, but proceeds more quickly by now. A total number of about 2900 studies have accumulated between 1991 and 2016 with almost 500 new publications in 2016. The discourse on NETs takes place in distinct communities around energy systems, forests as well as biochar and other soil carbon options. Integrated analysis of NET portfolios - though crucial for understanding how much NETs are possible at what costs and risks - are still in their infancy and do not feature as a theme across the literature corpus. Overall, our analysis suggests that NETs research is relatively marginal in the wider climate change discourse despite its importance for global climate policy. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon dioxide removal technologies; IPCC; negative emissions technologies; Paris agreement; scientometrics; topic modelling","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Risk assessment; Carbon dioxide removal; Emission technology; Global climates; Integrated analysis; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; IPCC; Scientometrics; Thematic structures; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; global climate; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; international agreement; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015189395

This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England &amp; Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha− 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year− 1, which effectively offset 20–35% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers. © 2017 The Authors","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Soil carbon; Soil carbon sequestration","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Best management practices; Climate change mitigation; Disruptive technology; Low-carbon technologies; Soil carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; United States of America; Soils; agricultural land; anthropogenic source; best management practice; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; feasibility study; food security; greenhouse gas; soil carbon; soil organic matter; topsoil; Africa; Asia; Europe; Russian Federation; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009919368

To find ways to utilize mass transit systems more efficiently across the United States, this paper aimed to identify the benchmark transit practices that every mass transit system can emulate and then continuously improve its performance. To achieve these goals, this paper analyzed the multiple years of past performances of 262 mass transit agencies in the United States using data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist productivity index and then provided practical guidelines for enhancing mass transit efficiency. © Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals","data envelopment analysis; dynamic benchmarking; longitudinal study; mass transit systems",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013853484

These systems, however, are acutely sensitive to climate change. In Andean water towers, which supply freshwater to more than 100 million people, climate change adaptation planning is critical. Adaptation plans, however, are more than just documents; they inform and are informed by sociopolitical processes with major implications for hydrosocial relations in mountain water towers. Noting the inadequate scholarly attention to climate change in relation to the hydrosocial cycle, we draw on the hydrosocial literature to examine and compare climate change adaptation plans from mountain water tower regions of Piura, Peru, and the Santiago metropolitan region in Chile. Through a hydrosocial lens, we find that these plans reinforce hydrosocial relations such as upstream–downstream disparities that tend to exclude those who access water informally, have differing ontologies of water, or have livelihoods outside of dominant economic sectors. Our analysis suggests that the Andean plans reinforce current water access patterns, missing a key opportunity to reenvision more inclusive hydrosocial relationships in the context of a changing climate. This study encourages further engagement between the climate change adaptation and hydrosocial literature within and beyond mountain water tower regions. Critical hydrosocial analysis of adaptation plans reveals gaps that must be addressed in future planning and implementation efforts if adaptation is going to provide meaningful pathways for change. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.","adaptation planning; climate change; hydrosocial cycle; mountains; water resources","adaptive management; climate change; environmental planning; future prospect; mountain region; policy approach; policy implementation; water resource; Chile; Metropolitana; Peru; Piura [Peru]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992529851

Nearly all state and national climate change regulations in the US target specific source sectors, and detailed monitoring of individual sectors presents a greater challenge than monitoring total emissions. We particularly focus on opportunities to synthesize disparate types of information on emissions, including emission inventory data and atmospheric greenhouse gas data. We find that inventory estimates of sector-specific CO2 emissions are sufficiently accurate for policy evaluation at the national scale but that uncertainties increase at state and local levels. CH4 emission inventories are highly uncertain for all source sectors at all spatial scales, in part because of the complex, spatially variable relationships between economic activity and CH4 emissions. In contrast to inventory estimates, top-down estimates use measurements of atmospheric mixing ratios to infer emissions at the surface; thus far, these efforts have had some success identifying urban CO2 emissions and have successfully identified sector-specific CH4 emissions in several opportunistic cases. We also describe a number of forward-looking opportunities that would aid efforts to estimate sector-specific emissions: fully combine existing top-down datasets, expand intensive aircraft measurement campaigns and measurements of secondary tracers, and improve the economic and demographic data (e.g., activity data) that drive emission inventories. These steps would better synthesize inventory and top-down data to support sector-specific emission reduction policies.",,"accuracy assessment; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; emission inventory; methane; mixing ratio; pollution policy; regulatory framework; top-down control; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016443885

Although the etiology of abruption is not fully understood, acute stimuli, such as ischemia and/or inflammation, are associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in placental separation. Ischemia and inflammation are acute biologic effects of air pollution. Using a case-crossover design, we tested the hypothesis that a short-term increase in exposure to air pollutants is a potential trigger of placental abruption. Methods: We received data for western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) from the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database. From 2005 to 2010, 821 singleton pregnant women with placental abruption were identified. We assigned daily concentrations of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), suspended particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), from the nearest monitoring station to the respective delivery hospital of each woman. Because information on the onset day of abruption was not obtained, we assumed the case day to be 1 day before the day of delivery. Results: Exposure to NO 2 at 2 days' lag was associated with placental abruption (temperature adjusted odds ratio per 10 ppb increase = 1.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.8). The association patterns were similar, when we restricted to participants who delivered by emergency cesarean (1.4, 1.1, 1.9), or who delivered after 35 weeks of gestation (1.4, 1.0, 2.0). There was no association with suspended particulate matter, ozone, or SO 2. Conclusions: We observed an association between NO 2 exposure at 2 days before the day of delivery and placental abruption in pregnant Japanese women. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this context, the authors have fabricated and investigated the switching mechanism of TiO2 based memristors with and without the incorporation of crystalline hafnium nanoparticles. The resistive switching of the devices needs no electroforming and is dictated by electrode/film interface modifications. The results indicate that the dominant conduction mechanism is Schottky emission while in the case of hafnium nanoparticles incorporation, a synthesis of which has not been reported before, conduction prevailing mechanism changes to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.

The Galactic supernova remnant Kes 78 is surrounded by dense molecular clouds, whose projected position overlaps with the extended HESS γ-ray source HESS J1852-000. The X-ray emission from the remnant has recently been revealed by Suzaku observations, which have shown indications for a hard X-ray component in the spectra that might be associated with synchrotron radiation. Aims. We describe the spatial distribution of the physical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma and reveal the effects of the interaction of the remnant with the inhomogeneous ambient medium. We also investigate the origin of the γ-ray emission, which may be inverse-Compton radiation associated with X-ray synchrotron-emitting electrons or hadronic emission originating from the impact of high-energy protons on the nearby clouds. Methods. We analyzed an XMM-Newton EPIC observation of Kes 78 by performing image analysis and spatially resolved spectral analysis on a set of three regions. We tested our findings against the observations of the 12CO and 13CO emission in the environment of the remnant. Results. We reveal the complex X-ray morphology of Kes 78 and find variations in the spectral properties of the plasma, with significantly denser and cooler material at the eastern edge of the remnant, which we interpret as a signature of interaction with a molecular cloud. We also exclude that narrow filaments emit the X-ray synchrotron radiation. Conclusions. Assuming that the very high energy γ-ray emission is associated with Kes 78, the lack of synchrotron emission rules out a leptonic origin. A hadronic origin is further supported by evidence of interaction of the remnant with a dense molecular cloud in its eastern limb. © ESO, 2017.","Acceleration of particles; ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects: Kes 78; ISM: supernova remnants; X-rays: ISM","Clouds; Inverse problems; Spectrum analysis; Supernovae; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; X rays; Acceleration of particles; ISM : clouds; ISM: individual objects; ISM: supernova remnants; X rays: ISM; Gamma rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014080490

To analyze the potential impact of cross-sector cooperation in reducing these emissions, we formulate a bi-level optimization model where the transportation sector can purchase renewable energy certificates (REC) from the electricity generation sector. These RECs are used to offset emissions from transportation in lieu of deploying high-cost fuel efficient technologies. The electricity generation sector creates RECs by producing additional energy from renewable sources. This additional renewable capacity is financed by the transportation sector and it does not impose additional cost on the electricity generation sector. Our results show that such a REC purchasing regime significantly reduces the cost to society of reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, our results indicate that a REC purchasing policy can create electricity beyond actual demand. This extra capacity can be used to make clean fuel for vehicles and thereby further cut emissions from fossil fuel powered vehicles. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Motor transportation; Purchasing; Sales; Bi-level optimization models; Efficient technology; Electricity generation sectors; Energy from renewable sources; Potential impacts; Renewable capacity; Renewable energy certificates; Transportation sector; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018337937

The surface modified steel slags were then added into asphalt mixture to replace fine aggregates. The results showed that the microwave heating rate of modified steel slag was 84.3 °C/min. That was 34.1 and 65.1% higher than that of the control group of unmodified steel slag and fine basalt aggregate, respectively. Within the microwave frequency band of 2–4 GHz, the real part and imaginary part of the complex permittivity of the modified steel slag asphalt mixture (MSAM) increased by 6.4–12.5 and 4.7–13.7%, respectively, comparing those of the ordinary steel slag asphalt mixture (OSAM) and the ordinary basalt asphalt mixture (OBAM).

For this reason, the national and supranational legislation in the EU is not yet adequately prepared to regulate both the production and the application of biochar. Driven by this “regulatory gap”, voluntary biochar quality standards have been formed in Europe with the European Biochar Certificate, in the UK with the Biochar Quality Mandate and in the USA with the IBI Standard which is intended to be used internationally. In parallel to this, biochar producers and biochar users in a number of EU countries were partly successful in fitting the new biochar product into the existing national legislation for fertilisers, soil improvers and composts. The intended revision of the EC Regulation 2003/2003 on fertilisers offers the opportunity to regulate the use of biochar at the EU level.

Hydropower producers on the Niagara River (flowing between lakes Erie and Ontario) operate as run-of-river, and changing lake levels alter interlake flows reducing both generation and revenues. Index-based insurance contracts, wherein contract payouts are linked to lake levels, offer a tool for mitigating this risk. As a potentially useful tool, pricing of financial insurance is typically based on historical behavior of the index. However, uncertainty with respect to the impacts of climate change on lake level behavior and how this might translate to increased (or decreased) risk for those selling or buying the insurance remains unexplored. Portfolios of binary index-insurance contracts are developed for hydropower producers on the Niagara River, and their performance is evaluated under a range of climate scenarios. Climate Informed Decision Analysis is used to inform the sensitivity of these portfolios to potential shifts in long-term, climatological variations in water level behavior. Under historical conditions, hydropower producers can use portfolios costing 0.5% of mean revenues to increase their minimum revenue threshold by approximately 18%. However, a one standard deviation decrease in the 50 year mean water level potentially doubles the frequency with which these portfolios would underperform from the perspective of a potential insurer. Trade-offs between portfolio cost and the frequency of underperformance are investigated over a range of climate futures. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

Nonetheless, particulate matter in the oceans appears in a continuum of sizes. Here we separated this continuum into six discrete size-fractions, from 0.2 to 200 μm, and described the prokaryotes associated to each of them. Each size-fraction presented different bacterial communities, with a range of 23-42% of unique (OTUs) in each size-fraction, supporting the idea that they contained distinct types of particles. An increase in richness was observed from the smallest to the largest size-fractions, suggesting that increasingly larger particles contributed new niches. Our results show that a multiple size-fractionation provides a more exhaustive description of the bacterial diversity and community structure than the use of only one filter. In addition, and based on our results, we propose an alternative to the dichotomy of FL or ATT lifestyles, in which we differentiate the taxonomic groups with preference for the smaller fractions, those that do not show preferences for small or large fractions, and those that preferentially appear in larger fractions. © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/17.",,"bacterium; community structure; marine ecosystem; microbial community; niche; particulate matter; plankton; prokaryote; species diversity; species richness; Bacteria (microorganisms); Otus; Prokaryota; particulate matter; bacterium; cell size; classification; cytology; genetics; particulate matter; plankton; sea; Bacteria; Cell Size; Oceans and Seas; Particulate Matter; Plankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008392240

We investigated the genetic integrity of the native Rocky Mountain red fox (V. v. macroura) in Colorado through analysis of the composition, distribution, and patterns of gene flow between native and nonnative red fox populations along an elevational gradient. The study area spanned the high plains around Denver in the east to the alpine zone of the Rocky Mountains adjacent to Gunnison and Crested Butte in the west. We used microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Colorado foxes, along with previously published reference data from other native western and nonnative populations, to evaluate the distribution of native versus nonnative ancestry and its relationship to elevation, distance, and landscape type. Nonnative red fox ancestry predominated in Denver and low-lying areas, whereas native ancestry was most prevalent at high elevations. The genetic integrity of foxes at higher elevations (i.e., within the historical native range) was greater in terms of mtDNA than nuclear DNA, consistent with higher male-mediated gene flow. Nonnative admixture was most pronounced in human-altered landscapes. Our findings provide baseline data necessary to monitor future trends of these Rocky Mountain red fox populations and highlight the potential for similar threats to affect genetic integrity of endangered montane red fox subspecies along the Pacific Crest. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.","Colorado; Microsatellites; Mitochondrial DNA; Native; Nonnative; Population genetics; Red fox; Vulpes vulpes","allele; ancestry; canid; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic variation; mitochondrial DNA; native species; population genetics; subspecies; Colorado; Denver; Rocky Mountains; United States; Canidae; Vulpes; Vulpes vulpes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036613860

However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species' potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants' distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source-sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results-based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts-suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.","Demography; Garlic mustard; Integral projection model; Japanese barberry; Species distribution model","Alliaria petiolata; Article; Berberis thunbergii; biogeography; canopy; climate change; community dynamics; demography; environmental temperature; flowering; forecasting; geographic distribution; germination; Lindera benzoin; native species; nonhuman; plant; plant growth; population growth; precipitation; priority journal; progeny; seed production; survival; Turritis glabra; United States; Berberis; Brassicaceae; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; introduced species; physiology; theoretical model; Berberis; Brassicaceae; Climate Change; Demography; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Models, Theoretical; New England",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017656300

Centre-ville, Montréal, Québec  H3C 3P8, Canada","The Wasamac deposit is an example of Archean greenstone-hosted gold deposit located in the Abitibi Belt, 15 km southwest of Rouyn-Noranda. The deposit is hosted by a second-order ductile shear zone of the Cadillac–Larder Lake Fault Zone (CLLFZ), known as the Francoeur-Wasa Shear Zone (FWSZ). It regionally sits at the boundary between the orogenic gold district of Noranda and the Kirkland Lake gold district dominated by intrusion-related gold systems. This specific location in-between two different gold mineralization environments sets the Wasamac deposit apart as a prime candidate for investigating hydrothermal processes along the CLLFZ. Within the Wasamac deposit, gold distribution is constrained to the altered mylonitized portion of the FWSZ; lode systems are absent. Hydrothermal alteration and associated disseminated mineralization occurs as a replacement of the Blake River Group metavolcanic units. The hydrothermal signature displays two distinct alkaline alteration assemblages: potassic and albitic, each associated with specific gold characteristics. (1) Potassic alteration is characterized by the crystallization of microcline, carbonates and quartz. Within this assemblage gold is associated with porous pyrite enriched in Te-Ag-Au-Mo-Pb-Bi-W, deposited under oxidizing conditions. Such characteristics are widely described in the Kirkland Lake area, and are found in examples of syenite-related mineralization, such as the Beattie and Malartic gold deposits. (2) The albitic alteration assemblage, composed of albite, sericite and carbonates, reflects more reduced hydrothermal conditions with mineralization characterized by free native gold. This hydrothermal event is coeval with the brecciation of early gold-rich pyrite reflecting a structural overprint that controlled late-stage gold characteristics. These alteration and structural features are common in orogenic gold deposits both worldwide and regionally, particularly at the neighbouring Kerr-Addison and Francoeur deposits, and in lode-gold systems such as in the Sigma-Lamaque deposit. The gold mineralization at Wasamac has similar characteristics to both intrusion-related gold systems and structurally controlled orogenic gold deposits. Hydrothermal and structural crosscutting relationships at Wasamac indicate that a structurally controlled hydrothermal event overprinted earlier potassic magmatic-hydrothermal alteration. This observation supports a multistage process of gold concentration during which new gold characteristics, metal anomalies, fluid conditions and alteration assemblages replaced earlier stages of gold enrichment, in places completely obliterating previous signatures. We propose that the Wasamac deposit was originally related to an alkaline intrusion buried at depth beneath the Francoeur-Wasa Shear Zone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alkaline alteration; Gold telluride; Intrusion-related; Orogenic gold","Carbonates; Clay alteration; Deposits; Gold; Lakes; Mercury (metal); Mineralogy; Pyrites; Abitibi Greenstone Belt , Canada; Alkaline alteration; Gold telluride; Hydrothermal alterations; Hydrothermal conditions; Intrusion-related; Intrusion-related gold systems; Orogenic gold; Gold deposits; gold; hydrothermal alteration; igneous intrusion; mineralization; ore deposit; orogeny; telluride; Abitibi Belt; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Rouyn-Noranda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012224779

By using an integrated control approach minimal fluid (fuel and DEF) consumption is targeted within the constraints of emission legislation during real-world operation. In such concept, the on-line availability of engine-out NOx emission is crucial. Here, the use of a Virtual NOx sensor can be of great added-value. Virtual sensing enables more direct and robust emission control allowing, for example, engine-out NOx determination during conditions in which the hardware sensor is not available, such as cold start conditions. Furthermore, with use of the virtual sensor, the engine control strategy can be directly based on NOx emission data, resulting in reduced response time and improved transient emission control. This paper presents the development and on-line implementation of a Virtual NOx sensor, using in-cylinder pressure as main input. The development steps from off-line modelling, calibration and validation towards real-time on-line implementation and validation will be presented in great detail. The Virtual NOx sensor is validated on a state-of-the-art EURO-VI Heavy Duty Diesel Engine. Steady-state validation results show that the performance of the Virtual NOx sensor is similar to the physical NOx sensor. Transient load ramp tests and frequency response function evaluation both show improved transient response from the Virtual NOx sensor. Furthermore, the Virtual NOx sensor is successfully applied as substitute for the physical NOx sensor as input to the air path controller over a transient cycle. These validation results demonstrate the application of the Virtual NOx sensor for engine control and show the potential for improved transient emission control. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Diesel engines; Emission control; Frequency response; Transient analysis; Aftertreatment systems; Calibration and validations; Development and applications; Engine control strategy; Frequency response functions; Heavy-duty diesel engine; In-cylinder pressures; Real world operations; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018351199

Methods and Materials We enrolled patients with stage IB-IVA cervical carcinoma in a single-arm phase II trial involving 8 centers internationally. All patients received weekly cisplatin concurrently with once-daily IMRT, followed by intracavitary brachytherapy, as indicated. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of either acute grade ≥3 neutropenia or clinically significant GI toxicity within 30 days of completing chemoradiation therapy. A preplanned subgroup analysis tested the hypothesis that positron emission tomography-based image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT) would lower the risk of acute neutropenia. We also longitudinally assessed patients’ changes in quality of life. Results From October 2011 to April 2015, 83 patients met the eligibility criteria and initiated protocol therapy. The median follow-up was 26.0 months. The incidence of any primary event was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.2%-36.9%), significantly lower than the 40% incidence hypothesized a priori from historical data (P=.012). The incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and clinically significant GI toxicity was 19.3% (95% CI 12.2%-29.0%) and 12.0% (95% CI 6.7%-20.8%), respectively. Compared with patients treated without IG-IMRT (n=48), those treated with IG-IMRT (n=35) had a significantly lower incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia (8.6% vs 27.1%; 2-sided χ2 P=.035) and nonsignificantly lower incidence of grade ≥3 leukopenia (25.7% vs 41.7%; P=.13) and any grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity (31.4% vs 43.8%; P=.25). Conclusions IMRT reduces acute hematologic and GI toxicity compared with standard treatment, with promising therapeutic outcomes.

Soil and root samples were seasonally collected from three olive plantations of different ages. Other samples were carried out in productive olive orchards cultivated under a climatic gradient (desertic, semi-arid, subhumid, and humid). The olive varieties analysed in this study were Blanquette, Rougette, Chemlel and the wild-olive. Spore density, mycorrhization intensity (M%), spore diversity and the most probable number (MPN) were determined. Both the intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and spore density increased with the increase of seasonal precipitation and decreased with the increase of air temperature regardless of the climatic region or olive variety. The variety Rougette had the highest mycorrhizal levels in all plantation ages and climates. Spore community was composed of the genera Rhizophagus, Funneliformis, Glomus, Septoglomus, Gigaspora, Scutellospora and Entrophospora. The genus Glomus, with four species, predominated in all climate regions. Spores of Gigaspora sp. and Scutellospora sp. were the most abundant in desertic plantations. Statistical models indicated a positive relationship between spore density and M% during spring and winter in young seedlings and old plantations. A significant positive relationship was found between MPN and spore density under different climates.

In this work, the impact of fuel composition variations on a heavy-duty, direct injection of natural gas engine with diesel pilot ignition is evaluated. This combustion process results in a predominantly non-premixed gaseous fuel combustion event; as a result, end-gas autoignition (knock) is not a concern. Changes in the fuel composition do still impact the combustion, both through the changes in the chemical kinetics of the reactions and due to changes in the density of the fuel. Increasing concentrations of heavier hydrocarbons, such as ethane or propane, in the fuel lead to higher fuel densities and hence greater fuel mass being injected for a given injection duration. This results in a combustion that has similar peak heat-release rates but longer combustion duration. There is little impact on peak cylinder pressures or the timing of the start of the combustion. The main effect on engine emissions is a substantial increase in PM emissions, due to the greater concentrations of C2-and higher species in the fuel. Various on-board sensors can be used to monitor the engine and correct fueling to avoid engine damage. In this work, a sensing system including bearing-cap mounted accelerometers is used to detect changes in the combustion event and adjust the fueling as needed to maintain engine torque over significant fuel composition variations. These results demonstrate a potential technique for engine protection and control that can accommodate wide variations in natural gas composition. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Combustion; Direct injection; Engines; Fueling; Gas emissions; Geographical regions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Combustion pro-cess; End-gas autoignition; Injection durations; Natural gas composition; Peak cylinder pressures; Peak heat release rates; Potential techniques; Protection and controls; Natural gas transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018326474

In so doing, it aims to provide a new understanding of equity aspects of current residential policy and to highlight opportunities for more effective and equitable policy. The paper uses three criteria: rights and corresponding duties; mitigation responsibilities and capabilities. It applies them systematically to assess the roles of five key actors involved in residential energy use in the UK. The assessment finds a suboptimal distribution of actors’ duties, responsibilities and capabilities and roles and discusses whether and how a more effective and fair allocation of outcomes, in terms of carbon reduction and fuel poverty, could be achieved. In particular, it raises questions about whether the right actors are being legally obliged or incentivised to deliver energy efficiency improvements, and suggests that particular actors–local authorities and community groups–are under-used and require greater government support with capability.

Moreover, proposed approaches to address climate migration as a form of loss and damage have extended beyond compensation, and remain controversial among developed nations. In the highly politicized field of migration governance, however, this article submits that policy support and guidance in addressing loss and damage could prompt dangerous forms of political interference, such as the imposition of a Western objective of containing migrants to the Global South.

At the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees, climate activists and researchers began to look for alternative measures. Climate engineering (CE) - the deliberate manipulation of the planetary environment to decelerate climate change - emerges as a possibly effective, albeit risky and conflictual, option. Aim. This article aims both at simulating a plausible international scenario of negotiation over solar climate engineering deployment, and at utilizing the rules of Model United Nations (MUN) for collaborative learning in a university class. Furthermore, the article intends to provide a framework for simulations about CE that could easily be reproduced. Method. MUN is an established and well-tested foundation for a simulation with students, including preparation leading up to the simulation and feedback rounds afterwards. We repeated the simulation three times, recorded the sessions as well as the debriefings, and gathered interesting insight by comparing the results. Result. For our CE simulations, we discovered: 1. Divergent interests (e.g. global north vs global south). 2. Power struggle (e.g. role of the veto powers). 3. Scientific and political ignorance (e.g. decision-making under uncertainty). 4. Risk politics (e.g. trade-offs between climate change risks vs. CE risks). Conclusion. MUN qualifies well for simulating a CE crisis. However, known lacks in MUN settings (like underrepresentation of non-state actors) must be discussed during the debriefing. These simulations illustrate possible future conflicts over CE without being prescriptive in any way. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","climate change; climate engineering; climate policy; conflict; debriefing; geoengineering; international environmental policy; Model United Nations; politics; risk perception; role-play; simulation; uncertainty; United Nations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015890288

We have identified a nozzle and a bipolar outflow: a jet and a counterjet consisting of coaxial high- and low-velocity components. The separation between the nozzles in the plane of the sky is Δρ = 0.84 ± 0.16 pc; the flow ejection velocity is v ≤ 0.1c. The nozzle brightness temperature reaches Tb ≈ 45 × 1012 K, φ = 20 μas, λ = 2 cm. The ejected electrons radiatively cool at a distance up to ≤4 pc. However, the jet afterglow is observed at a 8% level at a distance up to ρ ≈ 16 pc; the acceleration compensates for the radiative losses. The reduction in the emission level of the central flow at large distances determines the jet bifurcation. The counterjet shape is a mirror reflection of the initial part of the jet, suggesting a symmetry and identity of the ejected flows. The counterjet and jet nozzles are in the near and remote parts of the active region, respectively. The emission from the nozzles is absorbed by a factor of 2 and 15, respectively. The absorption decreases with increasing distance and the brightness of the jet fragments rises to its maximum at 0.5 pc from the nozzle. Arclike structures, arm fragments, are observed in the region of the nozzles. The relativistic plasma comes to the nozzles and is ejected. The brightness temperature of the arclike structures reaches 10% of the peak value, which is determined by the a smaller optical depth, the visibility in the transverse direction. The central high-velocity flow is surrounded by low-velocity components, hollow tubes being ejected as an excess angular momentum is accumulated. The remainder of the material flows along the arms toward the disk center until the next accumulation of an excess angular momentum and the process is repeated. The diameter of the outer nozzle is Ø = 25 pc and, further out, decreases exponentially; Øn ≈ 80 exp(−1.15n) pc. The flow kinematics, collimation, and acceleration have a vortical nature. Ring currents producing magnetic fields, which accelerate and stabilize the processes, are generated in the rotating flows (tubes). The tangential directions of the currents are observed as parallel chains of components. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","AGNs; jets; kinematics; quasar 3C 273; vortices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018503711

We suggest that these theoretical concepts can be used to explain why, despite the growing number of laws and recommendations in this context, local adaptations of climate policies vary significantly between different cities. We argue that the concept of governmentality is particularly well suited to grasping the discrepancies between discursively produced guidelines and actual planning practices and to conceptualising these planning practices as effects of competing and often conflicting technologies of government. © Author(s) 2017.

Although EGR cooler is considered to be an effective measure for further performance enhancement, exhaust gas soot deposition may cause degradation of the cooling. To address this issue, the authors studied the visualization of the soot deposition and removal phenomena to understand its behavior. Based on thermophoresis theory, which indicates that the effect of thermophoresis depends on the temperature difference between the gas and the wall surface exposed to the gas, a visualization method using a heated glass window was developed. By using glass with the transparent conductive oxide: tin-doped indium oxide, temperature of the heated glass surface is raised. This new method was applied to an EGR cooler, which successfully enabled real-time visualization without soot deposition on the window surface. Consequently it was visually confirmed that the soot adheres to the heat exchanging surface. This observation also confirms that basic mechanism of the deposition is due to the thermophoretic phenomenon. Furthermore, there were notable findings observed in the experiment on running a diesel engine. First, position of water condensation occurrence depends on the local thickness distribution within the soot deposit. In addition, the size of the soot peeling area can be effectively increased by inducing high gas velocity with Vortex Generator fin (VG fin) when condensed water exists. The VG fin has heat transfer promoting effect by generated vortex along the gas flow direction on the heat transfer surface. In this paper, these observations are discussed in detail as well as the development of the visualization method.

Despite increasing awareness of the need to incorporate mechanism into species distribution models (SDMs), mechanistic modeling of endotherm distributions remains limited in this literature. Using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as an example, we present a framework whereby mechanism can be incorporated into endotherm SDMs. Pika distribution has repeatedly been found to be constrained by warm temperatures, so we used Niche Mapper, a mechanistic heat-balance model, to convert macroclimate data to pika-specific surface activity time in summer across the western United States. We then explored the difference between using a macroclimate predictor (summer temperature) and using a mechanistic predictor (predicted surface activity time) in SDMs. Both approaches accurately predicted pika presences in current and past climate regimes. However, the activity models predicted 8–19% less habitat loss in response to annual temperature increases of ~3–5 °C predicted in the region by 2070, suggesting that pikas may be able to buffer some climate change effects through behavioral thermoregulation that can be captured by mechanistic modeling. Incorporating mechanism added value to the modeling by providing increased confidence in areas where different modeling approaches agreed and providing a range of outcomes in areas of disagreement. It also provided a more proximate variable relating animal distribution to climate, allowing investigations into how unique habitat characteristics and intraspecific phenotypic variation may allow pikas to exist in areas outside those predicted by generic SDMs. Only a small number of easily obtainable data are required to parameterize this mechanistic model for any endotherm, and its use can improve SDM predictions by explicitly modeling a widely applicable direct physiological effect: climate-imposed restrictions on activity. This more complete understanding is necessary to inform climate adaptation actions, management strategies, and conservation plans. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","activity; American pika; biophysical model; climate change; mechanistic model; Ochotona princeps; physiology; species distribution model; temperature","climate change; climate effect; endothermy; lagomorph; modeling; physiological response; spatial distribution; United States; Animalia; Ochotona princeps; Ochotonidae; animal; climate; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; forecasting; lagomorph; population dynamics; United States; Animals; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forecasting; Lagomorpha; Population Dynamics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984820114

It induces a growing use of chemical fertilizers, irrigation needs, energy use and green-house gases emissions. It also reduces the resilience of soils to climate change. This paper describes a technological process to restore the broken cycle of organic matter. The process is based on an anaerobic digestion followed by a composting enriched with earthworms, to produce bio-methane and humus in an optimised chain. Multiple are the environmental benefits: to produce a fuel with carbon dioxide emissions balanced, to enrich soils reducing the need of irrigation and the need of chemical fertilizers. Meanwhile the humus produced increases the carbon stock of soils and improve the carbon fixed by photosynthesis, closing the carbon cycle. The comparison of data of humus produced by composting and the “combined anaerobic digestion and composting” proposed are quite similar. Therefore the added value of the process described is the production of a renewable methane and avoiding its dispersion in the atmosphere; we remember that methane has a GWP20 = 56. Adding earthworms in the composting treatment enrichs compost with hormones which increase the growth of plants, reducing the fertilising needs.

Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs driven by National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis II for the 1981–2003 period and those driven by four Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models for the 1970–1999 and 2041–2070 periods (i.e. eleven current and the same number of corresponding future period simulations). Drought characteristics are extracted using two drought indices, namely the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Regional frequency analysis is used to project changes to selected 20- and 50-year regional return levels of drought characteristics for fifteen homogeneous regions, covering the study area. In addition, multivariate analyses of drought characteristics, derived on the basis of 6-month SPI and SPEI values, are developed using the copula approach for each region. Analysis of multi-RCM ensemble-averaged projected changes to mean and selected return levels of drought characteristics show increases over the southern and south-western parts of the study area. Based on bi- and trivariate joint occurrence probabilities of drought characteristics, the southern regions along with the central regions are found highly drought vulnerable, followed by the southwestern and southeastern regions.

Central place foragers, such as seabirds and pinnipeds, are thus likely to cope with an increase in the distance between foraging locations and their land-based breeding colonies. Understanding how central place foragers should modify their foraging behavior in response to changes in prey accessibility appears crucial. A spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (Marine Central Place Forager Simulator (MarCPFS)), including bio-energetic components, was built to evaluate effects of possible changes in prey resources accessibility on individual performances and breeding success. The study was calibrated on a particular example: the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), which alternates between oceanic areas in which females feed and the land-based colony in which they suckle their young over a 120 days rearing period. Our model shows the importance of the distance covered to feed and prey aggregation which appeared to be key factors to which animals are highly sensitive. Memorization and learning abilities also appear to be essential breeding success traits. Females were found to be most successful for intermediate levels of prey aggregation and short distance to the resource, resulting in optimal female body length. Increased distance to resources due to climate warming should hinder pups' growth and survival while female body length should increase. © 2017 Massardier-Galatà et al.

A vernacular urban form, which has been designed before the arrival of mechanical heating and cooling is chosen in Bushehr, Iran as a case study. This urbanism and architecture is consistent with strict climate of the region. Despite being a compact form, it is naturally well ventilated. The methodology adopted for this study is use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis for modeling of selected urban space to obtain the amount of pressure and velocity of airflow in outdoor spaces. This study investigates the form with better function.

They involve multiple products or benefits (intended and nonintended), with trade-offs and synergies occurring both on- and off-site and varying over time. Understanding both simplistic relationships and complex interactions between climate and agricultural production systems to determine overall system efficiency and impacts on human well-being is a major challenge. Computer-based tools coupled with participatory approaches for systems integrated assessments have the potential to resolve multiple dimensions of these complex systems. The products of these environmental, economic, and social analyses are important in the development of climate smart adaptation strategies. To reduce burdening the environment and contributing to resilience and sustained production capacity, highly efficient technologies are required. Although some advances have been made in technology generation, their assessment for delivery of crop-livestock systems has lagged behind. This chapter describes approaches that couple participatory methods with computer-based decision supporting tools to achieve an integrated assessment of crop-livestock systems in relation to climate change. Simulation results show that climate change will have an impact on crop-livestock production systems hence smallholder farmers' well-being will also affected. However, impacts will be varied, the three farm categories studied for Nkayi district will not be affected to the same degree due to agricultural management practices and wealth status. Tailoring adaptation packages to different farm categories can assist in developing context-specific technologies to buffer the impacts of climate change. Improved on-farm high-quality fodder production (inclusion of fodder and grain legume) and growing medium duration maize varieties would offset impacts of climate change by about 20%-30% for farmers with livestock. For those farmers without livestock (<40% of rural population) by diversifying on-farm crop production, improved management and growing medium duration crop varieties can reduce economic losses due to climate change from 25% to 19%. The integrated approach can evaluate impacts of climate change on both agricultural production and also human well-being, which is imperative in developing context-specific national adaptation strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The static chamber and gas chromatography techniques were used to capture and measure fluxes of N2O. A station of buried lysimeters was employed to collect leachate for determining nitrate leaching losses. The experiments were in completely randomised block designs. The loss of N in nitrate leaching increased significantly with increasing rates of manure and mineral fertiliser applications. When the application rates of N fertiliser and manure were increased, the emissions of N2O per unit harvested dry matter yield significantly decreased. Losses of N in N2O emissions can be reduced by adopting agronomic practices that enhance N uptake and higher dry matter yield.

Several years of measured weather and PM2.5 concentration data were used to perform statistical and dynamic thermal and airflow simulation analysis. The statistical analysis confirmed that most PM2.5 is locally generated. Higher PM2.5 levels occur in the morning, when wind speeds are low and commuter traffic is high. Unfortunately, in most of the analyzed cities, most hours when daytime weekday outdoor temperatures are mild have elevated PM2.5 levels (up to 95% of the hours). The simulation analysis shows that a hybrid NV system can reduce the electricity consumption of a well-designed office building by up to 60%, in comparison to an office using only mechanical HVAC equipped with a high-efficiency particle filter. Unfortunately, in this hybrid approach, elevated outdoor PM2.5 levels penetrate into the working environment and increase occupant cumulative exposure by 1.9–4.2 times (compared to the standard HVAC system). Limiting the use of NV to moments of low outdoor PM2.5 concentrations limits the exposure increase to 1.3 to 2.4 times but reduces the maximum energy savings to 40%. The last part of this study analyses the tradeoff between energy savings and increased exposure, revealing that in Antwerp, Lisbon and Paris most NV-related energy savings occur in moments of low outdoor PM2.5 levels, thereby limiting the increased exposure effects that occur when unfiltered NV air enters into the working environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality modeling; Indoor air; Natural ventilation; Particle exposure; PM2.5; Simulation","Air conditioning; Air quality; Climate control; Energy conservation; Office buildings; Pollution; Air quality modeling; Indoor air; Natural ventilation; PM2.5; Simulation; Ventilation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; building; indoor air; mathematical analysis; particulate matter; simulation; ventilation; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247619

The proposed methodology has two main objectives: (1) to provide more robust estimates of the fluxes of momentum, heat and CO2; and (2) to reduce the number of flux intervals rejected due to non-stationarity criteria when using traditional EC data processing techniques. The method was applied to measurements from a 28-day cruise (HALOCAST 2010) in the Eastern Pacific region. Empirical mode decomposition was applied to 4-h long time series data and used to determine the cospectral gap time scale, Tgap. Intrinsic modes of oscillation with characteristic periods longer than the gap scale due to non-turbulent motions were assumed and filtered out. Turbulent fluxes were then calculated for sub-intervals of length Tgap from the filtered 4-h time series. In the HALOCAST data, the gap scale was successfully identified in 89% of the 4-h periods and had a mean of 37 s. The EMD approach resulted in the rejection of 11% of the flux intervals, which was much less than the 68% rejected when using standard filtering methods based on data non-stationarity. For momentum and sensible heat fluxes, the averaged difference in flux magnitude between the traditional and EMD approaches was small (3 and 1%, respectively). For the CO2 flux, the magnitude of EMD flux estimates was on average 16% less than fluxes estimated from linear detrended 10-min time series. These results provide evidence that the EMD method can be used to reduce the effects of non-turbulent correlations from flux estimates. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Air–sea interaction; Empirical mode decomposition; Turbulent fluxes","Atmospheric turbulence; Bandpass filters; Data handling; Signal processing; Time series; Data processing techniques; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Filtering method; Long time series; Non-stationarities; Sensible heat flux; Turbulent flux; Turbulent motion; Air; air-sea interaction; carbon flux; eddy covariance; heat flux; time series analysis; transform; turbulent flow; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994414397

However, generalizing about these effects is difficult because invasive plants represent a wide range of life forms, and invaded ecosystems differ in their plant communities and abiotic conditions. We hypothesize that differences in traits between the invader and native species can be used to predict impacts and so aid generalization. We further hypothesize that environmental conditions at invaded sites modify the effect of trait differences and so combine with traits to predict invasion impacts. To test these hypotheses, we used systematic review to compile data on changes in aboveground and soil carbon pools following non-native plant invasion from studies across the World. Maximum potential height (Hmax) of each species was drawn from trait databases and other sources. We used meta-regression to assess which of invasive species’ Hmax, differences in this height trait between native and invasive plants, and climatic water deficit, a measure of water stress, were good predictors of changes in carbon pools following invasion. We found that aboveground biomass in invaded ecosystems relative to uninvaded ones increased as the value of Hmax of invasive relative to native species increased, but that this effect was reduced in more water stressed ecosystems. Changes in soil carbon pools were also positively correlated with the relative Hmax of invasive species, but were not altered by water stress. This study is one of the first to show quantitatively that the impact of invasive species on an ecosystem may depend on differences in invasive and native species’ traits, rather than solely the traits of invasive species. Our study is also the first to show that the influence of trait differences can be altered by climate. Further developing our understanding of the impacts of invasive species using this framework could help researchers to identify not only potentially dangerous invasive species, but also the ecosystems where impacts are likely to be greatest. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","carbon storage; ecosystem functioning; impact; invasive species; meta-analysis","aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; environmental impact; hypothesis testing; invasive species; invasiveness; meta-analysis; plant community; soil carbon; water stress; World; carbon; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate; ecosystem; human; introduced species; plant; soil; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Sequestration; Climate; Ecosystem; Humans; Introduced Species; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017281391

Its high impact is caused by its toxicity and ability to accumulate in living organisms, properties that justified the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to classify mercury as hazardous pollutant. The problem of mercury emission is crucial for countries like Poland, where the most of the emission is caused by coaldepended energy sector. Current technology of mercury removal utilizes adsorption of mercury on the surface of activated carbon. Due to high price of activated carbon, this technological approach seems to be uneconomical and calls for cheaper alternative. One possible solution can be usage of other sorptive materials obtained from thermal processes like coke production. Example of such material is coke dust obtained from dry quenching of coke. The aim of this work was to analyse the sorption potential of lignite and coke dust and determine parameters influencing mercury behaviour during combustion. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016500910

The model considers an introduction of a monorail into a mono-centric city with symmetrically distributed radial highways converging toward the central business district (CBD), with an inelastic commuter demand. We compare the CO2 emission amount as well as aggregate travel time savings from different monorail scenarios, with the introduction of a toll as a necessary condition to generate an efficient outcome. The results show that for a monorail running at an average speed of 40 km/h a length of 26.8 km from the CBD will optimize investment and contribute travel time savings of 105 million Rs. per day or 189 million USD per year to the Sri Lankan economy, resulting in the CO2 emission reduction by 42%.

To understand the controls on carbon fluxes in a productive region impacted by upwelling, we measured biological productivity via multiple methods during a cruise in Monterey Bay, California. We quantified net community production and gross primary production from measurements of O2/Ar and O2 triple isotopes (17∆), respectively. We simultaneously conducted incubations measuring the uptake of 14C, 15NO- 3, and 15NH+ 4, and nitrification, and deployed sediment traps. At the start of the cruise (Phase 1) the carbon cycle was at steady state and the estimated net community production was 35(10) and 35(8) mmol C m−2 d−1 from O2/Ar and 15N incubations, respectively, a remarkably good agreement. During Phase 1, net primary production was 96(27) mmol C m−2 d−1 from C uptake, and gross primary production was 209(17) mmol C m−2 d−1 from 17∆. Later in the cruise (Phase 2), recently upwelled water with higher nutrient concentrations entered the study area, causing 14C and 15NO- 3 uptake to increase substantially. Continuous O2/Ar measurements revealed submesoscale variability in water mass structure and likely productivity in Phase 2 that was not evident from the incubations. These data demonstrate that O2/Ar and 15N incubation-based NCP estimates can give equivalent results in an N-limited, coastal system, when the nonsteady state O2 fluxes are negligible or can be quantified. © 2017.

The underlying mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (""CMIP5"") historical climate model simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature datasets.

Although most of these technologies show promising results in official fuel economy tests, their benefits in real driving conditions and real driving emissions can vary significantly, since driving profiles of many drivers are different than the official driving cycles. Therefore, it is important to assess these technologies under different driving conditions and this paper aims to offer an overall perspective, with a numerical study in simulations. The simulations are carried out on a compact passenger car model with eight powertrain configurations including: a naturally aspirated spark ignition engine, a start-stop system, a downsized engine with a turbocharger, a Miller cycle engine, cylinder deactivation, turbocharged downsized Miller engine, a parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain and an electric vehicle powertrain. These are tested in seven driving cycles including the NYCC, FTP75, NEDC, WLTC, US06, HWFET and CADC. The impacts of different technologies on fuel economy and CO2 emissions are analyzed, with respect to different operating conditions. Results reveal that a combination of certain driving cycles and vehicle configurations have a large influence on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In general, Miller and downsized engines offer some improvements in all cycles while the start-stop system has benefits in city cycles with frequent stops. The HEV and EV configurations offer a substantial improvement compared to conventional technologies in lower speed conditions like city cycles, but their benefits are reduced at cycles including higher speeds.

Yet its implementation based on empirical distributions derived from control samples (referred to as nonparametric distribution mapping) makes the method's performance sensitive to sample length variations, the presence of outliers, the spatial resolution of climate model results, and may lead to biases, especially in extreme rainfall estimation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a methodology for simultaneous bias correction and high-resolution downscaling of climate model rainfall products that uses: (a) a two-component theoretical distribution model (i.e., a generalized Pareto (GP) model for rainfall intensities above a specified threshold u*, and an exponential model for lower rainrates), and (b) proper interpolation of the corresponding distribution parameters on a user-defined high-resolution grid, using kriging for uncertain data. We assess the performance of the suggested parametric approach relative to the nonparametric one, using daily raingauge measurements from a dense network in the island of Sardinia (Italy), and rainfall data from four GCM/RCM model chains of the ENSEMBLES project. The obtained results shed light on the competitive advantages of the parametric approach, which is proved more accurate and considerably less sensitive to the characteristics of the calibration period, independent of the GCM/RCM combination used. This is especially the case for extreme rainfall estimation, where the GP assumption allows for more accurate and robust estimates, also beyond the range of the available data. © 2017.

The partial aim of this paper is to compare greenhouse gas emissions production across sectors of livestock production and to evaluate a development of volume, value and share of emissions as a form of public goods. The methodology is based on the conceptual model MITERRA-Europe (The model was developed to assess the effects and interactions of policies and measures in agriculture on N losses and P balances at a regional level in EU-27), which is partly based on the CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact) and the GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) models using the tools for quantification of the emission factors indicators defined by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) organizations. Part of the solution is to determine the value of public goods quantified through a European platform for carbon emissions trading with its futures contract based on the EU Allowances. The result of this paper is quantified emission value of public goods in livestock production in Czechia and their appreciation in the period 2000-2014. In the final consequence is quantified the proportion of the value of public goods in the total production of the ana lyzed livestock sector.","Agriculture; Conversion ratio; Emission factor; Emissions; Greenhouse gas; Livestock; Polluter; Public goods; Valuation; Willingness to pay","agricultural emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; pollution tax; public goods; valuation; willingness to pay; Czech Republic; Bos; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019667966

The processes that drive this variation remain largely unknown. Understanding which factors determine chemical diversity has the potential to shed light on plant defenses against herbivores and diseases and accelerate drug discovery. For centuries, Cinchona alkaloids were the primary treatment of malaria. Using Cinchona calisaya as a model, we generated genetic profiles of leaf samples from four plastid (trnL-F, matK, rps16, and ndhF) and one nuclear (ITS) DNA regions from twenty-two C. calisaya stands sampled in the Yungas region of Bolivia. Climatic and soil parameters were characterized and bark samples were analyzed for content of the four major alkaloids using HPLC-UV to explore the utility of evolutionary history (phylogeny) in determining variation within species of these compounds under natural conditions. A significant phylogenetic signal was found for the content of two out of four major Cinchona alkaloids (quinine and cinchonidine) and their total content. Climatic parameters, primarily driven by changing altitude, predicted 20.2% of the overall alkaloid variation, and geographical separation accounted for a further 9.7%. A clade of high alkaloid producing trees was identified that spanned a narrow range of altitudes, from 1,100 to 1,350 m. However, climate expressed by altitude was not a significant driver when accounting for phylogeny, suggesting that the chemical diversity is primarily driven by phylogeny. Comparisons of the relative effects of both environmental and genetic variability in determining plant chemical diversity have scarcely been performed at the genotypic level. In this study we demonstrate there is an essential need to do so if the extensive genotypic variation in plant biochemistry is to be fully understood. © 2017 Maldonado, Barnes, Cornett, Holmfred, Hansen, Persson, Antonelli and Rønsted.","Alkaloids; Bolivia; Cinchona calisaya; Climate; Phylogeny; Plant chemical defense; Plant-climate interactions; Quinine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017284914

The aim of this study was to examine the potential antioxidant effects of a feed supplemented with grape pomace (GP), a winery by-product with high environmental load, in chickens. Broilers of 15 days post birth were separated into two groups fed either with standard diet or with diet supplemented with GP for 35 days. Blood and tissues collections were performed after feeding for 15 and 35 days with the experimental diet (i.e. at 30 and 50 days post birth). Free radical toxicity markers, namely thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione, catalase activity and rate of H2O2 decomposition were determined in blood and tissues of vital organs. The results indicated that feed supplemented with GP decreased oxidative stress-induced toxic effects and improved chickens’ redox status, and so it may also improve their wellness and productivity. On the other hand, this exploitation of GP may solve problems of environmental pollution in areas with wineries. © 2017","Antioxidants; Broilers; Grape pomace; Polyphenols; Toxicity markers; Winery waste","carbonyl derivative; catalase; glutathione; thiobarbituric acid; antioxidant; biological marker; catalase; glutathione; scavenger; waste; animal experiment; animal food; animal tissue; antioxidant assay; Article; broiler; controlled study; dietary supplement; enzyme activity; erythrocyte; female; food composition; food waste; grape; grape pomace; heart; IC50; kidney; liver; lung; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; spleen; wine; analysis; animal; blood; chicken; drug effects; metabolism; oxidative stress; physiology; waste; wine; Animal Feed; Animals; Antioxidants; Biomarkers; Blood; Catalase; Chickens; Female; Free Radical Scavengers; Glutathione; Oxidative Stress; Waste Products; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012297985

The conventional bottom-lit updraft (BLUD) method and the top-lit updraft (TLUD) method were evaluated using coal particle sizes between 20 mm and 40 mm. Emission factors of CO2, CO and NOx were in the range of 98-102 g/MJ, 4.1-6.4 g/MJ and 75-195 mg/MJ, respectively. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions were in the range 1.3-3.3 g/MJ for the BLUD method and 0.2-0.7 g/MJ for the TLUD method, for both field and lab-designed stoves. When employing the TLUD method, emission factors of PM2.5/PM10 reduced by up to 80% compared with those when using the BLUD method. Results showed the influence of ventilation rates on emission factors, which reduced by ∼50% from low to high ventilation rates. For energy-specific emission rates, the combined (3-h) PM10 emission rates were in the range of 0.0028-0.0120 g/s, while the combined average CO emission rates were in the range of 0.20- 0.26 g/s, with CO2 emission rates in the range of 0.54-0.64 g/s. The reported emission factors from coal braziers provide the first comprehensive, systematic set of emission factors for this source category, and fill a major gap in previous efforts to conduct dispersion modelling of South African Highveld air quality. © 2017.

The SLAPMB is built in an annular shape with an open area at the center for more secondary air (SA) entrainment, and a vaporizer for vaporizing the liquid ethanol is embedded inside the burner wall. The transient period of the SLAPMB during the switching period from LPG to ethanol vapor is investigated for understanding the simultaneous combustion phenomena within the porous medium burner and the vaporization process within the vaporizer. Effects of the primary air (PA), firing rate (FR) on the flame stabilization, temperature profiles within the burner, and emission characteristics are investigated. The PA strongly affects the flame stabilization within the burner. Flame moves upstream as the PA increases and vice versa with the flame moving downstream as the PA decreases. The existence of an SA inlet can significantly reduce CO emission and increase thermal efficiency. The ethanol flame can be successfully stabilized within the burner with a temperature peak occurring at the middle region of the burner with a relatively low emission of CO and NOx of about 900 ppm and 50 ppm, respectively. Thermal efficiency is 33.6%. The SLAPMB can offer a relatively wide turndown ratio with the firing rate (FR) ranging from 16 kW to 23 kW without the problem of flame stabilization and emission. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Annular packed bed; Liquid fuel combustion; Porous medium burner; Self-aspirating burner","Air entrainment; Efficiency; Ethanol; Fuel burners; Fuels; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Packed beds; Porous materials; Stabilization; Vaporization; Combustion phenomena; Design and Development; Emission characteristics; Flame stabilization; Liquid fuel combustion; Porous medium; Temperature profiles; Vaporization process; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006474714

To assess these assumptions, we utilized the Finnish long-term multi-location Official Variety Trial and weather data for 1979–2012 as a case study. The yield responses of timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb)/Festuca arundinacea (Schreb)), Festulolium (Festuca sp. × Lolium sp.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) to the critical agro-climatic variables depended in most cases on whether the trials were located on clay, coarse mineral, or organic soils. The average yield response to weather was 10% in clay and organic soils and 8% in coarse mineral soils. The diversity of forage crop responses was also dependent on soil type.

Association of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and economic loss with air pollution-related health effects demand quantitative analysis for correctional measures in air quality. This study applies an epidemiology-based exposure–response function to obtain the quantitative estimate of health impact of particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 across 190 cities of China during years 2014–2015. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 is 57 ± 18 μg/m3 (ranging from 18 to 119 μg/m3) and 97.7 ± 34.2 μg/m3 (ranging from 33.5 to 252.8 μg/m3), respectively. Based on the present study, the total estimated annual premature mortality due to PM2.5 is 722,370 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 322,716–987,519], 79% of which accounts for adult cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and ischemic heart disease (IHD). The premature mortality in megacities is very high, such as Chongqing (25,162/year), Beijing (19,702/year), Shanghai (19,617/year), Tianjin (13,726/year), and Chengdu (12,356/year). PM10 pollution has caused 1,491,774 (95% CI = 972,770–1,960,303) premature deaths (age &gt;30) in China. Further, 3,614,064 cases of chronic bronchitis (CB); 13,759,894 cases of asthma attack among all ages; 191,709 COPD-related hospital admission (HA) cases; 499,048 respiratory-related HA; 357,816 cerebrovascular HA; and 308,129 cardiovascular-related HA due to PM10 pollution have been estimated during 2014–2015. Chongqing, Beijing, Baoding, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang are the top five contributors to pollution-related mortality, accounting for 3.10, 2.71, 2.49, 2.20, and 2.02%, respectively, of the total deaths caused by PM10 pollution. The total DALYs associated with PM2.5 and PM10 pollution in China is 7.2 and 20.66 million in 2014–2015, and mortality and chronic bronchitis shared about 93.3% of the total DALYs for PM10. During this period, the economic cost of health impact due to PM10 is approximately US$304,122 million, which accounts for about 2.94% of China’s gross domestic product (GDP). Megacities are expected to contribute relatively more to the total costs. The present methodology could be used as a tool to help policy makers and pollution control board authorities, to further analyze costs and benefits of air pollution management programs in China. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Disability-adjusted life years; Economic cost; Health endpoints; Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10); Premature mortality","asthma; cardiovascular disease; confidence interval; disability; economic analysis; epidemiology; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution exposure; public health; quantitative analysis; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; cost of illness; human; particulate matter; public health; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Cost of Illness; Humans; Particulate Matter; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015649610

Humans have heavily perturbed the cycles of several important aerosol species, potentially affecting terrestrial and marine carbon budgets and consequently climate. The most ecologically important aerosol elements impacted by humans are nitrogen, sulfur, iron, phosphorus, and base cations. Here, we review the latest research on the modification of the atmospheric cycles of these aerosols and their resulting effects on continental and marine ecosystems. Recent Findings: Recent studies have improved our understanding of how humans have perturbed atmospheric aerosol cycles and how they may continue to evolve in the future. Research in both aquatic and terrestrial environments has highlighted the role of atmospheric deposition as a nutrient subsidy, with effects on ecosystem productivity. These studies further emphasize the importance of local biogeochemical conditions and biota species composition to the regional responses to aerosol deposition. Summary: The size of the impact of anthropogenic aerosol deposition on the carbon cycle and the resulting climate forcing is at present not well understood. It is estimated that increases in nutrient subsidies from atmospheric deposition across all ecosystems are causing an increase in carbon dioxide uptake between 0.2 and 1.5 PgC/year. As aerosol emissions from industrial sources are reduced to improve air quality, these enhancements in carbon uptake may be reduced in the future leading to reduced carbon dioxide emission offsets. However, large uncertainties remain, not only because of limited information on how humans have modified and will modify aerosol emissions, but also because of a lack of quantitative understanding of how aerosol deposition impacts carbon cycling in many ecosystems. © 2017, The Author(s).","Aerosols; Biogeochemistry; Carbon cycle; Nutrients",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029349804

Key to this strategy is identification of these areas as well as an understanding of how they are connected on the landscape. Focusing on meadows of the Sierra Nevada in California, we examined multiple factors affecting connectivity using circuit theory, and determined how patches have been and are expected to be affected by climate change. Connectivity surfaces varied depending upon the underlying hypothesis, although meadow area and elevation were important features for higher connectivity. Climate refugia that would promote population persistence were identified from downscaled climate layers, based on locations with minimal climatic change from historical conditions. This approach was agnostic to specific species, yielding a broad perspective about changes and localized habitats. Connectivity was not a consistent predictor of refugial status in the 20th century, but expected future climate refugia tended to have higher connectivity than those that recently deviated from historical conditions. Climate change is projected to reduce the number of refugial meadows on a variety of climate axes, resulting in a sparser network of potential refugia across elevations. Our approach provides a straightforward method that can be used as a tool to prioritize places for climate adaptation. © 2017 Maher et al.","Circuitscape; Climate; Connectivity; Conservation; Dispersal; Meadows; Refugia",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018996666

Two decades of international treaty negotiations have delivered rising greenhouse gas emissions and minimal adaptation funding. The pattern of negotiations suggests that key States will often only make significant commitments that are aligned with their material interests and reciprocated by their competitors. This ‘logic of reciprocity’ in international climate negotiations has limited ambition such that vulnerable States are facing existential threats from sea level rise, storm surge and salt-water inundation. We consider whether the international legal system offers any alternative logics that might found a duty on emitters to reduce their emissions in a timelier fashion and respond to climate-change-induced forced migration. We therefore focus on the foundational principle of the self-determination of peoples, a collective human right which has supported movements towards decolonization and the emancipation of oppressed peoples. We argue that self determination might offer an alternative logic of duty on high-emitting States to the plight of populations who find their territory (and potentially their nationhood) under threat from anthropogenic climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"adaptive management; climate change; emission control; environmental legislation; forced migration; greenhouse gas; human rights; international law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017349784

The aims of this study were to: 1) develop a framework that enabled quantification of the potential effect of environmental taxes on pig diet composition and 2) examine the relationship between tax level and its effectiveness in reducing environmental impacts from pig systems. Three taxes were investigated: a carbon tax on the feed ingredients as purchased, and two financial penalties on the field spreading of N and P in manure respectively. Each tax was integrated into a diet-formulation model for pig diets in Eastern and Western Canada and tested at a range of tax levels. The two regions use different feed ingredients and constitute a test for spatial variation in the consequences of tax measures on diet-formulation. In each case diets were formulated to minimise feed cost per kg of live weight gain and the effect of the tax on feed cost as well as on predicted N and P excretion by the pigs were calculated. The results were then tested in a Life Cycle Assessment model representative of pig farming systems in the two regions, which calculated the potential effect of the diets on the aggregated environmental impacts of each farming system. The environmental impact implications of each environmental tax were quantified using four impact categories: Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential and non-renewable resource use. As environmental tax levels increased, trigger points in the tax range caused dietary change which reduced levels of the targeted emission type. In almost all the tax scenarios the largest reductions in the target emission per Canadian Dollar (C$) increase in cost were achieved at the lower end of the tax range tested, as diminishing marginal returns were evident. The taxes on spreading N and P in manure did not significantly reduce levels of any environmental impact category tested in most cases. In many of the scenarios the environmental taxes altered the diet in a way which significantly increased levels of at least one of the environmental impact categories considered. These results showed the potential for taxes which target specific emissions, to increase system-level environmental impacts in livestock production. The study demonstrated how system-level environmental impact models can be used to quantify the potential of environmental taxes set at different rates to reduce overall environmental impact levels in livestock systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Diet-formulation; Environmental impact pig systems; Environmental taxes; Fertilizer taxes; Pig diets","artificial diet; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental tax; fertilizer application; livestock farming; manure; pig; pollution tax; spatial variation; Canada; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009274728

Canada is a resource rich state with one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas footprints in the world. It is also a state where issues of political will, geographic scale and incumbent industries contribute to a challenging context for broad community participation. Despite this, a long history of co-operative and municipal activity exists in the energy sector, exhibited in diverse ways across its provinces and territories. Provincial variation in energy sources and actors illustrates a far more nuanced picture than exists at the national level, providing a case rich with both promising and cautionary tales for the community energy sector. This article examines the emergence of community energy in the context of broader energy sector moves towards increasingly powerful trade agreements, privatization, and conflicts over Indigenous rights in Canada. It argues that significant potential exists to strengthen the role of local actors in Canadian energy governance, but that macro-level political and economic developments have also created significant challenges for widespread community energy transitions. © 2017 by the author.

Electrostatic interaction is also an important noncovalent interaction. However, very few examples of luminescence color tuning induced by electrostatic interaction were reported. Herein, a series of Zn(II)-bis(terpyridine) complexes (Zn-AcO, Zn-BF4, Zn-ClO4, and Zn-PF6) containing different anionic counterions were reported, which exhibit counterion-dependent emission colors from green-yellow to orange-red (549 to 622 nm) in CH2Cl2 solution. More importantly, it was found that the excited states of these Zn(II) complexes can be regulated by changing the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and counterions. On the basis of this controllable excited state, white light emission has been achieved by a single molecule, and a white light-emitting device has been fabricated. Moreover, a novel type of data decryption system with Zn-PF6 as the optical recording medium has been developed by the two-photon excitation technique. Our results suggest that rationally controlled excited states of these Zn(II) complexes by regulating electrostatic interaction have promising applications in various optoelectronic fields, such as light-emitting devices, information recording, security protection, and so on. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014573559

Two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were first grafted by 4,4′-oxydianiline (ODA). The successful grafting of ODA onto the rGO and CNTs were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The hybrid carbon nanomaterials of the functionalized CNTs and rGO with different ratios were prepared via a solution-mixing method, and their dispersion state was investigated. The hybrid carbon nanomaterials with good stability were introduced to polyimide (PI) via in situ polymerization. The morphology and properties of the polymer composites were studied. The results show that much better mechanical and electrical properties of the composites could be achieved in comparison with those of the neat PI. An improvement of 100.7% on the tensile strength and eight orders for the electrical conductivity were achieved at only a 1.0 wt % hybrid content. A significant enhancement effect was attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of the filler, filler–matrix strong interfacial interactions, and unique structure of the hybrid carbon nanomaterials in the composites. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Departing from a theoretical understanding of a circular economy provided by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the paper analyzes three areas: 1) biogas production, 2) nitrogen, phosphorous &amp; green house gas (GHG) emissions, and 3) re-cycle/cascade materials. It consequently elaborates on the environmental benefits obtained, in terms of CO2 emission from biogas production substituted for fossil fuels, improved water quality and hence reduced GHG emissions due to lower nitrogen effluents, and re-cycling of nutrients on farmland thereby recovering finite resources and improving crop yield. Economic spin-off effects are presented, including new jobs created in the local community. Learning from Solrød Biogas, this paper further proposes to include the following activities when planning for future biogas plants: waste-stream identification and coupling in the local community, measuring the value of digestate as a fertilizer, short distance to farmers delivering manure, and plant design adapted to the local energy market. Finally, the paper suggests how to qualify the circular economic concept based on the findings from the Solrød biogas plant. It is here concluded, that emphasis should be on cascading energy from biogas production by means of combined heat and power (CHP), district heating or process heat to industry. Besides this, cascades in the manufacturing chain must also be intensified, allowing a more efficient materials and energy utilization and re-cycling in this part of the production chain. This will consequently reduce the total quantity of waste being generated by manufacturing industries, and thus benefit re-cycling strategies that only capture and seek to re-use a limited fraction of the waste being generated from industry. © 2017, Paulus Editora.

However, the increment of energy cost caused by equipping a carbon capture process is the main barrier to its commercial deployment. To reduce the capital and operating costs of carbon capture, great efforts have been made to achieve optimal design and operation through process modeling, simulation, and optimization. Accurate models form an essential foundation for this purpose. This paper presents a study on developing a more accurate rate-based model in Aspen Plus® for the monoethanolamine (MEA)-based carbon capture process by multistage model validations. The modeling framework for this process was established first. The steady-state process model was then developed and validated at three stages, which included a thermodynamic model, physical properties calculations, and a process model at the pilot plant scale, covering a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and CO2 loadings. The calculation correlations of liquid density and interfacial area were updated by coding Fortran subroutines in Aspen Plus®. The validation results show that the correlation combination for the thermodynamic model used in this study has higher accuracy than those of three other key publications and the model prediction of the process model has a good agreement with the pilot plant experimental data. A case study was carried out for carbon capture from a 250 MWe combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant. Shorter packing height and lower specific duty were achieved using this accurate model. © 2017 THE AUTHORS","Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Combined cycle gas turbine power plant; Model validation; Monoethanolamine; Process modeling","Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Commerce; Digital storage; Ethanolamines; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas turbine power plants; Gas turbines; Operating costs; Pilot plants; Power markets; Process engineering; Thermodynamic properties; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Capital and operating costs; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Combined cycle gas turbine; Fossil fired power plants; Model validation; Monoethanolamine; Process Modeling; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024835599

Despite these benefits, emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) are the main shortcomings of the concept. These are caused, among other things, by overlean zones near the injector tip and injector dribble. Previous diesel low temperature combustion (LTC) research has demonstrated post injections to be an effective strategy to mitigate these emissions. The main objective of this work is to investigate the impact of post injections on CO and UHC emissions in a quiescent (non-swirling) combustion system. A blend of primary reference fuels, PRF87, having properties similar to US pump gasoline was used at PPC conditions in a heavy duty optical engine. The start of the main injection was maintained constant. Dwell and mass repartition between the main and post injections were varied to evaluate their effect. All points were run at 7 bar IMEPg. High-speed imaging of the natural combustion luminescence was performed together with measurements of performance and engine out emissions. Results show reduction in both CO and UHC with close coupled injections. A large close coupled post injection show the largest reduction in UHC. Analysis show that a post injection prior to combustion reduces the dribble and increases the recirculation in the downstream region of the fuel jet, hence reaching more of the UHC in the area near the injector. General observations show that the partition of fuel between the injections have the largest impact on the CO while the dwell time affects UHC emissions. Injector dribble seems to be a significant contributor to the UHC emissions. © null.",,"Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Engines; Temperature; Engine-out emissions; High speed imaging; Low temperature combustion; Natural combustion; Oxides of nitrogen; Partially premixed combustion; Primary reference fuels; Unburned hydrocarbons; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019039262

To understand the CAP impact on these priorities, the Land Use/Cover statistical Area frame Survey (LUCAS) employs direct field observations and soil sub-sampling across the EU. While a huge amount of information can be retrieved from LUCAS points for monitoring the environmental status of agroecosystems and assessing soil carbon sequestration, a fundamental aspect relating to climate change action is missing, namely nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions. To fill this gap, we ran the DayCent biogeochemistry model for more than 11'000 LUCAS sampling points under agricultural use, assessing also the model uncertainty. The results showed that current annual N2O emissions followed a skewed distribution with a mean and median values of 2.27 and 1.71 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Using a Random Forest regression for upscaling the modelled results to the EU level, we estimated direct soil emissions of N2O in the range of 171-195 Tg yr-1 of CO2eq. Moreover, the direct regional upscaling using modelled N2O emissions in LUCAS points was on average 0.95 Mg yr of CO2eq. per hectare, which was within the range of the metamodel upscaling (0.92-1.05 Mg ha-1 yr-1of CO2eq). We concluded that, if information on management practices would be made available and model bias further reduced by N2O flux measurement at representative LUCAS points, the combination of the land use/soil survey with a well calibrated biogeochemistry model may become a reference tool to support agricultural, environmental and climate policies. © 2017 Lugato et al.

This present work relied on the performance of molecular dynamics both for the neat [C2mim][Tf2N] and [C2mim][Tf2N]/CO2 mixtures in an attempt to elucidate the local environment of CO2 and their effects on the dynamic properties of [C2mim][Tf2N]. A slight change in the orientation of the cation and anion could be observed, which was correlated to the cation and anion moving away from each other in order to receive the carbon dioxide. The gas molecules pushed both the cation and the anion away to create sufficient void to its accommodation. The diffusion coefficient of [C2mim]+ is higher than [Tf2N]− regardless the increase of the CO2 concentration. The addition of CO2 in the ionic liquid has shown an increase of 4-5 times for the diffusivity of ions, which was related to the decrease of cation-anion interaction strength. The transport properties’ results showed that the addition of CO2 in the ionic liquid generates the fluidization of the system, decreasing the viscosity as a consequence of the local environment structure changing. Likewise, the effect of the type of anion and cation on the system properties was studied considering [Ac]− and [BMpyr]+ ions, showing large effects by the change of anion to [Ac]− which rise from the strong [C2mim]+-[Ac]− interaction, which conditions the solvation of ions by CO2 molecules. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Carbon; Fluidization; Ionic liquids; Ionic strength; Ions; Liquids; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Positive ions; Structural properties; Bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide; Cation-anion interactions; Dynamic property; Gas molecules; Local environments; Solvation of ions; Structure and dynamics; System property; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014934198

However, detailed process based investigations are still necessary in order to fully understand how drylands behave and to determine the main factors currently affecting their C balance with the aim of predicting how climate change will affect their structure and functions. Here, we explore the potential biological and non-biological processes that may compose net CO2 exchange in a semiarid grassland in southeast Spain by means of eddy covariance measurements registered over six hydrological years (2009–2015). Results point out the great importance of subterranean ventilation, an advective transport process causing net CO2 release, especially during drought periods and under high-turbulence conditions. Accordingly, extreme CO2 release, far exceeding that found in the literature, was measured over the whole study period (2009–2015) averaging 230 g C m−2 year−1; this occurred mostly during the dry season and was very unlikely to correspond to concurrent biological activity and variations of in situ organic C pools. Underground CO2 concentrations corroborate this finding. In this regard, the potential origins of the released CO2 could be geological degassing and/or subterranean translocation of CO2 in both gaseous and aqueous phases. However, future research is needed in order to understand how CO2 transport and production processes interact and modulate drylands’ terrestrial C balance. Overall, the present study exposes how subterranean ventilation and hydrogeochemistry can complicate the interpretation of the terrestrial C cycle. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Advective transport; Atmospheric pumping; Drought; Eddy covariance; Net CO2 flux; Vadose zone","advection; atmospheric sink; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; drought; eddy covariance; grassland; net ecosystem exchange; semiarid region; subterranean environment; vadose zone; ventilation; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007530417

The aim was to improve the knowledge about emissions from wood burning for residential heating in urban areas based on the collection of citizens’ localized insights. We focus on three main issues: 1) type of dwelling and residential heating source; 2) wood consumption and type of wood appliances; and 3) citizens’ perception of the urban environment. Our study shows the importance of wood burning for residential heating, and of the resulted particle emissions, in Norwegian urban areas. Citizens’ localized insights on environmental perception highlight the areas in the city that require particular attention as part of clean air strategies. Information about environmental perception is combined with existing environmental data showing certain correlation. The results support the urban environmental management based on co-benefit approaches, achieving several outcomes from a single policy measure. Measures to reduce urban air pollution will have a positive impact on the citizens’ environmental perception, and therefore on their quality of life, in addition to reducing the negative consequences of air pollution on human health.

In this study, we use a hybrid epistemological framework that integrates scientifc and local knowledge systems, methodological approaches, and geographic scopes to: 1) shed light on climate change in the equatorial Andes as reported by scientific and local knowledge systems, and 2) understand the role that climate factors play on land use and agricultural change in natural resource dependent communities in the region. We analyzed weather station (n = 5) data and downscaled climate data using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, and spatial analysis techniques to detect spatio-temporal climate trends between 1965 and 2013. We also analyzed climate variability in the past four decades using qualitative information derived from a semi-structured survey (n = 36) and life history smallholder interviews (n = 8) collected in three research sites. Our study reveals significant warming trends in the region which is corroborated by local reports. Precipitation records show high inter-annual variability, with no significant decreasing or increasing trends, which contradicts people's views in two of our research sites. Our study shows that although climate change appears to be a factor that influences farmers’ agricultural and livestock-production practices, other non-climatic forces play a more important role in determining their intensity and adoption.

Here we examine how environment controls the distribution of the neotropical genus Montrichardia at regional and local spatial scales using species distribution models (SDMs) and logistic regression, respectively. Montrichardia is a genus of aquatic macrophytes with two species, Montrichardia linifera and Montrichardia arborescens, and is often an important component of flooded habitats. We find that for each species, altitude, precipitation and temperature of the driest month figure in the best performing SDMs as the most important factors controlling large-scale distributions, suggesting that the range limits of both species are climatically constrained by plant water-energy balance and cold intolerance. At small spatial scales, logistic regression models indicate the species partition types of aquatic habitat along local gradients of water pH, conductivity, and water transparency. In summary, a hierarchy of factors may control Montrichardia distribution from large to small spatial scales. While at large spatial scales, evolutionarily conserved climatic niches may control the range limits of the genus, at small spatial scales niche differentiation allows individual species to grow in environmentally distinct aquatic habitats. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Amazon; Aquatic macrophytes; Maxent; Species distribution modeling; Wetlands","energy balance; geographical distribution; monocotyledon; Neotropical Region; niche breadth; spatial distribution; wetland; Amazon River; Araceae; Montrichardia; Montrichardia arborescens; Montrichardia linifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960099292

Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype × environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory. © The Author 2017.

Urban greening is thought to confer manifold socio-ecological benefits upon residents in towns and cities. Yet proponents of urban greening have seldom considered how people's support for greening policies may be shaped by weather and climate. This paper reports the results of exploratory research examining public expectations of adverse weather changes and people's attitudes toward the functional benefits of urban trees and green space. Results of a questionnaire survey of 800 residents of Hong Kong indicate a positive relationship. Respondents tended to rate functional benefits as more important if they anticipated adverse weather changes in the near future, namely, rising temperatures, more tropical cyclones and prolonged rain. This subjective weather effect is more salient when these weather changes are perceived as a threat to one's daily life. We found urban greenery is assigned a higher value by individuals concerned about exposure and vulnerability to climatic stressors. Affinity for greening appears to be related to how weather and climatic variability is perceived.

Urban agriculture is of great interest because of its potential in reducing the indirect CO2emissions of a city's food supply by reducing transportation distances, the packaging required and the food losses that occur during transportation. However, intensive urban agriculture production, which often relies on the use of soilless substrates, requires synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen, resulting in N2O emissions. Presently, there is a lack of studies that determine the generation of N2O from soilless crops to properly account for their global warming potential. In this study, an open chamber system was used to quantify N2O emissions from lettuce crops with perlite bags as their substrate in a Mediterranean rooftop greenhouse located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). N2O generation, through nitrifying and denitrifying reactions, was limited by assuring an aerobic environment, negligible water retention, the absence of NH3, and controlled dosage of NO3−in the most favorable pH conditions for plant assimilation. The emission factor (EF) measured for the soilless lettuce crop (0.0072–0.0085 kg N2O−1per kg N−1) was half the EF of the IPCC method (0.0125 kg N2O−1per kg N−1) for soil crops, which is commonly used in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to approximate direct N2O emissions, for lack of a better method. Using a more appropriate EF for an LCA study of a tomato crop grown under similar conditions to those used to generate the EF resulted in a 7.5% reduction (0.06 kg CO2eq. per kilogram of tomato production) in total global warming potential. This study shows that soilless crops reduce N2O emissions when compared to conventional crops, making urban agriculture an attractive practice for reducing GHG emissions. The results highlight the need to determine a standard method for determining an EF applicable to soilless protected crops, which, based on the parameters described here, such as the type of substrate, fertilizers and irrigation system, would allow for a more accurate environmental evaluation of soilless conventional and urban crops. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Low carbon food chain; N2O emissions; Nitrogen balance; Roof top greenhouses; Soilless crops; Urban agriculture","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Chains; Chip scale packages; Climate change; Crops; Fertilizers; Food supply; Fruits; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Life cycle; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Population statistics; Substrates; Environmental evaluation; Food chain; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nitrogen balance; Synthetic fertilizers; Transportation distance; Urban agricultures; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015741403

We derive complete travel-activity records of 1,048 residents from an activity diary survey conducted in 2007. Analysis using structural equation models finds that residents living in a neighborhood with higher land use mix, public transit accessibility, and more pedestrian-friendly street design tend to travel in a “low-carbon” manner and emit less CO2 in daily travel, even controlling for residential and travel preferences.

Exposure refers to people, property, systems, or other elements present in hazard zones that are thereby subject to potential losses. Exposure to extreme heat and changes therein are not just determined by climate changes but also population changes. Here we analyze output for three scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and socio-economic growth to estimate future exposure change taking account of both climate and population factors. We find that for the higher emission scenario (RCP8.5-SSP3), the global exposure increases nearly 30-fold by 2100. The average exposure for Africa is over 118 times greater than it has been historically, while the exposure for Europe increases by only a factor of four. Importantly, in the absence of climate change, exposure is reduced by 75-95% globally and across all geographic regions, as compared with exposure under the high emission scenario. Under lower emission scenarios RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP2.6-SSP1, the global exposure is reduced by 65% and 85% respectively, highlighting the efficacy of mitigation efforts in reducing exposure to extreme heat. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Africa; carbon footprint; climate change; economic development; Europe; exposure; heat; human; computer simulation; ecosystem; environmental exposure; population dynamics; Africa; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Environmental Exposure; Europe; Extreme Heat; Humans; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014747130

The smoke plumes originating from these fires increases ambient PM2.5 concentrations and potentially contributes to ozone (O3) exceedances in downwind communities. Source apportionment research using Unmix modeling has been utilized to estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient PM2.5 concentrations. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential correlations between O3 and various sources of PM2.5 that are derived from receptor modeling, and then to specifically estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient O3 concentrations through regression analysis. Various daily meteorological data were used as predictor variables. Multiple regression models were developed for the eight-hour daily maximum O3 as well as the daily contributions of the five PM2.5 source categories that were derived from receptor modeling. Cross correlation was analyzed among residuals of the meteorological regression models for O3 and the daily contributions of the five PM2.5 source categories in order to identify the potential hidden correlation between O3 and PM2.5. The model including effects of meteorological variables and episodic contributions from fire and industrial emissions can explain up to 78% of O3 variability. For non-rainy days in April, the daily average contribution from prescribed rangeland burning to O3 was 1.8 ppb. On 3% of the days in April, prescribed rangeland burning contributed over 12.7 ppb to O3; and on 7% of the days in April, burning contributed more than 7.2 ppb to O3. When the intensive burning activities occur in days with high O3 background due to high solar radiation or O3 carryover from the previous day, the contributions from these episodic fire emissions could result in O3 exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The regression models developed in this study demonstrated that the most valuable predictors for O3 in the Flint Hills region include the O3 level on the previous day, total solar radiation, difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperature, and levels of episodic fire and industrial emissions. The long term goal is to establish an online O3 forecasting tool that can assist regulators and land managers in smoke management during the burning season so that the intensive burning activities can be planned to avoid forecasted high O3 days and thus prevent O3 exceedance. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Forecasting; Prescribed burning; Smoke; Source apportionment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040316189

The total GHG emissions in the waste management sector in China is quite different from that in developed countries, mainly due to the high biodegradable fraction (almost 60–70%) of municipal solid waste (MSW). Based on the above characteristics of MSW and its current and future management strategies, five typical scenarios were modeled by the EaseTech software to compare GHG emissions under different scenarios. These strategies were evaluated by life cycle assessment (LCA) and sensitivity analysis. The two scenarios of landfilling, either with LFG flaring or with LFG to energy, would cause very high GHG emissions (259.5 kgCO2-Eq/t and 169.0 kgCO2-Eq/t, respectively) due to the rapid degradation and low efficiency of landfill gas (LFG) collection. Incineration with energy recovery would lower total GHG emissions (−17.5 kgCO2-Eq/t) substantially. However, the auxiliary fuel needed would offset its environmental benefit. Two scenarios, anaerobic digestion (AD) of the source-separated organic fractions and residue landfilling, and AD of the source-separated organic fractions and incineration of the fractions with high calorific value, followed by residue landfilling, would result in significant carbon sinks (−27.7 kgCO2-Eq/t and −54.8 kgCO2-Eq/t, respectively). From the perspective of GHG emissions reduction, the optimum technical route of MSW in China would be AD of the source-separated organic fractions, incineration of the fractions with high calorific value, followed by residue landfilling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Sensitivity analysis","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Calorific value; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Separation; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Waste management; Biodegradable fraction; Environmental benefits; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High-calorific-value; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management scenarios; Management strategies; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013427606

It can achieve the goal of energy exploitation and CO2 geological sequestration. Taking Zhacanggou as research area, a “Three-spot” well pattern (one injection with two production), “wellbore–reservoir” coupled model is built, and a constant injection rate is set up. A fully coupled wellbore–reservoir simulator—T2Well—is introduced to study the flow mechanism of CO2 working as heat transmission fluid, the variance pattern of each physical field, the influence of CO2 injection rate on heat extraction and the potential and sustainability of heat resource in Guide region. The density profile variance resulting from temperature differences of two wells can help the system achieve “self-circulation” by siphon phenomenon, which is more significant in higher injection rate cases. The density of CO2 is under the effect of both pressure and temperature; moreover, it has a counter effect on temperature and pressure. The feedback makes the flow process in wellbore more complex. In low injection rate scenarios, the temperature has a dominating impact on the fluid density, while in high rate scenario, pressure plays a more important role. In most scenarios, it basically keeps stable during 30-year operation. The decline of production temperature is &lt;5 °C. However, for some high injection rate cases (75 and 100 kg/s), due to the heat depletion in reservoir, there is a dramatic decline for production temperature and heat extraction rate. Therefore, a 50-kg/s CO2 injection rate is more suitable for “Three-spot” well pattern in Guide region. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CO2 geothermal; Flow rate; Zhacanggou","Extraction; Flow rate; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Oil field equipment; Energy exploitation; Geological sequestration; Heat extraction rate; Pressure and temperature; Reservoir simulator; Temperature and pressures; Temperature differences; Zhacanggou; Carbon dioxide; borehole; carbon dioxide; equipment; exploitation; extraction; fluid injection; geothermal energy; geothermal system; heat flow; heat production; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016164347

Predicting future wildfire trends and controlled burned conditions is essential to effective natural resource management, but the associated effects of forest fuel moisture remain uncertain. This study investigates the responses of dead forest fuel moisture to climate change in the continental United States, one of the global regions with frequent wildfire and controlled burning activities. Moisture content was calculated for dead fuels with 1- and 1000-hr lags (MC1 and MC1000) using the algorithms from the U.S. National Fire Danger Rating System. A set of dynamically downscaled regional climate change scenarios provided by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program was used. The present fuel moisture shows large seasonal variations peaked in winter and spatial variability with dominant meridional change in winter and zonal change in summer. Fuel moisture is projected to decrease overwhelmingly across the United States, mainly caused by temperature increases. The largest MC1 decrease of over 1% mainly occurs in the southwestern United States in spring and southeastern United States in summer, while the largest MC1000 decrease of over 1.5% occurs in the southwestern United States in spring and in the southern Plains and eastern United States in summer. The spatial patterns and seasonal variations of future fuel moisture trends, however, vary considerably with regional climate change scenarios. The drying fuel trends suggest that frequency, size, and intensity of wildfires would increase and prescribed burning windows would decrease in the future in the Southwest and the inter-mountains during spring and the Rocky Mountains during summer if other fuel conditions remain the same. These results highlight the general vulnerability of semiarid forests to drying fuels trends. Published 2016.

In the experiment, the premixed ratio (PR), injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate were varied with the pressure rise rate below 10 bar/crank angle. The experimental results showed that higher PR and earlier injection timing resulted in advanced combustion phasing and improved thermal efficiency, while the pressure rise rates and NOx emissions increased. Besides, a lowest ISFC of 176 g/kWh (corresponding to IMEP =7.24 bar) was obtained, and the soot emissions could be controlled below 0.6 FSN. Despite that NOx emission was effectively reduced with the increase of EGR, HC and CO emissions were high. However, it showed that GCI combustion of this work was sensitive to EGR, which may restrict its future practical application. For modelling investigation, the primary reference fuel (92% isooctane and 8% n-heptane, PRF92) was used as a surrogate of commercial RON92 gasoline fuel for combustion prediction. The combustion and emission characteristics were reasonably predicted. Control parameters, including premixed ratio, injection timing and EGR rate on the GCI combustion process were further elucidated. It demonstrated that the GCI combustion was initiated by the spray periphery near the cylinder bowl. NOx was mainly formed in the spray periphery rather than the homogeneous region, while soot was formed in the downstream of the spray.

This study reviews the status and major knowledge gaps in the interactions of land and atmospheric changes and present 11 grand challenge areas for the scientific research and adaptation community in the coming decade. These land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC)-related areas include 1) impacts on weather and climate, 2) carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, 3) biospheric emissions, 4) the water cycle, 5) agriculture, 6) urbanization, 7) acclimation of biogeochemical processes to climate change, 8) plant migration, 9) land-use projections, 10) model and data uncertainties, and, finally, 11) adaptation strategies. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of LCLUC on local to global climate and weather systems, but these putative effects vary greatly in magnitude and even sign across space, time, and scale and thus remain highly uncertain. At the same time, many challenges exist toward improved understanding of the consequences of atmospheric and climate change on land process dynamics and services. Future effort must improve the understanding of the scale-dependent, multifaceted perturbations and feedbacks between land and climate changes in both reality and models. To this end, one critical cross-disciplinary need is to systematically quantify and better understand measurement and model uncertainties. Finally, LCLUC mitigation and adaptation assessments must be strengthened to identify implementation barriers, evaluate and prioritize opportunities, and examine how decisionmaking processes work in specific contexts. © 2017, American Meteorological Society.

Here we conducted time series measurements of total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a well-studied coastal aquifer (Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA). Groundwater samples were collected monthly from May 2009 to June 2010 across the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the Waquoit Bay (WB) STE. The concentrations of both TAlk and DIC in zero-salinity groundwater were variable, but were lower than those in the bay water (S ∼ 28). DIC underwent slightly non-conservative mixing between low and intermediate salinities while there was an apparent additional DIC source at high salinity (&gt;20) in all seasons. TAlk concentrations exhibited even stronger variations, with evidence of both production and consumption in high salinity zones, and consistent TAlk consumption at intermediate salinity in summer and fall (June–December, 2009). The increases in DIC and TAlk at high salinity were attributed to aerobic respiration and denitrification in WB sediments during bay water recharge of the STE. We infer that the loss of TAlk at intermediate salinity reflects H+ production as reduced compounds (e.g. Fe2+) are oxidized within the STE. In terms of impacts on surface water inorganic carbon budgets, the SGD-derived DIC flux was mainly controlled by seasonal changes in SGD while a combination of TAlk concentration variability and SGD drove the TAlk flux. SGD-derived DIC, aqueous CO2, and H+ fluxes to the bay were ∼40–50% higher in summer vs. in winter, a result of enhanced marine groundwater flux and significant TAlk removal (proton addition) during periods of high seawater intrusion. Furthermore, the SGD-derived DIC flux was consistently greater than TAlk flux regardless of season, indicating that SGD serves to reduce the CO2 buffering capacity of surface water. Our results highlight the importance of seasonality and subsurface biogeochemical processes on the subterranean estuary carbonate system and the resulting impact on SGD-derived TAlk, DIC, aqueous CO2, and H+ fluxes to the coastal ocean. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alkalinity; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Groundwater; Ocean acidification; Subterranean estuary","alkalinity; biogeochemistry; carbonate system; coastal aquifer; dissolved inorganic carbon; estuary; groundwater; ocean acidification; subterranean environment; Massachusetts; United States; Waquoit Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013975859

Sulfate (e.g., gypsum) application can reduce CH4 emissions up to 70%. However, the effect of gypsum application on propionate degradation and the microbial communities involved are not well understood. Therefore, we studied propionate-dependent sulfate reduction in anoxic microcosms of paddy soils from Italy and the Philippines, combining 16S rRNA and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrB) gene profiling and co-occurrence network analysis. Sulfate was stoichiometrically reduced in treatments with propionate addition, while CH4 production was partially suppressed. Methane production but not sulfate reduction were suppressed and acetate accumulated after addition of methyl fluoride or fluoroacetate. With methyl fluoride in the presence of sulfate, the accumulated acetate was consumed after the depletion of propionate. Simultaneously, the relative abundances of Syntrophobacteraceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were significantly enhanced, while fluoroacetate repressed Desulfobulbaceae in both soils. Syntrophobacter 16S rRNA and dsrB gene copy numbers were also remarkably increased with gypsum amendment. Network analysis of both 16S rRNA and dsrB genes illustrated a strong co-occurrence of operational taxonomic units belonging to Syntrophobacteraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Desulfobulbaceae. In summary, Syntrophobacteraceae affiliated species were identified as the major propionate-dependent sulfate reducers in paddy soil. They (together with Desulfobulbaceae) oxidized propionate directly to acetate and CO2, or coupled the oxidation syntrophically to H2/formate-utilizing Desulfovibrionaceae.

Little is known, however, about how AM fungus community composition responds to slope aspect. Our objective was to compare the AM fungus communities between sunny and shady slopes and to detect factors that influenced the distributions of AM fungi in arid ecosystems of the Daqingshan Mountains, Inner Mongolia, North China. AM fungus communities were evaluated based on small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSUs) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. AM fungus community composition differed significantly between slope aspects, and sunny slopes had significantly higher AM fungus diversity and richness as well as spore density, total root colonization, arbuscule abundance, vesicle abundance, and hyphal colonization than shady slopes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) illustrated that the effects of slope aspect on AM fungus richness likely were mediated by available phosphorus, soil organic carbon, plant cover, and plant diversity. Available phosphorus was the principal factor that influenced AM fungus species richness, and soil organic carbon was the principal factor influencing spore density and total root colonization, suggesting that these factors especially might be responsible for differences between the AM fungus communities of different slope aspects. These findings elucidate the influence of slope aspect on AM fungus communities and may inform use of AM fungi in protection and restoration of vegetation with different slope aspects in arid ecosystems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi; Community composition; Driving factors; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; Slope aspect","arbuscular mycorrhiza; arid environment; colonization; fungus; genetic analysis; microbial community; organic carbon; soil organic matter; species diversity; species richness; symbiosis; China; Nei Monggol; Fungi; fungal RNA; phosphorus; ribosome RNA; soil; biodiversity; chemistry; China; classification; genetics; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; plant root; Poaceae; procedures; sequence analysis; soil; symbiosis; theoretical model; Biodiversity; China; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Models, Theoretical; Mycorrhizae; Phosphorus; Plant Roots; Poaceae; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Ribosomal; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994796845

Marginal emission abatement cost curves are simulated based on the environmental performance and marginal emission abatement costs measured in a set of parametric directional output distance functions with multi-inputs and multi-outputs. Further, the proposed model is applied to empirically investigate the optimal carbon emission quota allocation for China's building construction industry among thirty-three provinces in three different regions. The results indicate that the relatively developed eastern region in China has higher marginal emission abatement cost and can be imposed with more emission quotas, while the central and western regions can undertake more emission reduction. Approximately 74 million RMB can be saved by implementing the optimal emission allocation (proposed in this paper) as compared to a uniform emission quota allocation. The findings are of great theoretical, methodological, and practical significance for policymakers and social science researchers in terms of climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building construction; Carbon emissions; Environmental performance; Marginal emission abatement cost; Quota allocation","Climate change; Construction; Construction industry; Costs; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Nonlinear programming; Building construction; Carbon emissions; Emission abatement; Environmental performance; Quota allocation; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015729529

However, the responses of soil CH4 emissions to these factors and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of land-use conversion from paddies to orchards and fertilization on soil CH4 fluxes, and the abundance and community compositions of methanogens and methanotrophs. Soil CH4 fluxes were quantified by static chamber and gas chromatography technology. Abundance and community structures of methanogens and methanotrophs (based on mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), cloning and sequence analysis, respectively. Results showed that land-use conversion from paddies to orchards dramatically decreased soil CH4 fluxes, whereas fertilization did not distinctly affect soil CH4 fluxes. Furthermore, abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs were decreased after converting paddies to orchards. Fertilization decreased the abundance of these microorganisms, but the values were not statistically significant. Moreover, land-use conversion had fatal effects on some members of the methanogenic archaea (Methanoregula and Methanosaeta), increased type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis and Methylosinus), and decreased type I methanotrophs (Methylobacter and Methylococcus). However, fertilization could only significantly affect type I methanotrophs in the orchard plots. In addition, CH4 fluxes from paddy soils were positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon contents and methanogens abundance, whereas CH4 fluxes in orchard plots were negatively related to methanotroph abundance. Therefore, our results suggested that land-use conversion from paddies to orchards could change the abundance and community compositions of methanogens and methanotrophs, and ultimately alter the soil CH4 fluxes. Overall, our study shed insight on the underlying mechanisms of how land-use conversion from paddies to orchards decreased CH4 emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CH4 fluxes; Fertilization; Land-use conversion; Methanogens; Methanotrophs","abundance; agricultural emission; dissolved organic carbon; land use change; methane; methanogenic bacterium; orchard; paddy field; red soil; soil microorganism; China; Methanosaeta; Methylobacter; Methylococcaceae; Methylococcus; Methylocystaceae; Methylocystis; Methylosinus; fertilizer; methane; soil; archaeon; bacterial gene; chemistry; China; classification; genetics; growth, development and aging; Methylococcaceae; microbiology; Oryza; restriction fragment length polymorphism; soil; Archaea; China; Fertilizers; Genes, Bacterial; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Oryza; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013040537

Vitreous carbon is used for validation of the micro-mechanical measurements. Filter graphite is a single phase material with ∼52 vol% porosity. Gilsocarbon graphite is a nuclear-grade graphite that is currently used in the advanced gas-cooled reactors in the UK with ∼20 vol% porosity in the filler particles and matrix; Pile Grade-A graphite (PGA) was extracted from a fuel brick within a Magnox reactor core with 15% weight loss due to neutron irradiation and CO2 radiolytic oxidation. The ‘true’ material properties obtained at micro-scale are found to be of much higher value than those measured at the macro-scale due to different failure controlling mechanisms. In particular for the PGA graphite, the micro-mechanical tests allowed the mechanical properties of the filler particles and matrix to be measured separately. The filler particles showed a higher stiffness and flexural strength compared with the matrix indicating the different influence of neutron irradiation on these two constituents.

This is achieved by developing a code based on the Java language, which converts the typical four-dimensional structure (spatial and temporal dependency) of data results in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format. The visualization techniques most often used are revisited and implemented into the conversion tool. The potential of the tool is demonstrated in a case study of smog formation due to an intense traffic emission in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). It is shown that the Google Earth can provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly means of data representation. This feature can be very useful for visualization of pollution at street levels, which is of great importance for the city residents.

Generally, effects of minerals are partially thought to result from improvement of microbial metabolism, but their influence on the rumen microbiota has rarely been documented to date. In this study, we investigated the response of microbiota to mineral salt in heifer and adult cows and evaluated ruminal fermentation and enteric methane emissions of cows fed mineral salts. Twelve lactating Holstein cows and twelve heifers fed a total mixed ration (TMR) diet were randomly allocated into two groups, respectively: a treatment group comprising half of the adults and heifers that were fed mineral salt and a control group containing the other half fed a diet with no mineral salt supplement. Enteric methane emissions were reduced by 9.6% (P < 0.05) in adults ingesting a mineral salt diet, while concentrations of ruminal ammonia, butyrate, and propionate were increased to a significant extent (P < 0.05). Enteric methane emissions were also reduced in heifers ingesting a mineral salt diet, but not to a significant extent (P > 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were not significantly altered in heifers (P > 0.05). Based on these results, we performed high-throughput sequencing to explore the bacterial and archaeal communities of the rumen samples. Succiniclasticum and Prevotella, two propionate-producing bacteria, were predominant in samples of both adults and heifers. At the phylotype level, mineral salt intake led to a significant shift from Succiniclasticum to Prevotella and Prevotellaceae populations in adults. In contrast, reduced abundance of Succiniclasticum and Prevotella phylotypes was observed, with no marked shift in propionate-producing bacteria in heifers. Methanogenic archaea were not significantly abundant between groups, either in adult cows or heifers. The shift of Succiniclasticum to Prevotella and Prevotellaceae in adults suggests a response of microbiota to mineral salt that contributes to higher propionate production, which competes for hydrogen utilized by methanogens. Our data collectively indicate that a mineral salt diet can alter interactions of bacterial taxa that result in enteric methane reduction, and this effect is also influenced in an age-dependent manner. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Enteric methane; High-throughput sequencing; Methanogenic archaea; Mineral salt; Rumen microbiota; VFAs","ammonia; butyric acid derivative; inorganic salt; methane; mineral; propionic acid derivative; trace element; animal; Bacteroides; bovine; dietary supplement; drug effects; female; fermentation; Firmicutes; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; Prevotella; rumen; Ammonia; Animals; Bacteroides; Butyrates; Cattle; Dietary Supplements; Female; Fermentation; Firmicutes; Methane; Microbiota; Minerals; Prevotella; Propionates; Rumen; Salts; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001560558

Assessment of meteorological drought risk with the index of crop water deficit (CWD) can help in determining appropriate adaptation strategies to counter such losses. Using daily weather data from 68 stations in Northeast China (NEC) for 1961-2010, the spatial and temporal behaviour of CWD was assessed and the sensitivity of climatic variables related to CWD during the potential growth period of maize was explored. The results indicated that the potential maize growth period decreased by 26 days due to climate warming. The deficit (i.e. a negative value for water demand) decreased from east to west and decreased gradually during 1978-1984 and sharply during 2000-2010. It is noteworthy that NEC experienced severe droughts especially in the 1970s and the 2000s, and relative humidity was the most sensitive parameter affecting evapotranspiration. Regions in the middle of Heilongjiang and Jilin should take precautions concerning climate change effects on CWD, while the northern part of NEC should take precautions concerning changes in temperature and sunshine hours. Growing late-maturing and drought-tolerant maize varieties is therefore a good option for higher production in NEC, coupled with enhancing the availability of water in this limited-rainfall region, and should form a part of the strategy to cope with climate change. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.",,"agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; drought; growth response; maize; relative humidity; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature; water availability; water use; China; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984697989

These include the Pobeda field in the Kara Sea (338 billion m3 of gas, &gt;100 million tons of oil), the Velikoe field in the Astrakhan region (90 billion m3 of gas, 300 million tons of oil), and the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan (the world’s second largest, after North Dome). There have also been a number of oil and gas finds in East Africa. All of those corroborate the idea of the Ural–African transcontinental oil and gas belt being a planetary structure hosting unique hydrocarbon concentrations. Analysis of the belt’s metallogeny shows that large and super-large deposits of metallic and nonmetallic minerals are concentrated in an axial zone, highlighting the large-scale redistribution of energy and matter in the Earth’s crust and mantle. These processes are most active in the rift structure where they come together to form the Ural–African transcontinental oil and gas belt. The process that formed the recently identified hydrocarbon deposits within the modern rift structure—the East African Rift system—can be seen as an embryonic stage in formation of oil–gas accumulations. The East African Rift petroleum discoveries are characterized by the continuous flow of hydrocarbons and its short-term residence in local traps. This makes finding major hydrocarbon deposits there unlikely. The potential for large deposits is more likely where large accumulations of hydrocarbons are overlapped by later sedimentary strata, a situation seen offshore of East Africa. © 2016, The Author(s).","Oil and gas bearing; Oil- and gas-bearing prospects; Rifting; The Ural–African transcontinental oil and gas belt","Deposits; Gas bearings; Gases; Geologic models; Hydrocarbons; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Offshore petroleum prospecting; East African Rift; Hydrocarbon deposits; Hydrocarbon fields; Hydrocarbon potential; Nonmetallic minerals; Oil and gas; Rifting; Sedimentary strata; Petroleum deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013296073

This synthesis was made possible by a recent series of methane emission measurement campaigns that focused on the natural gas supply chain, production through distribution. The new data were translated to a standard basis, augmented with other data sources as needed, and simulated using a Monte Carlo-enabled, life cycle model. Gathering facilities and production pneumatics are the top methane emission reduction opportunities for the natural gas sector, but there are knowledge gaps and sources of uncertainty that merit further research. In particular, “unassigned” emissions that were measured at the site level, as opposed to component-level emissions measured directly at the device level, account for 19% of supply chain methane emissions. By definition, unassigned emissions cannot be attributed to specific emission sources, and the current data do not provide insight into how they vary geographically.

Biochars may be beneficial for plant production, nutrient uptake and greenhouse gas mitigation. Biochar properties vary widely and are known to be highly dependent on feedstocks, but their effects on planted forest ecosystem are elusive. This study investigated the effects of chicken manure biochar, sawdust biochar and their feedstocks on 2-year-old Pinus elliottii growth, fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE), soil N2O and CH4 emissions, and C storage in an acidic forest soil in a subtropical area of China for one year. The soil was mixed with materials in a total of 8 treatments: non-amended control (CK); sawdust at 2.16 kg m−2 (SD); chicken manure at 1.26 kg m−2 (CM); sawdust biochar at 2.4 kg m−2 (SDB); chicken manure biochar at 2.4 kg m−2 (CMB); 15N-fertilizer alone (10.23 atom% 15N) (NF); sawdust biochar at 2.4 kg m−2 plus 15N-fertilizer (SDBN) and chicken manure biochar at 2.4 kg m−2 plus 15N-fertilizer (CMBN). Results showed that the CMB treatment increased P. elliottii net primary production (aboveground biomass plus litterfall) and annual net C fixation (ANCF) by about 180% and 157%, respectively, while the the SDB treatment had little effect on P. elliottii growth. The 15N stable isotope labelling technique revealed that fertilizer NUE was 22.7% in CK, 25.5% in the NF treatment, and 37.0% in the CMB treatment. Chicken manure biochar significantly increased soil pH, total N, total P, total K, available P and available K. Only 2% of the N in chicken manure biochar was available to the tree. The soil N2O emission and CH4 uptake showed no significant differences among the treatments. The apparent C losses from the SD and CM treatments were 35% and 61%, respectively; while those from the CMB and SDB treatments were negligible. These demonstrated that it is crucial to consider biochar properties while evaluating their effects on plant growth and C sequestration. © 2017 Soil Science Society of China","15N-fertilizer application; biochar properties; C sequestration; emissions of greenhouse gases; planted forest; soil fertility","biogenic material; carbon sequestration; charcoal; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; forest soil; greenhouse gas; growth; manure; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; plantation forestry; soil degradation; soil emission; soil fertility; subtropical region; yield; China; Pinus elliottii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014410362

One way to reduce these hazardous emissions is to reduce the amount of fuel consumed by on-road vehicles. In this research, we consider both vehicle design and driver behavior as crucial elements in evaluating the environmental impact of two-wheel vehicles. Any redesign of vehicle specifications, results in different driving patterns that need to be re-evaluated in a realistic environment with traffic simulation. Therefore we developed traffic simulations with mixed fleets to model scooter/driver behaviors to reflect urban driving scenarios. Based on the results, a 31-variable continuous variable transmission (CVT) design and a 14-parameter cellular automata traffic model are integrated. Simultaneous redesign of CVT with traffic simulation can reduce the fuel consumption by 16.2% in our case study. This promising outcome demonstrates the need for multi-discipline integration of real-world traffic impact assessments and improvements. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.","Continuous variable transmission; fuel consumption; traffic model; vehicle design","Air quality; Behavioral research; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Variable speed transmissions; Continuous variable transmissions; Hazardous emissions; Realistic environments; Traffic impact assessment; Traffic model; Traffic simulations; Vehicle design; Vehicle specification; Vehicle transmissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016274345

The three laying-hen houses were conventional cage (CC), enriched colony (EC), and aviary (AV). The houses held a nominal number of 200,000, 46,700, and 50,000 Lohmann LSL lite layers, respectively. The manure collected on belts in each house was cleaned out twice a week. A fraction of the cleaned out manure was transferred to designated storage rooms wherein losses of different components were determined in two storage events. Manure was loaded into the storage rooms over 171 days during the first storage event and over 185 days during the second storage event. The total storage periods were 202 and 245 days, respectively, for the first and second storage events. Manure was weighed, sampled, and analyzed before it was loaded into the storage rooms and at the end of each storage event. Mass balance calculations were used to determine the losses of different components. Statistical analyses show that the nutrient contents, on a wet basis, of manure loaded in CC, AV, and EC storage rooms were significantly different due to the differences in manure moisture contents. However, on a dry basis, they had no significant differences. The fresh manure cleaned out from the EC layer house was drier than that from the other two houses. Loaded-in nitrogen losses in the CC, AV, and EC storage rooms were 24.6, 12.9, and 20.8%, respectively. Nitrogen losses depended on house temperature, manure moisture, and pH. The average losses of loaded-in manure mass, moisture, and total solids during the two storage events were 27.6 ± 1.9, 33.8 ± 8.3, and 20.8 ± 7.0%, respectively. The losses of N, P, K, C, and S were 19.4 ± 13.4, 11.7 ± 5.6, 10.2 ± 6.8, 27.0 ± 6.5, and 8.3 ± 8.5% of their loaded-in amounts, respectively. The total loss of N, P, K, C, and S was 56% of the total loaded-in solids loss; thereof, the loss of N, P, and K was 7%, and C loss was 48%. The laying-hen-specific losses of N, P, K, C, and S were 0.34, 0.05, 0.08, 3.2 and 0.019 g day−1hen−1, respectively. The results of this research are important for assessing impacts of stored manure on environment and nutrient losses.

We examine these conjoined processes with observations and global chemistry-climate model (GFDLAM3) hindcasts over 1980-2014. The model captures the salient features of observed trends in daily maximum 8 h average O3: (1) increases over East Asia (up to 2 ppb yr-1), (2) springtime increases at western US (WUS) rural sites (0.2-0.5 ppb yr-1/ with a baseline sampling approach, and (3) summertime decreases, largest at the 95th percentile, and wintertime increases in the 50th to 5th percentiles over the eastern US (EUS). Asian NOx emissions have tripled since 1990, contributing as much as 65% to modeled springtime background O3 increases (0.3-0.5 ppb yr-1/ over the WUS, outpacing O3 decreases attained via 50% US NOx emission controls. Methane increases over this period contribute only 15% of the WUS background O3 increase. Springtime O3 observed in Denver has increased at a rate similar to remote rural sites. During summer, increasing Asian emissions approximately offset the benefits of US emission reductions, leading to weak or insignificant observed O3 trends at WUS rural sites. Mean springtime WUS O3 is projected to increase by ∼10 ppb from 2010 to 2030 under the RCP8.5 global change scenario. While historical wildfire emissions can enhance summertime monthly mean O3 at individual sites by 2-8 ppb, high temperatures and the associated buildup of O3 produced from regional anthropogenic emissions contribute most to elevating observed summertime O3 throughout the USA. GFDL-AM3 captures the observed interannual variability of summertime EUS O3. However, O3 deposition sink to vegetation must be reduced by 35% for the model to accurately simulate observed high-O3 anomalies during the severe drought of 1988. Regional NOx reductions alleviated the O3 buildup during the recent heat waves of 2011 and 2012 relative to earlier heat waves (e.g., 1988, 1999). The O3 decreases driven by NOx controls were more pronounced in the southeastern US, where the seasonal onset of biogenic isoprene emissions and NOx -sensitive O3 production occurs earlier than in the northeast. Without emission controls, the 95th percentile summertime O3 in the EUS would have increased by 0.2-0.4 ppb yr-1 over 1988-2014 due to more frequent hot extremes and rising biogenic isoprene emissions. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; climate modeling; emission; extreme event; human activity; methane; ozone; summer; trend analysis; wildfire; Colorado; Denver; Far East; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014519871

To promote the development of green building, it is necessary to analyze driving factors and contribution through the analysis for relationship between regional economy and green building. Therefore, based on the system dynamic(SD) theory, this paper constructs the structure model of the stock flow diagram, including the regional economic subsystem, social subsystem, government support subsystem and green building subsystem. Among the model, Guangdong province, as the most prosperous province of economic development with the largest numbers of certified green buildings in China, has been chosen to show the influence level of their relationship. Through simulation, results can be easily shown that development of GB can make contributions to the field of local economy, however, also be limited by the regional condition, including policy incentive, regional economic, technological, etc. We can also find that direct contribution to the GDP the Green Building made can reach about 2.47 %0, and 9.23 %0 indirectly. If the current level of regional production is stable, it can be found that each additional 10,000 square meters of green area building may produce about ¥018.2 million for economy. On the contrary, that the regional economy investment in fixed assets increased by ¥1 million can stimulate 0.001648 million square meter demand of GB.

First, both were created independently as two self-contained legal regimes. Second, these regimes may potentially conflict with each other because climate change measures may violate the GATT/WTO rules. Third, if policies and measures are tailored well, the GATT/WTO and climate change legal regimes could be implemented simultaneously. Last, a shift to low carbon economy presses for close cooperation and mutual supportiveness between these two legal regimes. However, the multinational nature of these two legal regimes often delay or hamper global consensus on agenda for cooperation.

In this work, we established multiple scenarios to evaluate the impacts of land use change, population growth, carbon emission per capita, and carbon markets on carbon budget. We quantified carbon sinks (aboveground and belowground) under different scenarios, using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model, and studied carbon sources caused by human activities by analyzing the spatial distribution of human population and carbon emission per capita. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using NPV model. Our results indicate that the carbon budget of Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region is surplus: Carbon sinks range from 1.50 × 1010 to 1.54 × 1010 t, while carbon sources caused by human activities range from 2.76 × 105 to 7.60 × 105 t. And the NPV for carbon deficits range from 3.20 × 1011 RMB to 1.52 × 1012 RMB. From the perspective of ecological management, deforestation, urban sprawl, population growth, and excessive carbon consumption are considered as the main challenges in balancing carbon sources and sinks.

The CH4 and N2O fluxes are mediated by methanogens and methanotrophs, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in composting manure, respectively, while these specific bacterial functional groups may interplay in CH4 and N2O emissions during manure composting. To test the hypothesis that bacterial functional gene abundances regulate greenhouse gas fluxes in windrow composting systems, CH4 and N2O fluxes were simultaneously measured using the chamber method, and molecular techniques were used to quantify the abundances of CH4-related functional genes (mcrA and pmoA genes) and N2O-related functional genes (amoA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB, and nosZ genes). The results indicate that changes in interacting physicochemical parameters in the pile shaped the dynamics of bacterial functional gene abundances. The CH4 and N2O fluxes were correlated with abundances of specific compositional genes in bacterial community. The stepwise regression statistics selected pile temperature, mcrA and NH4+ together as the best predictors for CH4 fluxes, and the model integrating nirK, nosZ with pmoA gene abundances can almost fully explain the dynamics of N2O fluxes over windrow composting. The simulated models were tested against measurements in paddy rice cropping systems, indicating that the models can also be applicable to predicting the response of CH4 and N2O fluxes to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and rising temperature.

Our model is based on a given level of primary energy consumption, economic growth and natural gas consumption in the US, from 1990 to 2015. Our results indicate that a long-running equilibrium relationship exists between carbon emissions and four other variables. According to the variance decomposition of carbon dioxide emissions, the use of primary energy has a positive and notable influence on CO2 emissions, compared to other variables. From the Impulse Response Function (IRF) results, we find that the use of renewable energy would remarkably reduce carbon emissions, despite leading to an increase in emissions in the early stages. Natural gas consumption will have a negative impact on CO2 emissions in the beginning, but will have only a modest impact on carbon emission reductions in the long run. Finally, our study indicates that the use of renewable forms of energy is an effective solution to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

In recent years, urban air pollution has been a serious environmental issue in Chinese cities that often hits news headlines in China and abroad. Based on the most recent data available, this paper employs two indices to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of some major air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), zone (O3), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), in China’s major cities and city regions. The results show that these pollutants display distinct spatial and seasonal variations. Overall, air pollution is much more serious in northern parts of the country, especially in large cities and a few major urban agglomerations, but we also find concentrations of air pollutants in urban agglomerations in southern China. Seasonally, Chinese cities suffer from air pollution especially PM2.5pollution most in winter while summer is the cleanest season for most cities. Regional variations exist in composition of leading air pollutants and in influencing factors. Meteorological factors, such as wind speed, precipitation, temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity, often have important impacts on PM2.5concentration, though their specific contributions vary across different cities. We argue that effective air pollution control policies should be regional in nature, but cross-border cooperation between regional and local governments is essential in order to tackle the problem of air pollution more effectively. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Air pollution; China; Cities; PM2.5; Spatial and temporal variations","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur dioxide; Wind; China; Cities; Environmental issues; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological factors; PM2.5; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatial and temporal variation; Air pollution control; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; spatial variation; sulfur dioxide; temporal variation; urban pollution; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air pressure; air temperature; Article; China; concentration (parameters); environmental impact; humidity; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; precipitation; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; urban area; wind; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012193832

By combining these two technologies, vehicles may achieve excellent performances in terms of dynamic, economy, environmental friendliness, safety, and comfort. Hence, a smart hybrid electric vehicle (s-HEV) is selected as a platform in this paper to study a car-following process with optimizing the fuel consumption. The whole process is a multi-objective optimal problem, whose optimal solution is not just adding an energy management strategy (EMS) to an adaptive cruise control (ACC), but a deep fusion of these two methods. The problem has more restricted conditions, optimal objectives, and system states, which may result in larger computing burden. Therefore, a novel fuel consumption optimization algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed and some search skills are adopted in receding horizon optimization to reduce computing burden.

Researchers have been dedicated to the reduction of soot and NO emissions. Thus, an advance combustion regime, i.e. reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), was proposed to mitigate the formation of these emissions. In this study, the dynamic ϕ-T (equivalence ratio vs. temperature) map analysis was applied to visualise the combustion processes associated with the in-cylinder temperature and equivalence ratio in an RCCI engine. Therefore, the soot and NO emissions can be efficiently reduced by controlling the combustion process out of the emissions islands on the ϕ-T map. This analysis method employs KIVA4-CHEMKIN and SENKIN code to construct ϕ-T maps under various conditions. To find out the significant parameters of controlling combustion process and emissions formation, four parameters were taken into consideration in a natural gas (NG) and diesel fuelled RCCI engine: NG percentage, the first start of injection (SOI) timing, split fraction of diesel and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate. Each parameter was varied at three levels. Finally, the ϕ-T maps and final soot and NO emissions were compared among varied conditions for each parameter. It is found that the increased NG percentage can significantly reduce soot because of the absence of C-C bond in NG and the reduced diesel fuel impingement on the surface of the piston or cylinder wall. Increasing EGR can decrease the peak combustion temperature due to the dilution effect and thermal effect, consequently maintaining RCCI at low temperature combustion region. This study also indicates that dynamic ϕ-T map analysis is efficient at manipulating the combustion process to mitigate the soot and NO emissions formation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emissions reduction; KIVA modelling; natural gas; RCCI combustion; ϕ-T map analysis","Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dust; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fits and tolerances; Gas emissions; Ignition; Natural gas; Reduction; Soot; Temperature; Combustion temperatures; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Cylinder temperatures; Emissions reduction; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Low temperature combustion; Map analysis; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988556879

Among the CO2 emission sources, construction and building related activities consume a considerable amount of energy and produce a significant volume of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This paper proposes an integrated simulation and optimization approach to reducing CO2 emissions from the on-site construction process, which consists of three main steps: (i) construction process simulation, (ii) CO2 emission quantification, and (iii) labour allocation optimization. The construction process is simulated utilizing a discrete-event simulation (DES) platform, Simphony.NET, in order to quantify and analyze the amount of CO2 emissions produced by the construction process. Based on the simulation model, the crew sizes for labour-intensive activities are analyzed and optimized with respect to CO2 emissions, with a genetic algorithm (GA) employed as the method of optimization. The integrated simulation and optimization approach is capable of reducing CO2 emission through (i) the choice of the start-date of the construction, and (ii) labour allocation optimization. A case study in Edmonton, Canada, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that the total measured CO2 emissions from on-site construction can be reduced by 21.7% in winter by optimizing labour allocation.

Dynamically downscaled data were applied to simulate extreme typhoon precipitation events for facilitating future preparation efforts (2075–2099) under climate change conditions. Models were used to simulate possible impacts in upstream and downstream areas for basinwide disaster loss assessment purposes. The Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability and FLO-2D models were applied to simulate slope-land disaster impacts and sediment volume in the upstream area. The sediment delivery ratio was used to calculate the valid sediment amount delivered downstream and the riverbed uplift altitude. SOBEK was used to build a flood impact model for the Kaoping River basin, and the model was used to simulate potential flooding caused by future extreme typhoon events. The Taiwan Typhoon Loss Assessment System established by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction was used to evaluate the potential loss associated with extreme events. The property loss calculation included 32 land-use categories, including agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry losses; industrial and commercial service losses; public building losses; and traffic and hydraulic facility losses. One of the Kaoping River basin townships, Daliao District, had the highest flood depth increase ratio (12.6%), and the losses were 1.5 times the original situation. This was much worse than were the losses suffered during Typhoon Morakot. These results also show that sediment delivered from the upstream areas had a significant influence on the downstream areas. This is a critical issue for future flood mitigation under climate change conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Extreme climate; FLO-2D; Loss assessment; SOBEK; TLAS; TRIGRS","climate change; climate effect; disaster management; flood control; flooding; sediment transport; typhoon; Gaoping Basin; Taiwan; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007508370

The nature of this excursion remains enigmatic given the difficulties of interpreting a perceived extreme global decrease in the δ13C of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon. Here, we present carbonate and organic carbon isotope (δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) records from the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation along a proximal-to-distal transect across the Yangtze Platform of South China as a test of the spatial variation of the SE. Contrary to expectations, our results show that the magnitude and morphology of this excursion and its relationship with coexisting δ13Corg are highly heterogeneous across the platform. Integrated geochemical, mineralogical, petrographic, and stratigraphic evidence indicates that the SE is a primary marine signature. Data compilations demonstrate that the SE was also accompanied globally by parallel negative shifts of δ34S of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and increased 87Sr/86Sr ratio and coastal CAS concentration, suggesting elevated continental weathering and coastal marine sulfate concentration during the SE. In light of these observations, we propose a heterogeneous oxidation model to explain the high spatial heterogeneity of the SE and coexisting δ13Corg records of the Doushantuo, with likely relevance to the SE in other regions. In this model, we infer continued marine redox stratification through the SE but with increased availability of oxidants (e.g., O2 and sulfate) limited to marginal near-surface marine environments. Oxidation of limited spatiotemporal extent provides a mechanism to drive heterogeneous oxidation of subsurface reduced carbon mostly in shelf areas. Regardless of the mechanism driving the SE, future models must consider the evidence for spatial heterogeneity in δ13C presented in this study. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Doushantuo Formation; Ediacaran carbon cycle; Shuram excursion; spatial heterogeneity; surface-ocean oxygenation","carbon cycle; carbon isotope; Ediacaran; heterogeneity; inorganic carbon; organic carbon; oxidation; oxygenation; redox conditions; seawater; spatial variation; stratification; weathering; China; Doushantuo Basin; Guizhou; Yangtze Platform; carbon; carbon cycle; chemistry; China; fossil; sediment; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Isotopes; China; Fossils; Geologic Sediments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007350314

The dwell times of different macromolecular structural or functional states, correlated with characteristic fluorescence intensities, are extracted from the images and combined into dwell time distributions that are fitted by kinetic functions to extract corresponding rate constants. The frame rate of the camera limits the time resolution of the experiment and thus the fastest rate processes that can be reliably detected and quantified. However, including the influence of discrete sampling (framing) on the detected time series in the fitted model enables rate processes near to the frame rate to be reliably estimated. This influence, similar to the instrument response function in other types of instruments, such as pulsed emission decay fluorometers, is easily incorporated into the fitted model.

Increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources, are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence.

We consider such planets in their habitable zone, so that their outermost condensed mantle is a global, deep, liquid ocean. For these ocean planets, we investigate potential internal reservoirs of CO2, the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean for the various saturation conditions encountered, and the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux of CO2. We find that, in a steady state, the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere has two possible states. When wind-driven circulation is the dominant CO2 exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of tens of bars of CO2 results, where the exact value depends on the subtropical ocean surface temperature and the deep ocean temperature. When sea-ice formation, acting on these planets as a CO2 deposition mechanism, is the dominant exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of a few bars of CO2 is established. The exact value depends on the subpolar surface temperature. Our results suggest the possibility of a negative feedback mechanism, unique to water planets, where a reduction in the subpolar temperature drives more CO2 into the atmosphere to increase the greenhouse effect. © 2017.

CO2) concentration, and atmospheric pollutants will impact carbon sequestration in forested ecosystems. Although the individual roles of these environmental factors on tree growth are understood, analyses examining their simultaneous effects are lacking. We used tree-ring isotopic data and structural equation modeling to examine the concurrent and interacting effects of water availability, atm. CO2 concentration, and SO 4 and nitrogen deposition on two broadleaf tree species in a temperate mesic forest in the northeastern US. Water availability was the strongest driver of gas exchange and tree growth. Wetter conditions since the 1980s have enhanced stomatal conductance, photosynthetic assimilation rates and, to a lesser extent, tree radial growth. Increased water availability seemingly overrides responses to reduced acid deposition, CO2 fertilization, and nitrogen deposition. Our results indicate that water availability as a driver of ecosystem productivity in mesic temperate forests is not adequately represented in DGVMs, while CO2 fertilization is likely overrepresented.

Integrated Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) systems, where drainage water generated from higher-valued crops grown on high quality soils are used to irrigate salt-tolerant crops grown on marginal soils, is one possible strategy for managing salinity and drainage problems. If the IFDM crop were a biofuel crop, both environmental and private benefits may be generated; however, little is known about this possibility. As such, we develop a bioeconomic programming model of irrigated agricultural production to examine the role salt-tolerant biofuel crops might play within an IFDM system. Our results, generated by optimizing profits over land, water, and crop choice decisions subject to resource constraints, suggest that based on the private profits alone, biofuel crops can be a competitive alternative to the common practices of land retirement and nonbiofuel crop production under both low to high drainage water salinity. Yet IFDM biofuel crop production generates 30–35% fewer GHG emissions than the other strategies. The private market competitiveness coupled with the public good benefits may justify policy changes encouraging the growth of IFDM biofuel crops in arid agricultural areas globally. © 2017.

Here we use two largely independent data sets of cloud and surface downwelling radiation observations derived by satellite remote sensing (2007–2010) to evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over both polar ice sheets and oceans in state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalyses (ERA-Interim and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications-2) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model ensemble. First, we show that, compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Energy Balanced and Filled, CloudSat-CALIPSO better represents cloud liquid and ice water path over high latitudes, owing to its recent explicit determination of cloud phase that will be part of its new R05 release. The reanalyses and climate models disagree widely on the amount of cloud liquid and ice in the polar regions. Compared to the observations, we find significant but inconsistent biases in the model simulations of cloud liquid and ice water, as well as in the downwelling radiation components. The CMIP5 models display a wide range of cloud characteristics of the polar regions, especially with regard to cloud liquid water, limiting the representativeness of the multimodel mean. A few CMIP5 models (CNRM, GISS, GFDL, and IPSL_CM5b) clearly outperform the others, which enhances credibility in their projected future cloud and radiation changes over high latitudes. Given the rapid changes in polar regions and global feedbacks involved, future climate model developments should target improved representation of polar clouds.

Stop-start technology is widespread in Europe due to high fuel prices and due to stringent EU CO2 emissions standards beginning in 2012. Stop-start has recently appeared as a standard equipment option on high-volume vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Chrysler 200, Jeep Cherokee, and Ram 1500 truck. EPA has included stop-start technology in its assessment of CO2-reducing technologies available for compliance with the standards. Simulation and modeling of this technology requires a suitable model of the battery. The introduction of stop-start has stimulated development of 12-volt battery systems capable of providing the enhanced performance and cycle life durability that it requires. Much of this activity has involved advanced lithium-ion chemistries, variations of lead-acid chemistries, such as absorbed-glass-mat (AGM) designs, and lead-carbon formulations. EPA tested several AGM batteries that are used in OEM start-stop systems. The purpose of this testing was to develop an equivalent circuit model for integration into EPA's ALPHA vehicle simulation model. Testing was performed at the Battery Test Facility (BTF) at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Duracell batteries referenced are model number SLI49AGM with a rating of 92 Ah and the X2 Power batteries referenced are model number SLI34-78AGMDP with a rating of 68 Ah. Both batteries are 6 cell 12 volt using AGM technology. For compatibility with the voltage specifications of the BTF equipment, tests were performed on two batteries connected in series (nominal 24 volts). This paper presents the development and validation of the lead-acid battery model. The battery model is a standard equivalent circuit model with two Resistance-Capacitance (RC) blocks. Resistances and capacitances were calculated using test data from a Duracell 92Ah lead-acid battery which is aftermarket equipment for the Chevrolet Malibu. The lead-acid battery library in the ALPHA model was validated with data obtained from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) from their chassis dynamometer testing of the 2010 Mazda 3 Hatchback i-Stop [9] and 2010 VW Golf TDI Diesel Bluemotion [10]. The simulated battery voltages, currents, and state of charge (SOC) are in excellent agreement with the vehicle test data on a number of drive schedules. © null.",,"Battery management systems; Capacitance; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Circuit simulation; Digital storage; Dynamometers; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Equivalent circuits; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integration testing; Lithium-ion batteries; Regulatory compliance; Test facilities; Vehicles; Verification; Argonne National Laboratory; Chassis dynamometer testing; Equivalent circuit model; Modeling and validation; Reducing co2 emissions; Resistance capacitance; Simulation and modeling; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018440378

First, a compact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on vehicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1×12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100×100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio measurements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of -12 to 226CO2 ha-1 h-1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 25.9 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 28.76 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R2 = 0:53 in summer and R2 = 0:47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within ±1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerodynamic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerodynamics; building; carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; emission; emission inventory; energy use; map; mixing ratio; monitoring system; sensor; spatial resolution; transect; urban atmosphere; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014540009

This may create a market opportunity for cost-effective fuels in the light distillate range if they can be burned as efficiently and cleanly as diesel fuel. In this study, the emission performance of a low cetane number, low research octane number naphtha (CN 34, RON 56) was examined on a production 6-cylinder heavy-duty on-highway truck engine and aftertreatment system. Using only production hardware, both the engine-out and tailpipe emissions were examined during the heavy-duty emission testing cycles using naphtha and ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuels. Without any modifications to the hardware and software, the tailpipe emissions were comparable when using either naphtha or ULSD on the heavy duty test cycles. Overall lower CO2 emissions and fuel consumption were measured for naphtha due in part to its higher heating value and higher hydrogen to carbon ratio. Engine-out and tailpipe NOx emissions were lower for naphtha, and measured PM emissions were also lower due to naphtha's higher volatility and lower aromatic content compared to ULSD. To help assess the potential impact on diesel particulate filter design and operation, engine-out PM samples were collected and characterized at a steady-state mid-speed, mid-load operating point. A significant reduction in elemental carbon in PM samples was observed for naphtha fuel, and similar oxidation rates and peak oxidation temperatures were measured for the PM from both fuels.

We conducted a DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment to elucidate the bacterial community assimilating 13-carbon (13C) derived from plant residue under an anoxic soil condition. In addition, we compared the bacterial community with that under the oxic soil condition, which was elucidated in our previous study (Lee et al. in Soil Biol Biochem 43:814–822, 2011). Materials and methods: We used the 13C-labeled dried rice callus cells as a model of rice plant residue. A paddy field soil was incubated with unlabeled and 13C-labeled callus cells. DNA extracted from the soils was subjected to buoyant density gradient centrifugation to fractionate 13C-enriched DNA. Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16S rDNA band patterns and band sequencing method were used to evaluate bacterial community. Results and discussion: DGGE analysis showed that the band patterns in the 13C-enriched fractions were distinctly changed over time, while the changes in the community structure before fractionation were minor. Sequencing of the 13C-labeled DGGE bands revealed that Clostridia were a major group in the bacterial communities incorporating the callus-derived carbon although Gram-negative bacteria, and Actinobacteria also participated in the carbon flow from the callus under the anoxic condition. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and Actinobacteria increased on 14 days after the onset of incubation, suggesting that the callus was decomposed by diverse bacterial members on this phase. When the bacterial groups incorporating the 13C were compared between under anoxic and oxic soil conditions, the composition was largely different under the two opposite conditions. However, some members of Gram-negative bacteria were commonly found under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions. Conclusions: The majority of bacterial members assimilating the callus carbon was Clostridia in the soil under anoxic conditions. However, several Gram-negative bacterial members, such as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, also participated in the decomposition of callus under anoxic soil conditions. Our study showed that carbon flow into the diverse bacterial members during the callus decomposition and the distinctiveness of the bacterial communities was formed under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Clostridia; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis; Paddy field soil; Rice callus; Soil oxygen condition","anoxic conditions; bacterium; community structure; decomposition; DNA; electrokinesis; genetic analysis; microbial community; oxygen; plant residue; rhizosphere; soil fertility; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Clostridia; Negibacteria; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001560603

Based on field observations of the ore textures, breccias, and the sandstone host rocks, the ores formed in a dome that was created by the diapiric migration of evaporites in the Lanping Basin during Paleogene deformation and thrust loading. Most of the ore occurs in sandstones that are interpreted to be a former evaporite glacier containing a mélange of extruded diapiric material, including breccias, fluidized sand, and evaporites that mixed with sediment from a fluvial sandstone system. A pre-ore hydrocarbon and reduced sulfur reservoir formed in the evaporite glacier that became the chemical sink for Zn and Pb in a crustal-derived metalliferous fluid. In stark contrast to previous models, the Jinding deposit does not define a unique class of ore deposits; rather, it should be classified as MVT sub-type hosted in a diapiric environment. Given that Jinding is a world-class ore body, this new interpretation elevates the exploration potential for Zn–Pb deposit in other diapir regions in the world. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; Diapir; Evaporite; Jinding; Mississippi Valley-Type; Sandstone-hosted ore; Zinc–lead deposits","diapir; dome; evaporite; lead; ore deposit; zinc; China; Lanping Basin; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976505801

Rising atmospheric CO2 has the potential to fundamentally alter plant responses to waterlogging by altering gas exchange rates and stoichiometry, modifying growth, and shifting resource-economic trade-offs to favor different ecological strategies. While plant responses to waterlogging and elevated CO2 individually are relatively well characterized, few studies have asked how the effects of waterlogging might be mediated by atmospheric CO2 concentration. We investigated interactive effects of elevated (550 ppm) atmospheric CO2 and waterlogging on gas exchange, biomass accumulation and allocation, and functional traits for juveniles of three woody riparian tree species. In particular, we were interested in whether elevated CO2 mitigated growth reduction under waterlogging, and whether this response was sustained following a refractory “recovery” period during which soils were re-aerated. We found species-specific effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration and waterlogging status on growth, gas exchange, and functional traits between species, and no evidence for a general effect of elevated CO2 in mediating plant responses to flooding. For one specie, Casuarina cunninghamiana, elevated CO2 substantially increased growth, but this effect was entirely removed by waterlogging, and there was no recovery following a refractory period. Differential responses to combined waterlogging and elevated CO2 among species may result in compositional changes to riparian plant communities and associated changes in ecosystem functioning.

In this study, we apply these guidelines to soybean produced in 2010 in order to complement more traditional soybean LCAs with mid- and end-point impact assessment on biodiversity, erosion potential, water purification, groundwater recharge, biotic production and climate regulation potential in each of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. In addition to providing regionalized characterization factors of land transformation and occupation in both Mato Grosso biomes, we estimate that one tonne of soybean produced in 2010 in the Amazon had greater impacts than when produced in the Cerrado. For the Amazon, total land transformation and occupation damage was estimated at 532 ton−1and 260 ton−1respectively, with estimates of 231 ton−1and 153 ton−1for the Cerrado. The largest contributors to these damage estimates came from the change in mechanical filtration properties of the soil followed by the land's climate regulation and biotic production potentials. The impact allocation to pasture as a transitional landscape in the establishment of cropland onto natural ecosystems diminished the soybean contribution through allocation of pasture to the beef production system, further adding to the land sparing argument for future cropland expansion in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Land use change; Life cycle assessment; Mato Grosso; Soybean","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Economics; Employment; Groundwater; Land use; Life cycle; Produced Water; Recharging (underground waters); Remote sensing; Brazil; Land-use change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mato Grosso; Soybean; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015726723

We analysed information on biochar research in Poland alongside lessons learned elsewhere in order to identify the significant opportunities and risks associated with biochar use. This data fed into a GIS-based multicriteria analysis to identify areas where biochar application could deliver greatest benefit. We found that 21.8% of agricultural land in Poland has at least moderate indication for biochar use (soil organic matter below 2% and pH below 5.5), while 1.5% was categorized as a priority as it also exhibited contamination. Potential barriers identified included biomass availability and associated risks of indirect land-use change due to possible national and transnational biomass production displacement. Biochar use could have positive global consequences as a climate change mitigation strategy, particularly relevant in a country with limited alternatives. Scaling up a mitigation technology that is viable on account of its co-benefits might be cost-effective, which could, in turn, adjust national perspectives and stronger involvement in developing mitigation policies at the regional level. Biochar has much promise in temperate conditions and further research should therefore be assigned to explore biochar’s environmental and socio-economic impacts. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by VGTU Press and Informa UK Limited, [trading as Taylor & Francis Group].","biochar; carbon sequestration; GIS-based multicriteria analysis; land remediation; sustainable agricultural production","Agriculture; Carbon; Decision making; Decision theory; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Remediation; Bio chars; Carbon sequestration; Land remediation; Multi Criteria Analysis; Sustainable agricultural; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018443125

This paper investigates an annually-laminated (varved) record from the western Canadian Arctic and finds that the varves are negatively correlated with both the instrumental Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the past century and also with reconstructed PDO over the past 700 years, suggesting drier Arctic conditions during high-PDO phases, and vice versa. These results are in agreement with known regional teleconnections, whereby the PDO is negatively and positively correlated with summer precipitation and mean sea level pressure respectively. This pattern is also evident during the positive phase of the North Pacific Index (NPI) in autumn. Reduced sea-ice cover during summer-Autumn is observed in the region during PDOĝ' (NPI+) and is associated with low-level southerly winds that originate from the northernmost Pacific across the Bering Strait and can reach as far as the western Canadian Arctic. These climate anomalies are associated with the PDOĝ' (NPI+) phase and are key factors in enhancing evaporation and subsequent precipitation in this region of the Arctic. Collectively, the sedimentary evidence suggests that North Pacific climate variability has been a persistent regulator of the regional climate in the western Canadian Arctic. Since projected sea-ice loss will contribute to enhanced future warming in the Arctic, future negative phases of the PDO (or NPI+) will likely act to amplify this positive feedback.",,"air-sea interaction; climate feedback; climate variation; decadal variation; evapotranspiration; global climate; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sea ice; sea level pressure; teleconnection; Bering Strait; Canada; Canadian Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018639523

In autarky, the (equivalent) pollution tax is set equal to the marginal damage from own emissions. If the strategic policy instrument is a tax, leakage occurs under trade and tends to lower the tax. The net terms of trade effect, due to the exportable and importable varieties of the differentiated good, tends to increase the tax. We derive conditions under which pollution taxes under trade are higher than the marginal damage from own emissions, i.e., higher than the Pigouvian tax and than that under autarky. Then, pollution falls under trade relative to autarky. When countries use quotas/permits to regulate pollution, there is no leakage, while the net terms of trade effect tends to make pollution policy stricter. The equivalent tax is always higher than the marginal damage from own emissions, i.e., always higher than the Pigouvian tax and than that under autarky; hence, pollution always falls under trade.

The effects of climate warming on forage plant growth are expected to be larger at the Arctic breeding grounds than in temperate wintering grounds, potentially disrupting this green wave and causing waterfowl to mistime their arrival on the breeding grounds. We studied the potential effect of climate warming on timing of food peaks along the migratory flyway of the Russian population of barnacle geese using a warming experiment with open-top chambers. We measured the effect of 1.0–1.7°C experimental warming on forage plant biomass and nitrogen concentration at three sites along the migratory flyway (temperate wintering site, temperate spring stopover site, and Arctic breeding site) during 2 months for two consecutive years. We found that experimental warming increased biomass accumulation and sped up the decline in nitrogen concentration of forage plants at the Arctic breeding site but not at temperate wintering and stop-over sites. Increasing spring temperatures in the Arctic will thus shorten the food peak of nitrogen-rich forage at the breeding grounds. Our results further suggest an advance of the local food peak in the Arctic under 1–2°C climate warming, which will likely cause migrating geese to mistime their arrival at the breeding grounds, particularly considering the Arctic warms faster than the temperate regions. The combination of a shorter food peak and mistimed arrival is likely to decrease goose reproductive success under climate warming by reducing growth and survival of goslings after hatching. © 2017 The Authors.

With the wide-area “Stripe 82X” survey (∼31 deg2), we are discovering the rare, high-luminosity, high-redshift population missed in smaller area surveys, in a legacy field with a rich investment of multiwavelength coverage necessary for characterizing the X-ray sources detected. Though this survey will provide much insight into the growth of black holes and their co-evolution with their host galaxies, more area is needed to uncover a statistical sampling of the most distant active galactic nucleus (AGN; z &gt; 3) at the highest luminosities and search for signatures of direct-collapse super-massive black holes in the unresolved X-ray emission. Such a program will require a large investment of XMM-Newton observing time, which is a challenge in the current time allocation landscape. Indeed, challenges for both XMM-Newton and the next generation of telescopes in the coming decade include accommodating large time requests for observations necessary for advancing the field, devising best effort practices for the next generation of multiwavelength missions to efficiently return the best science in datasets orders of magnitude larger than what we have now (which can be informed by lessons learned from current XMM-Newton programs); and making ancillary value-added data products available to the community to truly harness the power of what X-rays and XMM-Newton has to offer. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the resultant changes in root dynamics, plant composition and soil carbon have not been completely evaluated, casting doubt on the ecological viability of this method. In this study, the fine root dynamics and soil organic carbon (SOC) of two land-use types, Caragana microphylla shrubland (CM-shrubland) and a natural restoration steppe (NR-steppe) in northwest China were compared. Fine root biomass and production of CM-shrubland were lower by 65.7% and 43.9%, respectively, than those in the NR-steppe, in soil depths down to 80 cm. Herbaceous fine roots in the CM-shrubland had the fastest turnover and decomposition rates, followed by herbaceous plants in the NR-steppe, and then by C. microphylla. Differences in SOC stocks between land-use types (including a decrease in the shrubland compared to the steppe) were reflected in the heavy fraction of SOC storage in the subsoil layer (60–80 cm), rather than in total and heavy fraction of SOC in the top soil layer (0–60 cm). Surprisingly, the light fraction of SOC increased slightly (8.7%) after C. microphylla introduction. Thus, changes in fine root dynamics contributed to differences in SOC and its fractions between the CM-shrubland and NR-steppe. These patterns suggest that, in terms of soil C sequestration, shrub restoration might not be an effective choice for land degradation control. Instead, a moderately protected steppe is a better approach for ecological restoration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon turnover; Decomposition; Fractions; Litter input; Minirhizotron","Decomposition; Dynamics; Ecology; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Restoration; Carbon turnover; Ecological restoration; Fractions; Land degradation control; Litter input; Minirhizotrons; Natural restoration; Vegetation restoration; Soils; biological method; carbon sequestration; decomposition; desertification; fine root; fractionation; herb; land degradation; leaf litter; organic carbon; phytomass; restoration ecology; shrub; soil carbon; steppe; turnover; vegetation dynamics; China; Caragana microphylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008625233

Therefore, the objectives of this study were i) to analyse the on-farm effects of different nitrogen fertilization sources on soil respiration, ii) to explore the effect of fertilization on soil respiration sensitivity to soil temperature (T) and iii) to assess the effect of the different fertilization regimes on the soil C balance. We hypothesized that i) the soil CO2 emission dynamics in Mediterranean irrigated cropping systems were mainly affected by fertilization management and T and ii) fertilization affected the soil C budget via different C inputs and CO2 efflux. Four fertilization systems (farmyard manure, cattle slurry, cattle slurry + mineral, and mineral) were compared in a double-crop rotation based on silage maize (Zea mays L.) and a mixture of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and oats (Avena sativa L.). The research was performed in the dairy district of Arborea, in the coastal zone of Sardinia (Italy), from May 2011 to May 2012. The soil was a Psammentic Palexeralfs with a sandy texture (940 g sand kg− 1). The soil total respiration (SR), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), T and soil water content (SWC) were simultaneously measured in situ. The soil C balance was computed considering the Rh C losses and the soil C inputs from fertilizer and crop residues. The results showed that the maximum soil CO2 emission rates soon after the application of organic fertilizer reached values up to 12 μmol m− 2 s− 1. On average, the manure fertilizer showed significantly higher CO2 emissions, which resulted in a negative annual C balance (− 2.9 t ha− 1). T also affected the soil respiration temporal dynamics during the summer, consistently with results obtained in other temperate climatic regions that are characterized by wet summers and contrary to results from rainfed Mediterranean systems where the summer SR and Rh are constrained by the low SWC. The sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature significantly increased with C input from fertilizer. In conclusion, this research supported the hypotheses tested. Furthermore, the results indicated that i) soil CO2 efflux was significantly affected by fertilization management and T, and ii) fertilization with manure increased the soil respiration and resulted in a significantly negative soil C budget. This latter finding could be primarily explained by a reduction in productivity and, consequently, in crop residue with organic fertilization alone as compared to mineral, by the favourable SWC and T for mineralization, and by the sandy soil texture, which hindered the formation of macroaggregates and hence soil C stabilization, making fertilizer organic inputs highly susceptible to mineralization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; C turnover; GHG emission; Microbial activity; Soil moisture","agronomy; biomass; carbon balance; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cereal; crop residue; crop rotation; double cropping; fertilizer application; grass; greenhouse gas; in situ measurement; maize; microbial activity; sandy soil; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil water; Arborea; Italy; Mediterranean Region; Oristano; Sardinia; Avena; Avena sativa; Bos; Lolium multiflorum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007327933

Aim of the work is to highlight differences in attainable GHG reduction by adopting a PHEV instead of a conventional vehicle (CV) for different driving patterns obtained from real-world sub-populations of vehicles. Modeling of the equivalent GHG for a trip made by a PHEV can be challenging since it not only depends on the vehicle design and driving pattern of the trip in question, but also on: i) all electric range (AER) of the PHEV, ii) ""well to tank"" (W2T) equivalent GHG of the electricity used to charge the battery, as well as, iii) battery depletion in previous trips since the last charging event. To overcome some of these modeling challenges, previous work on an energy re-allocation model for the estimation of GHG equivalent of different charging behaviors is adopted. Full set of recorded vehicle trips in CHTS (approx. 65 thousand trips) are analyzed for two PHEV models (short and long AER), for different charging behaviors and grid conditions. Comparisons are made for GHG reduction if the same trips were done by an equivalent-sized CV, for different sub-populations of vehicles ranging from ""more city-like"" driving patterns to ""less city-like"". Results show that certain sub-populations of vehicles could reduce their GHG by 1.7 to 3 times more than other sub-populations. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Charging (batteries); Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Surveys; Vehicle-to-grid; Allocation model; Charging behaviors; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas reductions; Household travel surveys; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Simulation-based modeling; Sub-populations; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018409772

This limits the control action, as we rely on emissions breakthrough at the HEGO sensor to infer the state of catalyst. In order to robustly meet the super ultra-low emission regulations, a more precise TWC control around the oxidation level of catalyst is desirable. In this work, we developed a comprehensive set of models to predict the oxygen storage capacity using measured in-vehicle signals only. This is accomplished by developing three models; the first model is a linear in parameter regression model to predict the feed gas emissions from measured signals like engine speed and air-to-fuel ratio (A/F). The second model is a low-dimensional physics based model of the three-way catalyst to predict the exhaust emissions and oxidation state of the catalyst. The third model computes the tailpipe A/F as a function of the exhaust emissions. These models were implemented and validated in vehicle using a rapid prototyping tool such as ATI NoHooks and validated over multiple FTP cycles and road tests. Finally, these models were used to design an outer-loop catalyst control (proportional-integral (PI) controller with an anti-windup loop) designed to achieve the desired fractional oxidation state (FOS) or the oxygen storage level. The experimental results confirm that the system is controllable and show improvement in catalyst control by reducing tail pipe emissions compared to current production strategy.

As this arrangement relies on proper participatory conditions in order to include all relevant stakeholders, input legitimacy is crucial to achieving legitimate outcomes. However, ‘stakeholding’ implies that actors—recast into a specific institutional context—are sorted into new formal or informal categories. This paper scrutinizes the clean development mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol to interrogate the problematic issue of ‘stakeholding’—i.e. the ‘sorting’ of actors—in enacting the multi-stakeholder framework. Based on an analysis of 25 CDM projects that provides insight into the widest range of participation opportunities for civil society regarding specific projects, this paper considers how certain institutional context of the Mechanism’s stakeholder framework affects the involvement of civil society actors and the implications of this for balanced and fair input legitimacy. The findings suggest that, in practice, the informal corporate-induced sorting of actors into internal and external stakeholders keeps civil society actors outside the CDM’s inner circle, forcing them to voice their concerns regarding specific projects via CDM insiders or through irregular channels. Furthermore, the absence of a clear definition of stakeholder in local consultations results in the inclusion of unsorted actors, destabilizing the distribution of participation opportunities. The paper concludes that recasting the deliberative principles of openness and plurality into the CDM’s corporate-inspired stakeholding creates a specific institutional context that imposes more than one set of perhaps incompatible stakeholder categories while impairing input legitimacy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Civil society; Clean development mechanism; Climate policy; Global environmental governance; Input legitimacy; Stakeholder","civil society; clean development mechanism; environmental policy; global change; governance approach; local participation; public-private partnership; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946882023

All models show that the regression pattern of tropics-wide Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies onto the tropical South Atlantic index correlates well with that in observations, even though with varying spatial standard deviations. However, only about half of the 32 models considered show the correct sign of rainfall response over India to a warm anomaly in the south tropical Atlantic, which is a reduction of rainfall. On the other hand, models generally do show large-scale responses broadly consistent with the observations, and the signal over India depends on relatively subtle changes in the response. This response to a tropical South Atlantic warm (cold) anomaly is a low-level quadrupole in stream function with an anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly over the Arabian Sea and India. This anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly leads to a weakening (strengthening) of the Somali jet and low-level divergence (convergence) over India, both inducing a reduction (an increase) of Indian rainfall. The models which do not show the correct rainfall response over India also show a response similar to the one indicated above, but with maximum of the anticyclonic (cyclonic) response shifted to the western Pacific. The large-scale Walker circulation adjustment to the tropical South Atlantic SST anomalies is identified as one of the factors which account for the differences in the low-level stream-function response. Models (and the observations) with the correct sign of the rainfall signal over India show the dominant upper-level convergence (divergence) as response to a warm (cold) tropical South Atlantic in the western Pacific region, whereas models with the wrong sign of the rainfall signal show it predominantly in the central-eastern Pacific. The fact that such relatively subtle changes in the response lead to a reversal of the rainfall signal over India raises the question about the robustness of the tropical South Atlantic–Indian monsoon teleconnection. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","CMIP5; Indian monsoon; teleconnection; tropical Atlantic SST variability","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Fighter aircraft; Rain; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Tropics; Wind effects; CMIP5; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Indian monsoon; Indian summer monsoon; Standard deviation; Teleconnections; Tropical atlantic; Walker circulation; Oceanography; air-sea interaction; anticyclone; climate modeling; convergence; jet flow; monsoon; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; Walker circulation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); India; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019615419

Methods A cross-sectional study undertaken in a steel industry in a city nicknamed “Steel City” in Southern India assessed thermal stress by wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and level of dehydration from urine color and urine specific gravity. A structured questionnaire captured self-reported heat-related health symptoms of workers. Results Some 90% WBGT measurements were higher than recommended threshold limit values (27.2–41.7°C) for heavy and moderate workloads and radiational heat from processes were very high in blooming-mill/coke-oven (67.6°C globe temperature). Widespread heat-related health concerns were prevalent among workers, including excessive sweating, fatigue, and tiredness reported by 50% workers. Productivity loss was significantly reported high in workers with direct heat exposures compared to those with indirect heat exposures (χ2 = 26.1258, degrees of freedom = 1, p &lt; 0.001). Change in urine color was 7.4 times higher among workers exposed to WBGTs above threshold limit values (TLVs). Conclusion Preliminary evidence shows that high heat exposures and heavy workload adversely affect the workers’ health and reduce their work capacities. Health and productivity risks in developing tropical country work settings can be further aggravated by the predicted temperature rise due to climate change, without appropriate interventions. Apart from industries enhancing welfare facilities and designing control interventions, further physiological studies with a seasonal approach and interventional studies are needed to strengthen evidence for developing comprehensive policies to protect workers employed in high heat industries. © 2016 The Authors","climate change; health risks; occupational heat stress; productivity loss; steel industry","adult; Article; cross-sectional study; fatigue; health impact assessment; heat stress; human; hyperhidrosis; India; iron and steel industry; job stress; male; productivity; structured questionnaire; temperature; thermal exposure; urine color; wet bulb globe temperature; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007608329

Technologies that impact vehicle cabin heating in cold weather conditions and cabin cooling in warm weather conditions were evaluated. Tests included thermal transient and steady-state periods for all technologies, including the development of a new test methodology to evaluate the performance of occupant thermal conditioning. Heated surfaces demonstrated significant reductions in energy use from steady-state heating, including a 29%-59% reduction from heated surfaces.

Unfortunately, ASE thresholds of such crystals are typically more than one order of magnitude higher (in the range of tens of kW cm−2) as compared to those of amorphous neat/doped films. Here, this issue is addressed by rationally designing bifluorene-based compounds to express weak intermolecular coupling in the crystalline phase. The twisted molecular backbone as well as out-of-plane twisted dimethyl moieties attached at the fluorene end-groups additionally benefit with enhanced electron–vibronic coupling resulting in a large Stokes shift (0.5 eV) and reduced reabsorption of emission. Endowed with such features the bifluorenes exhibit similarly high radiative decay rates (≈1.5 × 109 s−1) when doped in polystyrene matrix at low concentrations and in sublimation-grown single crystals. The high radiative rates accompanied by excellent waveguiding properties, favorable orientation of transition dipole moments as well as non-overlapping excited-state absorption and gain regions enable achieving extremely low ASE thresholds (≈700 W cm−2) in the bifluorene single crystals. The achieved low threshold encourages employment of rationally designed molecules in organic crystals for lasing applications. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In order to describe the knock resistance of NG, the Methane Number (MN) has been introduced. The lowest MN which generally can be found in any NG is 65, and the vast majority of NG (∼ 99.8%) is delivered with a MN above 70. The MN of bio-methane and power-to-gas methane is usually far above 80. Thus, from an automotive point of view any methane fuel should at least provide a minimum Methane Number of 70 at any point of sale. But the European draft standard describing the automotive CNG fuel quality so far proposes a minimum MN limit of 65. Therefore the efficiency difference caused by a MN reduction from 70 to 65 is of considerable interest for future NG (methane fuel) standardization. In order to investigate the MN effect on the efficiency and CO2 emissions of a dedicated future NG passenger car engine, a workhorse engine with increased combustion pressure capability and increased CR was designed and built. Steady state engine dynamometer testing was performed with different NG fuel qualities (different MN) within the framework of the European research project ""GasOn"" supported by the European Commission. The engine data and CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) analysis were used to determine the efficiency and CO2 impact of a Methane Number reduction. A reduction from MN 69 to 64 leads to an efficiency reduction of approximately 0.3 % for an engine with small cylinder bore (71.9mm). Larger efficiency reductions will occur for engines with larger cylinder bores, and for future engines with higher boost levels and/or higher compression ratios.

The economic capture approach is promoted by international organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). This paper will inquire as to how forest protection is related to issues of social and ecological justice, exploring whether forest exploitation based on the top-down managerial model fosters an unequitable distribution of resources. Both top-down and community-based approaches to forest protection will be critically examined and a more inclusive ethical framework to forest protection will be offered. The findings of this examination indicate the need for a renewed focus on existing examples of good practice in addressing both social and ecological need, as well as the necessity to address the less comfortable problem of where compromise appears less possible.

Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically. © 2016, The Author(s).","Circular economy; City Blueprints; HABITAT III; Smart cities; Sustainability transitions; Urban Agenda; Water governance capacities","adaptive management; climate change; economic development; flooding; infrastructure planning; maintenance; public health; urban planning; urbanization; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; Africa; Asia; Eastern Europe; Latin America; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014496079

Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit - the amount of moisture in the air relative to its potential maximum - can govern stomatal closure, which reduces plant carbon uptake. However, plants vary in the degree to which they regulate their stomata - and in association, xylem conductance - in response to increasing aridity: isohydric plants exert tight regulation of stomata and the water content of the plant, whereas anisohydric plants do not. Here we use remote-sensing data sets of anisohydricity and vegetation greenness to show that productivity in United States grasslands - especially anisohydric ones - is far more sensitive to variations in vapour pressure deficit than to variations in precipitation. Anisohydric ecosystem productivity is over three times more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit than isohydric ecosystem productivity. The precipitation sensitivity of summer productivity increases with anisohydricity only for the most anisohydric ecosystems. We conclude that increases in vapour pressure deficit rather than changes in precipitation - both of which are expected impacts of climate change - will be a dominant influence on future grassland productivity. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Reducing deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, asking households to reduce deforestation means asking them to sacrifice direct benefits from forests, such as energy resources. The REDD+ programme provides a way to compensate households. This study estimates households’ willingness to accept forest-use restrictions governing participation in the REDD+ programme and its determinants. The results show that households would participate in REDD+ if the programme were to compensate them with an average of USD 2072 per year. The determinants of willingness to participate are analysed using the Heckman sample selection model. The results reveal that awareness about REDD+ economic incentives, and that deforestation and forest degradation is not good for the environment, and the increased time spent collecting the most important forest products increased probability of household participation. Households that earned more from forest products demanded greater compensation to participate. The results further revealed that, once a household is aware of the programme and its incentives and decides to participate, it tended to demand less compensation. The Government of Tanzania is advised to (i) collect baseline data in order to differentiate incentives for households depending on their forest reliance, (ii) educate people about the relationship between REDD+ and climate change to increase the cooperation of the communities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon dioxide emission; climate change mitigation; deforestation and forest degradation; economic incentives; Heckman's procedure; REDD+","adaptive management; carbon dioxide; climate change; compensation system; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; greenhouse gas; household survey; incentive; participatory approach; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962575053

Due to this monitoring of forest above ground biomass (as carbon can be calculated as 0.47 part of total biomass) has become very important. Forest above ground biomass as being the major portion of total forest biomass should be given a very careful consideration in its estimation. It is hoped to be useful in addressing the ongoing problems of deforestation and degradation and to gain carbon mitigation benefits through mechanisms like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Many methods of above ground biomass estimation are in used ranging from use of optical remote sensing imageries of very high to very low resolution to SAR data and LIDAR. This paper describes a multi-scale approach for assessing forest above ground biomass, and ultimately carbon stocks, using very high imageries, open source medium resolution and medium resolution satellite datasets with a very limited number of field plots. We found this method is one of the most promising method for forest above ground biomass estimation with higher accuracy and low cost budget. Pilot study was conducted in Chitwan district of Nepal on the estimation of biomass using this technique. The GeoEye-1 (0.5m), Landsat (30m) and Google Earth (GE) images were used remote sensing imageries. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification technique was done on Geo-eye imagery for the tree crown delineation at the watershed level. After then, crown projection area (CPA) vs. biomass model was developed and validated at the watershed level. Open source GE imageries were used to calculate the CPA and biomass from virtual plots at district level. Using data mining technique, different parameters from Landsat imageries along with the virtual sample biomass were used for upscaling biomass estimation at district level. We found, this approach can considerably reduce field data requirements for estimation of biomass and carbon in comparison with inventory methods based on enumeration of all trees in a plot.

Empowering local communities as central partners in conservation and climate-change mitigation has allowed many people to gain access to land and citizenship rights but has provided limited improvements in access to social services and economic opportunities even as expectation about their role as environmental stewards grows. These expectations, however, are inconsistent with reality. We conducted multiple field studies in Brazil since the mid-1980s to illustrate the discrepancies between conservation programs and local conditions and expectations. We suggest that public policies and conservation programs should not delegate responsibility for managing protected areas to local and indigenous communities without considering local needs and expectations and locals’ attitudes toward conservation. In other words, behavior that maintains or improves the environment should not be treated as traditional based on the expectations of outsiders. Framing local populations as traditional environmentalists creates contradictions and frustrations for local populations and for conservation professionals and policy makers. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology","administración ambiental; citizenship; ciudadanía; environmental stewardship; indigenous peoples; inequidades sociales; poblaciones tradicionales; políticas socio-ambientales; pueblos indígenas; social inequities; social-environmental policies; traditional populations","climate change; conservation planning; environmental policy; equity; indigenous population; land rights; protected area; resource depletion; social behavior; Brazil; agriculture; attitude; Brazil; environmental protection; human; population group; Agriculture; Attitude; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Population Groups",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006952488

Current emissions regulations for hydrocarbons can be difficult to meet in-cylinder and thus after treatment technologies such as oxidation catalysts are typically used, which can be costly. In this work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are combined with engine experiments in an effort to build an understanding of hydrocarbon sources. In the experiments, the combustion system design was varied through injector style, injector rate shape, combustion chamber geometry, and calibration, to study the impact on UHC emissions from mixing-controlled diesel combustion. A tracer-based visualization methodology, using full cylinder and full cycle CFD simulations was developed to understand combustion chamber exhausting processes and help interpret crank-angle resolved test measurements of UHC in the exhaust runner using a Cambustion Fast Flame Ionization Detector. Comparisons of the quantitative CFD predictions of UHC for varying engine configurations gives additional insight on the current state of the art predictive capability. Simulations with imposed fuel injector dribble phenomenon were additionally evaluated. The historical view of diesel UHC emissions having a strong dependency on injector dribble and injector sac volume was confirmed to still be of utmost importance. Results indicate that fuel injector dribble is a key source contributing from 75 to 90% of the UHC emissions under the conditions investigated.

Box 1627, Kuopio, 70211, Finland","Management of peat soils is regionally important as they cover large land areas and have important but conflicting ecosystems services. A recent management trend for drained peatlands is the control of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changes in agricultural practices, peatland restoration or paludiculture. Due to complex antagonistic controls of moisture, water table management can be difficult to use as a method for controlling GHG emissions. Past studies show that there is no obvious relationship between GHG emission rates and crop type, tillage intensity or fertilization rates. For drained peat soils, the best use options can vary from rewetting with reduced emission to efficient short term use to maximize the profit per amount of greenhouse gas emitted. The GHG accounting should consider the entire life cycle of the peatland and the socio-economic benefits peatlands provide locally. Cultivating energy crops is a viable option especially for wet peat soils with poor drainage, but harvesting remains a challenge due to tractability of wet soils. Paludiculture in lowland floodplains can be a tool to mitigate regional flooding allowing water to be stored on these lands without much harm to crops. This can also increase regional biodiversity providing important habitats for birds and moisture tolerant plant species. However, on many peatlands rewetting is not possible due to their position in the landscape and the associated difficulty to maintain a high stable water table. While the goal of rewetting often is to encourage the return of peat forming plants and the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, it is not well known if these plants will grow on peat soils that have been altered by the process of drainage and management. Therefore, it is important to consider peat quality and hydrology when choosing management options. Mapping of sites is recommended as a management tool to guide actions. The environmental status and socio-economic importance of the sites should be assessed both for continued cultivation but also for other ecosystem services such as restoration and hydrological functions (flood control). Farmers need advice, tools and training to find the best after-use option. Biofuels might provide a cost-efficient after use option for some sites. Peat extraction followed by rewetting might provide a sustainable option as rewetting is often easier if the peat is removed, starting the peat accumulation from scratch. Also this provides a way to finance the after-use. As impacts of land use are uncertain, new policies should consider multiple benefits and decisions should be based on scientific evidence and field scale observations. The need to further understand the key processes and long term effects of field scale land use manipulations is evident. The recommended actions for peatlands should be based on local condition and socio-economic needs to outline intermediate and long term plans. © 2016",,"biofuel; peat; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; bird; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; cultivated land; ecosystem monitoring; energy crop; greenhouse gas; habitat; harvesting; health care policy; hydrology; land use; leaching; life cycle; moisture; nonhuman; nutrient supply; peatland; priority journal; Review; social control; social status; soil management; water table",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008219847

Currently, the pelletized chromite pre-reduction process, also referred to as solid-state reduction of chromite, is most likely the FeCr production process with the lowest specific electricity consumption, i.e., MWh/t FeCr produced. In this study, the effects of carbonaceous reductant selection on chromite pre-reduction and cured pellet strength were investigated. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to evaluate the effect of reductant characteristics on the aforementioned two parameters. This yielded mathematical solutions that can be used by FeCr producers to select reductants more optimally in future. Additionally, the results indicated that hydrogen (H)- (24 pct) and volatile content (45.8 pct) were the most significant contributors for predicting variance in pre-reduction and compressive strength, respectively. The role of H within this context is postulated to be linked to the ability of a reductant to release H that can induce reduction. Therefore, contrary to the current operational selection criteria, the authors believe that thermally untreated reductants (e.g., anthracite, as opposed to coke or char), with volatile contents close to the currently applied specification (to ensure pellet strength), would be optimal, since it would maximize H content that would enhance pre-reduction. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Chromite; Compressive strength; Linear regression; Pelletizing; Pulverized fuel; Regression analysis; Electricity-consumption; Mathematical solutions; Multiple linear regression analysis; Pellet strength; Production process; Selection criteria; Solid state reduction; Volatile contents; Chromite deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007413363

Complex bathymetry and ocean circulation in this region have contributed to biases in global climate model simulations of the Shelf waters. Increasing the resolution of these models results in reductions in the bias of future climate change projections and indicates greater warming than suggested by coarse resolution climate projections. Here, we used a high-resolution global climate model and historical observations of species distributions from a trawl survey to examine changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for various demersal and pelagic species on the Shelf. Along the southern portion of the shelf (Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank), a projected 4.1 °C (surface) to 5.0 °C (bottom) warming of ocean temperature from current conditions results in a northward shift of the thermal habitat for the majority of species. While some southern species like butterfish and black sea bass are projected to have moderate losses in suitable thermal habitat, there are potentially significant increases for many species including summer flounder, striped bass, and Atlantic croaker. In the north, in the Gulf of Maine, a projected 3.7 °C (surface) to 3.9 °C (bottom) warming from current conditions results in substantial reductions in suitable thermal habitat such that species currently inhabiting this region may not remain in these waters under continued warming. We project a loss in suitable thermal habitat for key northern species including Acadian redfish, American plaice, Atlantic cod, haddock, and thorney skate, but potential gains for some species including spiny dogfish and American lobster. We illustrate how changes in suitable thermal habitat of important commercially fished species may impact local fishing communities and potentially impact major fishing ports along the U.S. Northeast Shelf. Given the complications of multiple drivers including species interactions and fishing pressure, it is difficult to predict exactly how species will shift. However, observations of species distribution shifts in the historical record under ocean warming suggest that temperature will play a primary role in influencing how species fare. Our results provide critical information on the potential for suitable thermal habitat on the U.S. Northeast Shelf for demersal species in the region, and may contribute to the development of ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies in response to climate change. © 2017","Climate change; Global climate model; Northwest Atlantic; Temperature shifts; Thermal habitat","Climate models; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Oceanography; Population distribution; Ecosystem based fisheries managements; Global climate model; Global climate model simulations; Historical observation; Northwest Atlantic; Substantial reduction; Temperature shift; Thermal habitats; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; continental shelf; demersal fish; finfish; flatfish; future prospect; global climate; global ocean; historical record; lobster; marine ecosystem; perciform; shark; spatial distribution; temperature gradient; warming; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Georges Bank; Gulf of Maine; Middle Atlantic Bight; Centropristis; Gadus morhua; Hippoglossoides platessoides; Homarus americanus; Melanogrammus; Micropogonias undulatus; Morone; Paralichthys; Sebastes fasciatus; Squalidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017201720

The measurements were performed for sphere to plane geometry of the electrodes separated from 5 μm to 100 μm, within the pressure range 760 Torr to 3800 Torr. For gaps of the order of a few micrometers, it is not possible to properly obtain the left-hand side of the Paschen curve; and the Townsend mechanism is no longer suitable. Deviations are also observable in the direction of lower breakdown potential that appear at the right of the minimum of the direct-current breakdown voltage curves indicating that accumulated space charge plays an important role in enhanced field emission. The experimental data agree well with the simulation results obtained by a one-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision code including field emission effects. Their fit to a simple formula describing the dependence of the breakdown voltage on the product of the pressure and the gap size is suggested. Based on the measured breakdown voltage curves, the effective secondary electron emission coefficients have been determined. This work especially focuses on the effect of the electrode surface degradation on the breakdown characteristics at high pressure and high frequency. It is observed that in the case of direct-current and low frequency discharges, there is no significant influence of the electrode surface degradation on the breakdown voltage and the effective yields.

So far, the UK renewable energy generation has seen a steady growth but there are concerns about the impacts of these on the power system network. Sequel to this, the UK research councils have invested in microgeneration specific researches, one of which is the impact of significant microgeneration penetration on the LV/MV/HV network to 2050. This paper investigates the technical impacts of microgeneration on the UK low voltage distribution networks, using the Solar PV as a case study. Technical impacts considered include voltage rise, voltage unbalance, reversed power flow, transformer and cable loading, system losses and harmonics. The networks were modeled using OpenDSS and simulations performed using MATLAB via the OpenDSS COM interface. The analysis of the results obtained show that the aforementioned impacts increased with high solar PV penetration, but within acceptable limits. However, the variations of solar PV penetration beyond the acceptable limits of the network were illustrated. © 2016 IEEE.","Harmonics; Microgeneration; OpenDSS; Reversed power flow; Solar PV; System losses; Voltage rise; Voltage unbalance","Electric load flow; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Renewable energy resources; Harmonics; Microgeneration; Opendss; Power flows; Solar PVs; System loss; Voltage rise; Voltage unbalances; Voltage distribution measurement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017225817

The core study relies on an ensemble of climate simulations under two emissions scenarios: a business-as-usual reference scenario (REF) analogous to the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario, and a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario, called POL3.7, which is in between the IPCC RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, and is consistent with a 2 °C global mean warming from pre-industrial by 2100. Evaluating the outcomes of both climate change scenarios in the MC2 model shows that the carbon stocks of most forests around the world increased, with the greatest gains in tropical forest regions. Temperate forest regions are projected to see strong increases in productivity offset by carbon loss to fire. The greatest cost of mitigation in terms of effects on forest carbon stocks are projected to be borne by regions in the southern hemisphere. We compare three sources of uncertainty in climate change impacts on the world's forests: emissions scenarios, the global system climate response (i.e. climate sensitivity), and natural variability. The role of natural variability on changes in forest carbon and net primary productivity (NPP) is small, but it is substantial for impacts of wildfire. Forest productivity under the REF scenario benefits substantially from the CO2 fertilization effect and that higher warming alone does not necessarily increase global forest carbon levels. Our analysis underlines why using an ensemble of climate simulations is necessary to derive robust estimates of the benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. It also demonstrates that constraining estimates of climate sensitivity and advancing our understanding of CO2 fertilization effects may considerably reduce the range of projections. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change; dynamic global vegetation model; forests; MC2; mitigation scenarios; uncertainty analysis; wildfire","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Ecosystems; Fires; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Climate change scenarios; forests; Greenhouse gas mitigation; mitigation scenarios; Net primary productivity; Sources of uncertainty; Vegetation model; wildfire; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; emission; environmental modeling; forest ecosystem; global perspective; mitigation; net primary production; scenario analysis; socioeconomic conditions; tropical forest; uncertainty analysis; vegetation dynamics; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018513427

Since the road mobile pollutant is the probable reason for the air quality pollution, the electric vehicle expansion is one of the main strategies for sustainable transportation systems. The expanded distribution of electric taxis depends on the important task of securing the investment feasibility compared to the currently operating liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) taxis. One thing to note is that a validity analysis is required to secure the sustainability of the switch from LPG to electric taxis and for the effective distribution of investment resources. This study has diagnosed the implementation potential of electric taxis by analyzing the operating and charging behaviors of electric taxis from actual digital tachometer data which is consist of speed, driving distance, power usages of power train and by carrying out the feasibility study and environmental analysis for implementing electric taxis. It was found that the financial feasibility exists in converting private taxis to electric taxis, and the implementation potential is high. Moreover, the environmental analysis showed that socioeconomic benefits would be created with reduced air pollutants and CO2 from electric taxi operations. As a result of feasibility study, the implementation of electric taxis is feasible from both financial and environmental perspectives under the current subsidy situations. Thus, attempts for sustainable urban transportation structure should be supported by operating behaviors, charging infrastructure, regulations, policies, and battery technology for the promotion of electric taxis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality improvement; Electric taxi; Feasibility study; Tachometer data","Air pollution; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric switches; Global warming; Investments; Liquefied petroleum gas; Planning; Pollution; Sustainable development; Tachometers; Taxicabs; Transportation; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Air quality improvement; Charging infrastructures; Electric taxi; Feasibility studies; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Socio-economic benefits; Sustainable transportation systems; Urban transportation structure; Electric power distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006428025

However, Everglade have received drainage water enriched with phosphorus (P) fertilizer over past 40 years, which has created the gradient of P content, TN:TP ratio, the pool and size of microbial population in the Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) in the northern part of Everglade ecosystem. Until recent, there was little information on how the nutrient change caused by P enrichment affected the inorganic N transformation rates and relationships between them in the Everglade wetland ecosystems. Thus, we studied the relationships between nitrification, anammox and denitrification rates in along a sediment P gradient in WCA-2A, a nutrient affected area of the Florida Everglades. The P-enriched site exhibited higher nitrification rates than did the transitional and un-impacted sites, and their activities were regulated by ammonium concentrations. Bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA: AOB) nitrifiers were more numerous than archaeal amoA (AOA) nitrifiers and likely contributed most to sediment nitrification rates, which had positive correlations with ammonium concentration. Enhanced nitrification rate might supply more nitrite to anammox bacteria and enhance their activities, implying the possibly presence of coupled nitrification-anammox processes in wetland ecosystems. For nitrate reduction, labile organic carbon contents were positively correlated with sediment denitrification rates and abundances of nirS and nirK genes, and their activities and gene abundances were higher in the P-impacted and transitional sites than in the un-impacted site. Denitrification rates were much higher than anammox rates in sediment samples; however, the reverse was true in the water column. In summary, this study demonstrated that P-enrichment might enhance inorganic N transformation rates in wetland sediment ecosystem; however denitrification and anammox rates in the water ecosystems was not significantly affected by P-enrichment factors. In addition, the relative importance for N removal between denitrification and anammox was different from the water and sediment ecosystems in the Everglades wetland. © 2016, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Anammox; Denitrification; Eutrophication; Everglade wetland; Nitrification","anoxic conditions; bacterium; biogeochemistry; biotransformation; denitrification; eutrophication; fluvial deposit; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; oligotrophic environment; oxidation; phosphorus; reduction; sediment chemistry; wetland; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006142786

Hence, this will cause significant economic, social, and environmental challenges/problems for Bangladesh. The major negative impacts of climate change would be damage/destruction of wetland ecosystems and their biodiversity such as, loss or shift of breeding grounds of the Gangetic major carps in the Halda River, Chittagong; loss of Royal Bengal Tiger habitats in the Sundarbans; salinization of rice lands, freshwater aquaculture facilities, and aquifers; water quality problems in wetlands, i.e., algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, and enhancement of toxins in seafood organisms (fish, prawn); and loss of tourism/recreational business (due to loss of biodiversity). The positive impacts of climate change such as floods would reestablish the connection between rivers and shallow lakes/wetlands, disperse biota/ seeds, and enhance spawning and reproduction of native fishes. In order to reduce threats to various sectors, Bangladesh would need to adopt climate resilient development programs/actions including conserving wetlands/mangroves (which are biodiversity ""hot spots"" and act as major carbon sinks); conserving species with higher genetic diversity; use of 3F models (simultaneous forestry, food, and fish production in coastal areas) to reduce vulnerabilities in coastal communities; floating agriculture (waterlogged/flood-prone areas); and climatesmart aquaculture, rainwater harvesting, and use of renewable energy. Awareness and education programs including inclusion of climate change in curriculum at primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institutions would be essential.

The multilevel architecture has implications for low-carbon technology deployment in developing countries, an issue salient to both development and climate objectives. The paper examines this theme through two inter-related questions: how do (or don't) low-carbon technologies get deployed in India's built environment, and what implications can be drawn from the Indian case for effective low-carbon technology development and transfer for developing countries? By examining the multilevel linkages in India's buildings sector, the paper shows how the interactions between governance levels can both support and hinder technology deployment, ultimately leading to inadequate outcomes. The potential of these linkages is hobbled by aspects of the national context (federated energy governance and developing-country capacity limitations), yet can also be enabled by other features (the climate policy context, which may motivate international actors to fill domestic capacity lacunae). Reflecting on the India case, the paper makes recommendations for improved low-carbon technology deployment in developing countries: (1) technology development and transfer collaboration on a ‘need-driven’ approach, (2) development of the specific types of capacity required across the entire innovation chain and (3) domestic strengthening of the coordination and agendas across and between governance levels.

Global policy and environmental changes can affect regional consumption of forest products, as well as inter-regional trade of forest goods and services. This study analyzes global and regional change impacts on the production, consumption and trade of forest products in two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden. Annual data on removal and trade (1964–2012) for roundwood and sawnwood is used to identify structural breaks based on Chow tests. According to the analysis, the time period is divided into two periods: t1 (1964–1980) and t2 (1981–2012). In the first period, breaks occurred in 1975 and 1976 in the Finnish model and no break is found in the Swedish model. In the second period, we identify breaks in 1991 and 1992 for the Finnish model and in 2004, 2005 and 2006 for the Swedish model.

SLCPs emitted outside the Arctic influence the Arctic atmosphere, Arctic communities, and the rate of ice melt. As an intergovernmental forum that brings together three of the world's major petroleum producers (Russia, the United States, and Canada), the Arctic Council has a pivotal role in reducing the rate of Arctic warming through SLCP mitigation. This article explores the Arctic Council's approach to SLCP mitigation. It begins by addressing the current status of black carbon and methane in international legal instruments, and goes on to explore the important regime linkages that are set in place through the Arctic Council's Framework for Action on Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emission Reductions. The article suggests that the Arctic Council provides an experimental platform that may catalyze SLCP regulation not only in Arctic jurisdictions but also in Arctic Council observer states, such as China and India. The transnational and inclusive character of the Arctic Council's constitutional framework and knowledge-generating mechanisms enables new pathways for global action on climate change and air pollution governance. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","Arctic Council; Arctic governance; Black carbon; Experimental governance; International law; Short-lived climate pollutants",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986593904

Typically, vehicles equipped with such systems include two DC power sources that are coupled in parallel: a primary and a secondary power source. The primary power source supplies energy to the starter to crank the engine, while the secondary power source supplies energy to the rest of the vehicle electric loads. During an auto-stop event, a controllable switch decouples the two power sources. Moreover, operating current, voltage and the State of Charge (SOC) are monitored to ensure enough energy for the next auto-start event. When any of these operating parameters are below the threshold values, the controllable switch opens to isolate the two batteries and then the engine is automatically started. This paper introduces a strategy to control the power usage of the Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) system for enhanced stop-start availability, optimal steering/EPAS assist, maximum fuel economy savings and minimum CO2 emissions. The algorithm predicts the energy demand by the customer and determines the next engine state based on the above mentioned criteria. The power system architecture uses a Lead Acid battery (Lead Acid, AGM and/or Enhanced) in parallel to a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. Such architecture combines the advantages of the two technologies and supplies the required vehicle power over a wider operating range of ambient conditions. Moreover, the Li-Ion has voltage characteristics that are similar to the lead acid battery, and hence there is no need for any adjustments between the two power supplies. Measured data and results assure the ability of the introduced strategy to optimize between engine auto-stop/start and the EPAS assist. © 2017 SAE International.","Dual Power Source; Fuel economy; Power Supply; Start-Stop; Steering, EPAS; Stop-Start","Automobile steering equipment; Availability; Battery management systems; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric power system economics; Electric power systems; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Ions; Lead acid batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Steering; Controllable switches; Dual power; Electric power assist steering; Power supply; Power system architectures; Primary power sources; Secondary power sources; Voltage characteristics; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018381513

Among different climatic events, drought is frequently identified as a major threat to agricultural systems and livelihood security of farm families, in many arid and semi-arid regions of the developing world. The negative impacts of drought are further intensified by the threat of climate change. In order to mitigate the negative impacts of drought on livelihood, increasing adaptive capacity of farm families is imperative. If rural livelihoods are no longer secure, farm families are finally forced to abandon agriculture. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the livelihood vulnerability of farm families to drought. It was also intended to determine the drivers of livelihood vulnerability in the context of drought. A survey of 274 farm families of Fars province, selected through a multistage stratified random sampling technique, indicated that drought is the main threat to livelihood security meantime the interaction between drought intensity and its duration leads to more vulnerability. Additionally, results revealed that different adaptation strategies were used by the low, medium and high livelihood vulnerable families in order to adjust drought impacts. Tree analysis also illustrated that livelihood vulnerability is a product of the complex set of financial, physical, social and natural capitals.

Using direct questions about satisfaction with winter and with summer weather, I show that warming’s effects on subjective well-being can be reliably estimated from cross-sectional survey data across a broad temperature spectrum and, moreover, that these effects are large. Combining a US national survey (N = 2295) and standard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data on actual month-by-month temperatures at each location over many years, shows that changes to be expected from the widely discussed, allegedly “dangerous”, 2 °C of global warming are both familiar and small, equivalent to moving from Wisconsin to Michigan, or Virginia to North Carolina, or more generally 180 miles south. Such warming will greatly increase Americans’ satisfaction with winter weather, especially in the north, but somewhat decrease satisfaction with summer weather in both north and south. On balance, the nation benefits slightly. Regional differences are large, with northerners’ gains roughly equivalent to a 1–2 % increase in their GDP, while southerners losses are about the same size. These changes are important, about as large as the combined financial implications of all other aspects of global warming. They have important policy implications, suggesting that prompt action to reduce carbon emissions may not be optimal because that would restrict warming both in the summer and in the south (gains) but also in the winter and in the north (losses). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Global warming; Public opinion; Quality of life; Subjective well-being; USA","climate change; global warming; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; summer; winter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973125224

However, projected future warming and drying may further exacerbate the species' decline and possibly compromise long-term success of today's restoration activities. We evaluated successes of restoration treatments under future climate using a comprehensive landscape simulation experiment. The spatially explicit, ecological process model FireBGCv2 was used to simulate whitebark pine populations on two U.S. Northern Rocky Mountain landscapes over 95 years under two climate, three restoration, and two fire management scenarios. Major findings were that (1) whitebark pine can remain on some high mountain landscapes in a future climate albeit at lower basal areas (50% decrease), (2) restoration efforts, such as thinning and prescribed burning, are vital to ensure future whitebark pine forests, and (3) climate change impacts on whitebark pine vary by local setting. Whitebark pine restoration efforts will mostly be successful in the future but only if future populations are somewhat resistant to WPBR.

Findings are structured according to Köppen–Geiger climate classification, aiming to investigate the prevalence of research conducted in different climate zones. Results from full-scale studies and laboratory or greenhouse experiments were reviewed. The later were included as they provide systematic knowledge on the effect of individual factors on system performances although cannot provide climate specific information. Studies discussed effects of major substrate components and depths on plant survival and establishment using standard test procedures. Results showed that most research in the subject were in temperate (group C climate classification), continental (group D) and dry climates (group B), respectively. Considerable number of investigations was conducted in controlled laboratory or greenhouse environments. Based on the results, future green roof research and guidelines should consider climate specifications of the region in designing growing medium, depths and attribute of green roof substrates in order to ensure enhanced plant performance. Especially, for more fragile but less investigated dry climate, considerations should be made to tackle heat fluctuations and drought stress by enhancing water holding capacity and thermal isolation of the substrate.

This paper adopts a “pathways to sustainability” approach to review Australia's forest governance models, which are strongly tenure-dependent, and generally vary between sub-national jurisdictions; only climate change-related policies, which are in a state of considerable flux, apply to all forests. Consequently, pathways to sustainability are defined largely in terms of the dominant purpose of particular tenures, and are now little-integrated across institutions, landscapes or tenures. Three decades of trialing devolved models of natural resource governance have effectively been abandoned, as have many of the initiatives intended to support development of a more diverse and more integrated ‘forestry’ sector. While the near-term prospects for sustainability of Australia's forests in anything more than the narrowest sense are poor, there are both knowledge-based and historical institutional foundations from which more substantive progress towards sustainability could be realized. This progress will need to be founded on approaches to policy development and implementation that recognize and accommodate the plurality of interests in forests, that enhance coordination and integration between institutions and across landscapes, and that empower and enable the diverse communities of interests in forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Australia's forests; Forest conflict; Forest governance; Forest politics; Landcare; Natural resource management","Climate change; Climate models; Knowledge based systems; Natural resources; Natural resources management; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Australia; Forest conflicts; Forest governance; Forest politics; Landcare; Natural resource management; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930606665

Driving range decreases with low temperatures in particular because cabin heating system requires significant amount of electric power. Range also decreases with high ambient temperatures because of the air conditioning system with electrically-driven compressor. Both thermal systems reduce EV driving range under real life operating cycles, which can be a barrier against market penetration. The structure of a vehicle is capable of absorbing a significant amount of heat when exposed to hot climate conditions. 50-70% of this heat penetrates through the glazing and raises both the internal cabin air temperature and the interior trim surface temperature. In this paper, an integrated 1D/3D CFD approach is proposed to evaluate sensitivity of various vehicle climate control strategies (Cabin cool down) impact on battery energy state of charge and consequent driving range. Additionally, effects of ambient temperature and choice of glazing materials on climate control performance and its impact on driving range is studied.

Here, we investigated how land-use intensity and the three main components of land use used on the study sites (mowing, grazing, fertilisation) affect bumblebee visitation to bird's-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, using a novel chemistry-based approach that overcomes the limitations of classical visitation monitoring. This approach uses the hydrocarbon footprints left behind by bumblebees that accumulate within the epicuticular wax of flowers. Along with land-use intensity, we investigated whether the small-scale (patch) population density and local abundance of L. corniculatus affected visitation. We found that the amount of footprints, and thus visitation, of bumblebees to L. corniculatus increased with land-use and grazing intensity while traditionally recorded visitation rates did not show such an effect. We further found that the patch density and local abundance of L. corniculatus had no effect on visitation. We conclude that bumblebee visitation to L. corniculatus increased with land use using the novel approach but emphasise that foraging decisions by bumblebees can be affected by many different parameters unrelated to the land-use intensity of a specific site. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Ecosystem function; Lotus corniculatus; Pollination; Unsaturated hydrocarbons","abundance; agricultural ecosystem; bee; ecosystem function; fertilizer application; flower visiting; footprint; grazing; hydrocarbon; land use change; legume; mowing; pollination; population density; Aves; Lotus; Lotus corniculatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013276203

Whether and how the number of available resources affects resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting functions associated with resources) have, however, been little investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated how plant species richness-recorded for study sites located in different habitats-and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality, particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific plant species) become scarce. © 2017 Kaluza et al.","Functional complementarity; Functional redundancy; Meliponini; Nutritional ecology; Plant-insect interactions; Pollinator decline",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017498657

Slagging especially occurs in regions with reductive atmospheres which nowadays are very common due to very strict limitations in NOx emissions. Moreover alternative fuels like biomass which are also used in combustion systems from two decades in order to decrease CO2 emissions also usually increase the risk of slagging. Thus the prediction of slagging properties of fuels is not the minor issue which can be neglected before purchasing or mixing of fuels. This however is rather difficult to estimate and even commonly known standard laboratory methods like fusion temperature determination or special indexers calculated on the basis of proximate and ultimate analyses, very often have no reasonable correlation to real boiler fuel behaviour. In this paper the method of determination of slagging properties of solid fuels based on laboratory investigation and artificial neural networks were presented. A fuel data base with over 40 fuels was created. Neural networks simulations were carried out in order to predict the beginning temperature and intensity of slagging. Reasonable results were obtained for some of tested neural networks, especially for hybrid feedforward networks with PCA technique. Consequently neural network model will be used in Common Intelligent Boiler Operation Platform (CIBOP) being elaborated within CERUBIS research project for two BP-1150 and BB-1150 steam boilers. The model among others enables proper fuel selection in order to minimize slagging risk. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"artificial neural network; carbon emission; combustion; energy efficiency; equipment; fuel; heat transfer; laboratory method; prediction; research work; slag; solid",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016484661

The Asian region, accounting for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions and growing at a rapid economic pace, has a major role to play in the world's transition to a low carbon society (LCS). To design leapfrog pathways to low carbon and sustainable development, it is important to have a scientific tool that can develop LCS pathways and analyze the effectiveness of policies to achieve them under different scenarios. The Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model (AIM) is an effective tool to support these analyses. It has been developed by researchers in Asia and used in policymaking processes in Asia. It can provide comprehensive and consistent assessment of various policies, including macro-economic policies and technological measures. It can analyze trade-offs between rapid economic growth in Asia and its environmental impact and assess sustainable development policies. This paper presents the processes of designing LCS policies and how modeling tools can support the analyses of the leapfrog pathways to a LCS. As a modeling tool, the family of AIM models is explained and their applications in Asia are presented.

This study aimed at the quantification of the economic and environmental impacts considering the current and future scenarios of sugarcane biorefineries taking into account not only the improvements of the industrial process but also of biomass production systems. Technology assumptions and scenarios setup were supported by main companies and stakeholders, involved in the lignocellulosic ethanol production chain from Brazil and abroad. For instance, scenarios considered higher efficiencies and lower residence times for pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation (including pentoses fermentation); higher sugarcane yields; and introduction of energy cane (a high fiber variety of cane). Results: Ethanol production costs were estimated for different time horizons. In the short term, 2G ethanol presents higher costs compared to 1st generation (1G) ethanol. However, in the long term, 2G ethanol is more competitive, presenting remarkable lower production cost than 1G ethanol, even considering some uncertainties regarding technology and market aspects. In addition, environmental assessment showed that both 1G (in the medium and long term) and 2G ethanol can reduce climate change impacts by more than 80% when compared to gasoline. Conclusions: This work showed the great potential of 2G ethanol production in terms of economic and environmental aspects. These results can support new research programs and public policies designed to stimulate both production and consumption of 2G ethanol in Brazil, accelerating the path along the learning curve. Some examples of mechanisms include: incentives to the establishment of local equipment and enzyme suppliers; and specific funding programs for the development and use of energy cane. © 2017 The Author(s).","Climate change; Energy cane; Ethanol; Production costs; Sugarcane","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Costs; Crops; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Refining; Sugar cane; Climate change impact; Energy cane; Environmental assessment; Lignocellulosic ethanols; Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Production and consumption; Production cost; Techno-Economic analysis; Climate change; biomass; climate change; climate effect; economic analysis; ethanol; production cost; sugar cane; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015261187

Since the power generation sector in Korea is one of the main sources of CO2 emissions, low-carbon options in this sector with their implications for changing the energy mix and incremental costs are compared with the official basic plan in this sector. To project the power generations and the associated CO2 emissions under different scenarios, the Asia Integrated Model of the computable general equilibrium approach for Korea is used. The simulation results tell us that the CO2 emission reduction for the power sector in Korea is feasible with the incremental costs of power generation between −25.7 and 452.4 USD per ton of CO2 in 2029, depending on the energy mix under different scenarios. The policy implication is clear that the low-carbon pathways for the power sector are feasible with the social consensus that the extra burden of CO2 reduction cost will be considered. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Coal; Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Coal-fired power plant; Computable general equilibrium; Emission projections; Emission reduction; Global community; Integrated modeling; Policy implications; Temperature increase; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017236001

In some manner, climate change will impact on the livelihoods of most individuals in the twenty-first century. Some of the risks for small islands are risk of death, injury, ill-health or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that in small islands, which have diverse physical and human attributes, community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits when delivered in conjunction with other developmental activities. One of the adaptive responses suggested is to improve the efficacy of traditional community coping strategies; this can be facilitated by social work intervention at the macro-level. The role of social workers in SIDS can impact on sustainable development and towards improved livelihoods of a country’s human resources. According to the Council on Social Work Education, the purpose of the social work profession is to promote human and community well-being. This purpose is put into practice through a quest for social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty and the enhancement and quality of life for all persons. Key strategies by which social workers can promote sustainable development include building relations with communities, helping individuals to deepen their understanding of sustainable development, and assisting them to develop and work towards goals and objectives that lead towards the integration and improvement of economic, social and environmental outcomes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Caribbean; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Small islands; Social work; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012216772

We find that various facility-level factors are positively associated with plant-level emissions, including plant size, age, heat rate, capacity utilization rate, and coal as the primary fuel source. Results further indicate that plant-level emissions are lower, on average, in the transition nations that joined the European Union (EU), whose market reforms and environmental directives are relevant for emissions reductions. These negative associations between plant-level emissions and EU accession are larger for the nations that joined the EU in 2004 relative to those that joined in 2007. The findings also suggest that export-oriented development is positively associated with plant-level CO2 emissions in the transition nations.

This has led to the need for different industry sectors to investigate how climate change will impact their interests. In this context this research looks into what is being done in Japan in the cultural heritage sector through a case study of Itsukushima Shrine. Itsukushima Shrine is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, located on Miyajima Island in Hiroshima Prefecture. Since 1963, tide gauge data from the Japan Meteorological Agency shows that sea levels in the region have been rising and causing an increase in flooding events at the site. This rise mirrors a global increase in sea levels, with many researchers arguing it is a direct result of global warming. Research into global warming and its impacts upon climate systems over the next century strongly suggest that global sea levels will continue to rise. This paper makes use of examples from the United Kingdom to identify ways in which the situation in Japan can be improved. In the UK the cultural heritage industry and researchers have actively sought to investigate, mitigate and adapt to potential threats posed by climate change. Those efforts are helped in part through Government-funded climate change information dissemination and education. This paper details how different sectors are embracing this freely available information to mitigate the impact of climate change on their own interests. Finally, recommendations are made based on the findings from the Itsukushima Shrine case study and also through a detailed appraisal of the UK's approach. These recommendations are applicable to organizations and cultural heritage sites across Japan and would also benefit other sectors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054944547

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), absorption, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies show that CuZ° is a 1-hole (i.e., 3CuICuII) state with spin density delocalized evenly over CuI and CuIV. Resonance Raman spectroscopy shows two Cu-S vibrations at 425 and 413 cm-1, the latter with a -3 cm-1 O18 solvent isotope shift. DFT calculations correlated to these spectral features show that CuZ° has a terminal hydroxide ligand coordinated to CuIV, stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a nearby lysine residue. CuZ° can be reduced via electron transfer from CuA using a physiologically relevant reductant. We obtain a lower limit on the rate of this intramolecular electron transfer (IET) that is &gt;104 faster than the unobserved IET in the resting state, showing that CuZ° is the catalytically relevant oxidized form of N2OR. Terminal hydroxide coordination to CuIV in the CuZ° intermediate yields insight into the nature of N2O binding and reduction, specifying a molecular mechanism in which N2O coordinates in a μ-1,3 fashion to the fully reduced state, with hydrogen bonding from Lys397, and two electrons are transferred from the fully reduced μ4S2- bridged tetranuclear copper cluster to N2O via a single Cu atom to accomplish N-O bond cleavage. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Amino acids; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Dichroism; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Electrons; Hydrogen bonds; Magnetic resonance; Nitrogen oxides; Paramagnetic resonance; Spectroscopic analysis; Catalytic mechanisms; Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR); Intramolecular electron transfer; Magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy; Molecular insights; Molecular mechanism; Resonance Raman spectroscopy; Spectroscopic method; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; bacterial enzyme; copper; hydroxide; lysine; nitrous oxide reductase; reducing agent; copper; nitrous oxide reductase; oxidoreductase; absorption; Article; circular dichroism; comparative study; controlled study; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; electron transport; enzyme active site; enzyme isolation; enzyme mechanism; hydrogen bond; magnetic circular dichroism; Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus; nonhuman; Raman spectrometry; reduction (chemistry); steady state; turnover time; biocatalysis; chemistry; circular dichroism; electron spin resonance; enzymology; kinetics; Marinobacter; metabolism; quantum theory; Biocatalysis; Circular Dichroism; Copper; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Bonding; Kinetics; Marinobacter; Oxidoreductases; Quantum Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016297320

It would result in &gt; 111,000 new cyclists, corresponding to an increase of 209% compared to the current situation.

With global climate change, it is becoming an increasingly important trait. To better understand the molecular basis of heat stress, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out using the 250 K catfish SNP array with interspecific backcross progenies, which derived from crossing female channel catfish with male F1 hybrid catfish (female channel catfish × male blue catfish). Three significant associated SNPs were detected by performing an EMMAX approach for GWAS. The SNP located on linkage group 14 explained 12.1% of phenotypical variation. The other two SNPs, located on linkage group 16, explained 11.3 and 11.5% of phenotypical variation respectively. A total of 14 genes with heat stress related functions were detected within the significant associated regions. Among them, five genes—TRAF2, FBXW5, ANAPC2, UBR1 and KLHL29— have known functions in the protein degradation process through the ubiquitination pathway. Other genes related to heat stress include genes involved in protein biosynthesis (PRPF4 and SYNCRIP), protein folding (DNAJC25), molecule and iron transport (SLC25A46 and CLIC5), cytoskeletal reorganization (COL12A1) and energy metabolism (COX7A2, PLCB1 and PLCB4) processes. The results provide fundamental information about genes and pathways that is useful for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of heat stress.

Associated warming or cooling varies widely across the globe due to a range of factors including forest type, snow cover, and insolation, but resulting geographic variation remains poorly described and has been largely based on model assessments. This study provides an observation-based approach to quantify local and global radiative forcings from large-scale deforestation and reforestation and further examines mechanisms that result in the spatial heterogeneity of radiative forcing. We incorporate a new spatially and temporally explicit land cover-specific albedo product derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer with a historical land use data set (Land Use Harmonization product). Spatial variation in radiative forcing was attributed to four mechanisms, including the change in snow-covered albedo, change in snow-free albedo, snow cover fraction, and incoming solar radiation. We find an albedo-only radiative forcing (RF) of -0.819 W m-2 if year 2000 forests were completely deforested and converted to croplands. Albedo RF from global reforestation of present-day croplands to recover year 1700 forests is estimated to be 0.161 W m-2. Snowcover fraction is identified as the primary factor in determining the spatial variation of radiative forcing in winter, while the magnitude of the change in snow-free albedo is the primary factor determining variations in summertime RF. Findings reinforce the notion that, for conifers at the snowier high latitudes, albedo RF diminishes the warming from forest loss and the cooling from forest gain more so than for other forest types, latitudes, and climate settings. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.","Climate change mitigation; Forest conversion; Land cover change; Modis albedo; Radiative forcing","Atmospheric radiation; Deforestation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Land use; Radiometers; Reforestation; Satellite imagery; Snow; Solar radiation; Climate change mitigation; Forest conversion; Land-cover change; MODIS albedo; Radiative forcings; Climate change; albedo; climate change; climate forcing; data set; deforestation; environmental management; forest management; geographical variation; global climate; global warming; land cover; land use change; MODIS; radiative forcing; reforestation; satellite data; snow cover; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018524044

Likely explanations for this decrease include changes in anthropogenic, fires, and/or biogenic emissions or changes in the primary chemical sink hydroxyl radical (OH). Using remotely sensed CO measurements from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument, in situ methyl chloroform (MCF) measurements from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model, we estimate the change in global CO emissions from 2001 to 2015. We show that the loss rate of MCF varied by 0.2% in the past 15 years, indicating that changes in global OH distributions do not explain the recent decrease in CO. Our two-step inversion approach for estimating CO emissions is intended to mitigate the effect of bias errors in the MOPITT data as well as model errors in transport and chemistry, which are the primary factors contributing to the uncertainties when quantifying CO emissions using these remotely sensed data. Our results confirm that the decreasing trend of tropospheric CO in the Northern Hemisphere is due to decreasing CO emissions from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources. In particular, we find decreasing CO emissions from the United States and China in the past 15 years, and unchanged anthropogenic CO emissions from Europe since 2008. We find decreasing trends of biomass burning CO emissions from boreal North America, boreal Asia and South America, but little change over Africa. In contrast to prior results, we find that a positive trend in CO emissions is likely for India and southeast Asia. © 2017 Author(s).",,"biomass burning; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; hydroxyl radical; Northern Hemisphere; remote sensing; China; India; Southeast Asia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017161311

The CO partial current density at intermediate cathode potentials (V=−1.46 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is up to 3.5× higher than state-of-the-art Ag nanoparticle-based catalysts, and the maximum current density is 90 mA cm−2. The mass activity and energy efficiency (up to 48 %) were also higher than the Ag nanoparticle reference.

The industry grew rapidly in the 1970s, as large financial conglomerates acquired independent firms. While providing needed financial support, conglomerates changed the focus from existing markets in consumer applications toward a future utility market that never materialized. Concentration of the industry also left it vulnerable to the corporate restructuring of the 1980s, when the conglomerates were dismantled and solar divisions were pared back or sold off to foreign firms. Both the move toward conglomeration, when corporations became managed as stock portfolios, and its subsequent reversal were the result of increased financial dominance over corporate governance. The American case is contrasted with the more successful case of Japan, where these changes to corporate governance did not occur. Insulated from shareholder pressure and financial turbulence, Japanese photovoltaics manufacturers continued to expand investment throughout the 1980s when their American rivals were cutting back. The study is informed by Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction and Hyman Minsky’s theory of financialization, along with economic sociology. By highlighting the tenuous and conflicting relation between finance and production that shaped the early history of the photovoltaics industry, the article raises doubts about the prevailing approach to mitigate climate change through carbon pricing. Given the uncertainty of innovation and the ease of speculation, it will do little to spur low-carbon technology development without financial structures supporting patient capital. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"Commerce; Economics; Finance; Industrial management; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Climate change mitigation; Consumer applications; Corporate governance; Corporate restructuring; Creative destruction; Financial structures; Low-carbon industries; Low-carbon technologies; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041713180

The WSN is comprised of Epic core modules fit with the following sensors; Honeywell HIH-5030 (humidity), Panasonic AMS302 (photodiode – light intensity), Panasonic AMN41122 (PIR motion), Microchip TC1046 (temperature), and MEDER MK06 (door switch). The deployed WSN makes use of a split low-power sensor/core network architecture to reduce energy consumption of the sensors. When active, sensor nodes utilize 2.2 mA of current and ∼660 μJ of power is required to read all sensors (excluding the PIR) at a single point in time. A successful transmission used 22.5 mA for 78 ms, consuming 5 mJ and a failed transmission used 22.5 mA for 534 ms, consuming 36 mJ. Such low-power operation enables sensor nodes to operate for over one year from a single coin-cell battery. The observed packet delivery was best for nodes located closest to a base station and decreased with distance from the base station. However, slightly less than half of the expected number of packets were received overall. Finally, base energy analysis of the building under study was cast as three hypotheses in regards to the system being deployed and available metrics with the data collected. Results indicate inhabited units with individual swamp coolers, on average, utilize more energy (12.4 kWh/d, n = 3) vs. units that make use of a central evaporative cooling system (5.4 kWh/d, n = 3). Further, increased relative humidity in this study correlates with increased energy use. Our study demonstrates a realistic rapid deployment of WSN used to characterize energy use in a medium sized apartment complex in a dry climate in the Western U.S. It is proposed that such studies provide information for more rigorous energy studies that could be used in retro-fit decision frameworks, energy use behavior studies, or via integration with additional internet of things technologies. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 539–547, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog","energy use behavior; small to medium sized buildings; wireless sensor network","Apartment houses; Base stations; Complex networks; Energy utilization; Evaporative cooling systems; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Sensor nodes; Apartment complexes; Decision framework; Energy use; Engineering sensors; Internet of things technologies; Low-power operation; Reduce energy consumption; Western United States; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003016251

Most plants primarily procure N as inorganic nitrate (NO3 −) or ammonium (NH4 +), using membrane-localized transport proteins in roots, which are key targets for improving N use. Although interactive effects of elevated CO2, chronic warming and N form on N relations are expected, these have not been studied. In this study, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were grown at two levels of CO2 (400 or 700 ppm) and two temperature regimes (30 or 37°C), with NO3 − or NH4 + as the N source. Elevated CO2 plus chronic warming severely inhibited plant growth, regardless of N form, while individually they had smaller effects on growth. Although %N in roots was similar among all treatments, elevated CO2 plus warming decreased (1) N-uptake rate by roots, (2) total protein concentration in roots, indicating an inhibition of N assimilation and (3) shoot %N, indicating a potential inhibition of N translocation from roots to shoots. Under elevated CO2 plus warming, reduced NO3 −-uptake rate per g root was correlated with a decrease in the concentration of NO3 −-uptake proteins per g root, reduced NH4 + uptake was correlated with decreased activity of NH4 +-uptake proteins and reduced N assimilation was correlated with decreased concentration of N-assimilatory proteins. These results indicate that elevated CO2 and chronic warming can act synergistically to decrease plant N uptake and assimilation; hence, future global warming may decrease both plant growth and food quality (%N). © 2016 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society",,"ammonium derivative; carbon dioxide; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; plant protein; biomass; drug effects; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant root; shoot; temperature; tomato; Ammonium Compounds; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013057119

This article deals with the systemic dimension (the architecture) of global multi-level climate governance across levels and sectors. It refers to the model and its practical implementation at different levels. The text poses four hypotheses: (1) the global multi-level system of climate governance can be regarded as a structure which offers opportunities for ambitious innovation-based climate strategies; (2) each level of the global system has its own specific responsibilities, challenges, opportunities and mechanisms for lesson-drawing; (3) the main lesson to be learned is to make use of the co-benefits characteristic to climate mitigation; and (4) the system's multi-sectoral and multi-actor structure provides additional opportunities to address such co-benefits and to mobilize different interests in the pursuit of climate policy objectives.

The article adds to the literature by further developing existing arguments on multi-level reinforcement in climate and energy policy. We stress the point that economic co-benefits of climate protection have been successfully mobilized at all levels of governance, including the sub-national level, in recent times. This is illustrated by examples from pioneer countries as well as laggards and waverers in terms of national climate and energy policy. While it is far from certain whether the EU will indeed deliver the needed CO2 reductions to reach its internationally agreed targets, this paper, nevertheless, highlights why the EU system of climate governance remains relatively robust in light of the various challenges it currently faces. © 2017 The Authors.

Ions of interest, identified in flight, were implanted into the active volume of the gaseous optical time projection chamber, which allowed us to record tracks of charged particles emitted in the decay. Total branching ratios for β-delayed proton emission and for β-delayed two-proton emission were determined. In addition, energy spectra for delayed protons below 2 MeV were established. Our findings for P26 agree with results of previous experiments. In the case of S27, however, the observed probability of delayed proton emission is an order of magnitude larger than reported in literature. Two new strong proton transitions were identified representing decays of the first two excited states of P27 to the ground state of Si26.

Regional climate signals at specific global warming levels, and especially the differences between 1.5°C and 2°C, are not well constrained, however. In particular, methodological challenges related to the assessment of such differences have received limited attention. This article reviews alternative approaches for identifying regional climate signals associated with global temperature limits, and evaluates the extent to which they constitute a sound basis for impacts analysis. Four methods are outlined, including comparing data from different greenhouse gas scenarios, sub-selecting climate models based on global temperature response, pattern scaling, and extracting anomalies at the time of each global temperature increment. These methods have rarely been applied to compare 2°C with 1.5°C, but some demonstrate potential avenues for useful research. Nevertheless, there are methodological challenges associated with the use of existing climate model experiments, which are generally designed to model responses to different levels of greenhouse gas forcing, rather than to model climate responses to a specific level of forcing that targets a given level of global temperature change. Novel approaches may be required to address policy questions, in particular: to differentiate between half degree warming increments while accounting for different sources of uncertainty; to examine mechanisms of regional climate change including the potential for nonlinear responses; and to explore the relevance of time-lagged processes in the climate system and declining emissions, and the resulting sensitivity to alternative mitigation pathways.

Significantly, however, pre-GOE atmospheric aberrations toward more reducing conditions-featuring a methane-derived organic-haze-have recently been suggested, yet their occurrence, causes, and significance remain underexplored. To examine the role of haze formation in Earth's history, we targeted an episode of inferred haze development. Our redox-controlled (Fespeciation) carbon-and sulfur-isotope record reveals sustained systematic stratigraphic covariance, precluding nonatmospheric explanations. Photochemical models corroborate this inference, showing δ 36S/δ 33S ratios are sensitive to the presence of haze. Exploiting existing age constraints, we estimate that organic haze developed rapidly, stabilizing within 0.3 ± 0.1 million years (Myr), and persisted for upward of ∼1.4 ± 0.4 Myr. Given these temporal constraints, and the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the Archean, the sustained methane fluxes necessary for haze formation can only be reconciled with a biological source. Correlative δ13COrg and total organic carbon measurements support the interpretation that atmospheric haze was a transient response of the biosphere to increased nutrient availability, with methane fluxes controlled by the relative availability of organic carbon and sulfate. Elevated atmospheric methane concentrations during haze episodes would have expedited planetary hydrogen loss, with a single episode of haze development providing up to 2.6-18 × 1018 moles of O2 equivalents to the Earth system. Our findings suggest the Neoarchean likely represented a unique state of the Earth system where haze development played a pivotal role in planetary oxidation, hastening the contingent biological innovations that followed.","Hydrogen loss; Neoarchean; Organic haze; Planetary oxidation; Sulfur mass-independent fractionation","carbon; hydrogen; methane; oxygen; sulfate; sulfur; oxygen; Article; astronomy; atmosphere; chemical model; concentration (parameters); geochemistry; haze; Neoarchean; oxidation; oxygenation; photochemistry; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; total organic carbon; atmosphere; chemistry; theoretical model; time factor; Atmosphere; Earth (Planet); Models, Theoretical; Oxygen; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016420616

Longer ignition delays of PPC in comparison with conventional diesel combustion provide better fuel/air mixture which decreases soot and NOx emissions. Moreover, a proper injection timing and strategy for PPC can improve the combustion stability as a result of a higher level of fuel stratification in comparison with the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) concept. Injection timing is the major parameter with which to affect the level of fuel and combustion stratification and to control the combustion phasing and the heat release behavior. The scope of the present study is to investigate the fluid flow characteristics of PPC at different injection timings. To this end, high-speed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is implemented in a light-duty optical engine to measure fluid flow characteristics, including the flow fields, mean velocity and cycle-resolved turbulence, inside the piston bowl as well as the squish region with a temporal resolution of 1 crank angle degree at 800 rpm. Two injectors, having 5 and 7 holes, were compared to see their effects on fluid flow and heat release behavior for different injection timings. Reactive and non-reactive measurements were performed to distinguish injection-driven and combustion-driven turbulence. Formation of vortices and higher turbulence levels enhance the air/fuel interaction, changing the level of fuel stratification and combustion duration. Results demonstrate clearly how turbulence level correlates with heat release behavior, and provide a quantitative dataset for validation of numerical simulations. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Flow fields; Flow visualization; Fuels; Laws and legislation; Timing circuits; Turbomachinery; Turbulence; Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Charge stratification; Combustion duration; Combustion stability; Emission legislation; High-speed particles; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Partially premixed combustion; Temporal resolution; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018290825

This requires high-precision injection in the region in which the amount of injection is small. Achieving injection of a small amount of fuel using GDI solenoid injectors requires the use of the half-lift region. In this region, however, the variation in the injection amount tends to increase due to the variation in the lift behavior of the injectors, posing the problem of how to achieve high-precision injection. To reduce the variation, we analyzed the lift timing out of the injector current and voltage signal with the ECU in an attempt to adjust the amount of injection. To detect the injector needle-opening timing, we focused on the characteristic point of the injector current signal appearing when the injector needle opens, and to detect the injector needle-closing timing, we focused on the characteristic point of the injector voltage signal appearing when the injector needle closes. Using the ECU, we analyzed the current and voltage signal, developing an algorithm allowing the characteristic points of both signals to be detected. Detection requires a wide dynamic range and high precision. The application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) can acquire and process the current and voltage signal with high precision and at high sampling speed. Accordingly, we adopted a functional allocation based on the use of ASIC. As a result, the ECU has potential to detect the timing of the open-close needle with high precision without increasing the processing load of the micro-controller significantly. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Application specific integrated circuits; Needles; Solenoids; Timing circuits; Voltage measurement; Characteristic point; Current signal; Gasoline direct injection; Injection type; Injector needle; Processing load; Voltage signals; Wide dynamic range; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018449116

Its pore structure facilitates rapid diffusion of reactants and charge carriers to the photocatalytically active interface of TiO2. However, because the large band gap of TiO2 limits its ability to utilize visible light, non-metal doping has been extensively studied to tune the energy levels of TiO2. While first-principles calculations support the efficacy of this approach, it is challenging to efficiently introduce active non-metal dopants into the lattice of TiO2. This review surveys recent advances in the preparation of mp-TiO2 and their doping with non-metal atoms. Different doping strategies and dopant sources are discussed. Further, co-doping with combinations of non-metal dopants are discussed as strategies to reduce the band gap, improve photogenerated charge separation, and enhance visible light absorption. The improvements resulting from each doping strategy are discussed in light of potential changes in mesoporous architecture, dopant composition and chemical state, extent of band gap reduction, and improvement in photocatalytic activities. Finally, potential applications of non-metal-doped mp-TiO2 are explored in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and environmental remediation with visible light. © 2017 by the authors.","Catalysis; Mesoporous; Non-metal doping; Photocatalysis; Self-assembly; Titania",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038934028

This chapter explores the goods and services, collectively known as ecosystem services that the Sundarbans deliver to the populations living in the impact zone and to the wider landscape of Bangladesh. Similiar to other wetlands, four types of ecosystem services are derived from the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem. These are provisioning services (e.g. fish and shellfish, woods, and honey), cultural services (e.g. mangrove tourism, religious value), regulatory services (e.g. carbon sequestration), and other supporting services (e.g. soil formation). Particularly, provisioning services from the Sundarbans help to ensure employment, income, and food security and constitute a last resort activity when all other livelihood options are lost. However, a number of threats and stressors, both of natural and anthropogenic origin, continue to affect the flow and quality of the ecosystem services due to overuse and degradation. This chapter submits that for sustainable delivery of ecosystem services, urgent research and policy attention is required to manage the wetland in a manner that is socially equitable and ecologically sound. © Springer (India) Pvt.

The use of bicycle in urban areas can overcome a number of motorized vehicles operating wherever the using of them may create issues such as traffic jam and air pollution. This study aims to adjust the tandem bike which can be produced commercially for the apartment residents. Stated in the research problems, the design process was successfully fulfilled. Fabrication and product testing were positively completed. A concise and comfortable bike to carry from the lobby to the apartment unit, or vice versa, was successfully created. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Apartment houses; Automobile manufacture; Availability; Design; Housing; Pollution; Product design; Traffic congestion; Design process; Effective solution; Initial process; Marketing objective; Motorized vehicles; Multi-functions; Product testing; Research problems; Bicycles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015841066

Urbanization, energy consumption, intensification of road traffic and rapid population growth pose significant challenges to ambient air quality. Therefore, regular monitoring of current air quality is essential. Objectives. The study investigated the concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), ozone (O3), ammonia (NH3) and carbon monoxide (CO) in ten different sites to investigate possible anthropogenic sources within Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods. Air samples were collected into specific absorbing solutions twice daily in the morning and afternoon for four weeks. The resulting solutions were analyzed following specific colorimetric techniques according to standard methods of analysis. Results. Average concentrations varied among the sampling areas. All were above background levels obtained at the control site. Overall concentrations were found to be 30 ± 19 μg/m3 (SO2), 63 ± 16 μg/m3 (NOx), 31 ± 18 μg/m3 (O3), 463±180 μg/m3 (NH3) and 0.59±0.21 ppm (CO). These concentrations were present at the study areas at 15, 31, 17, 5 and 3 times the background concentrations for SO2, NOx, O3, NH3 and CO, respectively. Conclusions. In spite of the short duration of sampling, the data can guide future long term monitoring of air quality in Nigeria. The level of SO2 exceeded World Health Organization limits within this short duration. This is an indication of the need for long term air quality monitoring with a sustainable plan for air pollution management.","Ammonia; Carbon monoxide; Industrial and nonindustrial areas; NOx; Ozone; Sulphur dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038361575

Only few sectors of RE can still keep growing with this situation. One of the inexhaustible renewable energy sources in Indonesia is palm trees which produce palm oil that can be further processed into biodiesel that can potentially generate power and electricity as well as promote rural economic development. This paper investigates the use of palm biodiesel in Indonesian power sector, especially in the region of Java, Madura, and Bali (JAMALI). Projection on electricity demand, environmental impact, and emissions reduction over the next 20 years were established into two scenarios. The first situation examines recent energy policy, while the second situation promotes substitution of diesel fuel that is still consumed in the JAMALI power generating system. The effect of palm biodiesel on emissions such as CO2, CO, SO2, NOx, PM, and VOCs were calculated for each scenario. An externality study, resource analysis of palm oil plantations, and the economic feasibility of palm biodiesel were also conducted to accomplish the environmental analysis. The analysis shows the urgency for development of policies that support massive scale of biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel scenario; Emissions; Power generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010193066

In this context, agro-energy based on cultivation of energy crops in marginal lands allows to reduce competition with food crops and marginal lands abandonment, producing incomes for farmers. The aim of this work is to improve the knowledge on a promising crop (Arundo donax L.) for the production of bio-energy in marginal lands. Therefore, the behaviour of this crop was evaluated in three study areas of Campania region, under different energy inputs: two levels of nitrogen fertilisation, N100 and N50 in Sant’Angelo dei Lombardi (SA) and Bellizzi (BL). In Acerra (AC) site compost fertilisation was made to verify its effect on pollutant phytoextraction. In the last year, also crop growth analysis was done in the three sites. The results showed that giant reed confirms its adaptability to low fertility soils, allowing interesting biomass yield also in marginal lands. In more fertile environments, effect of fertilisation is not significant at least in the short term. Nevertheless, nitrogen uptake (65-130 kg N ha-1), also if lower than other highyielding crops, needs to be compensated with fertilisation to avoid depletion of soil nutrient reserves and to guarantee sustainability of this cropping system. Giant reed had a positive environmental impact, due to the improvement in soil fertility (soil organic matter and nitrogen increase) and to the mitigation of climate change (C storage in the soil). In marginal soils of Southern Italy this crop confirms an increasing trend of yield during the first 3-4 years. High productivity levels of this crop are related to the extremely high duration of the vegetative period and thus of the photosynthetic activity (from March to November in the Mediterranean area). These last are well expressed by the leaf area duration index, which is more than double than other high-yielding crops such as maize (280 vs 140 days). © A.

We assume that one of the most effective solutions is ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), which can control a powertrain accurately more than a driver. We have been developing a fuel saving ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) application named ""Sailing-ACC"". Sailing-ACC system uses sailing stop technology which stops engine fuel injection, and disengages a clutch coupling a transmission when a vehicle does not need acceleration torque. This system has a potential to greatly improve fuel efficiency. In this paper, we present a predictive powertrain state switching algorithm using external information (route information, preceding vehicle information). This algorithm calculates appropriate switching timing between a sailing stop mode and an acceleration mode to generate a ""pulse-and-glide"" pattern. In addition, future behavior of a preceding vehicle is predicted with a probabilistic algorithm to optimize switching timing. This algorithm uses a stereo camera and digital map information. As a result of driving experiments in a test course, fuel efficiency was improved by 43.4% in case of following travel around 40km/h. Additionally we evaluated practical performance of Sailing-ACC by simulation which simulated actual environment including a preceding vehicle and planimetric features. A result of following simulation was shown that the developed algorithm improved fuel efficiency by 38.8% during driving in a city area.

In this study, comparison of near-isogenic lines (NILs) revealed changes in stem morphology, cell wall composition, and stem strength. Microscopic analysis of stem cross-sections and chemical analysis of stem tissue indicated that cell walls in tin lines were thicker and more lignified than in freetillering NILs. Increased lignification was associated with stronger stems in tin plants. A candidate gene for tin was identified through map-based cloning and was predicted to encode a cellulose synthase-like (Csl) protein with homology to members of the CslA clade. Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5′UTR region of the Csl gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs.

Primary data regarding fuelwood and synthetic fertilizers consumption were collected through surveys and interviews with tobacco growers in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. Annual fuelwood consumption data (t dm/y) were converted into harvested biomass (m3) using a general wood density value of 0.65 t dm/m3. For annual GHG estimations, methodology outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was applied. The results revealed that fuelwood consumption varies from region to region and amounted to 99,268 t dm and 152,721 m3 during the cropping year 2014–2015. GHG emissions from fuelwood burned by tobacco curing barns are estimated as 160,245 tCO2, 705 tCH4, and 4.74 tN2O in 2014–15. Moreover, consolidated GHG emissions from fuelwood burning in tobacco curing barns in terms of tonne CO2-equivalent using global warming potential for 100-year time horizon is estimated to be 176,564 tCO2e during 2014–15. Similarly, annual nitrogenous fertilizers and urea consumption and consequent N2O and CO2 emissions were 117,223 and 41,084 kg and 347 and 30 tCO2e emissions, respectively. Furthermore, consolidated GHG emissions from synthetic fertilizers consumption in tobacco growing regions are estimated to be 377 tCO2e in 2014–15. Fuelwood harvesting and synthetic fertilizers application by the under study tobacco curing industry is a major cause of GHG emissions and contributes about 0.00094% of the Pakistan's greenhouse gas emissions. The results of a life cycle impact assessment for different synthetic fertilizers applied to produce one kg of green tobacco revealed that NPK (nitrogen–phosphorus–potassium), ammonium nitrate, and urea production and application had the highest contributions to the abiotic depletion, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and global warming potential impact categories. Therefore, it is imperative to take into account hazardous and GHG emissions mitigation strategies from fuelwood harvesting and synthetic fertilizers application by tobacco growers in Pakistan. © 2017","Environmental impacts; Fertilizer; Fuelwood; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pakistan; Tobacco",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014783771

Materials and methods: In this review, we discuss the potential role of biochar for improving crop yields and decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases, along with the potential risks involved with biochar application and strategies to avoid these risks. Results and discussion: Biochar soil amendment improves crop productivity mainly by increasing nutrient use efficiency and water holding capacity. However, improvements to crop production are often recorded in highly degraded and nutrient-poor soils, while its application to fertile and healthy soils does not always increase crop yield. Since biochars are produced from a variety of feedstocks, certain contaminants can be present. Heavy metals in biochar may affect plant growth as well as rhizosphere microbial and faunal communities and functions. Biochar manufacturers should get certification that their products meet International Biochar Initiative (IBI) quality standards (basic utility properties, toxicant assessment, advanced analysis, and soil enhancement properties). Conclusions: The long-term effects of biochar on soil functions and its fate in different soil types require immediate attention. Biochar may change the soil biological community composition and abundance and retain the pesticides applied. As a consequence, weed control in biochar-amended soils may be difficult as preemergence herbicides may become less effective. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biochar; Crop productivity; Soil amendment; Soil fertility; Soil quality","biogenic material; community composition; crop production; decomposition; ecosystem function; growth rate; nutrient use efficiency; rhizosphere; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil improvement; soil microorganism; soil quality; soil water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955595600

However, this vital rate is difficult to estimate with common wildlife management methods. Yet managers would benefit from being able to predict juvenile survival to reliably assess population dynamics for harvest management. In the case of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), previous studies reported that overwinter survival is the demographic parameter that influences population dynamics. We predicted winter survival of mule deer fawns under a range of habitat quality, weather, and predation regimes. We modeled overwinter survival of 2,529 fawns within 11 Population Management Units (PMU) in Idaho, 2003–2013. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of summer plant productivity and both Moderate Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy Snow Data (MODIS SNOW) and the modeled Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) as measures of winter snow conditions to capture spatiotemporal variation in winter survival. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate survival, including covariates at the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for each level: individual, capture site, PMU, and ecotype scales. We evaluated the predictive capacity of models using internal validation and external (out-of-sample) validation procedures comparing non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival estimates with estimates from Bayesian hierarchical models. Statewide survival of fawns from 16 December to 1 June ranged from 0.32 to 0.71 during 2003 to 2013, with relatively low survival in 2006, 2008, and 2011 in most Game Management Units. Survival for individual PMUs ranged from 0.09 in the Weiser-McCall PMU in 2011 to 0.95 in the same PMU in 2005. Internal validation revealed models predicted KM survival well, over a range of R2 from 0.78 to 0.82, with the most complex model explaining the most variance as expected. However, because our goal was to predict winter survival of mule deer in the future, we evaluated our candidate models by withholding 2 years of data and then predicted those years with each model. The best-supported predictive model was our simplest model with 3 covariates, accounting for 71% of the variance in withheld years. Forage quality in late summer-fall increased winter mule deer survival, whereas early and late winter snow cover decreased survival. At finer-spatial scales within ecotypes, our internal validation was slightly better in aspen (0.86), similar in conifer (0.80), and poorer in shrub-steppe (0.60) ecotypes than our best statewide overall survival models, which accounted for 82% of the variance. Our analyses demonstrate the generality versus precision tradeoff across ecotypes and spatial scales to understand the extent that our survival models may be applied to different landscapes with varied predator communities, climate, and plant nutrition. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","Bayesian model; hierarchical model; MODIS; mule deer; Odocoileus hemionus; prediction; SNODAS; survival; weather","Bayesian analysis; data assimilation; deer; demography; habitat quality; hierarchical system; juvenile; MODIS; NDVI; overwintering; population dynamics; predation; prediction; remote sensing; survival; weather; wildlife management; Coniferophyta; Odocoileus hemionus; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016389395

In Alaska enzootic rabies persist in northern and western coastal areas. Only sporadic cases have occurred in areas outside of the regions considered enzootic for the virus, such as the interior of the state and urbanized regions. Results: Here we examine the distribution of diagnosed rabies cases in Alaska, explicit in space and time. We use a geographic information system (GIS), 20 environmental data layers and provide a quantitative non-parsimonious estimate of the predicted ecological niche, based on data mining, machine learning and open access data. We identify ecological correlates and possible drivers that determine the ecological niche of rabies virus in Alaska. More specifically, our models show that rabies cases are closely associated with human infrastructure, and reveal an ecological niche in remote northern wilderness areas. Furthermore a model utilizing climate modeling suggests a reduction of the current ecological niche for detection of rabies virus in Alaska, a state that is disproportionately affected by a changing climate. Conclusions: Our results may help to better inform public health decisions in the future and guide further studies on individual drivers of rabies distribution in the Arctic. © 2017 The Author(s).","Alaska; Data mining; Ecologic niche; Predictions; Rabies","Alaska; algorithm; animal; Arctic; climate change; environment; geographic information system; human; machine learning; physiology; rabies; Rabies virus; theoretical model; veterinary; virology; Alaska; Algorithms; Animals; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Environment; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Rabies; Rabies virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015788037

Due to larger vehicle size and different usage profile, it is expected that the ideal electrification architecture is different than that of a passenger car. The purpose of this study is to identify potential low-voltage electrification solutions for an existing class 2 pickup truck for fuel economy improvement, while taking into account cost effectiveness for large market penetration. One of the potential solutions is presented. In this paper, vehicle electrification configuration concepts are examined by computer simulations. A design of experiment (DOE) is conducted to specify electric powertrain components for each configuration concept.

Investigating the living conditions of the late Miocene hominoids is therefore crucial for a better understanding of how they survived in those refugia. In this study, we present relevant palaeobotanical evidence regarding the habitat, climate and possible plant food resources for the Shuitangba hominoid (Lufengpithecus cf. lufengensis) from the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin, Southwest China. A total of 14 plant taxa were recognized from carpological remains newly recovered from the Zhaotong Basin, among which ten taxa were not reflected in the previous pollen record. These new plant taxa expand our knowledge of the flora and indicate how diverse the ecosystem in the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin was. Based on our carpological taxa, we hypothesize that the Shuitangba hominoid lived in a stratified mixed forest composed of trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs and grasses, near a lake occupied by various aquatic plants. The quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction using the Coexistence Approach (CoA) indicates that the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin had a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 11.3–17.6 °C and a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1042–1547 mm, suggesting a mildly warm and humid climate for the Shuitangba hominoid. It also indicates that the hominoid had warm and wet summers but cool and dry winters, under the influence of the Asian monsoon. Edible and nutritious fruits and seeds of a considerable size, e.g., nuts of Carya and Corylus, fruits of Euryale and Trapa, were possibly exploited by the Shuitangba hominoid. The harder fruits, e.g., nuts of Carya and Corylus, might have benefited the hominoid as a fallback resource in winter when foods were scarce. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diet; Fossil carpology; Palaeoclimate reconstruction; Palaeoenvironment; Zhaotong Basin","climate variation; coexistence; diet; food availability; habitat structure; hominid; Miocene; mixed forest; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; plant community; reconstruction; refugium; temperature profile; China; Yunnan; Zhaotong; Carya; Corylus; Hominoidea; Homo; Poaceae; Trapa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009887591

The relative magnitude of these sources remains poorly constrained over polar regions, affecting our ability to predict their impact on halogen chemistry, cloud formation, and climate. We implement a blowing snow and a frost flower emission scheme in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model, which we validate against multiyear (2001-2008) in situ observations of SSA mass concentrations at three sites in the Arctic, two sites in coastal Antarctica, and from the 2008 ICEALOT cruise in the Arctic. A simulation including only open ocean emissions underestimates SSA mass concentrations by factors of 2-10 during winter-spring for all ground-based and ship-based observations. When blowing snow emissions are added, the model is able to reproduce observed wintertime SSA concentrations, with the model bias decreasing from a range of -80 to -34g% for the open ocean simulation to -2 to +9g% for the simulation with blowing snow emissions. We find that the frost flower parameterization cannot fully explain the high wintertime concentrations and displays a seasonal cycle decreasing too rapidly in early spring. Furthermore, the high day-to-day variability of observed SSA is better reproduced by the blowing snow parameterization. Over the Arctic (>60°N) (Antarctic, >60° S), we calculate that submicron SSA emissions from blowing snow account for 1.0gTggyr-1 (2.5gTggyr-1), while frost flower emissions lead to 0.21gTggyr-1 (0.25gTggyr-1) compared to 0.78gTggyr-1 (1.0gTggyr-1) from the open ocean. Blowing snow emissions are largest in regions where persistent strong winds occur over sea ice (east of Greenland, over the central Arctic, Beaufort Sea, and the Ross and Weddell seas). In contrast, frost flower emissions are largest where cold air temperatures and open leads are co-located (over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, coastal regions of Siberia, and off the Ross and Ronne ice shelves). Overall, in situ observations of mass concentrations of SSA suggest that blowing snow is likely to be the dominant SSA source during winter, with frost flowers playing a much smaller role. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; concentration (composition); cruise report; ground-based measurement; halogen; parameterization; polar region; sea salt; shipborne measurement; Antarctica; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Ronne Ice Shelf; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; West Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015453801

Recent epidemiological studies have identified associations between PM0.1 OA and premature mortality and low birth weight. In this study, the source-oriented UCD/CIT model was used to simulate the concentrations and sources of primary organic aerosols (POA) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in PM0.1 in California for a 9-year (2000-2008) modeling period with 4 km horizontal resolution to provide more insights about PM0.1 OA for health effect studies. As a related quality control, predicted monthly average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) total organic carbon at six major urban sites had mean fractional bias of -0.31 to 0.19 and mean fractional errors of 0.4 to 0.59. The predicted ratio of PM2.5 SOA/OA was lower than estimates derived from chemical mass balance (CMB) calculations by a factor of 2-3, which suggests the potential effects of processes such as POA volatility, additional SOA formation mechanism, and missing sources. OA in PM0.1, the focus size fraction of this study, is dominated by POA. Wood smoke is found to be the single biggest source of PM0.1 OA in winter in California, while meat cooking, mobile emissions (gasoline and diesel engines), and other anthropogenic sources (mainly solvent usage and waste disposal) are the most important sources in summer. Biogenic emissions are predicted to be the largest PM0.1 SOA source, followed by mobile sources and other anthropogenic sources, but these rankings are sensitive to the SOA model used in the calculation. Air pollution control programs aiming to reduce the PM0.1 OA concentrations should consider controlling solvent usage, waste disposal, and mobile emissions in California, but these findings should be revisited after the latest science is incorporated into the SOA exposure calculations. The spatial distributions of SOA associated with different sources are not sensitive to the choice of SOA model, although the absolute amount of SOA can change significantly. Therefore, the spatial distributions of PM0.1 POA and SOA over the 9-year study period provide useful information for epidemiological studies to further investigate the associations with health outcomes. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; concentration (composition); modeling; organic carbon; particulate matter; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018877768

Many scholars have suggested that the success of this emergent regime will depend, at least in part, on its ability to integrate climate action from non-state and subnational entities. Vertical alignment, the linking and coordination of policies between different levels of government, and horizontal alignment, the connection of peer cities and regions through networks of transnational climate governance, can help facilitate needed coherence. But, how do multiple actors link or interact at multiple scales and domains? In this article, we develop an analytical framework for examining different modes of vertical and horizontal alignment that subnational actors have employed to address climate change mitigation. We identify key elements in nine case studies of subnational climate action to examine the intersectionalities of alignment mechanisms that catalyze subnational climate actions. The paper concludes with a discussion about how vertical and horizontal alignment pathways overlap, intersect, and exhibit trade-offs. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.",,"Alignment; Economic and social effects; Alignment mechanism; Case-studies; Climate change mitigation; Climate regime; Horizontal alignment; Multiple actors; Multiple scale; Vertical alignment; Climate change; action plan; analytical framework; climate change; environmental policy; international agreement; local government; mitigation; participatory approach; policy strategy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016928567

Nowhere are solutions to large-scale forest loss more urgently required. To reverse the trend, the Government of Indonesia is banking on carbon market mechanisms like the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) programme. REDD+ is designed to enable the provision of economic compensations to protect forests by making them more valuable standing than cut down. The Sungai Lamandau REDD+ demonstration activity is unique in Indonesia as the first REDD+ project officially proposed by a community group upon land they hope to manage autonomously. Despite the project's 'bottom-up' architecture, for some, access to Sungai Lamandau's REDD+ benefits remain exclusive. These exclusions are not only something imposed by powerful external actors, but has emerged endogenously, through the everyday functioning of gendered market relations, and community-based socio-environmental and ethno-territorial movements. This paper adopts a feminist-inspired intimacy-geopolitics to explore the nuanced powers of exclusion used by Sungai Lamandau's farmers to access the project's non-monetary REDD+ benefits. The paper focuses on 'intimate exclusions' - everyday processes of accumulation and dispossession among villagers and small-holders. In doing so, it highlights the hazards of developing REDD+ projects structured with limited sympathy for marginalised actors. Although the seemingly 'inclusive' benefits sharing structure attracted excellent ethical carbon credit ratings, the project still failed to address (and even exacerbated) existing inequalities - a root cause of Sungai Lamandau's forest degradation.","Exclusion; Forests; Gender; Indonesia; Race; REDD+",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021773329

Reducing conditions in basaltic magmas can be achieved through assimilation of carbonaceous crustal material, which leads to formation of an immiscible, molten, C-rich, native Fe alloy liquid. If this liquid also contains sufficient sulfur, it can undergo further division into conjugate Fe–C-rich and a Fe–S-rich immiscible melts that can effectively scavenge the highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Au, and the platinum group elements [PGE], Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os), as well as Ni and Cu, to economic abundances. Three localities are known globally where native Fe bearing mafic rocks occur: (1) Paleocene basalts of Disko Island, West Greenland; (2) a Miocene lava of the Bühl basalts, Germany; and (3) mafic intrusions associated with the Late Permian Siberian flood basalts. In this contribution, we report major- and minor-element compositions and HSE concentrations for the main alloy phases (FeNi metal and cohenite) and sulfide, for all three known global occurrences of native Fe bearing basalt. Total HSE abundances in metal grains, obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), are lowest in the Bühl basalt, (∼0.05 ppm), intermediate in the Disko Island basalts (4–8 ppm), and highest the Siberian Khungtukun and Dzhaltul intrusions (10–30 ppm). These differences demonstrate that, while native Fe formation is the result of carbonaceous crustal assimilation, HSE enrichment is not ubiquitous during this process. The Siberian occurrences are characterized by Pt PGE (PPGE: Pt, Pd) enrichment relative to the Ir PGE (IPGE: Rh, Ru, Ir, Os), consistent with models of early stage fractionation of olivine, chromite and metallic IPGE in staging magma reservoirs, prior to the addition of C-rich crustal materials in the shallow crust. Relative to Noril'sk Ni–Cu-PGE sulfide ores, the Siberian native Fe basalts are enriched in the PPGE relative to the IPGE, but exhibit Ru enrichments. In contrast, Disko Island native Fe rocks do not show significant fractionation of the PPGE from the IPGE, but have positive Re and Ru anomalies and high Os/Ir ratios. To reconcile these observations, we present a general model where some parental melts experienced early-stage crustal assimilation in staging magma reservoirs, prior to reduction by carbon-rich materials (e.g., Khungtukun, Dzhaltul), whereas basaltic parental melts to Disko Island and Bühl solely experienced interaction with carbonaceous material, resulting in extensive devolatilization, native Fe segregation, and native Fe formation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crustal contamination; Highly siderophile elements; Mass extinction; Native iron; Ore formation; PGE; Siberian flood basalt","crustal contamination; enrichment; flood basalt; fractional crystallization; inductively coupled plasma method; magma assimilation; mass extinction; ore deposit; platinum group element; precious metal; redox conditions; siderophile element; Arctic; Disko Island; Germany; Greenland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012075614

Although small changes in arterial CO2 are particularly potent to change CBF (1mmHgvariation in arterial CO2 changes CBF by3%–4%), the coupling mechanism is incompletely understood. Wetested the hypothesis that astrocytic prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) plays a key role for cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity, and that preserved synthesis of glutathione is essential for the full development of this response. We combined two-photon imaging microscopy in brain slices with in vivo work in rats and C57BL/6J mice to examine the hemodynamic responses to CO2 and somatosensory stimulation before and after inhibition of astrocytic glutathione and PgE2 synthesis. We demonstrate that hypercapnia (increased CO2) evokes an increase in astrocyte [Ca2+]i and stimulates COX-1 activity. The enzyme downstream of COX-1 that synthesizes PgE2 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1) depends critically for its vasodilator activity on the level of glutathione in the brain.Weshow that, when glutathione levels are reduced, astrocyte calcium-evoked release of PgE2 is decreased and vasodilation triggered by increased astrocyte [Ca2+]i in vitro and by hypercapnia in vivo is inhibited. Astrocyte synthetic pathways, dependent on glutathione, are involved in cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2. Reductions in glutathione levels in aging, stroke, or schizophrenia could lead to dysfunctional regulation of CBF and subsequent neuronal damage. © 2017 the authors.","Astrocyte; Calcium; Cerebral blood flow; Glutathione; Hypercapnia","5 (4 chlorophenyl) 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 3 trifluoromethyl 1h pyrazole; glutathione; prostaglandin E2; 1-amino-1,3-dicarboxycyclopentane; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; alpha adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; carbon dioxide; clonidine; cycloleucine; cyclooxygenase 1; glial fibrillary acidic protein; glutathione; membrane protein; neuroprotective agent; noradrenalin; Ptgs1 protein, mouse; aging; animal tissue; Article; astrocyte; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow measurement; fluorescence imaging; hemodynamics; hypercapnia; immunohistochemistry; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; schizophrenia; vasodilatation; analogs and derivatives; animal; astrocyte; brain circulation; C57BL mouse; drug effects; hippocampus; hypercapnia; in vitro study; innervation; metabolism; mouse; newborn; pathology; vibrissa; Wistar rat; Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Astrocytes; Carbon Dioxide; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Clonidine; Cycloleucine; Cyclooxygenase 1; Dinoprostone; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Glutathione; Hippocampus; Hypercapnia; In Vitro Techniques; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neuroprotective Agents; Norepinephrine; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Vibrissae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014468789

We employ the model to explore eight ‘what if’ scenarios based on well-known challenges (e.g. climate change) and current policy debates (e.g. subsidy withdrawal). The findings show that the social-ecological system in the Bangladesh delta may move beyond a safe operating space when a withdrawal of a 50% subsidy for agriculture is combined with the effects of a 2 °C temperature increase and sea level rise. Further reductions in upstream river discharge in the Ganges would push the system towards a dangerous zone once a 3.5 °C temperature increase was reached. The social-ecological system in Bangladesh delta may be operated within a safe space by: 1) managing feedback (e.g. by reducing production costs) and the slow biophysical variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) to increase the long-term resilience, 2) negotiating for transboundary water resources, and 3) revising global policies (e.g. withdrawal of subsidy) that negatively impact at regional scales.

The strategies of partial migratory raptors from Central Europe are, however, unclear for most species. We analysed ring re-encounter data of Eurasian Sparrowhawks Accipter nisus and Common Buzzards Buteo buteo ringed in Germany in terms of distances and directions between ringing and re-encounter sites. We investigated possible differences between sexes (only in Sparrowhawks) and age classes, as well as effects of ringing region, seasonal weather (in the form of North Atlantic Oscillation indices) and long-term temporal changes (including climate change) on migratory strategies by means of generalized linear models. We found that, in both species, migration is mostly conducted by juveniles, although migratory adults were also found. In general, male Sparrowhawks tend to migrate less than females. Sparrowhawks from different regions showed no differences in migration activity and no responses to long-term temporal changes. They did not respond to seasonal weather either. Buzzards showed strong responses to winter weather (‘winter escapes’) predominantly in highland regions, and a reduction of migratory intensity probably due to global warming. We compared our results to ones for Common Kestrels Falco tinnunculus and found most similarities between Kestrels and Sparrowhawks. © 2016, Dt.

Calculations are carried out using the emissions and meteorological data from the year 2012. The modeling tool is the regional CALMET/CALPUFF system, which is used to link the emission sources with the distributions of the annual mean concentrations. Several types of polluting species that characterize the urban atmospheric environment, like PM10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2, Pb, B(a)P, are included in the analysis. The goal of the analysis is to identify the most polluted districts and polluting compounds there, to check where the concentration limits of particular pollutants are exceeded. Then, emission sources (or emission categories) which are mainly responsible for violation of air quality standards and increase the adverse health effects, are identified. The modeling results show how the major emission sources - the energy sector, industry, traffic and the municipal sector - relate to the concentrations calculated in receptor points, including the contribution of the transboundary inflow. The results allow to identify districts where the concentration limits are exceeded and action plans are needed. A quantitative source apportionment shows the emission sources which are mainly responsible for the violation of air quality standards. It is shown that the road transport and the municipal sector are the emission classes which substantially affect air quality in Warsaw. Also transboundary inflow contributes highly to concentrations of some pollutants. The results presented can be of use in analyzing emission reduction policies for the city, as a part of an integrated modeling system. © 2017 Archives of Environmental Protection 2017.","air quality standards; emission inventory; source apportionment; urban air pollution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015192981

The role of metallurgical industry in Finland is significant accounting for 12% of the value of exports. Meanwhile it is also responsible for 7% of CO2 emissions. Sustainability has been in focus during the latest decennia. Foremost progresses in iron and steelmaking for energy saving and reduction of emissions are surveyed in this contribution. Ferroalloys smelting is a highly energy intensive process. Utilization of local low-grade chromite ore led to major technological advances including innovative agglomeration technique, closed smelting furnace with pre-heating and off-gas recovery contributing to high energy efficiency and low carbon footprint in ferrochrome production. In non-ferrous metallurgy developments in flash smelting for copper rose from a need of substantial reduction of energy consumption and SO2 emissions. The focus was then set on energy efficient technologies with low carbon footprint, sulphur fixation and fugitive emissions. Oxygen in smelting, continuous converting, direct to blister and direct nickel matte smelting are the main achievements. The impact of novel technologies to global sulphur emissions and local environmental issues in the smelters has been considerable. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and The AusIMM Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute and The AusIMM.","copper; emissions; energy efficiency; ferroalloys; innovations; iron and steel; nickel; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Copper; Copper smelting; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Ferroalloys; Innovation; Metallurgical furnaces; Metallurgy; Metals; Nickel; Nickel smelting; Particulate emissions; Smelting; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Energy efficient technology; Ferrochrome production; High energy efficiency; Iron and steel; Local environmental issue; Metallurgical industry; Reduction of emissions; Technological advances; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006306809

The surface-energy barriers for both temperatures are determined analytically with a steady-state analysis. The desorption energy per D atom from the surface is 0.69 ± 0.02 eV at 500 K and 0.87 ± 0.03 eV at 600 K. These values are in good agreement with ab initio calculations as well as experimental determination of desorption energies. The absorption energy (from the surface to the bulk) is 1.33 ± 0.04 eV at 500 K, 1.55 ± 0.02 eV at 600 K when assuming that the resurfacing energy (from the bulk to the surface) is 0.2 eV. Thermal-desorption spectrometry data after D atom exposure at 500 K and isothermal desorption at 600 K after D atom exposure at 600 K can be reproduced quantitatively with three bulk-detrapping energies, namely 1.65 ± 0.01 eV, 1.85 ± 0.03 eV and 2.06 ± 0.04 eV, in addition to the intrinsic detrapping energies known for undamaged tungsten (0.85 eV and 1.00 eV). Thanks to analyses of the amount of traps during annealing at different temperatures and ab initio calculations, the 1.65 eV detrapping energy is attributed to jogged dislocations and the 1.85 eV detrapping energy is attributed to dislocation loops. Finally, the 2.06 eV detrapping energy is attributed to D trapping in cavities based on literature reporting observations on the growth of cavities, even though this could also be understood as D desorbing from the C-D bond in the case of hydrocarbon contamination in the experimental sample. © 2017 CEA.","damaged material; deuterium atoms; fuel retention; rate-equation modeling; tungsten","Calculations; Desorption; Deuterium; Polycrystalline materials; Tungsten; Ab initio calculations; Damaged materials; Experimental determination; Fuel retention; Hydrocarbon contamination; Rate-equation models; Steady-state analysis; Thermal desorption spectrometry; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017460977

The EUSF is viewed as a valuable instrument for pooling risk among countries in Europe and potentially as a model for financing loss and damage from climate change in vulnerable countries worldwide. This paper assesses its future prospects taking account of reforms adopted in 2014. Our analysis is based on three recognized aims of the Solidarity Fund: its promotion of solidarity with those countries having the least capacity to cope with major disasters; its contribution to proactive disaster risk reduction and management (climate adaptation); and its robustness with regard to its risk of depletion (stress testing). Using a simulation approach for future disasters, we conclude that the reformed EUSF’s risk of depletion, although it is reasonably robust to more frequent disasters, could be reduced by increasing member state contributions and/or engaging in risk transfer. The European Commission has taken important steps in linking the fund to proactive risk reduction; yet, by changing its budgeting practices, the commission could be more proactive in encouraging risk management in member states. In its current form, the EUSF does not embed needs-based solidarity. Lower-income “new” member states have received disproportionately less compensation in terms of eligible losses, although on average, they have received more disaster aid than what they contribute to the fund. Solidarity could be enhanced by changing the rules for disbursing aid. After briefly describing alternative risk-pooling models in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe, we suggest how design features of the EUSF as compared to other regional risk pools can inform discussions on the Warsaw International Loss and Damage Mechanism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate adaptation; Disaster financing; Disaster risk reduction; European Union Solidarity Fund; Risk pools; Robustness; Solidarity; Stress testing","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; disaster relief; European Commission; European Union; flooding; risk assessment; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944710225

With average precipitation of 15 cm/yr in the arid zones and 120 cm/yr in the temperate zones, feldspar is relatively decreased in stream sand (compared to parent rock) by &lt; 2% and ~ 20%, respectively. Potassium feldspar is more resistant to weathering than plagioclase but is less stable than quartz in temperate climates. Hornblende and biotite are more easily weathered in temperate than arid climates, although their occurrence in medium-grained stream sands is affected by hydraulic sorting and comminution during transport. Temperate-climate sands have lower concentrations of CaO and Na2O compared to K2O and Al2O3, reflective of the expected faster loss of plagioclase than potassium feldspar during weathering. With the exception of biotite, the mineralogy of medium-grained stream sand reflects that of medium-grained weathering profile material in both climates, confirming the findings from constant-climate case studies that the composition of proximal sand is largely achieved within weathering profiles and during initial erosion. We encourage continued attention to climate as a control on sand composition in provenance and paleoclimate studies, where a moderate precipitation shift is capable of producing a significant loss of feldspar.

Here, we examine formerly residential vacant lot soils in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, USA for their potential to provide multiple ecosystem services. We examine two key contrasts: 1) differences between cities and 2) differences within vacant lots created during demolition, specifically pre-existing (i.e., prior to demolition) soils outside of the building footprint and fill soils added within the former building’s footprint. Methods: Deep soil cores were collected from vacant lots in Cleveland and Detroit. Soil properties that are proxies for three ecosystem services were measured: hydraulic conductivity for stormwater retention, topsoil depth and soil nitrogen (N) level for support for plant growth, and soil carbon (C) content for C storage. Results: Both city and soil group contrasts created distinct ecosystem service provisioning based on proxy measures. Cleveland soils had greater hydraulic conductivity and greater soil C and N levels but thinner topsoil layers than Detroit. Within vacant lots of both cities, pre-existing soils had greater soil C and N levels, but lower hydraulic conductivity values than fill soils. Conclusions: Soil properties of vacant lots were generally suitable for providing multiple ecosystem services. City-level differences in soil properties created differences in ecosystem service potential between cities and these differences were evident in pre-existing and fill soils. When comparing between cities, though, fill soils were more similar than pre-existing soils indicating some homogenization of ecosystem service potential with greater redistribution of soil. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).","Cleveland; Detroit; Ecosystem services; Shrinking cities; Vacant lots","carbon sequestration; demolition; ecosystem service; growth; plant; soil carbon; soil depth; soil nitrogen; topsoil; urban area; water retention; Cleveland [Ohio]; Detroit; Michigan; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962138772

Methods We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes. Findings Globally, small and medium farms (≤50 ha) produce 51–77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (&gt;50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75% and 100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (≤20 ha) produce more than 75% of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20–50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (≤2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30% of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81%), roots and tubers (72%), pulses (67%), fruits (66%), fish and livestock products (60%), and cereals (56%) are produced in diverse landscapes (H&gt;1·5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53–81%) and protein (57%) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H&gt;1·5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73%) and oil crops (57%) are produced in less diverse ones (H≤1·5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56%). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size. Interpretation Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

Its deficiency, like in beriberi and in the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, has been studied for many decades. However, its mechanism of action is still not completely understood at the cellular and molecular levels. Since it acts as a coenzyme for dehydrogenases of pyruvate, branched-chain keto acids, and ketoglutarate, its nutritional privation is partly a phenocopy of inborn errors of metabolism, among them maple syrup urine disease. In the present paper, we report metabolic and genomic findings in mice deprived of thiamine. They are similar to the ones we have previously found in biotin deficiency, another ATP generation cofactor. Here we show that thiamine deficiency substantially reduced the energy state in the liver and activated the energy sensor AMP-activated kinase. With this vitamin deficiency, several metabolic parameters changed: blood glucose was diminished and serum lactate was increased, but insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol, as well as liver glycogen, were reduced. These results indicate a severe change in the energy status of the whole organism. Our findings were associated with modified hepatic levels of the mRNAs of several carbon metabolism genes: a reduction of transcripts for liver glucokinase and fatty acid synthase and augmentation of those for carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase as markers for glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, beta-oxidation, and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Glucose tolerance was initially increased, suggesting augmented insulin sensitivity, as we had found in biotin deficiency; however, in the case of thiamine, it was diminished from the III week on, when the deficient animals became undernourished, and paralleled the changes in AKT and mTOR, 2 main proteins in the insulin signaling pathway. Since many of the metabolic and gene expression effects on mice deprived of thiamine are similar to those in biotin deficiency, it may be that they result from a more general impairment of oxidative phosphorylation due to a shortage of ATP generation cofactors. These findings may be relevant to energy-related disorders, among them several inborn errors of metabolism, as well as common energy disorders like obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative illnesses. © 2017 S.

A common trend seen in modern SCR systems is the use of ""split-brick"" configurations where two SCR catalysts are placed in thermally distinct regions of the aftertreatment. One catalyst is close-coupled to the engine for fast light-off and another catalyst is positioned under-floor to improve performance at high space velocities. Typically, a single injector is located upstream of the first catalyst to provide the reductant necessary for efficient NOx reduction. This paper explores the potential benefit, in terms of improved NOx reduction, control of NH3 slip or reduced reductant consumption, of having independently actuated injectors in front of each catalyst. A dynamic programming approach is used to find optimal dosing strategies for both single and multiple injector installations over standard drive cycles. The resulting NOx and NH3 emissions for each case are compared in simulation to provide insight into the conditions where multiple injectors provide the greatest benefit. With these ideal settings, a second injector is found to be advantageous in situations where the control authority of a single injector is restricted but provide limited benefit elsewhere.

Gasification of these materials allows all of the carbon to become available for product generation, a clear advantage over partial biomass conversion into fermentable sugars. Gasification results into a synthesis stream (syngas) containing carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2). Autotrophy-the ability to fix carbon such as CO2 is present in all domains of life but photosynthesis alone is not keeping up with anthropogenic CO2 output. One strategy is to curtail the gaseous atmospheric release by developing waste and syngas conversion technologies. Historically microorganisms have contributed to major, albeit slow, atmospheric composition changes.

In order to understand the influence of climatic factors on OSR, detailed farm-level panel data from 2566 farms across 67 counties of the 6 major OSR production regions in China, from the surveys conducted by the national OSR industry project between 2008 and 2013, were used to examine the contribution of changes in selected climatic variables between 2008 and 2013 to yield variation. Spatial and temporal patterns of the relationships between OSR yield, climatic factors were estimated together with the effects of farmer adaptation and management practices on yield variability. The analysis revealed that yields in the low-latitude production regions were more sensitive to temperature increases and likely to decline. Precipitation iwas the most influential factor on yield at the first two growth stages; temperature and sunshine hours were most important at the third and fourth growth stages, respectively. Labour input was the most influential management factor affecting yields compared with fertilizer and other inputs. The study concludes that projection of future climate change impacts will need inter alia to incorporate more sophisticated and detailed measures of climatic variables than simple means of temperature and precipitation, incorporating timing in relation to plant growth and yield. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Climate and management factors; OSR yield; Spatial and temporal impact","adaptive management; agrometeorology; climate change; crop yield; fertilizer application; precipitation assessment; prediction; China; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015975287

In this study, we attempted to investigate the dispersion behavior of exhaust gas from exhaust pipe using computational fluid dynamics approach. The time-averaged CO2 concentration, velocity and temperature profiles along the centerline of the vehicular exhaust plume were simulated in varied situations. The computational results showed good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical model was validated to be an effective method to investigate the pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a vehicle. Based on it, the numerical simulations were extended to explore the impacts of the emit concentration, the emit direction and the incoming velocity on the flow dynamics and CO2 dispersion. The outputs indicated that the emit concentration could change the pollution level in the near-wake region of a vehicle and the emit direction may alter the spreading direction of the vehicular exhaust plume. The incoming velocity was found to have dominant influence on the dispersion of pollutant due to induced vortices and turbulence behind the vehicle. These findings are expected to provide important insight into evaluating the design and control strategies for alleviating mobile source emissions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Exhaust dispersion; Near-wake region; Vehicular exhaust plume","Air pollution; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Dynamics; Fluid dynamics; Gases; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Pollution; Thermal plumes; Vehicles; Wakes; Computational results; Dispersion behavior; Exhaust dispersion; Exhaust plumes; Mobile source emissions; Near wake; Pollutant dispersions; Temperature profiles; Computational fluid dynamics; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; computational fluid dynamics; computer simulation; concentration (composition); dispersion; exhaust emission; flow velocity; gas flow; numerical model; temperature profile; wake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953403201

In Victoria, Australia, public natural forests extend over 7.2 M ha and constitute a significant and important carbon stock. Recently, a wide range of approaches to estimate carbon stocks within these forests have been developed and applied. However, there are a number of data and estimation limitations associated with these studies. In response, over the last five years, the State of Victoria has implemented a pragmatic plot-based design consisting of pre-stratified permanent observational units located on a state-wide grid. Using the ground sampling grid, we estimated aboveground and belowground carbon stocks (including soil to 0.3 m depth) in both National Parks and State Forests, across a wide range of bioregions. Estimates of carbon stocks and associated uncertainty were conducted using simple design based estimators. We detected significantly more carbon in total aboveground and belowground components in State Forests (408.9 t ha-1, 95% confidence interval 388.8-428.9 t ha-1) than National Parks (267.6 t ha-1, 251.9-283.3 t ha-1). We were also able to estimate forest carbon stocks (and associated uncertainty) for 21 strata that represent all of Victoria's bioregions and public tenures. It is anticipated that the lessons learnt from this study may support the discussion on planning and implementing low cost large area forest carbon stock sampling in other jurisdictions. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon stocks; Designed based estimation; National Forest Inventory; Victorian Forest Monitoring Program","Climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon stocks; Confidence interval; Forest monitoring; Ground sampling; National forest inventories; Natural forests; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Victoria , Australia; Forestry; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon cycle; climate change; design; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; Carbon; Forests; Inventories; Seasonal Variation; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017367956

Climate change conceptual models generally consider lakes and reservoirs together despite the possibility that these systems respond differently to climate-related drivers. Here, we synthesize differences between lake and reservoir characteristics that are likely important for predicting waterbody response to climate change. To better articulate these differences, we revised the energy mass flux framework, a conceptual model for the effects of climate change on lentic ecosystems, to explicitly consider the differential responses of lake versus reservoir ecosystems. The model predicts that catchment and management characteristics will be more important mediators of climate effects in reservoirs than in natural lakes.

Tissue CO2/H+ also functions as the main stimulus for breathing by activating chemosensitive neurons that control respiratory output. Considering that CO2/H+-induced vasodilation would accelerate removal of CO2/H+ and potentially counteract the drive to breathe, we hypothesize that chemosensitive brain regions have adapted a means of preventing vascular CO2/H+-reactivity. Here, we show in rat that purinergic signaling, possibly through P2Y2/4 receptors, in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) maintains arteriole tone during high CO2/H+ and disruption of this mechanism decreases the CO2ventilatory response. Our discovery that CO2/H+-dependent regulation of vascular tone in the RTN is the opposite to the rest of the cerebral vascular tree is novel and fundamentally important for understanding how regulation of vascular tone is tailored to support neural function and behavior, in this case the drive to breathe. © Hawkins et al.",,"purinergic P2Y2 receptor; purinergic P2Y4 receptor; purinergic receptor; carbon dioxide; proton; purinergic receptor; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood vessel tone; breathing; calcium cell level; chemoreceptor; controlled study; electromyography; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; hypercapnia; image analysis; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; rat; respiratory airflow; signal transduction; vascular smooth muscle cell; vasoconstriction; vasodilatation; animal; blood vessel; brain circulation; brain stem; drug effects; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; vasodilatation; Animals; Blood Vessels; Brain Stem; Carbon Dioxide; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Neurons; Protons; Rats; Receptors, Purinergic; Respiration; Vasodilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019646869

In 2015 1456 measurements at the Port of Los Angeles and 694 measurements at the Cottonwood weigh station in northern California were collected. The Port fleet changed little since 2013, increasing the average age (+1.8 years), accompanied by an increase in particle mass (PM) by +266% (0.03 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.01 gPM/kg of fuel) and black carbon (BC) by +300% (0.02 ± 0.003 to 0.08 ± 0.01 gBC/kg of fuel). Particle number (PN) also increased (1.5 × 1014 ± 2.5 × 1013 to 2.8 × 1014 ± 2.8 × 1013 PN/kg of fuel) by a smaller percentage (+87%). Chassis model year 2008 and 2009 vehicles currently dominate the fleet, accounting for the majority of these increases. The long-haul Cottonwood fleet decreased in fleet age (-0.6 model years), where half the decreases in fuel specific PM (-66%), BC (-65%), and PN (-19%) emissions are due to the newer fleet; an increased fraction of pre-2008 chassis model year vehicles with retrofit diesel particulate filters (DPFs) account for the remaining reductions.

Panel data over the period 1990-2014 and the STRIPAT model are used. After panel unit root tests, the method of fully modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) is applied as an analytical technique. Empirical results reveal that urbanization has a positive and significant relationship with CO2 emissions in all BRICS countries with the exception of Russia. Results also show that GDP per capita in cases of Brazil, Russia, and South Africa will help to mitigate CO2 emissions, while the results are opposite in the cases of India and China. Likewise, energy consumption is positively and significantly causing CO2 emissions in cases of Brazil, India, and China, whereas, it is helping to reduce CO2 emission in Russia, while energy consumption has no impact in the case of South Africa. The findings of the study suggest important policy implications.

Rice, the staple food of about 50% of global population and consumed at the rate of one-fifth of the total global calorie count, is grown in wetland systems. The total area of wetlands in Bangladesh is about 7-8 million ha, which constitutes about 50% of the land surface of the country. Wetlands of Bangladesh encompass haors (freshwater marshes of bowl or saucer-shaped shallow depression), baors (oxbow lakes - dead arms of a river), beels (saucer-shaped deeper part of the floodplain landscape), fishponds and dighi (large ponds), flooded rice lands and floodplains, natural lakes, man-made reservoirs (Kaptai Lake), and coastal (Sundarbans) and marine (St. Martin's Coral Island) areas. Wetlands are rich in flora and fauna (300 plant species, 400 vertebrate species, and 260 freshwater fish species are dependent on wetlands of Bangladesh). Some wetlands of Bangladesh are of national and international significance such as Tanguar haor (Ramsar and an Ecologically Critical Area), Hakaluki haor (Ecologically Critical Area), Sundarbans (Ramsar and UNESCO World Heritage Site and Ecologically Critical Area), and St. Martin's Coral Island (Ecologically Critical Area). About two-thirds of people in Bangladesh depend on wetlands for a variety of purposes including water (drinking, irrigation), food production (agriculture, aquaculture), fishing, livestock grazing, bird hunting, fire-/fuelwoods, medicinal plants, wild food, honey, waterway transportation, harvesting grasses and seaweeds, and tourism/recreational business. Some poorest of the poor in the vicinity depend totally on the goods and services of the wetland for livelihood. Apart from biodiversity and livelihood support, wetlands have additional significances as a source and sink for greenhouse gases and in mitigation of disasters in Bangladesh. Livelihood diversification, awareness, and education of local communities on preservation and conservation of wetlands would be needed to reduce pressure on wetland resources. © Springer (India) Pvt.

Oxygen levels in the shallow marine settings critical to these events were lower than today's, although how much lower is debated. Here, we use concentrations of iodate (the oxidized iodine species) in shallow-marine limestones and dolostones to generate the first comprehensive record of Proterozoic near-surface marine redox conditions. The iodine proxy is sensitive to both local oxygen availability and the relative proximity to anoxic waters. To assess the validity of our approach, Neogene–Quaternary carbonates are used to demonstrate that diagenesis most often decreases and is unlikely to increase carbonate-iodine contents. Despite the potential for diagenetic loss, maximum Proterozoic carbonate iodine levels are elevated relative to those of the Archean, particularly during the Lomagundi and Shuram carbon isotope excursions of the Paleo- and Neoproterozoic, respectively. For the Shuram anomaly, comparisons to Neogene–Quaternary carbonates suggest that diagenesis is not responsible for the observed iodine trends. The baseline low iodine levels in Proterozoic carbonates, relative to the Phanerozoic, are linked to a shallow oxic–anoxic interface. Oxygen concentrations in surface waters would have at least intermittently been above the threshold required to support eukaryotes. However, the diagnostically low iodine data from mid-Proterozoic shallow-water carbonates, relative to those of the bracketing time intervals, are consistent with a dynamic chemocline and anoxic waters that would have episodically mixed upward and laterally into the shallow oceans. This redox instability may have challenged early eukaryotic diversification and expansion, creating an evolutionary landscape unfavorable for the emergence of animals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bahamas; carbonate diagenesis; iodine; metazoan evolution; Proterozoic oxygen; Shuram isotope anomaly","Carbon; Carbonates; Carbonation; Isotopes; Oxygen; Sedimentology; Bahamas; Carbon isotope excursions; Isotope anomalies; metazoan evolution; Oxygen concentrations; Proterozoic; Proterozoic carbonates; Shallow water carbonates; Iodine; carbon isotope; carbonate sediment; diagenesis; dolostone; eukaryote; iodine; limestone; oxygen; Proterozoic; redox conditions; sea surface; Bahamas; Animalia; Eukaryota; Metazoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012927399

In this study, by establishing a life cycle assessment framework, GHG emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries in China are estimated. The results show that for the three types of most commonly used lithium-ion batteries, the (LFP) battery, the (NMC) battery and the (LMO) battery, the GHG emissions from the production of a 28 kWh battery are 3061 kgCO2-eq, 2912 kgCO2-eq and 2705 kgCO2-eq, respectively. This implies around a 30% increase in GHG emissions from vehicle production compared with conventional vehicles. The productions of cathode materials and wrought aluminum are the dominating contributors of GHG emissions, together accounting for around three quarters of total emissions. From the perspective of process energy use, around 40% of total emissions are associated with electricity use, for which the GHG emissions in China are over two times higher than the level in the United States. According to our analysis, it is recommended that great efforts are needed to reduce the GHG emissions from battery production in China, with improving the production of cathodes as the essential measure. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Lithium-ion battery","aluminum; carbon dioxide; electric vehicle; electricity; emission inventory; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; lithium; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017365606

Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on agriculture and ecosystem services for their livelihoods. There is an urgent need to develop national and local adaptation responses to reduce these impacts, yet evidence from historical climate change is fragmentary. Modeling efforts help bridge this gap. Here, we review the past decade of research on agricultural and ecological climate change impact models for Central America. The results of this review provide insights into the expected impacts of climate change and suggest policy actions that can help minimize these impacts. Modeling indicates future climate-driven changes, often declines, in suitability for Central American crops. Declines in suitability for coffee, a central crop in the regional economy, are noteworthy. Ecosystem models suggest that climate-driven changes are likely at low- and high-elevation montane forest transitions. Modeling of vulnerability suggests that smallholders in many parts of the region have one or more vulnerability factors that put them at risk. Initial adaptation policies can be guided by these existing modeling results. At the same time, improved modeling is being developed that will allow policy action specifically targeted to vulnerable groups, crops, and locations. We suggest that more robust modeling of ecological responses to climate change, improved representation of the region in climate models, and simulation of climate influences on crop yields and diseases (especially coffee leaf rust) are key priorities for future research. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Regional planning; Adaptation policies; Climate change impact; Ecological response; Ecosystem services; Local adaptation; Smallholder farmers; Vulnerability factors; Vulnerable groups; Climate change; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; climate modeling; coffee; crop yield; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; ecosystem service; environmental policy; future prospect; livelihood; montane forest; policy analysis; regional climate; regional economy; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007500020

Population-level exposure to air pollution during active travel is understudied. Objectives: Our goals were a) to investigate population-level patterns in exposure during active travel, based on spatial estimates of bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, and particulate concentrations; and b) to assess how those exposure patterns are associated with the built environment. Methods: We employed facility–demand models (active travel) and land use regression models (particulate concentrations) to estimate block-level (n = 13,604) exposure during rush-hour (1600–1800 hours) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We used the model-derived estimates to identify land use patterns and characteristics of the street network that are health promoting. We also assessed how exposure is correlated with indicators of health disparities (e.g., household income, proportion of nonwhite residents). Our work uses population-level rates of active travel (i.e., traffic flows) rather than the probability of walking or biking (i.e., “walkability” or “bikeability”) to assess exposure. Results: Active travel often occurs on high-traffic streets or near activity centers where particulate concentrations are highest (i.e., 20–42% of active travel occurs on blocks with high population-level exposure). Only 2–3% of blocks (3–8% of total active travel) are “sweet spots” (i.e., high active travel, low particulate concentrations); sweet spots are located a) near but slightly removed from the city-center or b) on off-street trails. We identified 1,721 blocks (~ 20% of local roads) where shifting active travel from high-traffic roads to adjacent low-traffic roads would reduce exposure by ~ 15%. Active travel is correlated with population density, land use mix, open space, and retail area; particulate concentrations were mostly unchanged with land use. Conclusions: Public health officials and urban planners may use our findings to promote healthy transportation choices. When designing health-promoting cities, benefits (physical activity) as well as hazards (air pollution) should be evaluated. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The properties of these formulations were investigated in terms from gas production, appropriate combustion temperature and nontoxic gaseous emission. REAL software calculation program [1] was used to calculate the combustion heat at constant pressure, combustion heat at constant volume and specific volume in standard state. It showed that gas generators based on GZT with nitrate salts as oxidant exhibited better performance. Thus its thermal behavior and combustion temperature were studied further and the experimental results were consistent with the theoretical calculation results. Therefore, it can be concluded that formulation 3 has comprehensive optimal performance: low moisture content, insensitivity to friction, heightened vacuum stability, high combustion heat and specific volume. Namely, formulation 3 exhibited the most promising indications of commercial application, such as using in air bags of motor vehicles. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our graph-based approach and its computational aspects allow for factor ranking(s) according to their importance to the network both numerically and visually, for certain settlement types. Our contribution provides quantitative estimates of impacts and adaptation potentials of five potential effects of climate change (migration, flooding-landslides-fire, air and water pollution, human health and energy-water-other resources) which play a substantial role at the synergistic impact mechanism. By using graph visualization techniques, the structure of the synergistic impact mechanism is self-evident.

This paper is Part II of a two-part review, which presents a summary of fundamental and applied research on pathways to fire spread in the wildland urban interface. Part I discussed the fundamentals of wildland fire spread via radiative heat transfer, direct flame contact, and firebrand exposure. Here in Part II, we cover the response of building components and systems, as well as mitigation strategies used to prevent fire spread into and within communities in the United States. Post-fire investigations, full-scale structural testing, individual component testing, and combined systems or assembly testing have been used to identify building component and system vulnerabilities such as roofs, vents, siding, decks, fences, and mulch. Using results from these tests and investigations at different scales, some knowledge has been gained on specific vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, but a quantitative framework has not yet been established. On a community level, the layout of structures and the space between them has been shown to be incredibly important in mitigating wildfire risk. More locally, defensible space around homes has been effective in mitigating exposure from both radiation and direct flame contact. Firebrands still remain a challenge; however, many design recommendations have been proposed to harden structures against firebrand exposures. Recommendations for future research and development are also presented. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Embers; Fire spread; Firebrands; Wildfire; Wildland fire; Wildland urban interface; WUI","Building components; Climate change; Heat transfer; Interface states; Embers; Fire spread; Firebrands; Wildfire; Wildland fire; Wildland urban interface; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969808326

By solving an optimal control problem for a nonlinear, time-varying system, IAMs enable the determination of economically optimal pathways for emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Central to any IAM is a climate model capturing the dynamic response of global surface temperature to changes in net downward radiative forcing due to the atmospheric accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The transient climate response (TCR), defined as the temperature change at the time of CO2 doubling under a scenario in which CO2 concentrations increase by 1%yr-1, plays a central role in quantifying the economic impacts of climate change on policy-relevant timescales. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based methodology for computing the parameters of a climate model in such a way that the resulting model exhibits a specified TCR. The methodology developed in this paper targets the climate model parameterization employed in DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy), a widely-studied IAM for which TCR is only indirectly specified.

This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioenergy production; BMPs; climate change; cover crops; land use and management; riparian buffer; switchgrass","Biomass; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Suspended sediments; Water quality; Watersheds; Bioenergy productions; BMPs; Cover crops; Land use and managements; Riparian buffers; Switchgrass; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; biomass; buffer zone; climate change; cover crop; crop production; grass; land management; nitrogen; phosphorus; streamflow; suspended sediment; sustainability; water footprint; water quality; Corn Belt; Iowa; South Fork Iowa River; United States; Glycine max; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014996632

It was shown that phenylephrine, an activator of receptorregulated calcium uptake, enhanced the relaxing action of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide. In contrast, inhibition of the membrane potassium conductance, especially its voltage-dependent component, decreased the myogenic effects of carbon monoxide in the smooth muscles. The effects of hydrogen sulfide depended on its concentration and the means of activation of the cell transport systems. Furthermore, sodium-dependent components of the membrane conductivity are also involved in the effects of this gasotransmitter on ion transport systems in addition to the calcium and potassium conductance. This expands the range of the potential gasotransmitter-affected targets of signaling pathways, which may result in either activation or inhibition of cell functions. The consequences of such impacts on the functionally significant responses of cells, organs, and systems should be taken into account in various physiological and pathological states. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","carbon monoxide; hydrogen sulfide; Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransporter; potassium conductance of membrane; smooth muscle cells",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020686246

Air pollution is increasing and causing global warming, rise in sea level, change in seasonal patterns, rainfall pattern, extreme summer and winter temperatures, droughts and floods, etc. along with various endemic and epidemic diseases. There is a lack of understanding of air pollution and related health risk. The condition of air quality in India is poor. As many as 54% of Indians live in cities not meeting NAAQS standards on fine particulate matter and none of the cities meeting WHO standards. The whole world, including India, is worried about the degradation of air quality which is affecting every form of life and material; hence there is a need for extensive study on the causes, effects and mitigation of air pollution. A scientific model is proposed to control environmental pollution. The ultimate solution of global warming climate change problem is making the people aware about the causes, consequences, and control of energy consumption through environmental consciousness. © 2016 IEEE.","air pollution; climate change; modeling; pollution control","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Climate change; Energy utilization; Global warming; Health risks; Models; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Quality control; Rain; Sea level; Control of energies; Environmental pollutions; Epidemic disease; Fine particulate matter; Global challenges; Rainfall patterns; Scientific modeling; Seasonal patterns; Pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020218237

But as the climate change intensifies, P. tabulaeformis forests are experiencing soil water deficit and nitrogen deposition during growth season. Thus an experiment was carried out to investigate the interaction of different soil water content and N addition on the growth and photosynthesis of P. tabulaeformis seedlings by measuring whole-plant growth, leaf area, biomass production and allocation, leaf photosynthesis, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Method: Two-year-old seedlings of P. tabulaeformis were subjected to a nested design with four soil water regimes (W1, W2, W3, and W4) and four N addition levels (N1, N2, N3 and N4). Result: The result showed that N addition significantly enhanced growth and biomass production of the seedlings under plentiful soil water conditions (W3 and W4), but aggregated the negative effect of low soil water treatments (W1 and W2) on plant growth. Moreover, N addition was able to lead to an increase in photosynthetic capacity under high soil water conditions (W3 and W4), but a decrease in low soil water treatments (W1 and W2), which was paralleled with the shifts of PSII actual efficiency and PSII photochemical quenching. Furthermore, W3N2 treatment was the appropriate N supply and optimum soil water conditions to growth, biomass production, and photosynthetic capacity of P. tabulaeformis seedlings. Conclusion: These results suggest N deposition might be beneficial to biomass production and photosynthesis of P. tabulaeformis forests in the central and northeast areas in China with abundant rainfall, but harmful to P. tabulaeformis forests in the northwest arid and semi-arid regions. Thus, in the northwest arid and semi-arid regions in China, P. tabulaeformis should no longer be used as afforestation and reforestation tree species in ecological restoration and soil conservation programs. © 2017, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

Agriculture is the largest consumer of phosphorus, which is a non-renewable resource. Cotton accounts for one third of all natural and synthetic fibres of the total textile production. Today, Xinjiang, China, has become one of the most important cotton producers with highest yields worldwide. The aim of this study was to calculate the carbon (climate footprint and energy footprint) and phosphorus footprint of this high yielding cotton production and compare it to a theoretical production of an alternative fibre from Apocynum (local name: Kendyr or Kutra), which is a bast fibre plant native in Xinjiang and Central Asia. The data of the cotton production was collected through farm interviews during six years in Xinjiang. The data for Apocynum was compiled by literature from field experiments in the former Soviet Union. Cotton fibres, mainly due to high fertiliser inputs, caused a climate footprint of 4.43 kg CO2e/kg fibre, an energy footprint of 30.90 MJ/kg fibre, and a phosphorus footprint of 101 g P/kg fibre. The footprints of Apocynum are significantly lower with a climate footprint of 1.93 kg CO2e/kg fibre, an energy footprint of 21.85 MJ/kg fibre, and a phosphorus footprint of 1.6 g P/kg fibre. In cotton production, 63.9% of the climate footprint and 68.4% of the energy footprint are attributed to fertiliser production. Soil emissions of N2O account for another 22.2% of the climate footprint of cotton. The biggest potential to reduce carbon and phosphorus footprints of cotton production lie in reduced fertiliser application and re-use of plant residues. In the case of Apocynum, 65.1% of the climate footprint and 64.1% of the energy footprint are attributed to chemical treatment of the fibres in the extraction process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural emissions; Central Asia; Irrigated agriculture; Natural fibres; Phosphorus use; Textiles","Agriculture; Climate change; Cotton; Fertilizers; Fibers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural fibers; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Textiles; Agricultural emissions; Central Asia; Chemical treatments; Climate footprints; Extraction process; Irrigated agriculture; Non-renewable resource; Textile production; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014932488

This ‘mesoscale’ influence is known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect and results largely from modification of surface properties leading to greater absorption of solar radiation, reduced convective cooling and lower water evaporation rates. Cities typically contain less vegetation and bodies of water than rural areas, and existing green and bluespace is often under threat from increasing population densities. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the key ways in which green and bluespace affect both urban canopy- and boundary-layer temperatures, examined from the perspectives of city-planning, urban climatology and climate science. The analysis suggests that the evapotranspiration-based cooling influence of both green and bluespace is primarily relevant for urban canopy-layer conditions, and that tree-dominated greenspace offers the greatest heat stress relief when it is most needed. However, the magnitude and transport of cooling experienced depends on size, spread, and geometry of greenspaces, with some solitary large parks found to offer minimal boundary-layer cooling. Contribution to cooling at the scale of the urban boundary-layer climate is attributed mainly to greenspace increasing surface roughness and thereby improving convection efficiency rather than evaporation. Although bluespace cooling and transport during the day can be substantial, nocturnal warming is highlighted as likely when conditions are most oppressive. However, when both features are employed together they can offer many synergistic ecosystem benefits including cooling. The ways in which green and bluespace infrastructure is applied in future urban growth strategies, particularly in countries expected to experience rapid urbanisation, warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the UHI and enhance climate resilience. © 2017 The Author(s)","Blue infrastructure; Bluespace; Evapotranspiration; Green infrastructure; Greenspace; Urban heat island","Absorption cooling; Atmospheric temperature; Boundary layers; Climatology; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Heat convection; Planning; Population statistics; Rural areas; Stress relief; Surface roughness; Thermal pollution; Water absorption; Blue infrastructure; Bluespace; Green infrastructure; Greenspace; Urban heat island; Urban growth; water; boundary layer; climatology; cooling; evapotranspiration; greenspace; heat island; infrastructure; urban planning; Article; canopy; city planning; climate; ecosystem; environmental temperature; evaporation; evapotranspiration; heat stress; microclimate; population density; solar radiation; surface property; thermodynamics; urban head island; urban rural difference; urbanization; vegetation; warming; article; boundary layer; climate resilience; cooling; evapotranspiration; geometry; heat stress; human; meta analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027929139

It also discusses the impact of future climate variation on building energy use and identifies a method to incorporate climate resilience planning as part of the design process. Reducing energy use offers an optimum path to build resilience to changing climate by lowering grid dependency for normal building operation. This effort should first begin with the design community. High performance building design should be based on customized local strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approach, but has not been viewed in this light by policymakers. This oversight presents a serious limitation in current industry practices, since there are no policies or guidelines for architects and engineers to incorporate the most adaptive design upgrades in their building projects.

The methods and ancillary information used for the spatial and temporal disaggregation and speciation of the emissions are presented and discussed. The resulting emission system is evaluated, and a case study on CO, NO2, O3, VOC and PM2.5 concentrations is conducted to demonstrate its applicability. Moreover, resulting traffic emissions from the Mobile Source Emission Factor Model for Mexico (MOBILE6.2-Mexico) and the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator for Mexico (MOVES-Mexico) models are integrated in the tool to assess and compare their performance. NOx and VOC total emissions modelled are reduced by 37% and 26% in the MCMA when replacing MOBILE6.2-Mexico for MOVES-Mexico traffic emissions. In terms of air quality, the system composed by the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled with the HERMES-Mex and CMAQ models properly reproduces the pollutant levels and patterns measured in the MCMA. The system's performance clearly improves in urban stations with a strong influence of traffic sources when applying MOVES-Mexico emissions.

In the present study, we compared in situ measurements of plankton carbon metabolism (primary production and respiration) to calculated air–water CO2 fluxes (based on abiotic parameters) during 1 year (2008) in a hypereutrophic tropical estuary (Recife Harbor, NE Brazil – 08°03′S, 34°52′W) to test the hypothesis that high productivity leads to a net CO2 flux from the atmosphere. The calculated CO2 fluxes through the air–water interface (FCO2) were negative throughout the year (FCO2: –2 to –9 mmol C·m−2·day−1), indicating that Recife Harbor is an atmospheric CO2 sink. Respiration rates of the plankton community ranged from 2 to 45 mmol C·m−2·hr−1. Gross primary production ranged from 0.2 to 281 mmol C·m−2·hr−1, exceeding respiration during most of the year (net autotrophy), except for the end of the wet season, when the water column was net heterotrophic.

Island spatiality encourages renewable energy and sustainability initiatives that emphasise iconicity and are undertaken in order to gain competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism, claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance or obviate the need for more comprehensive policy action. Without necessarily contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, the pursuit of eco-island status can raise costs without raising income, distract from more pressing social and environmental problems, lead to competitive sustainability and provide green cover behind which communities can maintain unsustainable practices. We argue that eco-islands do not successfully encourage wider sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Instead, island communities may place themselves in eco-island traps. Islands may invest in inefficient or ineffective renewable energy and sustainability initiatives in order to maintain illusory eco-island status for the benefit of ecotourism, thereby becoming trapped by the eco-label. Islands may also chase the diminishing returns of ever-more comprehensive and difficult to achieve sustainability, becoming trapped into serving as eco-island exemplars. We conclude by arguing that island communities should pursue locally contextualised development, potentially focused on climate change adaptation, rather than focus on an eco-island status that is oriented toward place branding and ecotourism. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)","climate change mitigation; conspicuous sustainability; ecotourism; islands; renewable energy; sustainability","adaptive management; alternative energy; climate change; ecotourism; environmental management; renewable resource; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986331098

Most of the current strategies fall into the category of low temperature combustion (LTC), which allow emissions mandates to be met in-cylinder along with anticipated reduction in cost and complexity. These strategies, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI), partially premixed combustion (PPC) and reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), use early injection timings, resulting in a highly lean charge with increased specific heat ratios to improve thermal efficiency and reduce PM emissions. Lower combustion temperatures also avoid the activation of NOx formation reactions. However, the lean air/fuel ratio decreases fuel oxidation rates of CO and HC and, due to longer ignition delays with high peak pressure rise rate (PPRR) and heat release rates (HRR), confines the engine's operating loads and speeds. A strategy to reduce these negative effects of LTC is RCCI, which generally uses two fuels with different reactivities in order to optimize ignitability and equivalence ratio stratification. It has demonstrated improvements in efficiency and low NOx and PM emissions by utilizing in-cylinder fuel blending, while the simultaneous optimization of fuel reactivity results in increased engine operating space. The current work investigates Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) combustion in a light-duty multi-cylinder engine over steady-state operating conditions with custom designed, 15.3:1 compression ratio, pistons. Experiments were conducted using mixtures of gasoline and diesel, i.e., ""dieseline"", as the high reactivity fuel and a comparison to gasoline/diesel RCCI combustion is made. The tests were performed over a broad selection of ""ad hoc"" load and speed points in order to examine performance and emission effects of a less reactive direct-injected (DI) fuel mixture to in turn reduce the need for a second fuel.

RCCI has demonstrated improvements in efficiency along with low NOx and PM emissions by utilizing in-cylinder fuel blending, generally using two fuels with different reactivity in order to optimize stratification. In the present work, a ""single-fuel"" approach for RCCI combustion using port-injected gasoline and direct-injected gasoline mixed with a small amount of the cetane improver 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) was studied with custom designed, compression ratio (CR) of 13.75:1, pistons under transient conditions. The EHN volume percentage in the mixture for the direct-injected fuel was set at 3%. In an experimental investigation, comparisons were made to transient RCCI combustion operation with gasoline/diesel. The experiments were performed over a step load change from 1 to 4 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) at constant 1500 rev/min on a General Motors (GM) Z19DTH 1.9-L diesel engine. The transients were conducted by changing the accelerator pedal command to provide a desired torque output with a DRIVVEN engine control unit (ECU) that replaced the original Bosch ECU. All relevant engine parameters are adjusted accordingly, based on 2D-tables. Previous to the transient engine operation, four steady-state points were used to obtain performance and emission values. Engine calibration at these four points, as well as the interpolation of the intermediate points, allowed for smooth operation during the instantaneous step changes. Differences between the steady-state and transient results indicate the complexity of transient operation and show the need for additional controls to minimize undesirable effects. The steady-state points were calibrated by modifying the fuel injection strategy (actual start of injection (aSOI) timing, port-fuel injection (PFI) fraction, etc.), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and rail pressure in order to obtain predefined values for the crank-angle at 50% of total heat release (CA50). Furthermore, emission targets (HC1 &lt; 1500 ppmC3, NO &lt; 10 ppm, filter smoke number (FSN)&lt;0.1 with a maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) &lt; 10 bar/deg) and noise level targets (&lt;95 dB) for RCCI combustion were maintained during the calibration and mapping. The tests were performed with a closed-loop (CL) calibration by using a next-cycle (NC) controller to adjust the PFI ratio of each cycle in order to reach the steady-state CA50 values in the table. The results show that single-fuel RCCI operation can be achieved, but requires significant alteration of the operating conditions, and NOx emissions were significantly elevated for gasoline/gasoline-EHN operation. While combustion phasing could not be matched, UHC1 emissions were at a similar level as for gasoline/diesel combustion. It is expected that the implementation of different injection strategies and boosted operation, combined with use of higher compression ratio pistons in order to compensate for the lower reactivity direct injection (DI) fuel, could raise the potential for improved performance.

While the luminescence is uniform along the non-polar {1-100} sidewalls, nano-cathodoluminescence shows a sharp reduction in the luminescent intensity at the intersection of the non-polar {1-100} facets. The reduction in the luminescent intensity is accompanied by a reduction in the emission energy localised at the apex of the corners. Correlative compositional analysis reveals an increasing indium content towards the corner except at the apex itself.

The combination of wideband receivers and spectrometers currently available in (sub-)millimeter observatories deliver wide-field hyperspectral imaging of the interstellar medium. Tens of spectral lines can be observed over degree wide fields in about 50 h. This wealth of data calls for restating the physical questions about the interstellar medium in statistical terms. Aims. We aim to gain information on the physical structure of the interstellar medium from a statistical analysis of many lines from different species over a large field of view, without requiring detailed radiative transfer or astrochemical modeling. Methods. We coupled a non-linear rescaling of the data with one of the simplest multivariate analysis methods, namely the principal component analysis, to decompose the observed signal into components that we interpret first qualitatively and then quantitatively based on our deep knowledge of the observed region and of the astrochemistry at play. Results. We identify three principal components, linear compositions of line brightness temperatures, that are correlated at various levels with the column density, the volume density and the UV radiation field. Conclusions. When sampling a sufficiently diverse mixture of physical parameters, it is possible to decompose the molecular emission in order to gain physical insight on the observed interstellar medium. This opens a new avenue for future studies of the interstellar medium. © 2017 ESO.","ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects: Orion B; ISM: molecules; Methods: statistical; Photon-dominated region (PDR)","Fault tolerant computer systems; Hyperspectral imaging; Multivariant analysis; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; ISM : clouds; ISM: individual objects: Orion; ISM: molecules; Methods:statistical; Photon dominated regions; Principal component analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015203440

Consistent with this reasoning, they have shown that from the middle of the last century up through the mid-1990s, nations with more memberships in NGOs have tended to have lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aggregate. Doubts remain, however, about whether NGOs have reduced emissions in the time since and at the level of individual power plants where the lion's share of carbon pollution is emitted. Using plant-specific information on CO2 emissions recently collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, we investigate the effects of local environmental NGOs (ENGOs) on plants’ environmental performance. Consistent with our expectations, we find that local ENGOs not only directly reduce plants’ emissions but indirectly do so by enhancing the effectiveness of subnational climate policies that encourage energy efficiency.

Relative changes in simulated mean annual runoff (MAR) and four indicators of high and low extreme flows are compared between the two ensembles. The ensemble median values of changes in runoff with three different scenarios of global-mean warming (1, 2 and 3 °C above pre-industrial levels) are generally similar between the two ensembles, although the ensemble spread is often larger for the Glob-HM ensemble. In addition the ensemble spread is normally larger than the difference between the two ensemble medians. Whilst we find compelling evidence for projected runoff changes for the Rhine (decrease), Tagus (decrease) and Lena (increase) with global warming, the sign and magnitude of change for the other catchments is unclear. Our model results highlight that for these three catchments in particular, global climate change mitigation, which limits global-mean temperature rise to below 2 °C above preindustrial levels, could avoid some of the hydrological hazards that could be seen with higher magnitudes of global warming. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Global warming; Hydrology; Climate change impact assessments; Global climate changes; Global mean warming; Global-mean temperature; Hydrological models; Mean annual runoffs; Pre-industrial levels; Upper Mississippi; Runoff; catchment; ensemble forecasting; global climate; global warming; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; river basin; runoff; streamflow; Amazon Basin; Australia; Darling Basin; Ganges Basin; Mississippi River; Murray-Darling Basin; Niger Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994460618

However, typical UVAI retrieval requires at least two UV channels, while several satellite instruments, such as the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) instrument onboard a Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), provide single channel UV radiances. In this study, a new UVAI retrieval method was developed which uses a single UV channel. A single channel aerosol index (SAI) is defined to measure the extent to which an absorbing aerosol state differs from its state with minimized absorption by aerosol. The SAI qualitatively represents absorbing aerosols by considering a 30-day minimum composite and the variability in aerosol absorption. This study examines the feasibility of detecting absorbing aerosols using a UV-constrained satellite, focusing on those which have a single UV channel. The Vector LInearized pseudo-spherical Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) was used to test the sensitivity of the SAI and UVAI to aerosol optical properties. The theoretical calculations showed that highly absorbing aerosols have a meaningful correlation with SAI. The retrieved SAI from OMI and operational OMI UVAI were also in good agreement when UVAI values were greater than 0.7 (the absorption criteria of UVAI). The retrieved SAI from the TANSO-CAI data was compared with operational OMI UVAI data, demonstrating a reasonable agreement and low rate of false detection for cases of absorbing aerosols in East Asia. The SAI retrieved from TANSO-CAI was in better agreement with OMI UVAI, particularly for the values greater than the absorbing threshold value of 0.7. © 2017 by the authors.","Aerosol; CAI; OMI; Single channel; UV Aerosol Index","Arid regions; Carbon; Computer aided instruction; Greenhouse gases; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Optical properties; Satellites; Aerosol absorption; Aerosol index; Aerosol optical property; Greenhouse gases observing satellites; Near-infrared sensors; Satellite instruments; Single channels; Theoretical calculations; Aerosols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017639846

While observers of CAIR claim success in the reduction of air pollution, our innovative multivariate statistical analysis based on spatial and facility-level panel data finds mixed results concerning the rule's effectiveness. On the one hand, we find that CAIR facilities are associated with increases in the reduction rate of pollution compared to non-CAIR facilities. However, the evidence suggests that sulfur dioxide levels decreased in CAIR-mandated facilities before the actual implementation of the program. Additionally, on the one hand, CAIR facilities in the interior of states are associated with slower pollution reduction rates than those on the border. However, this difference in reduction rate does not change dramatically before or after the adoption or implementation of this rule. This suggests that the CAIR program was ineffective in targeting specific facilities most likely to contribute to interstate pollution. We conclude that while CAIR spurred the electrical utility industry to reduce air pollution, some of these reductions occurred before the actual implementation of the program. More substantially, gains in interstate spillover pollution did not occur by targeting specific facilities most likely to spillover but rather through the overall reduction of air pollution in the eastern states. © 2016 Policy Studies Organization.","energy; environment; governance; pollution; regional governance","atmospheric pollution; governance approach; industrial emission; nitrogen oxides; pollution control; sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006850971

Little progress has however been made, as shown by Article 10 of the Paris Agreement. One reason is that these technologies could become vital assets to compete on global markets. This paper presents a partial equilibrium model with two regions, the North and the South, and imperfect competition in the international polluting goods market, to analyze the North’s incentives to accept technology transfer. Results crucially depend on the existence of environmental cooperation. When both northern and southern governments set emission quotas non-cooperatively, inducing fewer global emissions is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the North to accept the transfer. In contrast, when governments set quotas cooperatively, the North has no incentive to share its technology either before or after the agreement. Technology transfer commitments may be included in the agreement, but with no effect on global emissions and global surplus. The only impacts are distributional, technology transfers and side payments may be substitute instruments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cap and trade; Climate policy; Environmental cooperation; Imperfect competition; Technology transfer","Commerce; Competition; Developing countries; International trade; Technology transfer; Cap and trade; Climate mitigations; Climate policy; Developing world; Environmental cooperation; Global emissions; Imperfect competition; Partial equilibrium model; Environmental technology; competitiveness; cooperative sector; developing world; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental management; environmental policy; incentive; international agreement; mitigation; North-South relations; technology transfer; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000814889

However, SDG No. 7 (affordable and clean energy) and other goals connected to the reduction of climate change are crucial for the attainment of sustainable development in Nigeria. This comprehensive review encompasses the discussions of the clean energy potential, obstacles to and stimulants of clean energy implementations, and renewable energy policies in Nigeria. Solar and biomass resources have been presented in this article because of their huge availability in Nigeria. Nigeria has the potential to produce an estimated 47.97 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) annually from biomass resources. Likewise, 17, 459 billion MJ/day of solar energy is incident on the total surface of Nigeria. The biomass resources which can be tapped for renewable energy production in Nigeria include Jatropha with high oil contents, sweet sorghum and molasses; food crops such as cassava, rice, coconut, cashew, millet, rice, oil palm, maize, and yam; agricultural residues and wastes from food crops such as cassava peels, cassava liquid sludge, mango peel, mango seed kernel, rice husks (RH), corn residues, oil palm derivatives, sugar cane straw, and bagasse; forest resources; municipal solid wastes; and animal wastes. These resources can be exploited for the production of biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, briquettes and organic fertilizers through anaerobic digestion, transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and briquetting. There are also huge potentials for the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermal systems in off-grid, grid-connected, and hybrid installations. It can be concluded that the techno-economic feasibility and environmental significance of solar power and bioenergy for Nigeria's sustainable development is site-specific and subject to factors such as incentives and financing, research and development, public enlightenment, government's policies, and private investments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biomass; Energy policy; Renewable energy; Solar energy; Sustainable energy","Agricultural wastes; Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Briquetting; Climate change; Crops; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Fruits; Liquid sugar; Municipal solid waste; Oils and fats; Palm oil; Planning; Plants (botany); Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sugar cane; Sustainable development; Bio-energy; Environmental significance; Renewable energies; Renewable energy policy; Research and development; Solar photovoltaics; Sustainable energy; Techno-economic feasibility; Investments",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996956209

The present study sought to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted intervention designed to promote speaking up on teamwork climate in one clinical department of a large community hospital based in Canada. The multifaceted intervention included a role-playing simulation workshop, teamwork climate data feedback and facilitated discussion with the interprofessional team (discussion briefings), and other department-led initiatives to promote trust, teamwork, and speaking up among interprofessional team members. A quasi-experiment (pretest–posttest control group design, using two posttests several months apart) was used to evaluate the impact of the complete intervention on individual teamwork climate perceptions. The intervention was implemented with an intact interprofessional team (the Emergency Department—ED) in 2014. The intensive care unit (ICU) was used as the control unit. Survey response rates were the highest at time 1 (83/102 = 81% for the ED and 29/31 = 94% for the ICU) and the lowest at time 3 (38/105 = 36% for the ED and 14/30 = 47% for the ICU). The results obtained from paired and unpaired analyses suggest that this type of multifaceted approach can improve staff perceptions of teamwork climate. The teamwork climate score in the ED was significantly higher at follow-up (Mt2 = 3.42, SD = 0.66) compared to baseline (Mt1 = 3.13, SD = 0.72), (F(1, 34) = 12.2, p =.001, eta2p =.263), while baseline and follow-up scores were not significantly different between baseline and follow-up for the ICU group (Mt1 = 4.12, SD = 0.60; Mt2 = 4.15, SD = 0.56; F(1, 34) = 0.06, p =.806, eta2p =.002).

This study identified the influence of different low molecular weight C (LMW-C) compounds on the production of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N2) and the associated role of the size and structure of the microbial community. We examined this following application of glucose, glutamine or citric acid (250 mg C kg−1 dry soil) and 15N-KNO3 (100 mg N kg−1 dry soil) to a sandy loam soil and measured the production of N2 and N2O by denitrifiers using 15N labeling techniques, changes in the bacterial community as measured by T-RFLP on 16SrDNA fragments and changes in the gene copy number of 16SrDNA, nirK, nirS and nosZ over 144 h. Addition of glucose, citric acid and glutamine all increased emissions of 15N-N2 above that found in the control (P &lt; 0.05) while the addition of glucose and glutamine resulted in higher emissions of 14+15N-N2O (P &lt; 0.001) than the addition of citric acid, resulting in a lower 15N-N2O to 15N-N2 ratio in the citric acid treatment. The 16SrDNA gene copy number increased after addition of citric acid and glutamine, whilst 16SrDNA showed significant shifts in community composition in all C treatments although over different time periods. The gene copy number of nosZ only significantly increased at 120 h in the glutamine treatment (P &lt; 0.05) and nirS at 120 h in the citric acid and glutamine treatments (P &lt; 0.05). This suggests that where C is added as a single input, differences in N2 and N2O emissions between LMW-C compounds were not caused by selection for denitrifiers but likely driven by differences in substrate use efficiency and subsequent differences in C partitioning between growth and respiration. The differing influence of the three selected C compounds on denitrification indicates the potential for lowering net N2O emissions through regulation of C compound availability. © 2016","Carbon; Denitrification; nirK; nirS; Nitrous oxide; nosZ","Amino acids; Carbon; Citric acid; Denitrification; Efficiency; Genes; Glucose; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Bacterial community; Community composition; Low molecular weight; Microbial communities; nirK; nirS; Nitrous oxide; nosZ; Process control; citric acid; community structure; denitrification; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; sandy loam; soil carbon; soil emission; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007029675

A study was conducted to quantify the amounts of shoots and roots biomass of Brachiaria grass cultivars and their effects on soil carbon in two sites, Ithookwe and Katumani in semi-Arid tropical Kenya. The grass cultivars were Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk, B. brizantha cvs. Marandu, MG4, Piatã and Xaraes, B. humidicola cv. Llanero and B. hybrid cv. Mulato II. These were compared with two locally cultivated grasses (Chloris gayana cv. KAT R3 and Pennisetum purpureum cv. Kakamega 1). The grass treatments were evaluated with fertilizer application (40 kg P applied at sowing and 50 kg N ha-1 in each wet season) and with no fertilizer application. Shoots biomass of the Brachiaria cultivars ranged from 3.0 to 11.3 t ha-1 and 5.5 to 8.3 t ha-1 at Ithookwe and Katumani sites respectively in year 1. The highest shoots biomass recorded at Ithookwe was from cv. Piata while cv. MG4 gave the highest biomass at Katumani. Similar trends were recorded in year 2 of growth though the shoots biomass was lower at Katumani. However, the yields were significantly lower than those recorded from control, Napier grass in both years. The cv. Marandu, Xaraes, Basilisk and Piata had higher roots biomass than the controls (Rhodes grass and Napier grass) indicating greater potential for the Brachiaria grasses to sequester more carbon in the soil. The results of this study indicate that introduction of Brachiaria grasses in the semi-Arid tropics of Kenya and in other similar environments can help increase soil carbon stocks that would mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and have greater economic returns.","Brachiaria; Roots biomass; Semi-Arid; Shoots biomass; Soil carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019651157

Bumblebees preferred bumblebee-pollinated plants over hoverfly-pollinated plants at the end of the experiment, showing that plants had adapted to the bumblebees' preferences. Plants with hoverfly pollination became shorter, had reduced emission of some floral volatiles, but increased fitness through augmented autonomous self-pollination.

However, the application of these measures may influence the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and other environmental impacts of agricultural and biofuel production. This study applies a novel, integrated approach to assess the environmental impacts of agricultural and biofuel production for three ILUC mitigation scenarios, representing a low, medium and high miscanthus-based ethanol production potential, and for three agricultural intensification pathways in terms of sustainability in Lublin province in 2020. Generally, the ILUC mitigation scenarios attain lower net annual emissions compared to a baseline scenario that excludes ILUC mitigation and bioethanol production. However, the reduction potential significantly depends on the intensification pathway considered. For example, in the moderate ILUC mitigation scenario, the net annual GHG emissions in the case study are 2.3 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (1.8 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) for conventional intensification and −0.8 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (−0.6 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) for sustainable intensification, compared to 3.0 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (2.3 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) in the baseline scenario. In addition, the intensification pathway is found to be more influential for the GHG balance than the ILUC mitigation scenario, indicating the importance of how agricultural intensification is implemented in practice. Furthermore, when the net emissions are included in the assessment of GHG emissions from bioenergy, the ILUC mitigation scenarios often abate GHG emissions compared to gasoline. But sustainable intensification is required to attain GHG abatement potentials of 90% or higher. A qualitative assessment of the impacts on biodiversity, water quantity and quality, soil quality and air quality also emphasizes the importance of sustainable intensification. © 2016 The Authors.

Intensification of cattle production systems is considered an important strategy for mitigating anthropogenic GHG emissions. When categorizing production practices into three systems, i.e. pasture-based, mixed and industrial systems, intensification can either take place within one system or through the transition to another more productive system. This study investigates the impacts of these two pathways on farm gate emissions and LUC-related emissions (expressed in kg CO2-eq per kg of milk or beef) in nine world regions. First, a review is conducted of bottom-up studies on farm gate emissions (without LUC) from dairy production in Europe and beef production in North America and Brazil. Then, a global data set on GHG emissions from cattle production is used to discuss the GHG emission impacts of the two development pathways in other regions. Finally, the GLOBIOM model is applied to perform a global assessment of land occupation and LUC-related emissions. For dairy in Europe, farm gate emission reductions of 1%–14% are found for intensification within one system and 2%–26% for system transitions. In Europe as well as other developed regions, the comparative influence of both pathways on the GHG balance largely depends on the specific design of the initial and final production systems. In developing countries especially, there is a greater potential for emission reductions through intensification within the pasture-based system. The additional reduction potential of moving from pasture-based to mixed and industrial production is limited. Also, emission reductions of intensification within the mixed system are smaller compared to the pasture-based system. For beef production in Brazil, intensification within pasture-based systems can attain significant farm gate emission reductions (&gt;50%). The same is true for pasture-based systems in other developing regions and also some developed regions. Furthermore, the additional GHG reduction potentials of moving from pasture-based to mixed systems, and of intensification within mixed systems are larger for beef than for dairy. Although both the dairy and beef sector can often attain significant farm gate emission reductions through intensification within pasture-based systems, the transition to mixed systems is important to reduce land occupation and LUC-related emissions. LUC mitigation is considered to be the most important GHG mitigation strategy for cattle production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Important, but technically and economically constrained strategies to reduce both farm gate and LUC-related emissions include increasing the productivity of grassland and cropland, and increasing the animal productivity through improved feed quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Cradle to farm gate emissions; Incremental and transformational system changes; Livestock production; Production systems; System transitions","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; climate change; data set; emission; emission control; grassland; greenhouse gas; industrial production; land use change; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; Brazil; Latin America; North America; Sub-Saharan Africa; Animalia; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013780990

For Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system engineers, one of the most important challenges is to reduce the system's cost, while keeping its high level of NOx emission reduction performance. Ways to achieve this cost reduction include 1. using an engine out NOx estimation model instead of a NOx sensor upstream of the SDPF (DPF coated with SCR) catalyst and 2. eliminating the Ammonia Slip Catalyst (ASC) downstream of the SDPF catalyst. Achieving these challenging targets requires actions on the complete SCR system, from the optimisation of mixing and uniformity in the SDPF catalyst to the development of robust controls. To face these challenges, a novel exhaust reverse flow concept with a blade mixer was developed. With this concept, total mixing length and mixing performance were increased. The SDPF catalyst uniformity during transient and steady state operation of the engine has been investigated. On the controls side, robust engine out NOx, advanced ammonia storage modelling and robust system adaption controls were developed. Finally, the robustness of the whole SCR system against tolerances and errors through extended sensitivity analysis has been evaluated.

Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy]. Incentives to promote the installation of on-site renewable energy sources have emerged in different states, including net metering programmes. The fast spread of such distributed power generation represents additional challenges for the management of the electricity grid and has led to increased interest in smart control of building loads and demand response programmes. This paper presents a general methodology for assessing opportunities associated with optimal load management in response to evolving utility incentives for residential buildings that employ renewable energy sources and energy storage. An optimal control problem is formulated for manipulating thermostatically controlled domestic loads and energy storage in response to the availability of renewable energy generation and utility net metering incentives. The methodology is demonstrated for a typical American house built in the 1990s and equipped with a single-speed air-to-air heat pump, an electric water heater and photovoltaic (PV) collectors. The additional potential associated with utilizing electrical batteries is also considered. Load matching performance for on-site renewable energy generation is characterized in terms of percentage of the electricity production consumed on-site and the proportion of the demand covered. For the purpose of assessing potential, simulations were performed assuming perfect predictions of the electrical load profiles. The method also allows determination of the optimal size of PV systems for a given net metering programme. Results of the case study showed significant benefits associated with control optimization including an increase of load matching between 3% and 28%, with the improvement dependent on the net metering tariff and available storage capacity. The estimated cost savings for the consumer ranged from 6.4% to 27.5% compared to no optimization with a unitary buy-back ratio, depending on the available storage capacity. Related reduction in CO2 emissions were between 11% and 46%. Optimal load management of the home thermal systems allowed an increase in the optimal size of the PV system in the range of 13–21%. © 2016 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).","heat pump; linear programming; load matching; net metering; optimal control","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heating; Housing; Linear programming; Natural resources; Optimal control systems; Storage management; Water heaters; Distributed renewable energy generations; Electrical energy consumption; Heat pumps; Load matching; Net metering; Optimal controls; Primary energy consumption; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980322343

In order to study the real road emission performance of HEBs, the emission tests of an in-use diesel-electric hybrid bus (DHEB) are evaluated both on chassis dynamometer over China City Bus Cycles (CCBC) and on-road using Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). The DHEB is powered by electric motor alone at speed of 0∼20km/h. When the speed exceeds 20km/h, engine gets engaged rapidly and then works corporately with the electric motor to drive the bus. For chassis dynamometer test over CCBC, emissions of NOx, particulate number, particulate mass, and THC of the DHEB are 7.68g/km, 5.88E+11#/km, 0.412mg/km, and 0.062g/km, respectively. They have all decreased greatly compared to those of the diesel bus. But the CO emission which is 3.48g/km has increased significantly. Then the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) of the DHEB are compared with the dynamometer test results. Particulate and CO emissions have increased because of the higher vehicle speed and more radical acceleration and deceleration driving conditions in on-road test. But NOx emissions of RDE have decreased because of the fast light-off and higher catalytic temperature of Selective Catalytic Reduction system. In all, emissions of the DHEB have decreased significantly compared with traditional powered diesel bus. But CO emissions have increased owing to the control strategy of engine.

The board nets of modern cars have become more complex, and the number and characteristics of loads have been extended. Today the battery is used as a controlled and active part of a comprehensive energy management to reduce the CO2 emissions from a combustion engine car. New requirements on battery performance, including maintenance, endurance, charge-acceptance and crank ability, have led to significant changes in battery design. Basic investigations of premature ageing due to acid stratification and inhomogeneous current distribution have supplied the basis for a significant improvement of performance of the classic starter battery (starting-lighting-ignition, SLI) leading to the emergence of the so-called enhanced flooded battery (EFB).In parallel with this development, new production technologies and materials have been introduced to reduce costs and weight and to increase productivity as well as to improve performance.This chapter will review the interdependence of the application and the design changes of flooded lead-acid batteries in automotive use, will refer to market trends and will address those basic investigations which have been carried out as well as those which remain to be undertaken. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Known eukaryotic CCMs consist of inorganic carbon transporters and carbonic anhydrases (and other supporting components) that culminate in elevated [CO2] inside a chloroplastic Rubiscocontaining structure called a pyrenoid. We set out to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCM in the emerging model photosynthetic stramenopile, Nannochloropsis oceanica, a unicellular picoplanktonic alga that lacks a pyrenoid.We characterized CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 1 (CAH1) as an essential component of the CCM in N. oceanica CCMP1779. We generated insertions in this gene by directed homologous recombination and found that the cah1 mutant has severe defects in growth and photosynthesis at ambient CO2.We identified CAH1 as an α-type carbonic anhydrase, providing a biochemical role in CCM function. CAH1 was found to localize to the lumen of the epiplastid endoplasmic reticulum, with its expression regulated by the external inorganic carbon concentration at both the transcript and protein levels. Taken together, these findings show that CAH1 is an indispensable component of what may be a simple but effective and dynamic CCM in N. oceanica.","Algae; Carbon-concentrating mechanism; Carbonic anhydrase; Heterokont; Photosynthesis","carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase I; algal protein; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; Article; carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme localization; gene insertion; homologous recombination; mutant; Nannochloropsis; Nannochloropsis oceanica; nonhuman; photosynthesis; picoplankton; priority journal; protein expression; amino acid sequence; aquatic species; genetics; metabolism; mutation; physiology; stramenopile; Algal Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Aquatic Organisms; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Mutation; Photosynthesis; Stramenopiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018828441

For policy options which generate controversy between diverse actor groups, such as REDD+, mass media plays an important role in defining and supporting policy possibilities. Analysis of the way in which national media frames issues of climate change and deforestation can offer insights into the nature of the contested domains of the REDD+ policy process. Here, we examine the Brazilian national media discourses surrounding REDD+ because it contributes to setting the tone of policy debates at the federal level. Specifically, we ask the following: (i) How was REDD+ portrayed in the Brazilian national print media and whose opinions and perceptions were represented? and (ii) How have media frames on REDD+ in the national print media changed over time? Our results contribute with new knowledge for understanding the observed progress of REDD+ in Brazil. We identify two main themes that dominate the focus in the national media coverage of REDD+, specifically “politics and policymaking” (representing half the coverage) and “economics and market” (with over a third). Results show that discussions around carbon markets were amongst the most contested and that optimism in relation to REDD+ effectiveness declined over time. The analysis suggests that positions adopted on the national REDD+ strategy were shaped by state and federal collision of interests. We demonstrate an evolution of national concerns from an initial focus on efficiency (e.g. finance and carbon markets) to a recentred focus on equity issues (e.g. implementation of safeguards). We conclude with some thoughts on the implications of these features for REDD+ interventions and implementation in Brazil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Commerce; Deforestation; Forestry; Climate regime; Media coverage; Policy debates; Policy options; Policy process; Reducing emissions; Supporting policies; Tropical countries; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; degradation; environmental economics; equity; implementation process; international agreement; mass media; negotiation process; perception; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446431

A case study explores hurricane intensity in the Caribbean and the modelled expected maximum wind speeds and hurricane category for the region along with local design codes. These findings are used as an informed-decision-support tool for risk managers and design engineers. It has been observed that the environmental loading definitions and maps provided in building codes are in some cases based on historical data that have not been updated with the latest hazard databases or more recent events. Building standards and regulations should be regularly revised to reflect the latest hazard information available to ensure that they lead to resilient design reflecting the current and expected future states of natural hazard risk, allowing for adaptation to address climate change, thus improving future hazard-resilient structures and buildings. © 2017, ICE Publishing.

In this study, we characterize the degree to which federal policies in three major global food production regions that span a range of socioeconomic contexts, Brazil, New Zealand, and the United States, incentivize or disincentivize the use of integrated crop and livestock practices (ICLS). Our analysis indicates that Brazil and New Zealand have the most favorable policy environment for ICLS, while the United States provides the least favorable environment. The balance of policy incentives and disincentives across our three cases studies mirrors current patterns of ICLS usage. Brazil and New Zealand have both undergone a trend toward mixed crop livestock systems in recent years, while the United States has transitioned rapidly toward continuous crop and livestock production. If transitions to ICLS are desired, particularly in the United States, it will be necessary to change agricultural, trade, environmental, biofuels, and food safety policies that currently buffer farmers from risk, provide too few incentives for pollution reduction, and restrict the presence of animals in crop areas. It will also be necessary to invest more in research and development in all countries to identify the most profitable ICLS technologies in each region. © 2017 by the authors.","Agroecology; Brazil; New zealand; Sustainable agriculture; United states","agroecology; alternative agriculture; comparative study; federal system; food production; incentive; mixed farming; policy implementation; Brazil; New Zealand; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016048676

This results in the loss of land for other purposes, particularly soil for agriculture and drainage. This book presents a review of current knowledge of the extension and projected expansion of urban areas at a global scale. Focusing on the impact of the process of 'land take' on soil resources and the ecosystem services that they provide, it describes approaches and methodologies for detecting and measuring urban areas, based mainly on remote sensing, together with a review of models and projected data on urban expansion. The most innovative aspect includes an analysis of the drivers and especially the impacts of soil sealing and land take on ecosystem services, including agriculture and food security, biodiversity, hydrology, climate and landscape. Case studies of cities from Europe, China and Latin America are included. The aim is not only to present and analyse this important environmental challenge, but also to propose and discuss solutions for the limitation, mitigation and compensation of this process. © 2017 Ciro Gardi.

The samples were stored in a regional environmental specimen bank and belonged to specimens which died between 2000 and 2013 in Galicia (NW Spain). We would expect to see a decline in Hg concentrations across the study period, as data of atmospheric emissions show a gradual reduction of this pollutant in Europe in the last two decades. The study did not reveal any temporal pattern in Hg concentrations of feathers in any of the three species for the study period, may be due to the persistence of Hg in the environment, but showed a low level of contamination by this metal in the study area. In addition, the results show high intra-specific, as well as, inter-annual and inter-specific variability in data, mainly attributed to the level of exposure of the raptors to this pollutant and to the biomagnification process of Hg through food chains. These findings indicate that the high variability can be a limiting factor in the use of raptors for biomonitoring temporal patterns of Hg, but nevertheless, the technique provides qualitative information about the amount of Hg that reach the top of the terrestrial food chains. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Hg; Pollution; Raptor; Specimen bank; Temporal trend","mercury; mercury; pollutant; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); feather; food chain; mercury (element); pollution exposure; raptor; specimen bank; temporal variation; Accipiter gentilis; air pollution; animal tissue; Article; biobank; biological monitoring; bird; Buteo buteo; carbon footprint; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; feather; flight feather; food chain; intraspecific variation; nonhuman; qualitative analysis; raptor; Spain; storage; Strix aluco; trend study; analysis; animal; chemistry; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; feather; female; hawk; male; metabolism; owl; pollutant; season; species difference; Galicia [Spain]; Spain; Accipiter gentilis; Buteo buteo; Raptores; Strix aluco; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Feathers; Female; Hawks; Male; Mercury; Seasons; Spain; Species Specificity; Strigiformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006372341

For developing this model, REMOURBAN is implementing several strategies at city level based on: the creation of a holistic catalogue of innovative technologies and solutions on energy, mobility and ICTs favouring the replicability, the identification and overcome of nontechnical barriers, the development of new integrated business models oriented at the creation of a European market for innovation and the definition of a complete evaluation procedure using sustainability and smartness indicators. This urban renovation strategy is focused on the citizens, where they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality For this reason, citizens are being actively engaged in REMOURBAN and the population awareness about energy and environmental impact of their daily activities are increased. In order to ensure the usefulness and high replication of the REMOURBAN project at European level, the sustainable urban regeneration model is aimed at the decision makers, investors, public administrations and the industrial sector. Furthermore, in order to ensure this replicability, two follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) are involved in the project so they can apply the developed model once it is validated. The project will allow demonstrating that, by means of improving the current conditions of a city, it is possible to achieve low energy districts and more sustainable urban transport, as well as to perceive a greater quality of life. REMOURBAN, thus, will focus on improving the energy efficiency, reduction of GHG emissions, refurbishment of districts, transport sustainability, access to urban information and citizen engagement. A big impact across Europe is intended to be achieved by the REMOURBAN project results at European level, showing the model for sustainable urban regeneration can be easily applied and replicated. With the aim at maximizing the impact of the project results, REMOURBAN is deploying a powerful communication and dissemination plan that integrates a citizen engagement strategy and has started to disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Energy efficiency; Mobility; Regeneration; Replicability; Smart city",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016114058

Nowadays, a better knowledge of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) pollution is required for implementing measures to reduce these emissions. In this work, pollution flows mobilized during rainy events have been monitored and modeled in two urban catchments located in the city of Murcia (southeast Spain). For each analyzed event, rainfall volume, in-sewer turbidity and water flow depth have been continuously measured. Therefore, sets of pollutographs and hydrographs have been obtained for each event analyzed. Characteristic variables have been defined and obtained for each event such as the maximum concentration of turbidity, the total event rainfall, the previous dry weather period, the time to the peak of the hydrograph and to the peak of the pollutograph, among others. Relations between variables have been adjusted through a statistical model. The adjusted parameters are used to generate pollutographs that are compared with those measured in field. The present work provides tools to assist in the knowledge of pollution transported through sewer network during stormy events, suggesting the creation of design pollutographs which may facilitate the evaluation of measures to reduce urban runoff pollution. © 2017 by the authors.","Combined sewer overflow (CSO); Pollution prediction indexes; Pollutographs; Sewer system; Turbidity","Catchments; Flow of water; Pollution; Pollution control; Rain; Runoff; Sewage; Sewers; Storms; Turbidity; Combined sewer overflows; Impact on the environment; Maximum concentrations; Pollutographs; Sewer system; Storm water overflows; Total event rainfalls; Urban runoff pollution; Combined sewers; catchment; graphical method; index method; numerical model; pollutant transport; runoff; sewer network; storm; turbidity; urban area; water flow; water pollution; Murcia [Murcia (ADS/PRV)]; Murcia [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018376340

The previous research has shown that during the combustion stage, the high temperature ignition tends to occur early at the near-stoichiometric region where the combustion temperature is high and majority of NOx is formed; Therefore, it is desirable to burn the leaner region first and then the near-stoichiometric region, which inhibits the temperature rise of the near-stoichiometric region and consequently suppresses the formation of NOx. Such inverted ignition sequence requires mixture with inverted phi-sensitivity. Fuel selection is performed based on the criteria of strong ignition T-sensitivity, negligible negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior, and large heat of vaporization (HoV). Based on the suggested criteria, Ethanol (C2H5OH) is selected as the preliminary test fuel for this study. 0-D ignition delay analysis is performed to illustrate the selected fuel's potential to generate mixture with inverted phi-sensitivity. 3-D engine CFD simulation is conducted with the selected fuel under different engine load conditions. The inverted phi-sensitivity and the inverted ignition sequence are demonstrated to exist in the engine simulation. The NOx reduction by inverted ignition sequence is effective at low and medium load. At high load, the proposed method fails to reduce the NOx emission due to the high overall equivalence ratio.

However, the quantities and compositions of total airborne bacterial community and their relationships with environmental factors remain poorly investigated. Here, a case study of the total airborne bacteria of PM2.5 collected at six cities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) megalopolis, China were profiled using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq (PE300) sequencing. qPCR results showed the high abundance of total airborne bacteria of PM2.5 in BTH, ranging from 4.82 × 104 ± 1.58 × 103 to 2.64 × 105 ± 9.63 × 104 cell m−3 air, and averaged 1.19 × 105 cell m−3 air. The six PM2.5 samples were classified into three groups. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the four dominant phyla of PM2.5. 18 common potential pathogens with extremely low percentage (3.61%) were observed, which were dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli. Plants and soil are probably the main sources of bacteria in PM2.5, as suggested by the high percentages of Chloroplast, plant-associated bacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales and Sphingomonadales) and soil-inhabiting bacteria (e.g., Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) indicated that the atmospheric pollutants explained the most of the variation (31.90%) in community structure of PM2.5, followed by meteorological conditions (15.73%) and the chemical compositions of PM2.5 (11.32%). The case study furthers our understanding of the diversity and composition of airborne bacterial communities of PM2.5 in BTH, and also identified the main factors shaping the bacterial communities. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Airborne bacterial communities; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megalopolis; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; PM2.5; Potential pathogens","Atmospheric structure; Chemical analysis; Escherichia coli; Polymerase chain reaction; Atmospheric pollutants; Bacterial community; Environmental factors; Illumina; Meteorological condition; Plant-associated bacteria; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Tianjin; Bacteria; bacterium; community structure; genetic analysis; megacity; microbial community; particulate matter; pathogen; polymerase chain reaction; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Burkholderiales; Cyanobacteria; Enterococcus faecium; Escherichia coli; Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonadales; Rhizobiales; Sphingomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014089827

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of urban residents on the health co-benefits involving GHG abatement and related influencing factors in three cities in China. Beijing, Ningbo and Guangzhou were selected for this survey. Participants were recruited from randomly chosen committees, following quotas for gender and age in proportion to the respective population shares. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were employed to examine the associations between socio-demographic variables and individuals’ perceptions of the health co-benefits related to GHG mitigation. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the influencing factors of respondents’ awareness about the health co-benefits. A total of 1159 participants were included in the final analysis, of which 15.9% reported that they were familiar with the health co-benefits of GHG emission reductions. Those who were younger, more educated, with higher family income, and with registered urban residence, were more likely to be aware of health co-benefits. Age, attitudes toward air pollution and governmental efforts to improve air quality, suffering from respiratory diseases, and following low carbon lifestyles are significant predictors of respondents’ perceptions on the health co-benefits. These findings may not only provide information to policy-makers to develop and implement public welcome policies of GHG mitigation, but also help to bridge the gap between GHG mitigation measures and public engagement as well as willingness to change health-related behaviors. © 2017 by the authors.

Europe is one of the most urbanized regions, accounting for a 73% of people living in urban areas. This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are considered as one of the most vulnerable areas. European cities are characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage, which is commonly located in what is defined as the historic city. In order to protect urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis should be given to the integration of conservation management and urban planning strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable development. Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context. Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures. Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and public authorities. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Climate change; Cultural heritage; Historic cities; Sustainable cities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016090934

Studies comparing leaf traits as a metric of carbon capture strategies in native and invasive species have come to different conclusions. Some studies suggest that invasive species are better at acquiring resources, but that native and invasive species use resources similarly. Other studies have found that native and invasive species differ in resource use efficiency, which implies different biochemical or physiological mechanisms of carbon capture. To resolve this debate, we examined relationships among four leaf traits (photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, foliar nitrogen, foliar phosphorus) in co-occurring native and invasive species from eight plant communities across five Mediterranean-climate ecosystems. We performed standardized major axis regression for all trait combinations within and across sites, testing for slope homogeneity and shifts in elevation (y-intercept) or along a common slope between species groups. Across the global dataset, native and invasive species had similar carbon capture strategies (i.e., similar slopes), with invasive species occupying a position of greater resource acquisition. However, these patterns did not hold when regions were analyzed individually. Regional differences may be driven by differences in life form between native and invasive species, and variation in soil resource availability among regions. Our context-dependent results reveal not only that management of invasive species will differ across regions but also that global comparisons of invasive and native species can be misleading. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Carbon capture; Functional traits; Leaf economics spectrum; Resource acquisition; Resource use efficiency","invasive species; leaf area; Mediterranean environment; physiological response; plant; resource availability; resource use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991794916

Protected areas and biological corridors have been historically implemented as biodiversity conservation measures and suggested as tools within planning frameworks to respond to climate change. However, few applications to national protected areas systems considering climate change in tropical countries exist. Our goal is to define new priority areas for biodiversity conservation and biological corridors within an existing protected areas network. We aim at preserving samples of all biodiversity under climate change and facilitate species dispersal to reduce the vulnerability of biodiversity. The analysis was based on a three step strategy: i) protect representative samples of various levels of terrestrial biodiversity across protected area systems given future redistributions under climate change, ii) identify and protect areas with reduced climate velocities where populations could persist for relatively longer periods, and iii) ensure species dispersal between conservation areas through climatic connectivity pathways. The study was integrated into a participatory planning approach for biodiversity conservation in Costa Rica. Results showed that there should be an increase of 11 % and 5 % on new conservation areas and biological corridors respectively. Our approach integrates climate change into the design of a network of protected areas for tropical ecosystems and can be applied to other biodiversity rich areas to reduce the vulnerability of biodiversity to global warming. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Global warming; Land use; Network security; Tropics; Biodiversity conservation; Conservation priorities; Participatory planning; Planning framework; Representative sample; Terrestrial biodiversity; Three-step strategies; Tropical ecosystems; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; connectivity; conservation planning; conservation status; global warming; land use change; protected area; tropical environment; tropical region; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988973086

We carried out this estimation in three steps. First, we developed a sector- and region-specific regression model for IWW. The model utilized and analyzed cross-country panel data using historical statistics of IWW for 10 sectors and 42 countries. Second, we estimated historical IWW by applying a regression model. Third, we projected future IWW from the output of AIM/CGE. For future projections, we considered and included multiple socioeconomic assumptions, namely different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with and without climate mitigation policy. In all of the baseline scenarios, IWW was projected to increase throughout the twenty-first century, but growth through the latter half of the century is likely to be modest mainly due to the effects of decreased water use intensity. The projections for global total IWW ranged from 461 to 1,560 km3/year in 2050 and from 196 to 1,463 km3/year in 2100. The effects of climate mitigation on IWW were both negative and positive, depending on the SSPs. We attributed differences among scenarios to the balance between the choices of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and renewable energy. A smaller share of CCS was accompanied by a larger share of non-thermal renewable energy, which requires a smaller amount of water withdrawal per unit of energy production. Renewable energy is, therefore, less water intensive than thermal power with CCS with regard to decarbonizing the power system. © 2016, The Author(s).","Computable general equilibrium model; Industrial water withdrawal; Shared socioeconomic pathway; Technological assumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987678796

In this context, the European Union asks all member states to report an emission inventory of substances for river basins. The river basin management system MoRE (Modeling of Regionalized Emissions) was developed as a flexible open-source instrument which is able to model pathway-specific emissions and river loads on a catchment scale. As the reporting tool for the Federal Republic of Germany, MoRE is used to model annual emissions of nutrients, heavy metals, micropollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and certain pharmaceuticals. Observed loads at gauging stations are used to validate the calculated emissions. In addition to its balancing capabilities, MoRE can consider different variants of input data and quantification approaches, in order to improve the robustness of different modeling approaches and to evaluate the quality of different input data. No programming skills are required to set up and run the model. Due to its flexible modeling base, the effect of reduction measures can be assessed. Within strategic planning processes, this is relevant for the allocation of investments or the implementation of specific measures to reduce the overall pollutant emissions into surface water bodies and therefore to meet the requirements of water policy. © 2017 by the authors.

Enhanced UV-B radiation decreased plant biomass, plant height, basal diameter, leaf area index, maximal PSII efficiency, and Chl a+b, but increased intercellular CO2 concentration, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion radical, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline and UV-B absorbing compounds.

The effect of enhanced UV-B radiation on MDA decreased with experimental duration. The effect of enhanced UV-B radiation on superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased with the magnitude of enhanced UV-B radiation. Forests rather than grasslands exhibited a positive response of SOD and a negative response of Pn to enhanced UV-B radiation.

Offering a high leverage potential, this sector is a suitable starting point for greenhouse gas mitigation policies. By providing predictions of the energy demand of building stocks, bottom-up building energy models represent a first step toward deriving strategies for abatement of detrimental effects related to housing energy use. This article aims at evaluating the performance of a simplified bottom-up housing energy model. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to study the model's structure and the impact of individual model parameters. Moreover, an extensive final energy consumption data set allowed for an in-depth comparison of this model with primary data in the scope of a case study in a Swiss municipality. On an individual building scale, the model fails to accurately simulate the energy demand. Deviations can be attributed to a range of factors, such as variability in occupants’ behavior and problems of representativeness in the underlying statistical database. Nevertheless, such under- or overestimations level off on an aggregated scale. In particular, the model reproduces the overall characteristics of the residential building stock's heating demand well. It is therefore well suited as a building stock model and provides a promising basis for an extended assessment of housing energy demands.

The next frontier in chloroplast research is to identify and characterize the function of the whole chloroplast proteome, a challenging task due to the inherent complexity a proteome possesses. A logical starting point is to identify and study proteins that have been determined experimentally to be localized in the chloroplast, conserved only among the photosynthetic lineage. These are the proteins with the most probable and important roles in chloroplast function. This review gives an introduction to the GreenCut2, a collection of proteins present only in photosynthetic organisms. By using recent large scale proteomics data, this cut was narrowed to include only those proteins experimentally verified to be localized in the chloroplast, and more specifically to the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane.

This study assesses the wealth of urban ecosystem services research conducted in the tropical city state of Singapore, in particular their historical local use and implicit and explicit incorporation into land use planning, and shows how Singapore is exporting their experiences to other cities around the world. Singapore is an important model for urban ecosystem services research, as the nation has experienced rapid urban development and has a 100 % urban population. Singapore also historically utilized ecosystem services in urban decision making long before the concept was popularized. For example, forests were conserved since 1868 for climatic regulation and for the watershed protection services provided to Singapore’s first reservoirs, and green spaces have been conserved for cultural ecosystem services since the 1920s. Urban ecosystem services were formally incorporated into national planning in the 1960s through the “Garden City” urban planning vision. Singapore is now a leading case study for tropical urban climatology and carbon sequestration, exporting its experiences globally through bilateral agreements and the construction of eco-cities in China, and the creation and promotion of a global City Biodiversity Index to assess urban ecosystem service provision in cities across the globe. Consolidating and understanding case study cities such as Singapore is important if we are to understand how to incorporate multiple ecosystem services into large scale planning frameworks, and provides an important tropical example in a research field dominated by western, temperate case studies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carbon; City biodiversity index; Cultural ecosystem services; Garden city; Urban heat island",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983407752

For these reasons, the high demands in terms of quality and validity of measurements at the engine test bench are continuously rising. This paper will present a new methodology for efficient testing of an industrial combustion engine in order to improve the process of decision making for combustion-relevant component setups. The methodology includes various modules for increasing measurement quality and validity. Modules like stationary point detection to determine steady state engine behavior, signal quality checks to monitor the signal quality of chosen measurement signals and plausibility checks to evaluate physical relations between several measurement signals ensure a high measurement quality over all measurements. For increasing measurement validity, engine setting parameters are permanently monitored to ensure exact and consistent engine adjustments according to the test plan. Furthermore, embedded 0D engine simulations are used to correct undesired setting parameter deviations in order to create a consistent data base used for model-based optimization (DoE) and combustion-relevant component decisions. The methodology was verified by a measurement campaign carried out at an industrial engine. The new methodology is reducing potential incorrect measurements that have to be repeated. In addition, it ensures that only valid measurements are taken for model-based techniques (DoE) that have been 0D-corrected if necessary. Test bench time can be shortened, leading to a reduction in and better utilization of development costs as well.

Better methodology is needed to support this impetus for action. Problem structuring methods (PSMs) enable improvements to be made in wicked problem situations; they appear to have potential to improve climate change mitigation actions but they are difficult to carry out in highly pluralist problem contexts. A case study (STEEP) that applied a PSM to support low-carbon urban energy master planning in three cities is presented. The STEEP methodology was effective in reducing the wickedness of the problem but issues of a lack of clarity on problem ownership and lack of interessement were seen. A reflective boundary critique study found that there was a mismatch between power and interest amongst key stakeholders towards the low-carbon vision. Three key issues identified in the case study were discussed through the lens of critical systems thinking: (i) the need for new competencies, (ii) dealing with wickedness, and (iii) behavioural complexity and discordant reference systems. The paper suggests how these issues might be improved through the application of non-PSM theories which can support the use of PSMs in improving city-level climate change mitigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary critique; Climate change mitigation; Critical systems thinking; Problem structuring methods; Problematisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007268654

This method uses local coastal wind patterns and key urban air pollution sources in each zone to more accurately calculate air pollutant concentration statistics. The new approach distributes virtual air pollution sources within each small grid cell of an area of interest and analyzes a puff dispersion model for a full year’s worth of 1-hr prognostic weather data. The difference of wind patterns in coastal and inland areas creates significantly different skewness (S) and kurtosis (K) statistics for the annually averaged pollutant concentrations at ground level receptor points for each grid cell. Plotting the S-K data highlights grouping of sources predominantly impacted by coastal winds versus inland winds. The application of the new method is demonstrated through a case study for the nation of Kuwait by developing new AQZs to support local air management programs. The zone boundaries established by the S-K method were validated by comparing MM5 and WRF prognostic meteorological weather data used in the air dispersion modeling, a support vector machine classifier was trained to compare results with the graphical classification method, and final zones were compared with data collected from Earth observation satellites to confirm locations of high-exposure-risk areas. The resulting AQZs are more accurate and support efficient management strategies for air quality compliance targets effected by local coastal microclimates. Implications: A novel method to determine air quality zones in coastal urban areas is introduced using skewness (S) and kurtosis (K) statistics calculated from grid concentrations results of air dispersion models. The method identifies land–sea breeze effects that can be used to manage local air quality in areas of similar microclimates. © 2017 Lakes Environmental Research, Inc.",,"Air quality; Application programs; Classification (of information); Coastal zones; Higher order statistics; Meteorology; Weather satellites; Air dispersion model; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality compliance; Classification methods; Earth observation satellites; Efficient management strategies; Pollutant concentration; Support vector machine classifiers; Mapping; air pollution; air quality; Article; compliance (physical); concentration (parameters); dispersion; microclimate; priority journal; urban area; weather; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; geographic mapping; procedures; statistical model; swimming; theoretical model; wind; air pollutant; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bathing Beaches; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Mapping; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015693308

Despite public transit׳s climate change mitigation potential, the use of transit necessitates environmental exposure which may be a health hazard during periods of extreme heat. Transit system design, which includes stop location and schedules, is shown to contribute to environmental exposure resulting from access and waiting. Using Los Angeles Metro (Los Angeles County, CA) and Valley Metro (Maricopa County, AZ) as case studies of systems operating in extreme heat conditions, the research demonstrates how system design contributes to heat exposure times that vary significantly between neighborhoods. Household level access (walking) time estimates are developed using a shortest path algorithm to nearby transit stops. Waiting time estimates for individual transit stops are derived from published transit schedules and on-board survey responses. The results show that transit users from areas with low residential density, limited high capacity roadways and irregular street networks, and not located along direct paths between major activity centers are likely to experience prolonged access and/or waiting times. Public transit may help mitigate climate change impacts but transit proponents, agencies and planners should be cognizant of the impact an uncertain climate future may have on a growing base of transit riders. These insights can allow us to proactively govern and adapt transit systems to protect people from a growing health concern. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Health; Heat; Transit; Urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979774521

Preparative-scale electrolysis experiments, carried out at −1.5 V versus the standard calomel electrode (SCE) in CO2-saturated acetonitrile, reveal that the process selectivity is extremely sensitive to the acid strength, producing CO and formate in different faradaic yields. A detailed spectroelectrochemical (IR and UV/Vis) study under Ar and CO2 atmospheres shows that 1 undergoes fast solvolysis; however, dimer formation in acetonitrile is suppressed, resulting in an atypical reduction mechanism in comparison with other reported MnI catalysts.

This new model treatment has been built upon previously developed physics-based parameterization schemes from the literature. A distinct and novel feature of this scheme, however, is the incorporation of a newly developed dynamic relation for the surface roughness length relevant to small-scale dust generation processes. Through this implementation, the effect of nonerodible elements on the local flow acceleration, drag partitioning, and surface coverage protection is modeled in a physically based and consistent manner. Careful attention is paid in integrating the new windblown dust treatment in the CMAQ model to ensure that the required input parameters are correctly configured. To test the performance of the new dust module in CMAQ, the entire year 2011 is simulated for the continental United States, with particular emphasis on the southwestern United States (SWUS) where windblown dust concentrations are relatively large. Overall, the model shows good performance with the daily mean bias of soil concentrations fluctuating in the range of ±1 µg m−3 for the entire year. Springtime soil concentrations are in quite good agreement (normalized mean bias of 8.3%) with observations, while moderate to high underestimation of soil concentration is seen in the summertime. The latter is attributed to the issue of representing the convective dust storms in summertime. Evaluations against observations for seven elevated dust events in the SWUS indicate that the new windblown dust treatment is capable of capturing spatial and temporal characteristics of dust outbreaks. © Published 2017.

Our research is part of a long-Term study evaluating silvicultural treatments that promote late-successional forest characteristics in northern hardwood-conifer forests. We are testing the hypothesis that aboveground biomass development (carbon storage) is greater in structural complexity enhancement (SCE) treatments when compared to conventional uneven-Aged treatments. Structural complexity enhancement treatments were compared against selection systems (single-Tree and group) modified to retain elevated structure. Manipulations and controls were replicated across 2-ha treatment units at two study areas in Vermont, United States. Data on aboveground biomass pools (live trees, standing dead, and downed wood) were collected pre-And post-Treatment, then again a decade later. Species group-specific allometric equations were used to estimate live and standing dead biomass, and downed log biomass was estimated volumetrically. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to project ""no-Treatment"" baselines specific to treatment units, allowing measured carbon responses to be normalized against differences in site characteristics affecting tree growth and pre-Treatment stand structure. Results indicate that biomass development and carbon storage 10 yr post-Treatment were greatest in SCE treatments compared to conventional treatments, with the greatest increases in coarse woody material (CWM) pools. Structural complexity enhancement treatments contained 12.67 Mg/ha carbon in CWM compared to 6.62 Mg/ha in conventional treatments and 8.84 Mg/ha in areas with no treatment. Percentage differences between post-Treatment carbon and simulated/projected baseline values indicate that carbon pool values in SCE treatments returned closest to pre-harvest or untreated levels over conventional treatments. Total carbon storage in SCE aboveground pools was 15.90% less than that projected for no-Treatment compared to 44.94% less in conventionally treated areas. Results from classification and regression tree models indicated treatment as the strongest predictor of aboveground C storage followed by site-specific variables, suggesting a strong influence of both on carbon pools. Structural enhancement treatments have the potential to increase carbon storage in managed northern hardwoods. They offer an alternative for sustainable management integrating carbon, associated climate change mitigation benefits, and late-successional forest structure and habitat. © 2017 Ford and Keeton.","Carbon forestry; Carbon storage; Forest structure; Forest vegetation simulator; Late-successional; Northern hardwoods; Old-growth forests; Structural complexity enhancement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019001247

We provide insight into how carbon pricing affects substitution of high- by low-carbon fuels at the province level. In fact, as historically substitution of gasoline by diesel was driven by a price differential, today taxing carbon makes it considerably more attractive for consumers to shift to low-carbon fuels like LPG and natural gas.

The aim of this study was to identify production systems of beef cattle that allow reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and, concomitantly, are economically viable. Four different production systems of a typical farm were analyzed in the southern region of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. The methodology used was the Environmental Life Cycle Costing, integrating the environmental Life Cycle Assessment and investment analysis tools. Production system IV, with slaughter of the animals at 20 months of age and 510 kg body weight, achieved the best results regarding the indicators profitability and emissions, reducing by 45% the emissions per kg of live weight and increasing by 38% the profitability per hectare compared to the base production system I. However, improvements in pastures are needed to increase the stocking rate per hectare and the average daily gain per animal, enabling lower emissions in production and greater financial returns to producers, avoiding the conversion of new areas into pastures for production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beef cattle profitability; Beef sustainability; Global warming; Intensification of production; Livestock","Agriculture; Animals; Beef; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Meats; Profitability; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Beef cattle; Economically viable; Environmental life cycle; Environmental life cycle assessment; Environmental performance; Financial profitabilities; Investment analysis; Livestock; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013380413

The Pliocene is a useful deep-time laboratory for understanding an equilibrium climate state under modern atmospheric CO2, and has been a focus for climate modelers. Accurate estimates of proxy data-model mismatch are hindered by the scarcity of well-constrained observations from well-dated sites in the High Arctic. Using a recently developed community-based approach (Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood Estimation: CRACLE) compared with an established method (The Coexistence Approach: CA), and applied to extraordinary, permafrost-driven preservation of floras, we explore the climate and community assemblages at five Pliocene sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The results suggest that climatic differences at this scale do not simply correlate to differences in community assemblage between sites. The threshold temperature for tree line is one important component, but other factors in the environment (e.g., soil characteristics) may drive dissimilarity of communities where the taxa could share the same climate space. Estimates from CRACLE agree with previous estimates where available, and generally fall within the ranges of CA. Mean annual temperatures were ~22°C hotter (ranging from 0.8 to 6.2°C by species across sites) and mean annual precipitation ~500 mm wetter (ranging from 530 to 860 mm by species across sites) during the Early to ""mid""-Pliocene (~3.6 Ma) when compared with modern climate station data in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Comparison of estimates for three levels of taxonomic input suggest judicious interpretation is needed when generic level identifications are used, especially in the Polar Regions. The results herein are a reminder of the large impact of non-climatic abiotic and biotic factors to be accounted for when predicting future ranges of communities under different climate conditions from the present, and when hindcasting climate from past ecosystem assemblages. © 2017 Fletcher, Feng, Telka, Matthews and Ballantyne.","Biogeography; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; Climate-vegetation interactionsm; Community assembly; CRACLE; Plant Macrofossils; Pliocene; Raup-Crick",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018309640

It is recently reintroduced on gasoline engines to improve fuel economy at mid and high engine load conditions, where EGR can reduce throttling losses and fuel enrichment. Fuel enrichment causes fuel penalty and high soot particulates, as well as hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, all of which are limited by emissions regulations. Under stoichiometric conditions, gasoline engines can be operated at high EGR rates (&gt; 20%), but more than diesel engines, its intake gas including external EGR needs extreme cooling (down to -50°C) to gain the maximum fuel economy improvement. However, external EGR and its problems at low temperatures (fouling, corrosion &amp; condensation) are well known. To avoid this, a coated Gasoline Particulate Filter (cGPF) is introduced in the EGR loop to clean the EGR gas by removing particulates, HC, NOx and CO, such that only CO2, N2 and H2O remain. After cooling the cleaned EGR gas, water condensation is clear without particulates and with neutral pH-values, otherwise being dirty and acidic. These characteristics allow cleaned EGR to cool down with less fouling and corrosion risks. Using cooled clean EGR, gasoline combustion temperature is reduced significantly, which reduces engine knocking, engine-out soot particulates, engine heat losses and fuel consumption, all at the same time. Engine testing with cooled clean EGR at high loads confirms fuel consumption is reduced by more than 10% while particulate numbers is reduced by more than 75%. Engine knocking is suppressed and exhaust temperature is noticeably reduced, which allows for a significant increase of engine compression ratio to further improving fuel economy across the entire engine map. However, to ensure these benefits an effective EGR cooling system is required. The technology for Cooled and Cleaned EGR, CleanEGR™, can be applied to Gasoline engines at a competitive cost in the near future. And rather than trade-off fuel economy improvement (CO2 reduction) versus particulate emissions, it benefits both, which are often thought of as competing. While the tests in this presentation are performed with 91 octane fuel, CleanEGR offers the economical operation of 87 octane fuel in some regions as well.

Despite growing scientific evidence that climate change is taking place, skepticism still exists about whether it is actually occurring and, if it is, whether increased greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant adverse impact on the ecosystem. Unless divergent actor groups are able to establish a dialogue on these issues, meaningful discussions about the causes and effects of climate change will not take place, government action will not be forthcoming, and additional harm to the ecosystem will occur. This, in turn, will place an impediment in front of public and private efforts to promote sustainability, making it even that much more difficult to reverse course and adopt needed changes to energy production and consumption in the future. This paper contributes to the emerging scholarly discussion around the dimensions of climate change communication by conducting a stakeholder-focused analysis concerning climate change at the local level. The paper draws upon a theoretical framework developed by Sabatier et al. (2005) to analyze stakeholder involvement in collaborative watershed management, and applies the framework to climate change policymaking in American cities. A major goal of the study is to assess the value of this framework for analyzing the nature and extent of interactions between the major players involved in climate change mitigation and adaptation at the local level. Developing an effective stakeholder framework can help us to understand the multifaceted stakeholder dynamics around climate change communication at the municipal level and can be a critical contribution to theory and, subsequently, to policymaking by helping decision makers become aware and knowledgeable about their constraints and opportunities in addressing climate change within the urban context. Overall, research on climate change policymaking by cities is underdeveloped, and this paper adds to this literature. © 2015, AESS.","Cities; Climate change; Climate change policy; Collaborative management; Stakeholder engagement","climate change; decision making; environmental planning; environmental policy; government; greenhouse gas; local participation; policy making; stakeholder; urban area; watershed; Central America; North America; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011844940

Key mechanisms through which adaptive advantages might be gained include the potential for forest resources to support livelihoods in the context of climatic strains on agriculture and the protection that intact forest ecosystems might provide against landslides, flash floods and other hazards related to extreme weather. This paper presents findings from field research with forest communities in three areas of the Congo Basin in Central Africa, in which the adaptive role and potential of forests in these respects is critically analysed. The investigation was carried out through a combination of structured and semi-structured qualitative techniques within six villages in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The findings of the research highlight the need to understand both the limits of synergy, and the constraints and trade-offs for rural livelihoods that may be associated with a forest conservation agenda driven by the additional impetus of carbon sequestration. The search for synergy may be conceptually laudable, but if forest management actions do not take account of on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs then the result of those actions risks undermining wider livelihood resilience. © 2016, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Congo Basin; Forests; Livelihoods; Trade-offs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996480066

Notably our understanding of the role of fire regime dynamics in the functioning and biodiversity of Central Eastern European temperate forests is limited because investigation of the effect of fire has been neglected. To fill this gap in knowledge, we applied a multi-proxy approach (macrocharcoal, charred remains, pollen, plant macrofossils) to two sedimentary sequences spanning stands of closed canopy Picea abies to the P. abies treeline located in the northern Carpathians, Romania. We found that climate exerts a broad-scale influence, whereas vegetation feedbacks strongly modulate this fire-climate relationship. Fire has been almost continuously present throughout the Holocene with a remarkably stable mean fire rotation (∼250 yr) with fires of mostly low to mid severity and/or small to medium size. Humans have shifted the fire regime during the last 2800 years to slightly longer fire return intervals (mean 300 yr) and more biomass consumption per fire. We found that P. abies was favoured by low to moderate fire severity/area burned. The establishment of late-successional, shade tolerant Fagus sylvatica was facilitated by fire disturbances, but its expansion coincided with major gaps in fire events. This highlights the key role of fire in the expansion of F. sylvatica that seems only possible in a low/small to mixed severity/size fire regime with a sufficiently long fire return interval. High magnitude charcoal peaks negatively affected F. sylvatica. We found more diverse pollen assemblages, especially taxa linked to anthropogenic impact, at times of moderate fire disturbance corroborating the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. In terms of forest management, our results show that, contrary to current understanding, fire is a natural and important driver of vegetation change in this region. The anticipated increase in fire activity with the climate warming and/or augmented fuel accumulation may threaten the dominant forest ecosystems, given that these are adapted to low frequency and severity fires. We advise forestry to consider the effects of fire as part of climate-change conservation strategies. Diversifying the forest tree mixture with more fire-resistant native species is desirable in order to mitigate the effects of increased fire occurrence and severity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Abies alba; Anthropogenic impact; Charcoal; Disturbances; Fagus sylvatica; Fire frequency; Fire severity; Picea abies; Pollen","Biodiversity; Charcoal; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Abies alba; Anthropogenic impacts; Disturbances; Fagus sylvatica; Fire frequencies; Fire severity; Picea abies; Pollen; Fires; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; charcoal; climate change; coniferous tree; environmental change; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; forest fire; Holocene; native species; pollen; temperate forest; temporal analysis; vulnerability; Carpathians; Romania; Abies alba; Fagus sylvatica; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007247367

A move must be made away from individual models of single species toward approaches with synergistically interacting species. The focus should be on indirect effects due to biotic interactions. Here we propose a new parsimonious approach to simulate direct and indirect effects of global warming on plant communities. The methodology consists of five steps: a) field survey of species abundances, b) quantitative assessment of species co-occurrences, c) assignment of a theorised effect of increased temperature on each species, d) creation of a community model to project community dynamics, and e) exploration of the potential range of temperature change effects on plant communities. We explored the possible climate-driven dynamics in an alpine vegetation community and gained insights into the role of biotic interactions as determinants of plant species response to climate change at local scale. The study area was the uppermost portion of Alpe delle Tre Potenze (Northern Apennines, Italy) from 1500 m up to the summit at 1940 m. Our work shows that: 1) unexpected climate-driven dynamics can emerge, 2) interactive communities with indirect effects among species can overcome direct effects induced by global warming; 3) if just one or few species react to global warming the new community configuration could be unexpected and counter-intuitive; 4) timing of species reactions to global warming is an important driver of community dynamics; 5) using simulation models with a limited amount of data in input, it is possible to explore the full range of potential changes in plant communities induced by climate warming. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biotic interactions; Climate change; Community model; Emergent configurations; Indirect effects; Time-dependent interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997831571

This study measured primary aspects of the carbon balance (biomass, community metabolism, dissolved organic carbon [DOC] fluxes, seston trapping) across the depth gradient in a Zostera muelleri meadow during the seasonal biomass minimum and maximum. Over the annual estimation, the meadow was neither a sink nor source of carbon, with inputs of seston (∼58% of total inputs) balanced by exports of wrack and DOC. The carbon sink represented by wrack export depends on the nature of the environment where the wrack accumulates; if it reaches subtidal sediments it will largely be remineralised over the annual cycle, whereas between 14 and 26% of the wrack may be preserved if the material is exported to terrestrial environments. The fate of DOC exuded by seagrasses is unknown due to a lack of knowledge about its composition and lability; however, a number of lines of evidence suggest that a large fraction of DOC is mineralised. The net community metabolism (NCM) of the meadow was balanced, indicating that photosynthetic O2 production balanced community respiration and/or the reoxidation of reduced compounds (sulphur and iron) in the rhizosphere. We suggest that a balanced NCM may be the preferred state for Zostera spp. and may limit their occurrence in environments where plants cannot balance the respiratory demand exerted by seston inputs. There was a close coupling between metabolism and biomass, which in turn is forced by antecedent light over the preceding 120 days (the time integration window for antecedent light that best predicted biomass). Increased metabolism with depth and seasonal variation in light is accompanied by a decrease in the above ground:below ground biomass ratio (AGB:BGB). This trend is suggested to be a morphological adaptation that balances the competing requirements of maintaining a neutral plant carbon balance across enrichment and light gradients. Our results suggest that Zostera muelleri may be most important as a ‘blue carbon’ store (i.e. carbon stored as biomass standing stock), which is therefore vulnerable to degradation if seagrasses are lost. © 2017","Blue carbon; Carbon budget; Depth gradient; Metabolism; Seagrass","adaptation; carbon balance; carbon budget; carbon sink; dissolved organic carbon; ecosystem resilience; metabolism; oxygen; respiration; rhizosphere; seagrass; seasonal variation; water depth; Zostera; Zostera muelleri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012277321

Meanwhile, psychological and social considerations are sparingly mentioned, especially for the related studies in developing countries. This study investigates the impact of psychological factors and social appraisal on farmers' behavioral intention to adopt adaptation measures for the aforementioned reason, due to climate change and not to anthropogenic climate change. Drawing on the protection motivation theory, a threat, coping, social appraisal, maladaptation and behavioral intention to adopt adaptation measures (TCSMBI) model was proposed to predict farmers' adaptation. A structural equation model was then employed to analyze the relationships between variables in the TCSMBI model with 658 apple farmers in Shaanxi province, China. The empirical results showed that threat appraisal and coping appraisal have positive and significant impacts on behavioral intention to climate change. Moreover, threat appraisal reduces the occurrence of maladaptation, and social appraisal tends to have significantly positive impacts on threat appraisal and coping appraisal. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptation; Apple farmers; China; Climate change; Protection motivation theory; Structural equation model","adaptive management; climate change; deciduous tree; developing world; farmers attitude; fruit; mathematical analysis; psychology; resource availability; socioeconomic status; China; Shaanxi; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017338624

In fact, these latter have a decisive role in the development and application of rational water policies. Since the accuracy of the simulation depends strongly on the available data, the task of optimizing the monitoring network is of great importance. In this paper, an application is presented aiming at the evaluation of a precipitation monitoring network by predicting monthly, seasonal, and interannual average rainfall. The method given here is based on the theory of the regionalized variables using the well-known geostatistical variance reduction method. The procedure, which involves different analysis methods of the available data, such as estimation of the interpolation uncertainty and data cross validation, is applied to a case study data set in Tunisia in order to demonstrate the potential for improvement of the observation network quality. Root mean square error values are the criteria for evaluating rainfall estimation, and network performance is discussed based on kriging variance reduction. Based on this study, it was concluded that some sites should be dropped to eliminate redundancy and some others need to be added to the existing network, essentially in the center and the south, to have a more informative network. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Geostatistics; Kriging variance; Optimization; Rainfall network; Spatial variability; Tunisia","Data flow analysis; Interpolation; Mean square error; Optimization; Quality control; Rain; Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Development and applications; Geo-statistics; Kriging; Rainfall monitoring network; Root mean square errors; Spatial variability; Tunisia; Variance reduction methods; Precipitation (meteorology); data set; estimation method; geostatistics; hydrological modeling; interpolation; kriging; monitoring system; optimization; precipitation assessment; rainfall; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016555587

A European dimension related to affordability and to the harmonization of national security of supply policies is also missing in this context. Policy coordination is further required among Member States and together with other trading partners in order to secure investments in energy markets. In the electricity market, different market policy instruments are envisaged as part of the EU Energy Union. Among them, a reform of the European Trading Scheme is put in place and a convergence of existing national capacity remuneration schemes is considered.

Such strategies should align with the overarching principle of sustainable intensification and will need to consider the economic, environmental and social trade-offs of reduced fertilizer-related emissions. However, the gender equity dimensions of such strategies are rarely considered. The case studies cited in this paper, from India, Lake Victoria in East Africa and more broadly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), show that the negative externalities of imbalanced inorganic N use in high- and low-use scenarios impact more strongly on women and children. We examine, through a literature review of recent work in SSA, the relative jointness of intra-household bargaining processes in low N use scenarios to assess the degree to which they impact upon N use. We suggest that gender-equitable strategies for achieving more balanced use of N will increase the likelihood of attaining macro-level reductions in GHG emissions provided that they secure equity in intra-household decision-making and address food security. Gender-equitable N use efficiency strategies will help to integrate and assure gender and social equity co-benefits at local scales. © 2017 The Author(s).

The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric vehicles into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, conventional electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. This chapter seeks to objectively compare the systemic impacts of these two electric vehicle concepts on the combined electrical power grid and road transportation system. It applies a recently developed hybrid dynamic system model of the transportation-electricity nexus that holistically incorporates vehicle dispatch, route choice, charging station queues, coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid stabilization. It draws upon Axiomatic Design for Large Flexible Engineering System Theory to superimpose a marked petri net model layer on a continuous-time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The results show that online electric vehicles, unlike their conventional vehicle counterparts, are able to avoid charging station queues and thus are able to meet the needs of a greater variety of transportation uses cases including commercial and public fleets. Their impacts on the power system also differ. While conventional electric vehicles are likely to require greater investment to expand power system generation capacity, online electric vehicles are likely to incur greater operating costs to manage their charging loads. The chapter concludes with several directions for future work in the development of intelligent transportation-energy systems which can serve to reduce both costs for both vehicle concepts. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033352150

The climate scenario can be used as basic information to support adaptation and mitigation studies. In order to deliver future climate scenarios over specific region, baseline and projection data from the outputs of global climate models (GCM) is needed. However, due to its coarse resolution, the data have to be downscaled and bias corrected in order to get scenario data with better spatial resolution that match the characteristics of the observed data. Generating this downscaled data is mostly difficult for scientist who do not have specific background, experience and skill in dealing with the complex data from the GCM outputs. In this regards, it is necessary to develop a tool that can be used to simplify the downscaling processes in order to help scientist, especially in Indonesia, for generating future climate scenario data that can be used for their climate change-related studies. In this paper, we introduce a tool called as ""Statistical Bias Correction for Climate Scenarios (SiBiaS)"". The tool is specially designed to facilitate the use of CMIP5 GCM data outputs and process their statistical bias corrections relative to the reference data from observations. It is prepared for supporting capacity building in climate modeling in Indonesia as part of the Indonesia 3rd National Communication (TNC) project activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Climate change scenarios; Climate scenarios; Downscaling process; Future climate scenarios; Global climate model; Project activities; Spatial resolution; Supporting capacities; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018695382

Expanded PES (payment for ecosystem service) principles provides a framework for assessing the transparency and efficacy of partnerships, tested on the model developed by The Converging World (TCW). The TCW partnership model currently links south-west England and Tamil Nadu, raising funds for wind turbines in India to avert emissions from conventional sources and reinvesting operating surpluses into restoration of tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF). Over assumed 100-year progression to climax community, 123 ha of restored TDEF sequesters a conservatively calculated 270,545,880 tCO2. This forest area is restored using operating surpluses from a 2.1 MW turbine, which generates renewable energy over 20-year operating life conservatively calculated as averting 80,000 tCO2e compared to a conventional energy mix. Forest restoration funded from turbine generation surpluses represents a substantial ‘multiplier effect’, providing around 3000 times greater overall carbon reductions.

Calcite (CaCO3) and siderite (FeCO3) are isostructural, thus Ca2+ incorporates readily into the hexagonal FeCO3 lattice, and vice versa. In aqueous carbon dioxide (CO2) solutions where both Ca2+ and ferrous iron (Fe2+) are present (such as downhole gas reservoirs or deep saline aquifers after CO2 injection), inhomogeneous mixed metal carbonates with the formula FexCayCO3 (x + y = 1) can form; their presence on steel has been hypothesized to lead to localized corrosion. During carbon steel corrosion experiments conducted in electrolytes containing high Ca2+ concentrations, inhomogeneous corrosion product layers with the composition FexCayCO3 (x + y = 1) were indeed observed, along with non-uniform corrosion. Determining relative molar fractions of Ca2+ and Fe2+ in FexCayCO3 is paramount to predicting the relative properties and stability of such mixed metal carbonates. Using Bragg's law and equations to relate interplanar spacings to unit cell parameters, x-ray diffraction patterns yielded values for the mole fraction of Ca2+ in FexCayCO3. Procedures in the current study were designed to develop a range of specific corrosion product layers on mild steel samples. The compositional analysis of these surface layers was used to develop a relationship with the observed corrosion mechanisms. Experiments were conducted at constant chloride (Cl−) concentration with and without 10,000 ppm Ca2+ in stagnant conditions and for two different flow conditions. In stagnant conditions, localized corrosion was associated with the presence of Ca2+ and the inhomogeneity of the corrosion product layer. The corrosion attack became uniform when flow was introduced. © 2017 National Assoc. of Corrosion Engineers International.

These endeavors overwhelmingly focus on actions within sectors and thus fail to account for coupled effects across systems. This paper focuses on adaptation constraints that arise from the interdependencies of coupled systems, and the opportunities that emerge when adaptation strategies integrate such interdependencies. Three general constraints to adaptation in coupled systems are identified and detailed using evidence from the United States energy-water nexus: insufficient data and information, path dependence, and institutional fragmentation and disorganization. Adaptation constraints within the energy-water nexus are especially difficult to avoid or overcome at local and regional scales owing to complex, and poorly integrated, governance structures. This indicates that some degree of national coordination is an important enabling condition to overcome constraints and enable adaptation throughout the energy-water nexus. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Decision-making; Energy; Scale; Water","water; adaptation; climate change; desalination; disorientation; energy; priority journal; Review; risk management; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013188377

Households play an important role in responding to the impact of a changing climate by creating a functional link between individual and community responses to change. However, household perspectives on their capacity needs are rarely sought in programs seeking to provide incentives for household action—despite the influence of normative values and perceptions on household action. Rather, interventions are often informed by quantitative measures of adaptive capacity, such as access to financial or social capital. An alternative approach involves analysis of social narratives of capability that reflect normative perceptions of climate risk and capacity needs. Implementation of this approach reveals that a significant number of households in vulnerable locations consider existing capacities sufficient to manage familiar climate hazards, regardless of socio-economic circumstance. Our comparative study of two Australian coastal communities also suggests that a dominant narrative of capability to manage climate hazards reduces the likelihood of household investments in adaptive actions. While socio-political influences on narratives are often deeply embedded and difficult to change in the short term, identifying perceived risk and response capacity is pivotal in determining the likely utility of adaptive capacity stocks as measured through quantitative means. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change adaptation; Environmental hazard; Management; Resilience; Risk perception; Self-efficacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976293900

This constrains humanity's ability to protect our planet's climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions.

A very common theme in ""smart"" cities is the high dependency, and application of ICT technologies in city planning and management, which is expected to result-in superior and rational optimization of time and resources with harmonious smart city ecosystem. Nevertheless, the definitions of ""smart"" cities remain vague, and poor understanding may lead cities planners to possible technological traps such as heavy investments in ICT infrastructure for short-term solutions without reasonably considering the long term. As cities officials deals with rapid development, expansion and goals for creating sustainable development, dealing with climate change mitigation, and rationally manage resources, the precise definition and wisdom about being ""smart"" will be vital for smart cities leaders and planners.

Plastic water bottles have become a great problem in the environment because of the large numbers consumed throughout the world. Certain types of plastic bottles can be recycled but most of them are not. This paper describes an economical solvent-free process that converts polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles waste into carbon nanostructure materials via thermal dissociation in a closed system under autogenic pressure together with additives and/or catalyst, which can act as cluster nuclei for carbon nanostructure materials such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This research succeeded in producing and controlling the microstructure of various forms of carbon nanoparticles from the PET waste by optimizing the preparation parameters in terms of time, additives, and amounts of catalyst. Implications: Plastic water bottles are becoming a growing segment of the municipal solid waste stream in the world; some are recycled but many are left in landfill sites. Recycling PET bottles waste can positively impact the environment in several ways: for instance, reduced waste, resource conservation, energy conservation, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and decreasing the amount of pollution in air and water sources. The main novelty of the present work is based on the acquisition of high-value carbon-based nanomaterials from PET waste by a simple solvent-free chemical technique. Thus, the prepared materials are considered to be promising, cheap, eco-friendly materials that may find use in different applications. © 2017 A&WMA.",,"Additives; Bottles; Catalysts; Conservation; Dissociation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Municipal solid waste; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Natural resources; Plastic bottles; Plastic products; Polyethylene terephthalates; Water pollution; Water recycling; Yarn; Carbon Nano-Particles; Carbon Nanostructures; Eco-friendly materials; Municipal solid waste stream; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Preparation parameters; Resource conservation; Thermal dissociation; Plastic recycling; carbon nanoparticle; carbon nanotube; ferrocene; fullerene derivative; nanomaterial; polyethylene terephthalate; plastic; polyethylene terephthalate; solid waste; water; Article; carbon footprint; catalyst; decomposition; dissociation; energy conservation; municipal solid waste; plastic bottle; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; transmission electron microscopy; waste; waste management; X ray diffraction; chemistry; environment; procedures; recycling; solid waste; Environment; Nanotubes, Carbon; Plastics; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Recycling; Solid Waste; Waste Management; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013001170

The andesite composition was specifically chosen to match a low-degree partial melt composition that is generated from MORB-like eclogite in the convective, oceanic upper mantle. Experiments were performed at 1–3 GPa, 1375–1550 °C, and fO2 of FMQ −3.2 to FMQ −2.3 and the resulting experimental glasses were analyzed for CO2 and H2O contents using FTIR and SIMS. Experimental results were used to develop a thermodynamic model to predict CO2 content of nominally anhydrous andesitic melts at graphite saturation. Fitting of experimental data returned thermodynamic parameters for dissolution of CO2 as molecular CO2: ln(K0) = −21.79 ± 0.04, ΔV0 = 32.91 ± 0.65 cm3mol−1, ΔH0 = 107 ± 21 kJ mol−1, and dissolution of CO2 as CO3 2−: ln(K0) = −21.38 ± 0.08, ΔV0 = 30.66 ± 1.33 cm3 mol−1, ΔH0 = 42 ± 37 kJ mol−1, where K0 is the equilibrium constant at some reference pressure and temperature, ΔV0 is the volume change of reaction, and ΔH0 is the enthalpy change of reaction. The thermodynamic model was used along with trace element partition coefficients to calculate the CO2 contents and CO2/Nb ratios resulting from the mixing of a depleted MORB and the partial melt of a graphite-saturated eclogite. Comparison with natural MORB and OIB data suggests that the CO2 contents and CO2/Nb ratios of CO2-enriched oceanic basalts cannot be produced by mixing with partial melts of graphite-saturated eclogite. Instead, they must be produced by melting of a source containing carbonate. This result places a lower bound on the oxygen fugacity for the source region of these CO2-enriched basalts, and suggests that fO2 measurements made on cratonic xenoliths may not be applicable to the convecting upper mantle.

Housing has been a critical area for urban studies, but often considered in sectoral terms and work on urban responses to climate change has followed this positioning. By contrast, an Urban Political Ecology (UPE) perspective would position housing in more integrated terms as part of the metabolism of the city. Yet so far there has been relatively little written in UPE about either housing or climate change. This paper therefore seeks to bring UPE into dialogue with the emergent literature focused on governing climate change through housing. It does so through a detailed study of the ‘Retrofit Philly ‘‘Coolest Block’’ Contest’. We argue that this contest highlights the ways climate change is changing the way housing is embedded in the circulations of the city, pointing to changes in who is governing housing, how housing is being governed and who is able to access the benefits of (climate change-branded) action on housing. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.","Climate change; Governance; Housing; Philadelphia; Urban political ecology","climate change; environmental planning; governance approach; housing project; metabolism; political discourse; urban ecosystem; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014621033

The NOx emissions from these units are in general significantly higher than those in other combustion systems, and the large flows of flue gases make the implementation of secondary measures for NOx control costly. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate NOx formation under combustion conditions relevant for iron ore production, in order to control the emissions from these units. The present work examines NOx formation during the combustion of four pulverized coals, as well as during cofiring with biomass in a pilot-scale kiln (580 kWfuel) based on a two-week experimental campaign. The influence of burner settings was also included in the investigation. Based on the presented experimental results and the results of previous modeling and experimental studies, we suggest that the NOx emissions are mainly the result of a high conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen (fuel-N) to NO. In particular, char-bound nitrogen (char-N) conversion appears to be higher than in conventional pulverized fuel flames, presumably due to the high levels of oxygen present in the char-burnout region. The temperatures in the kiln varied between the test cases, but thermal NO formation is estimated to be of low importance. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Brickmaking; Coal; Combustion; Fuels; Iron; Iron ores; Nitrogen; Pulverized fuel; Combustion condition; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion systems; Equivalence ratios; Experimental campaign; Fuel bound nitrogens; High temperature air; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017533459

This is, partly, because agricultural productivity in SSA is highly dependent on rainfall. Thus, the slightest variation in climatic conditions has the potential of subjecting a large proportion of the rural poor to increased poverty and misery as the ability to obtain their livelihoods can be compromised. Despite the effects of climate variability on rural livelihoods, the rural poor are not passive actors. They are actively and consistently involved in adapting and modifying their asset portfolios to reduce the impacts of climate variability, and consequently, build their adaptive capacity and resilience. Drawing on a recent field-based research conducted in the Delta State of Nigeria and using the participatory climate change adaptation appraisal, this paper discusses the various asset adaptation strategies employed by the rural poor in building their adaptive capacity and resilience to climate variability.

We have developed a robust optimization (RO) model to determine the minimum amount of land (cropland and pasture) required to grow food items that would satisfy a local population’s (accounting for gender and age) calorie and nutrient needs. This model has been applied to Boone County, Missouri, which has a population of approximately 170,000. Boone County is 1790 km2, with 16% of the land defined as cropland and 30% defined as pasture. The model includes 27 nutrients from 17 potential foods that could be produced: six fruits and vegetables, five grains and six animal-sourced foods. Yield estimates are based on the predominate methods of agriculture in the USA. We first run our model assuming no variability, using the midpoint yield estimates. Then, to quantify uncertainty in yield for different food types, we use historical yield data over 10 years to estimate this variability and run our RO model under these variability estimates. We compare the two model results to illustrate the impact of data uncertainty on meeting sustainable local food for communities. Solutions suggest that nutrition needs can be met for the Boone County population within the land area defined. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Land use; Local food production; Robust optimization","basic needs; food production; land use change; local economy; numerical model; optimization; sustainability; Boone County [Missouri]; Missouri; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994792003

Long-term studies relating composition and water availability primarily focus on current-year precipitation patterns, though mounting evidence highlights the importance of previous-year rainfall particularly in grasslands dominated by perennial species. The extent to which lagged precipitation effects occur in annual grasslands, however, remains largely unexplored. We pair a long-term study with two manipulative experiments to identify patterns and mechanisms of lagged precipitation effects in annual grasslands. The long-term study captured variation in functional group (exotic annual forbs and grasses) abundance and precipitation across 8 years at three northern California grassland sites. We then tested whether lagged rainfall effects were created through seed production and litter (residual dry matter, RDM) by manipulating rainfall and litter, respectively. Rainfall from the previous-year growing season (both seasonal and total rainfall) shifted functional group abundance. High lagged rainfall was associated with increased grass and decreased forb abundance the following year. Current-year seasonal rainfall also influenced species composition, with winter rain increasing forb and decreasing grass abundance. Lagged precipitation effects were generally stronger for forbs than for grasses. Our experimental studies provided evidence for two mechanisms that contributed to lagged effects in annual grasslands. Higher rainfall increased seed production for grasses, which translated to more germinable seed the following year. Higher rainfall also increased biomass production and RDM, which benefited grasses and reduced forb abundance. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of previous-year precipitation in structuring annual community composition and suggest two important biotic pathways, seed rain and RDM, that regulate lagged community responses to rainfall. Incorporating lagged effects into models of grassland diversity and productivity could improve predictions of climate change impacts in annual grasslands. © 2016 The Authors.

Based on household survey our study provides data on i) how local farmers perceive climate change in general, ii) prevailing freshwater aquaculture scenarios and potential impacts of the climate change on aquaculture, and iii) which strategies aquaculture farmers employ to cope with the perceived risks. The study reveals that farmers are aware of climatic variability and express their experiences of changes in temperature, rainfall, tropical cyclones and sea level rise. The production methods of freshwater aquaculture in Sundarban can be termed as ‘semi-improved low-input carp polyculture’. Cyclones and storm surges are the most significant climatic phenomena and severely affect freshwater aquaculture due to subsequent coastal flooding, and sea-level rise that cumulatively lead to salinity intrusion, followed by rising air temperature and drought. In relation to perceived risks, farmers are currently dealing with the problems through short-term coping measures which need scientific improvements to give long-term relief to the farmers. Considering the effects of climate change on freshwater pond aquaculture in the delta, we propose some preliminary policy recommendations that need to be introduced to cope with the challenges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate resilient aquaculture; Indian Sundarban; Local adaptation plan; Saline water inundation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009216529

Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km-2 year-1. Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers. © 2017 Duarte, Wu, Xiao, Bruhn and Krause-Jensen.","Aquaculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Macroalgae; Seaweed; Sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020117533

Uncovering the possible factors that govern the PL emission of solvated fullerenes thus becomes important for the purpose of application. Here, we report a high pressure study on a typical solvated fullerene, C70*mesitylene, using the diamond anvil cell technique with associated spectroscopic measurements. Our Raman and PL spectra show that there is a change in the pressure dependence for the normalized PL intensity in solvated samples during the rotational transition. It indicates that the rotational state of C70 is a critical factor which can influence the PL emission of solvated samples. The optical absorption (OA) spectra further suggest that the C70–C70 interactions in solvated samples compared with those in desolvated samples are hindered under pressure because of the intercalation of solvent, which makes the PL emission in solvated samples more sensitive to the change in C70 rotations under pressure.

Under modeled scenarios, surge barriers exerted a significant influence on the tide, salinity, residual current, and transport processes. The surge barrier caused (1) a reduction of tidal range inside the estuary, (2) stronger stratification and further salt intrusion, weaker vertical mixing and larger vertical exchange time, and (3) a decrease of bottom inflow in the mainstem and weakened horizontal water exchange.

Limited work has been done on understanding rib spacing and furrow size in the context of a wide range of environmental variables. Data were collected in two Carnegiea gigantea Sonoran Desert (Northern Hemisphere) populations, that were analyzed using General Linear Models and MANOVA to assess the relationships between rib and furrow metrics, height and direction on the plants, and several environmental and plant-wide variables (e.g., intraspecific crowding, shade, branching). Furrow sides are smaller lower on the plant, but are not related to orientation suggesting adjustment with growth. Rib spacing is not related to height on the plant, but is related to direction (greater spacing to the north and west), likely due to thermal and photosynthetic differences. Intraspecific crowding and shade affect the size of furrows. This morphology offers both a long-term response to general conditions (furrow size, e.g., shade, regional factors) and short-term response (rib spacing) to seasonal variations in temperature and moisture for direct response to fluctuating conditions. These mechanisms will continue to be important with changing climate, and through range shifts associated with warming. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cactaceae; Photosynthesis; Plant-climate interactions; Sonoran desert; Water storage","Cactaceae; Carnegiea gigantea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996560119

Urban green zones including parks and urban forests provide key functions and services for city dwellers. Most of the urban forests' functions, including biodiversity maintenance, supporting carbon and nitrogen cycles and climate mitigation are supported by soil. Therefore, urban forests' soil health and its vulnerability to anthropogenic influence need thorough investigation. In the chapter the anthropogenic influence on soil health was studied for the unique forest experimental station located in Moscow and exposed to urbanization for more than a century. Changes in soil physical (bulk density), chemical (nutrients' and heavy metals' concentrations and mobility), and biological features (amount of ammonifiers and soil nitrogen-fixing activity) resulted from continuous urbanization and anthropogenic load were studied. Urbanization effect on soil health and functions was examined through comparison of the recent soil features to the historical data obtained at the same experimental sites prior urbanization, whereas anthropogenic influence gradient was studied based on the proximity to the roads and residential blocks. Substantial anthropogenic influence on soil features, their time dynamics, spatial variability, and profile distribution was found. Urban forest soils' contamination with heavy metals was more than ten times higher compared to the non-urbanized counterparts. Concentration of heavy metals increased and nutrients' concentration decreased from the forest core to the boundary zones. Over-compaction of forest topsoil was observed in proximity to the pathway network. Negative changes in soil chemical and physical features resulted in substantial decline in soil health and depletion of important soil functions, like support of a nitrogen cycle. The observed negative trend in forest soil health, resulted from urbanization and anthropogenic pressure, highlights importance to develop strategies of sustainable urban development, integrating green zones into urban areas. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

Since the 1970s, Brazil has experienced changes in the vehicle energy matrix, with the appearance of ethanol fuel as an alternative to oil. The use of ethanol produced from sugar cane, followed by biodiesel and modest advances in the use of electrical batteries in cars, has put the country on the path to energy sustainability. Currently, the technological innovations of the automotive industry have been concerned with developing electric and hybrid vehicles, as is the case with hybrid vehicles that are powered by hydrogen fuel cells or batteries (lead or lithium). The Brazilian automotive industry has thus contributed to the search for sustainability. It has a long way to go in that direction, however, because the use of diesel engines in trucks and buses accounts for the largest portion of air pollution in Brazilian cities. Brazilian legislation plays an important role in the quest for sustainability. More stringent legislation for reducing the emission of gaseous pollutants in all types of vehicles, and improvements in the enforcement of vehicle regulation, represent a huge leap forward in this regard. The efforts of the automotive industry in Brazil, along with technological developments, can contribute to the reduction of emissions of polluting gases, and the introduction of public transportation via trains, subways, and monorails that use electricity can do likewise. All of these are important contributions to the reduction of air pollution in Brazilian cities, and to the sustainability that we all so badly need. © 2017, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

These problems include direct negative influences on people's health, adverse economic effects, negative social impacts, local environmental damage, and risk of catastrophic global climate change. There is a drastic need to develop ways to reduce these emissions and EcoTrec, presented in this paper, is one of these innovative approaches. EcoTrec is a vehicular ad hoc network-based vehicle routing solution designed to reduce vehicle carbon emissions without significantly affecting the travel times of vehicles. The vehicles exchange messages related to traffic and road conditions, such as average speed on the road, road gradient, and surface condition. This information is used to build a fuel efficiency model of the routes, based on which the vehicles are recommended to take more efficient routes. By routing vehicles more efficiently, the greenhouse emissions are reduced while also maintaining low traffic congestion levels. This paper presents results of extensive simulations, which show how EcoTrec outperforms other state-of-The-Art solutions with different number of vehicles, vehicle penetration, and compliance rates, and when considering different real world road maps from Dublin and Koln. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Ad hoc networks; road traffic; routing; vehicle communications; wireless LAN","Ad hoc networks; Climate change; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Health risks; Roads and streets; Telecommunication networks; Traffic congestion; Traffic control; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Environmental damage; Extensive simulations; Global climate changes; Greenhouse emissions; Innovative approaches; Number of vehicles; Surface conditions; Vehicle penetration; Vehicular ad hoc networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981346594

In most work on IEM, a suboptimal heuristic real-time implementable solution is used, which is based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). In this paper, we compute the optimal solution using both PMP and Dynamic Programming (DP). As the emission legislation imposes a terminal state constraint, standard DP algorithms are sensitive to numerical errors that appear close to the boundary of the feasible sets. Therefore, we propose two extensions to existing DP methods, which use an approximation of the forward reachable sets to reduce the grid size over time and an approximation of the backward reachable sets to avoid the aforementioned numerical errors. Using a simulation study of a cold-start World Harmonised Transient Cycle for a Euro-VI engine, we show that the novel extension to the DP algorithm yields the best approximation of the optimal cost, when compared to existing DP methods. Furthermore, we show that PMP yields almost the same results as DP, and that the real-time implementable solution only deviates approximately 0.08–0.16% from the optimal solution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive control; Dynamic programming; Optimal control","Approximation algorithms; Diesel engines; Engines; Numerical methods; Optimal systems; Optimization; Aftertreatment systems; Automotive control; Emission constraints; Emission legislation; Integrated emissions; Optimal controls; Pontryagin's minimum principles; Supervisory control strategy; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015722714

Reducing the fast rising rate of CO2 emissions in this sector is essential for realizing the target of carbon emission mitigation in China. The researches on the driving factors of residential CO2 emissions have attracted scholars' attention recently, yet few studies can interpret the causality relationship between household per capita income-expenditure-CO2 emissions at national and regional levels. Based on econometric techniques and a panel data set, this paper presents an investigation of the causality relationship, which combines household per capita income, per capita expenditure and per capita CO2 emissions (hereafter referred to as PI, PE, and CE, respectively) on a national level and within three regions (namely, eastern, central, and western regions of China) from 1997 to 2014. Urban and rural areas are considered as well. The empirical results manifest a varied causality relationship in different regions. For example, PI and PE correspond to CE in eastern rural area, but this phenomenon does not occur in central rural area. In addition, urban and rural differences are displayed.

Accompanying this rapid warming are significant increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, annual hottest day temperature and warmest night temperature, and an increase in frequency of summer days and tropical nights, while the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) is small. This study focuses on understanding causes of the rapid summer warming and associated temperature extreme changes. A set of experiments using the atmospheric component of the state-of-the-art HadGEM3 global climate model have been carried out to quantify relative roles of changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), and anthropogenic aerosols (AAer). Results indicate that the model forced by changes in all forcings reproduces many of the observed changes since the mid-1990s over Western Europe. Changes in SST/SIE explain 62.2 ± 13.0 % of the area averaged seasonal mean warming signal over Western Europe, with the remaining 37.8 ± 13.6 % of the warming explained by the direct impact of changes in GHGs and AAer. Results further indicate that the direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe, mainly through aerosol-radiation interaction with additional contributions from aerosol-cloud interaction and coupled atmosphere-land surface feedbacks, is a key factor for increases in annual hottest day temperature and in frequency of summer days. It explains 45.5 ± 17.6 % and 40.9 ± 18.4 % of area averaged signals for these temperature extremes. The direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe acts to increase DTR locally, but the change in DTR is countered by the direct impact of GHGs forcing. In the next few decades, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise and AAer precursor emissions over Europe and North America will continue to decline. Our results suggest that the changes in summer seasonal mean SAT and temperature extremes over Western Europe since the mid-1990s are most likely to be sustained or amplified in the near term, unless other factors intervene. © 2016, The Author(s).","Anthropogenic aerosol; Atmospheric general circulation model; Greenhouse gas; Surface air temperature; Temperature extremes; Western Europe","aerosol; air temperature; atmospheric general circulation model; extreme event; greenhouse gas; summer; surface temperature; warming; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966292302

However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated all planktonic food-web components in tropical regions. The aim of this study was to unravel the top-down controls (metazooplankton community structure), bottom-up controls (resource availability), and hydrologic (water residence time) and physical (temperature) variables that affect different components of the microbial food web (MFW) carbon stock in tropical reservoirs, through structural equation models (SEM). We conducted a field study in four deep Brazilian reservoirs (Balbina, Tucuruí, Três Marias, and Funil) with different trophic states (oligo-, meso-, and eutrophic). We found evidence of a high contribution of the MFW (up to 50% of total planktonic carbon), especially in the less-eutrophic reservoirs (Balbina and Tucuruí). Bottom-up and top-down effects assessed through SEM indicated negative interactions between soluble reactive phosphorus and phototrophic picoplankton (PPP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). Copepods positively affected ciliates, and cladocerans positively affected heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and PPP. Higher copepod/cladoceran ratios and an indirect positive effect of copepods on HB might strengthen HB-HNF coupling. We also found low values for the degree of uncoupling (D) and a low HNF/HB ratio compared with literature data (mostly from temperate regions). This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating the whole size spectrum (including microbial compartments) of the different planktonic compartments, in order to capture the complex carbon dynamics of tropical aquatic ecosystems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carbon stock; Degree of uncoupling; Grazing; Structure equation models","fresh water; nitrogen; animal; bacterium; Brazil; ciliate; Cladocera; copepod; ecosystem; eutrophication; food chain; metabolism; microbiology; plankton; temperature; Animals; Bacteria; Brazil; Ciliophora; Cladocera; Copepoda; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Food Chain; Fresh Water; Nitrogen; Plankton; Temperature; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000786118

Echoing the controversial Aviation Directive, the Regulation is intended to support a unilateral market-based measure, and includes emissions from outside EU territory. This raises the question whether, according to international law, the EU has jurisdiction to regulate such 'extraterritorial' circumstances. In exploring the appropriate jurisdictional bases, we argue that neither the Law of the Sea Convention, nor world trade law definitively decide this issue. We therefore devote more detailed attention to the customary international law of State jurisdiction supplementing these regimes. We seek to build on the existing analysis by examining climate change as a 'common concern of mankind'. We argue that this emerging concept has distinct legal implications that can and should be accommodated within the interest-balancing exercise underlying the jurisdictional analysis.

It is found that desorption of molecular adsorbate from CNT surface can be controlled by UV−vis photoexcitations. In addition, it is shown that the presence of CNT substrate facilitates photodecomposition of the adsorbate molecule, related to optically controlled explosion. This model demonstrates potential of photoinduced charge transfer between the adsorbate and substrate, which can affect efficiency of desorption and decomposition reactions.

An ensemble-based Kalman filter technique (namely the local ensemble transform Kalman filter - LETKF) has been utilized to optimally combine model background and satellite retrievals. Our implementation of the ensemble is based on known uncertainties in the physical parametrizations of the dust emission scheme. Experiments showed that MODIS AOD retrievals using the Dark Target algorithm can help NMMB-MONARCH to better characterize atmospheric dust. This is particularly true for the analysis of the dust outflow in the Sahel region and over the African Atlantic coast. The assimilation of MODIS AOD retrievals based on the Deep Blue algorithm has a further positive impact in the analysis downwind from the strongest dust sources of the Sahara and in the Arabian Peninsula.

The findings reveal that the years 2006–07 represent a turning point, after which climate change studies appear more prominently and consistently in the urban planning and design literature; however, the majority of these studies address climate change mitigation rather than adaptation. Most adaptation studies deal with governance, social learning, and vulnerability assessments, while paying little attention to physical planning and urban design interventions. This paper identifies four gaps that pertain to the lack of interdisciplinary linkages, the absence of knowledge transfer, the presence of scale conflict, and the dearth of participatory research methods. It then advocates for the advancement of participatory and collaborative action research to meet the multifaceted challenges of climate change. © 2016 Newcastle University.","climate change adaptation; mitigation; physical planning; urban design","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; governance approach; learning; research work; urban design; urban planning; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982810948

This paper uses an energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL to analyse the role of electric vehicles (EV) in India. The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a ‘Reference’ scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a ‘EV policy’ scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a ‘low carbon’ scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 °C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2- wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2° C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply-push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-à-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2° C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-à-vis all three indicators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 mitigation; Cobenefits; Electric vehicle; Electricity demand","Air pollution; Air quality; Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy security; Forestry; Pollution; Risk perception; Secondary batteries; Stabilization; Vehicles; Cobenefits; Electricity demands; Emissions reduction; Energy system model; Financial incentives; Passenger transport; Scenarios analysis; Temperature stabilization; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995531387

Despite its climatic importance, there are large uncertainties in basic metrics of the biological pump. Previous estimates of the strength of the biological pump, as measured by the amount of organic carbon exported from the euphotic zone, range from about 4 to 12 Pg C yr−1. The fate of exported carbon, in terms of how efficiently it is transferred into the deep ocean, is even more uncertain. Here we present a new model of the biological pump that assimilates satellite and oceanographic tracer observations to constrain rates and patterns of organic matter production, export, and remineralization in the ocean. The data-assimilated model predicts a global particulate organic carbon (POC) flux out of the euphotic zone of ∼9 Pg C yr−1. The particle export ratio (the ratio of POC export to net primary production) is highest at high latitudes and lowest at low latitudes, but low-latitude export is greater than predicted by previous models, in better agreement with observed patterns of long-term carbon export. Particle transfer efficiency (Teff) through the mesopelagic zone is controlled by temperature and oxygen, with highest Teff for high-latitude regions and oxygen minimum zones. In contrast, Teff in the deep ocean (below 1000 m) is controlled by particle sinking speed, with highest deep ocean Teff below the subtropical gyres. These results emphasize the utility of both remote sensing and oceanographic tracer observations for constraining the operation of the biological pump. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

One of the pollutants emitted from transportation which affect human's health is NO2. Plants, especially trees, have high potential in reducing air pollutants from transportation through diffusion, absorbtion, adsorption and deposition. Purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of several tree canopy types on roadside green belt in influencing distribution of NO2 gas emitted from transportation. The study conducted in three plots of tree canopy in Jagorawi Highway: Bungur (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Gmelina (Gmelina arborea) and Tanjung (Mimusops elengi). The tree canopy ability in absorbing pollutant is derived by comparing air quality on vegetated area with ambience air quality at control area (open field). Air sampling was conducted to measure NO2 concentration at elevation 1.5m, 5m and 10m at distance 0m, 10m and 30m, using Air Sampler Impinger. Concentration of NO2 was analyzed with Griess-Saltzman method. From this research, the result of ANOVA showed that tree plot (vegetated area) affected significantly to NO2 concentration. However the effect of distance from road and elevation was not significant. Among the plots, the highest NO2 concentration was found on Control plot (area without tree canopy), while the lowest NO2 concentration was found in Tanjung plot. Tanjung plot with round shape and high density canopy performed better in reducing NO2 than Bungur plot with round shape and medium density canopy, regardless the sampling elevation and distance. Gmelina plot performed the best in reducing horizontal distribution of NO2 concentration at elevation 1.5 and 5m, but the result at elevation 10m was not significant. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Air pollution; Air quality; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Quality control; Roadsides; Air pollutants; Air samplers; Air sampling; Control area; Gmelina arborea; High potential; Horizontal distribution; Urban air pollution; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018681944

We grew 35 natural accessions of the grass Brachypodium distachyon in four environments in the glasshouse, contrasting soil water deficit, elevated temperature and their interaction. We modeled treatment, genotype and interactive effects on leaf-level and whole-plant traits, including fecundity. We also assessed the relationship between glasshouse-measured traits and parameters related to climate at the place of origin. We found abundant genetic variation in both constitutive and induced traits related to plant–water relations. Most traits showed strong interaction between temperature and water availability, and we observed genotype-by-environment interaction for several traits. Notably, leaf free proline abundance showed a strong effect of genotype × temperature × water. We found strong associations between phenology, biomass and water use efficiency (WUE) with parameters describing climate of origin.

In our study, we applied a top-down approach to quantify mercury emissions on the basis of atmospheric mercury measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. We established the source-receptor relationships and by the means of atmospheric inversion we were able to quantify spatially resolved European emissions of 89 ± 14 t/a for elemental mercury. Our European emission estimate is 17% higher than the bottom-up emission inventory, which is within stated uncertainties. However, some regions with unexpectedly high emissions were identified. Stationary combustion, in particular in coal-fired power plants, is found to be the main responsible sector for increased emission estimates.

One mechanism employed by the Pacific Islands to overcome conflict is the formation of climate networks that work together to meet the needs of the islands as a region. During this process of networked governance, however, contestations occur between the local and global strategies and knowledges that must be navigated by state and nonstate organizations in these networks in order to achieve their respective aims. In order to gain authority to make decisions and govern on climate issues, these networks employ particular narratives—constructions of the hero, victim, and villain, both human and nonhuman, in the story of climate policy—that both produce and are produced by these local/global contestations. This article explores these issues in the context of the Pacific Island Forum and Pacific Island Development Forum summits leading up to the 2015 Conference of the Parties, and their final climate declarations. Through this investigation, two competing narratives are found—the global technical narrative and the local power narrative. These narratives impacted the deliberations and subsequent climate declarations in these Pacific summits, with both the global technical narrative of the Pacific Island Forum summit and the local power narrative of the Pacific Island Development Forum summit being evident in their final declarations. These narrative constructions have consequences for the representativeness of the decisions made in these networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; International environmental governance; Knowledge; Narrative; Networks; Pacific islands","climate change; decision making; environmental degradation; environmental legislation; environmental policy; island state; regional development; shoreline; Pacific islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012081844

However, in-depth, evidence-based investigations of the relationships among individual perceptions, climatic disaster experiences, and daily behaviors regarding adaptation to climate change remain to be conducted. We obtained survey data from 488 respondents in southwestern China, a region prone to frequent and severe droughts, to assess factors that influence adaptive behaviors and to identify their pathways. We applied Construal Level Theory (CLT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to differentiate between respondents' high-level abstract construals and their low-level concrete construals. We analyzed the influences of these two levels of perception, combined with drought experiences on water-saving behaviors. We developed a structural equation model to estimate the correlation coefficients of the latent and observed variables in the structural process linked to the respondents' adaptive behaviors. The results found that a concrete perception of saving water plays a more significant part than an abstract perception of climate change in prompting specific adaptive behaviors. Improving public perceptions of climate change might increase the desirability of adaptation, whereas improving perceptions of water saving might increase the feasibility of implementing adaptive measures.

A review of Chinese experiences in ensuring food self-sufficiency and reducing carbon emission in the agricultural sector can provide a valuable reference for similar countries and regions. According to a comprehensive review of previous publications and recent field observations, China has experienced on average a larger and faster climatic warming trend than the global trend, and there are large uncertainties in precipitation change, which shows a non-significantly increasing trend. Existing evidence shows that the effects of climatic warming on major staple crop production in China could be markedly negative or positive, depending on the specific cropping region, season, and crop. However, historical data analysis and field warming experiments have shown that moderate warming, of less than 2.0 °C, could benefit crop production in China overall. During the most recent warming decades, China has made successful adaptations in cropping systems, such as new cultivar breeding, cropping region adjustment, and cropping practice optimization, to exploit the positive rather than to avoid the negative effects of climatic warming on crop growth. All of these successful adaptations have greatly increased crop yield, leading to higher resource use efficiency as well as greatly increased soil organic carbon content with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Under the warming climate, China has not only achieved great successes in crop production but also realized a large advance in greenhouse gas emission mitigation. Chinese experiences in cropping system innovation for coping with climatic warming demonstrate that food security and climatic warming mitigation can be synergized through policy, knowledge, and technological innovation. With the increasingly critical status of food security and climatic warming, further efforts should be invested in new agricultural policy, knowledge and technology creation, and popularization of climate-smart agriculture, and more financial investments should be made in field infrastructure development to increase cropping system resilience in China. © 2016 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Carbon emission mitigation; Food security; Global warming; Grain production; Response and adaptation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016398603

It has however been reported that this type of engine is emitting more ultrafine particles than the Euro 6c Particle Number (PN) limit of 6·1011 particles/km that will be introduced in Europe as of September 2017 in parallel with the Real Driving Emission (RDE) procedure. The emissions performance of a Euro 6b GDI passenger car was measured, first in the OEM build without a Gasoline Particulate Filter (GPF) and then as a demonstrator with a coated GPF in the underfloor position. Regulated emissions were measured on the European regulatory test cycles NEDC and WLTC and in real-world conditions with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) according to the published European RDE procedure (Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/427 and 2016/646). Finally, tests were conducted on the chassis dyno to explore the impact of going towards the RDE boundary conditions (driving dynamics and ambient temperature as defined in the RDE legislation). PN results showed that the vehicle was a state-of-the-art GDI as values on the regulatory test cycles were below the Euro 6c limit of 6·1011 particles/km in its original configuration using the reference E5 fuel. A maximum value of 9·1011 particles/km was measured during the on-road tests, increasing to 2·1012 particles/km when going towards the RDE boundary conditions. With the GPF, PN emissions were controlled well below 6·1011 particles/km on NEDC, WLTC and on-road RDE. With GPF, emissions stayed well below 9·1011 particles/km towards the RDE boundaries, demonstrating that the GPF enables well controlled real-world PN emissions. No fuel penalty impact could be measured for the GPF during the tests and NOx emissions were always below the Euro 6d NTE (Not-to-exceed) limit that will apply from 2020 onwards.

A large number of research projects in the field of biofuels have been carried out. Biomasses can be converted into primarily liquid products in the presence of a reducing reagent, e.g., carbon monoxide or hydrogen. The main biofuels from biomasses are bioethanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, biogas, and charcoal. The main biofuels are bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, vegetable oils, biomethanol, pyrolysis oils, biogas, synthesis gas, and biohydrogen. The two major ethanol producers are the United States and Brazil followed by the European Union and China. The two major biodiesel producers are the European Union and Indonesia followed by Brazil and the United States. While the share of biofuels will become 5.0% the total automotive fuel consumption in 2020, it will increase to 11.8% in 2050. Liquid biofuels, especially ethanol and biodiesel, hold promise for the future. There is a worldwide interest in sustainable energy sources based on biofuels. Liquid biofuels are important alternative to fossil liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Biofuels are promising alternatives for the road, aviation, and maritime fueling. Suitable liquid biofuels can be used as bio-jet fuels, and the alternative biofuels of today may become the conventional fuels in the future. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiesel; bioethanol; biofuels; goals; hopes","Automotive fuels; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Biogas; Carbon monoxide; Charcoal; Diesel fuels; Ethanol; Fighter aircraft; Gas oils; Liquids; Synthetic fuels; Conventional fuel; European union; goals; hopes; Liquid biofuels; Liquid products; Reducing reagents; Sustainable energy sources; Bioethanol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016926174

Two major ways to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions are by reducing mass and improving aerodynamics. In the wheel segment, these two possible means to improve fuel economy compete against each other. Most lightweight wheel designs are detrimental to aerodynamics and aerodynamic wheels are seen as unstylish and with a high mass penalty. One solution is through the use of composite wheel technology which replaces non-structural aluminum with lighter weight materials. This study used SAE J2263 and SAE J2264 procedures to establish baseline fuel economy numbers and to evaluate various mass, inertial and aerodynamic differences between wheel concepts. Additional physical studies included steady state testing and real world road testing. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was also performed to examine the link between the fuel economy differences and coefficient of drag (Cd). It is concluded that the lightest weight wheel studied is not the most fuel efficient, nor is the heaviest. Additionally, applying a surface without a permanent attachment, such as a wheel cover, is also not the most fuel efficient. The wheel technology that provides the highest fuel efficiency and reduces emissions is one that focuses on improving aerodynamics through the use of permanently bonded aerodynamic surfaces and mass optimized structural backbones. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuels; Testing; Wheels; Aerodynamic surfaces; Coefficient of drag; Computational fluid dynamics analysis; Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Emissions reduction; Fuel efficiency; Vehicle development; Vehicle fuel economy; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018413122

The laser annealing is a cold process that preserves the chemical state and integrity of the underlying aluminum layer, while it is essential for the improvement of the ZnO performance as a light emitter and leads to enhanced emission in the visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. In all cases, the metal interlayer enhances the intensity of the emitted light, either through coupling of the surface plasmon that is excited at the Al/ZnO interface, in the case of light-emitting ZnO in the ultraviolet region, or by the increased back reflection from the Al layer, in the case of the visible emission. In order to evaluate the process and develop a solid understanding of the relevant physical phenomena, we investigated the effects of various metals as interlayers (Al, Ag, and Au), the metal interlayer thickness, and the incorporation of a dielectric spacer layer between Al and ZnO. Based on these experiments, Al emerged as the undisputable best choice of metal interlayers because of its compatibility with the laser annealing process, as well as due to its high optical reflectivity at 380 and 248 nm, which leads to the effective coupling with surface plasmons at the Al/ZnO interfaces at 380 nm and the secondary annealing of ZnO by the back-reflected 248 nm laser beam. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Annealing; Composite films; Gold; Laser beams; Light emission; Metal analysis; Metals; Plasmons; Substrates; Thin films; Zinc oxide; Dielectric spacers; Laser annealing process; Optical reflectivity; Photoluminescence enhancement; Secondary annealing; Ultraviolet emission; Ultraviolet region; Ultraviolet spectral range; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014853449

Paleoclimate always explained a greater amount of the variance in soil C stocks than current climate at regional and global scales.

To date surface transport in the EU has benefited from the push effect of renewable transport energy policy. This has led to the development of a biodiesel industry in the EU to meet the demand created by renewable fuel obligations. Biojet fuel has not benefited from this uplift with only one Member State (The Netherlands) acknowledging the option of biojet fuel as a means of contribution to the renewable transport target. This chapter explores biofuels for aviation or biojet fuel as a policy option to reduce emissions. Direct emissions from civil aviation currently account for about 3% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels can help lower the EU's carbon footprint by providing a renewable alternative to jet fuel in airliners. Biofuels emit less CO2 and contain no sulfur compounds. Our analysis shows that in the absence of action, emissions from EU aviation will grow from 151 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 to 405Mt in 2050. This represents a 167% increase on 2005 levels. The additional costs for biojet fuels are between 0.42 and 1.20/L. These costs, if spread across all domestic and intra-EU flights in 2020, would add between 1.20 and 4.30 to the cost per passenger of a typical 1000km flight.

Until recently, weather and climate (change) have been largely represented quantitatively and discussed at broad spatial and social scales. Qualitative weather research is helping to reconnect weather with its diverse local meanings and to explain how climate change may alter future representational and behavioral understands of weather (herein called ''weather-relations'') in the hope of furthering climate change action. Responding to the need for greater research into weather-relations, particularly in industrialized urban areas, this paper examines the role of weather in everyday life in tropical Darwin, Australia. It identifies a willingness among participants to stay ''weather-connected'' despite challenging weather conditions and access to air conditioning. This willingness is driven by desires to remain acclimatized in order to enhance positive weather sensations, retain outdoor lifestyles, and reduce financial and environmental costs associated with resource-intensive technologies. In delving into weather adjustment strategies that facilitate weather-connectedness along with possible climate change implications, greater potential for weather-relations research is recognized. By drawing attention to weather experiences and understandings alongside resource efficient weather responses, this paper uncovered a substantial capacity among participants to respond sustainably to environmental change. These capacities are the outcome of adjustment practices relating to food, clothing, laundering, physical and outdoor activities, and domestic comfort and a previously unrecognized coping strategy expressions of tolerance. Findings suggest that by recognizing and fostering existing adjustment capabilities of societies and cultures and the local values that afford their reproduction, communities would be better placed to adapt to future climate change. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"acclimation; climate change; coping strategy; environmental change; lifestyle; living standard; resource use; socioeconomic indicator; urban area; willingness to pay; Australia; Darwin; Northern Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014067010

The objective of this study was to explore the taxonomic composition and presumed functional diversity of cave sediment metagenomes using paired end Illumina sequencing using V3 region of 16S rRNA gene and bioinformatics pipeline. Results: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria were the major phyla in all the five cave sediment samples. Among the five caves the highest diversity is found in Lamsialpuk with a Shannon index 12.5 and the lowest in Bukpuk (Shannon index 8.22). In addition, imputed metagenomic approach was used to predict the functional role of microbial community in biogeochemical cycling in the cave environments. Functional module showed high representation of genes involved in Amino Acid Metabolism in (20.9%) and Carbohydrate Metabolism (20.4%) in the KEGG pathways. Genes responsible for carbon degradation, carbon fixation, methane metabolism, nitrification, nitrate reduction and ammonia assimilation were also predicted in the present study. Conclusion: The cave sediments of the biodiversity hotspot region possessing a oligotrophic environment harbours high phylogenetic diversity dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Among the geochemical factors, ferric oxide was correlated with increased microbial diversity. In-silico analysis detected genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, methane metabolism and complex metabolic pathways responsible for the survival of the bacterial community in nutrient limited cave environments. Present study with Paired end Illumina sequencing along with bioinformatics analysis revealed the essential ecological role of the cave bacterial communities. These results will be useful in documenting the biospeleology of this region and systematic understanding of bacterial communities in natural sediment environments as well. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biospeleology; Cave; Functional diversity; Illumina sequencing; KEGG pathways","nitric oxide synthase; nitrite reductase; nitrogenase; RNA 16S; amino acid; ammonia; bacterial DNA; carbon; ferric ion; ferric oxide; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; amino acid metabolism; ammonia formation; Article; biogeochemical cycling; bioinformatics; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon degradation; carbon fixation; cave; concentration (parameters); correlation analysis; DNA extraction; geochemical analysis; metagenome; methane metabolism; microbial community; nitrate reduction; nitrification; nitrogen fixation; operational taxonomic unit; phylogeny; principal component analysis; Proteobacteria; sediment; sequence analysis; taxonomy; Verrucomicrobia; X ray fluorescence; bacterium; biodiversity; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon cycle; cave; chemistry; classification; ecology; genetics; India; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; nitrogen cycle; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; survival; Amino Acids; Ammonia; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Biodiversity; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Caves; Classification; DNA, Bacterial; Ecology; Ferric Compounds; Geologic Sediments; India; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis; Soil Microbiology; Survival",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018655863

The relativistic particles can interact with different fields (magnetic or radiation) in the colliding-wind region and produce non-thermal emission. In many cases, non-thermal synchrotron radiation might be observable and thus constitute an indicator of the existence of a relativistic particle population in these multiple systems. To date, the catalogue of PACWBs includes about 40 objects spread over many stellar types and evolutionary stages, with no clear trend pointing to privileged subclasses of objects likely to accelerate particles. This paper aims at discussing critically some criteria for selecting new candidates among massive binaries. The subsequent search for non-thermal radiation in these objects is expected to lead to new detections of particle accelerators. On the basis of this discussion, some broad ideas for observation strategies are formulated. At this stage of the investigation of PACWBs, there is no clear reason to consider particle acceleration in massive binaries as an anomaly or even as a rare phenomenon. We therefore consider that several PACWBs will be detected in the forthcoming years, essentially using sensitive radio interferometers which are capable of measuring synchrotron emission from colliding-wind binaries. Prospects for high-energy detections are also briefly addressed. © ESO, 2017.","Acceleration of particles; Binaries: general; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Radio continuum: stars; Stars: massive","Chemical detection; Interferometers; Particle accelerators; Relativity; Stars; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; Acceleration of particles; Binaries: general; Radiation mechanisms: non thermal; Radio continuum: stars; Stars: massive; Bins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016624218

Replacing conventional plastics with bio-based plastics (made from renewable feedstocks) is frequently proposed as a way to mitigate these impacts. Comparatively little research has considered the potential for green energy to reduce emissions in this industry. This paper compares two strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. plastics production: using renewable energy or switching to renewable feedstocks. Renewable energy pathways assume all process energy comes from wind power and renewable natural gas derived from landfill gas. Renewable feedstock pathways assume that all commodity thermoplastics will be replaced with polylactic acid (PLA) and bioethylene-based plastics, made using either corn or switchgrass, and powered using either conventional or renewable energy. Corn-based biopolymers produced with conventional energy are the dominant near-term biopolymer option, and can reduce industry-wide GHG emissions by 25%, or 16 million tonnes CO2e/year (mean value). In contrast, switching to renewable energy cuts GHG emissions by 50%-75% (a mean industry-wide reduction of 38 million tonnes CO2e/year). Both strategies increase industry costs by up to $85/tonne plastic (mean result) for renewable energy, and up to $3000 tonne-1 plastic for renewable feedstocks. Overall, switching to renewable energy achieves greater emission reductions, with less uncertainty and lower costs than switching to corn-based biopolymers. In the long run, producing bio-based plastics from advanced feedstocks (e.g. switchgrass) and/or with renewable energy can further reduce emissions, to approximately 0 CO2e/year (mean value). © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Bio-based plastics; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy; Renewable feedstocks","Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Elastomers; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Gases; Life cycle; Plants (botany); Plastic products; Plastics; Renewable energy resources; Switching; Wind power; Bio-based; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Renewable feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; biogenic material; commodity; cost analysis; emission; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; industrial production; landfill; life cycle analysis; mitigation; natural gas; plastic; polymer; renewable resource; wind power; United States; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037129565

Monaldi and University, Federico II Medical School, Napoli, Italy","Background: Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8 × 107 km2) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1 × 107 Km2) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body: Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32-36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the 'hotspots' of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion: Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50-70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air pollution and respiratory diseases; Anthropogenic emissions of CO2; Bronchial asthma; Climate change; Deforestation and climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Interaction between climate change and allergy; Respiratory allergy","carbon dioxide; air pollution; allergy; asthma; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biosphere; Brazil; climate change; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); deforestation; disease exacerbation; environmental change; greenhouse gas; human; particulate matter; photosynthesis; plant growth; Review; risk factor; seasonal variation; skin test; temperature measurement; tropical rain forest; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014521437

This chapter highlights the impact of climate change on the wetlands of tropical islands, with Nicobar group of islands in India as a representative case. Nicobar has a prominent tribal group practicing community living by gathering resources available from the terrestrial and coastal waters. The islands are vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme events such as tsunami, earthquake, and cyclones that affect their routine life. The receding arable and forest areas also affect their livelihood. The projected changes in mean temperature and precipitation for Nicobar region indicate that the rainfall pattern is all set to change significantly during different seasons and the pattern of change in Nicobar would be different from that in Andaman. The magnitude of climate vagaries is likely to be more prominent in the years to come. This chapter illustrates the vulnerability of tropical island ecosystems in general and the Nicobar Islands in particular, to changing climate and calls for incorporating sea level rise into coastal planning and development of appropriate decision-support systems for taking adaptive action, in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these islands and their wetland ecosystems. © Springer (India) Pvt.

Methana is a peninsula in Peloponnesus, Greece whose arid climate and hydrological situation is similar to that of the nearby small islands of the Aegean Sea. Similarly, the chemical and isotopic compositions of its water are dominated by the mixing of seawater with meteoric water both through direct intrusion and meteoric recharge. However, the simple mixing trends at Methana are modified by water–rock interaction processes, enhanced by the dissolution of endogenous CO2, which lead to strong enrichments in alkalinity, Ca, Ba, Fe and Mn. The thermal waters show very high salinity that is sometimes close to that of seawater [total dissolved solids (TDS) = 8.5–40 g/l]. Although the cold groundwaters sometimes also show elevated TDS values (up to 6.3 g/l), their overall quality is acceptable due to the trace metal and nitrate contents mostly being below acceptable limits. While the saltiest groundwaters are not acceptable for human consumption, they are used for irrigation without exerting toxic effects on plants, which is probably due to the high permeability of the soils not supporting salt accumulation and salinity-resistant crops being cultivated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogeochemistry; Salinization; Stable isotopes; Trace elements; Volcanic aquifers","Alkalinity; Aquifers; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Manganese removal (water treatment); Mixing; Seawater; Soils; Trace elements; Volcanoes; Water quality; Anthropogenic factors; Hydro geochemistries; Hydrogeochemical studies; Natural water samples; Salinization; Stable isotopes; Total dissolved solids; Volcanic aquifers; Hydrochemistry; anthropogenic effect; aquifer; climate conditions; geothermal system; groundwater; isotopic composition; salinization; semiarid region; stable isotope; thermal water; trace element; water chemistry; water quality; Greece; Peloponnese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009999881

The final amalgamation of the CAOB terrane collage involved diachronous closure of the Permian-Triassic Solonker suture in northernmost China and the Jurassic Mongol-Okhotsk suture in northeast Mongolia and eastern Siberia. The distribution, style, and kinematics of deformation associated with these two terminal collision events is poorly documented in southern Mongolia and northernmost China because these regions were later tectonically overprinted by widespread Cretaceous basin and range-style crustal extension and Miocene-recent sinistral transpressional mountain building. These younger events structurally compartmentalized the crust into uplifted crystalline basement blocks and intermontane basins. Consequently, widespread Cretaceous and Late Cenozoic clastic sedimentary deposits overlie older Permian-Jurassic sedimentary rocks in most basinal areas and obscure the deformation record associated with Permian-Triassic Solonker and Jurassic Mongol-Okhotsk collisional suturing. In this report, satellite image mapping of basinal compartments that expose folded Permian-Jurassic sedimentary successions that are unconformably overlapped by Cretaceous-Quaternary clastic sediments is presented for remote and poorly studied regions of southern Mongolia and two areas of the Beishan. The largest folds are tens of kilometers in strike length, east-west trending, and reveal north-south Late Jurassic shortening (present coordinates). Late Jurassic fold vergence is dominantly northerly in the southern Gobi Altai within a regional-scale fold-and-thrust belt. Local refolding of older Permian north-south trending folds is also evident in some areas. The folds identified and mapped in this study provide new evidence for the regional distribution and kinematics of Jurassic and Permian-Triassic contractional tectonism in the southern Mongolia-northern China borderland region. The newly mapped folds are also important potential targets for hydrocarbon exploration and vertebrate paleontological discoveries. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Beishan; CAOB; China; Fold-and-Thrust-Belt; Gobi Altai; Intracontinental deformation; Mongol-Okhotsk; Mongolia; Orogeny; Permian-Jurassic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012980100

Climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) are one method to assess risk and are increasingly used as a tool to inform management plans. Migratory animals move across regions and continents during their annual cycles where they are exposed to diverse climatic conditions. Climate change during any period and in any region of the annual cycle could influence survival, reproduction, or the cues used to optimize timing of migration. Therefore, CCVAs for migratory animals best estimate risk when they include climate exposure during the entire annual cycle. We developed a CCVA incorporating the full annual cycle and applied this method to 46 species of migratory birds breeding in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (UMGL) region of the United States. Our methodology included background risk, climate change exposure × climate sensitivity, adaptive capacity to climate change, and indirect effects of climate change. We compiled information about migratory connectivity between breeding and stationary non-breeding areas using literature searches and U.S. Geological Survey banding and re-encounter data. Climate change exposure (temperature and moisture) was assessed using UMGL breeding season climate and winter climate from non-breeding regions for each species. Where possible, we focused on non-breeding regions known to be linked through migratory connectivity. We ranked 10 species as highly vulnerable to climate change and two as having low vulnerability. The remaining 34 species were ranked as moderately vulnerable. In general, including non-breeding data provided more robust results that were highly individualistic by species. Two species were found to be highly vulnerable throughout their annual cycle. Projected drying will have the greatest effect during the non-breeding season for species overwintering in Mexico and the Caribbean. Projected temperature increases will have the greatest effect during the breeding season in UMGL as well as during the non-breeding season for species overwintering in South America. We provide a model for adaptive management of migratory animals in the face of projected climate change, including identification of priority species, research needs, and regions within non-breeding ranges for potential conservation partnerships. © 2017 Culp et al.","Adaptive capacity; Annual cycle; Climate change exposure; Climate change vulnerability; Climate sensitivity; Migratory birds; Migratory connectivity; Non-breeding season",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016140388

With DR, a building may make a profit by optimizing its energy consumption while helping to achieve the overall targets of energy efficiency and emission reduction for the whole energy system. The recent US Supreme Court ruling on FERC Order 745 has reaffirmed the critical role and functions of demand response. It is expected that demand response will soon become a basic function of smart buildings. In this paper, we summarize the background of demand response, investigate promising automation technology such as OpenADR for demand response applications in smart buildings, and present an OpenADR Interface prototype demonstration for building energy management systems.

The results showed that the NH3 emission potentials and N pools presented small variations among seasons, which were mainly controlled by plant species and the leaf age. Also, high emission potential in one species did not correspond to high tissue N content. Specifically, the Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) had higher NH3 emission potential (mean: 46.2) but lower N content (mean: 1.6% of Dw). The leaf privet (Ligustrum quihoui Carr.) was with the moderate emission potential (15) and the highest N content (2.7% of Dw) on average, which for the Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) were both low. Overall, the emission potentials of the six species were too low (&lt;200) to build up a sufficiently high NH3 partial pressure in the leaves. Therefore, the Masson pine dominant subtropical forest at TSP acts as a sink for the atmospheric NH3, indicating that using the N flux in throughfall only may significantly underestimate the N income of the ecosystem. The results are informative for future modeling of plant-atmosphere NH3 exchange and estimating N budget in local or regional scales. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ammonia; Emission potential; Nitrogen pool; Subtropical forests; Temporal variability","ammonia; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; bioaccumulation; emission; evergreen forest; gas exchange; leaf; nitrogen cycle; subtropical region; temporal variation; China; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Ligustrum quihoui; Pinus massoniana; ammonia; nitrogen; soil; chemistry; China; ecosystem; forest; plant leaf; soil; tree; Ammonia; China; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015081946

Microbiological analysis included heterotrophic and oil-degrading bacterial counts, isolation of the phenanthrene-degrading bacteria, and identification of cyanobacteria. Generally, in comparison to the results from previous studies, concentrations of the measured pollutants have been in a decline. Specifically, the metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were reduced whereas microbial counts and toxicity tests did not indicate significant pollution.

We investigate the fragmentation properties from 0.3 pc to 0.06 pc scales of a homogenous sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps within 4.5 kpc selected from the ATLASGAL survey. Using the ALMA 7 m array we detect compact dust continuum emission towards all targets and find that fragmentation, at these scales, is limited. The mass distribution of the fragments uncovers a large fraction of cores above 40 M, corresponding to massive dense cores (MDCs) with masses up to ~400 M. Seventy-seven percent of the clumps contain at most 3 MDCs per clump, and we also reveal single clumps/MDCs. The most massive cores are formed within the more massive clumps and a high concentration of mass on small scales reveals a high core formation efficiency. The mass of MDCs highly exceeds the local thermal Jeans mass, and we lack the observational evidence of a sufficiently high level of turbulence or strong enough magnetic fields to keep the most massive MDCs in equilibrium. If already collapsing, the observed fragmentation properties with a high core formation efficiency are consistent with the collapse setting in at parsec scales. © ESO, 2017.","Stars: formation; Stars: massive; Submillimeter: ISM","Efficiency; Stars; Continuum emission; Core formation; Evolutionary stage; Mass distribution; Small scale; Stars: formation; Stars: massive; Submillimeter: isms; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017176513

However, increasing NOx emissions from emerging industries, such as unconventional natural gas (UNG) extraction, could offset stationary source emission reductions in shale gas producing regions of the U.S. The Marcellus Shale in the northeastern U.S. has seen dramatic increases in the number of wells and associated natural gas production during the past 10 years. In this study, we examine the potential impacts of shale gas development on regional NOx emission inventories and dry deposition fluxes to Clean Air Status and Trends (CASTNET) sites in Pennsylvania and New York. Our results demonstrate that the current distribution of CASTNET sites is ineffective for monitoring the influence of Marcellus well NOx emissions on regional nitrogen deposition. Despite the fact that existing CASTNET sites are not influenced by UNG extraction activity, NOx emissions densities from shale gas extraction are substantial and are estimated to reach up to 21 kg NOx ha-1 year-1 in some regions.

Crops like soy bean, oil palm and rubber have led to drastic changes in land cover over the past decades, thereby altering ecosystem functions and services (ESS). Associated shifts in ESS such as climate regulation, erosion and water cycles, biodiversity as well as soil fertility or the provisioning of raw materials have been assessed through several models and software solutions (InVEST, ARIES, MIMES). However, suitable methods for the integration of a range of biodiversity assessments in agricultural landscapes are scarce. With this study, we introduce a methodology for incorporating multiple levels of species diversity into models to allow an integrated evaluation of ESS. We collected data sets from both published and unpublished sources on the distribution of vascular plants, selected pollinator groups, ground beetles, ungulates as well as amphibians, mammals, reptiles and birds in rubber-dominated landscapes, with a focus on our study sites in Southwest China and Thailand. Based on this information, we developed a common classification scheme that enables the integration of different facets of biodiversity (species diversity and functional diversity) to complement an interdisciplinary ESS assessment. Species diversity data were normalized against the most divers habitats reported (using habitat scores) to assess the impact of rubber cultivation on multiple levels of biodiversity. This resulted in a comparable matrix of different land use types and their suitability as habitat for the respective species groups allowing the aggregation of very diverse indicators. The findings were applied to two alternative land use scenarios in southern China to highlight the potential effects of land use and management decisions on species and functional diversity. Our results highlighted that the conservation oriented scenario did score higher for habitat suitability in both total species (+5%) as well as IUCN Red List species (+6%) assessments compared to the current state or business as usual scenarios (-2% and −3% compared to current state). The process presented here allows for an application within established ESS software programs, in our case InVEST, using aggregated indices while additionally providing enhanced opportunities for comparable, spatially explicit assessments of the expected impact of the analyzed scenarios on specific species groups. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service assessment; Habitat suitability; Indicator development; InVEST; Rubber","Application programs; Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Climate models; Conservation; Cultivation; Ecology; Land use; Palm oil; Plants (botany); Rubber; Tropics; Different land use types; Ecosystem services; Habitat suitability; Indicator development; InVEST; Land use and managements; Large-scale plantations; Spatially explicit assessments; Ecosystems; beetle; biodiversity; bioindicator; cultural landscape; ecosystem service; environmental assessment; environmental indicator; functional role; habitat structure; land use planning; pollinator; Red List; rubber; software; species diversity; species inventory; ungulate; vascular plant; China; Thailand; Amphibia; Aves; Carabidae; Elaeis; Mammalia; Reptilia; Tracheophyta; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007137838

Franco) stands in western North America are fertilized with nitrogen (N) to increase growth rates, but only about ⅔ of all stands respond. Understanding the mechanisms of response facilitates prioritization of stands for treatment. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the short-term basal area growth response to a single application of 224 kg N ha−1 as urea was associated with reduced stable carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) and increased intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) in a 20-yr-old plantation of Douglas-fir in the Oregon Coast Range, USA. Increment cores were measured to estimate earlywood, latewood, and total basal area increment over a time series from 1997 to 2015. Stable carbon isotope discrimination and iWUE were estimated using earlywood and latewood stable carbon isotope concentrations in tree-ring holocellulose starting seven years before fertilization in early 2009 and ending seven years after treatment. A highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) interaction effect between fertilization treatment and year was found for total basal area growth and earlywood basal area increment. Specifically, fertilized trees showed significant responses (p &lt; 0.05) in total basal area growth and earlywood basal area increment in the first (2009) and second (2010) growing seasons after fertilization in 2009. A marginally significant (p &lt; 0.10) fertilization effect was found for latewood basal area increment only in the first growing season after treatment. A significant treatment × year interaction was also found for Δ13C and iWUE in earlywood and latewood. Fertilization significantly reduced earlywood Δ13C and increased earlywood iWUE in the first and second growing seasons after fertilization. Only a marginally significant fertilization effect was detected for latewood Δ13C and iWUE in the second growing season after treatment. Previous studies of N fertilization of Douglas-fir forests have reported consistently increased growth and iWUE on low productivity sites treated with relatively high fertilization rates. This study suggested that these responses can also be observed on highly productive sites despite their lower frequency and apparently shorter duration. Other key mechanisms driving growth responses appear less important than iWUE, including an increase in LAI and shift from belowground to aboveground carbon allocation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Basal area increment; Carbon isotope discrimination; Fertilization; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Water use efficiency","Efficiency; Isotopes; Nitrogen fertilizers; Urea; Basal area increment; Carbon isotope discrimination; Fertilization; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Water use efficiency; Forestry; basal area; biomass allocation; carbon isotope; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; growing season; growth response; leaf area index; water use efficiency; Carbon; Fertilization; Isotopes; Pseudotsuga Menziesii; North America; Oregon; United States; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009144987

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits. © 2017 by the authors.

The US social cost of carbon (SCC) methodology is used in innovative ways to value new Earth observing systems (EOSs). The study departs from the strict US SCC methodology, and from previous work, in that net benefits are used instead of only damages to calculate the value of information of the enhanced systems. In other respects the US SCC methodology is followed closely. We compute the surfeit expected net benefits of learning the actionable information earlier, with the enhanced system, versus learning later with existing systems. The enhanced systems are designed to give reliable information about climate sensitivity on accelerated timescales relative to existing systems; therefore, the decision context stipulates that a global reduced emissions path would be deployed upon receiving suitable information on the rate of temperature rise with a suitable level of confidence. By placing the enhanced observing system in a decision context, the SCC enables valuing this system as a real option. Policy relevance Uncertainty in key parameters of the climatic system is often cited as a barrier for near-term reductions of carbon emissions. It is a truism among risk managers that uncertainty costs money, and its reduction has economic value. Advancing policy making under uncertainty requires valuing the reduction in uncertainty. Using CLARREO, a new proposed EOS,as an example, this article applies value of information/real option theory to value the reduction of uncertainty in the decadal rate of temperature rise. The US interagency social cost of carbon directive provides the decision context for the valuations. It is shown that the real option value of the uncertainty reduction, relative to existing observing systems, is a very large multiple of the new system's cost. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","CLARREO; climate observing system; DICE; real option value; social cost of carbon; value of information","carbon emission; decision making; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; EOS; learning; satellite mission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954122194

Thus, we measured field-scale N2O flux over 5 years (2005–2007, 2010–2011) from an annual crop rotation to evaluate how N2O emissions are influenced by no-till (NT) compared to conventional tillage (CV), and how crop residue removal (R−) rather than crop residue return to soil (R+) affects emissions from these two tillage systems. Data from all 5 years indicated no differences in N2O flux between tillage practices at the onset of the growing season, but CT had 1.4–6.3 times higher N2O flux than NT overwinter. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher due to R− compared to R+, but the effect was more marked under CT than NT and overwinter than during spring. Our results thus challenge the assumption based on IPCC methodology that crop residue removal will result in reduced N2O emissions. The potential for higher N2O emission with residue removal implies that the benefit of utilizing biomass as biofuels to mitigate greenhouse gas emission may be overestimated. Interestingly, prior to an overwinter thaw event, dissolved organic C (DOC) was negatively correlated to peak N2O flux (r = −0.93). This suggests that lower N2O emissions with R+ vs. R− may reflect more complete stepwise denitrification to N2 during winter and possibly relate to the heterotrophic microbial capacity for processing crop residue into more soluble C compounds and a shift in the preferential C source utilized by the microbial community overwinter. © 2016 The Authors.

The Vietnam Government has implemented a range of policies to assist migration in order to address these environmental problems. While much research has focused on the environmental causes of, and responses to, climate change there has been less research on the impact of environmentally motivated responses to climate change on labour force and human capital factors. This paper examines the experience of the Vietnam Government in encouraging internal migration from vulnerable agricultural areas to urban industrial cities, to explore the human capital effects of these environmentally motivated response to climate change. The paper first presents the environmental argument for migration in response to climate change, together with examples of what the Vietnam Government has done to encourage migration from the rural (originating) areas to other rural resettlement and city (receiving) areas. It then uses data collected as part of recent study into the impact of government encouragement for internal migration to explore the labour force and human capital impacts in both the originating region and receiving areas. The findings suggest that while there are social and economic advantages there are challenges, including ensuring that job opportunities are available, migrants and appropriate skills, and that labour contracts provide for job security and healthy and safe working result in improved living conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a more integrated approach that acknowledges and addresses associated human capital (skills upgrading) and business development needs and integrates these with environmentally-motivated policies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; government policy; human capital; human resource development; Mekong Delta; migration; Vietnam","climate change; government; holistic approach; human capital; internal migration; policy implementation; resource development; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016197627

Focusing on Kolkata in India, we consider the economic case for low-carbon urban development, and assess whether this pathway could support wider social goals. We find that Kolkata could reduce its energy bill by 8.5 per cent and greenhouse gas emissions by 20.7 per cent in 2025, relative to business-as-usual trends, by exploiting readily available, economically attractive mitigation options. Some of these measures offer significant social benefits, particularly in terms of public health; others jeopardize low-income urban residents’ livelihoods, housing and access to affordable services.

Estimated subsidies are $4.9 trillion worldwide in 2013 and $5.3 trillion in 2015 (6.5% of global GDP in both years). Undercharging for global warming accounts for 22% of the subsidy in 2013, air pollution 46%, broader vehicle externalities 13%, supply costs 11%, and general consumer taxes 8%. China was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 ($1.8 trillion), followed by the United States ($0.6 trillion), and Russia, the European Union, and India (each with about $0.3 trillion). Eliminating subsidies would have reduced global carbon emissions in 2013 by 21% and fossil fuel air pollution deaths 55%, while raising revenue of 4%, and social welfare by 2.2%, of global GDP. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","air pollution; deadweight loss; efficient taxation; energy subsidies; global warming; revenue","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; European Union; fossil fuel; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; subsidy system; tax system; China; Europe; India; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006306473

It is therefore necessary to understand the mechanics behind injection strategies which are capable of reducing these emissions while also maintaining the performance and efficiency of the engine. Splitting the fuel delivery into two or more injections is a proven way of working towards this goal, however, many different injection permutations are possible and as such there is no clear consensus on what constitutes an ideal strategy for any given objective. In this study, the effect of the timing of the first and second injections for an evenly split dual injection strategy are investigated in an optical SIDI engine running at 1200 RPM with an unthrottled intake. Performance parameters derived from in-cylinder pressure data are analysed alongside high-speed natural flame luminescence images in order to obtain relationships between engine output and the physical properties associated with flame propagation. It was found that the best performing injection strategy consisted of one injection relatively early in the intake stroke and one injection towards the middle of the compression stroke, likely due to the combination of both ample mixture formation time and a high level of spray induced turbulence. Interestingly the trends found in the results are significantly non-monotonic, as there are a series of peaks and troughs in indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and combustion phasing (CA50) as the injection timings are varied. The relationships between these indicated performance parameters and flame propagation were also analysed, where it was discovered that flame speed is very closely correlated with CA50, regardless of the value of IMEP. Additionally, an elliptical approximation was calculated for each flame in an attempt to establish a link between injection timing and flame shape. It was found that retarded second injections lead to a less circular flame, potentially as a result of decreased charge homogeneity causing local regions of varied laminar flame speed throughout the combustion chamber. Furthermore, analysis of eccentricity and CA50 graphs suggest that there is a link between retarded combustion phasing and non-circular flame fronts.

The increasing block pricing model is based on the main consideration of the per capita disposable income of urban residents, household consumption expenditure, production rate of waste disposal industry, and inflation rate. The empirical analysis is based on survey data of 5000 households in Beijing, China. The results indicate that the current uniform price of waste disposal is set too high for low-income people, and waste fees to the household disposable income or total household spending ratio are too low for the medium- and high-income families. An increasing block pricing model can prevent this kind of situation, and not only solve the problem of lack of funds, but also enhance the residents' awareness of environmental protection. A comparative study based on the grey system model is made by having a preliminary forecast for the waste emissions reduction effect of the pay-as-you-throw programme in the next 5 years of Beijing, China. The results show that the effect of the pay-as-you-throw programme is not only to promote the energy conservation and emissions reduction, but also giving a further improvement of the environmental quality. © The Author(s) 2017.","block pricing; equity; fee; Municipal household solid waste; validity","Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Emission control; Environmental protection; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; Block pricing; Comparative studies; Environmental quality; equity; Household Consumption; Municipal household solid wastes; validity; Waste disposal industry; Municipal solid waste; domestic waste; economic analysis; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental protection; equity; household expenditure; low income population; model test; municipal solid waste; price dynamics; urban population; waste disposal; Article; awareness; block pricing; China; comparative study; economic aspect; elasticity; empirical research; energy conservation; environmental protection; fee; grey system model; highest income group; household; human; income; inflation rate; lowest income group; mathematical model; middle income group; municipal solid waste; prediction; priority journal; solid waste management; sustainable development; urban population; waste fee; cost; economics; family size; socioeconomics; solid waste; theoretical model; waste disposal; waste management; Beijing [China]; China; solid waste; Beijing; Costs and Cost Analysis; Family Characteristics; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Socioeconomic Factors; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014457860

Methods: This study used a convenience sample and subjects were collected from a community in Wuchang District and Children’s Hospital of Wuhan, respectively. A designed questionnaire was used for this study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to analyze the relationship between parents’ individual and familial characteristics and related behavioral intensions to air quality improvement. Statistical analysis was done with SAS 9.1. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 865 subjects (response rate = 86.5%). The number of people with migrant intent was 150(36.4%) from hospital group, and 139(30.7%) from community group. In the hospital group, subjects with higher knowledge of air quality (OR = 6.268, p < 0.05) and higher average annual household income (AAHI), which was equal or more than 50,000 Yuan (OR = 2.045, p < 0.01), were found to be more intent to migrate. AAHI (OR = 1.939, p < 0.05) was also the affecting factor in the community group correspondingly. Those willing to pay for air quality improvement included 297 people (72.1%) from the hospital group and 333 people (73.5%) from the community group, and affecting factors was the public responsibility for air quality improvement (hospital group: OR = 3.380, p < 0.01; community group: OR = 4.436, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study indicated high tendency of propensity to migrate for avoiding poor air condition and willingness to pay to improve air quality in Wuhan.

In developing countries, the problem has become crucial as they do not have sufficient infrastructure for transportation. This paper presents the design and implementation of a ride sharing network designed to connect students in same institution who commute on the same route. Security of the students is considered to be the first priority in the design that is why the service will be provided within students of same institutes only. Someone can offer a ride to/from their institutes if they have seats available in their transport, or students can travel together on a public transport and split the fare. This way they can help reduce the number of transport traveling to/from each institute every day. In a survey among the students of an institution it is found that almost two third of the seats/space of the transports those people use are not used or empty. This ride sharing platform is a way to better utilize the empty seats in most passenger cars, thus lowering fuel usage and transport costs. It can serve areas not covered by public transport systems. Not only does it reduce our carbon footprint and reduce traffic on our roads, but it is an easy and effective way of reducing your travel costs and saving money. Ride sharing is a necessary mean that should have been introduced in our modern society for the betterment of our citizens and mainly students on their daily transport system in urban areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Environment; Road traffic; Security; Social computing and social network; Transportation","Big data; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Computer privacy; Developing countries; Distributed computer systems; Education; Network security; Roads and streets; Social sciences computing; Students; Transportation; Academic institutions; Design and implementations; Environment; Environment friendly; Public transport systems; Road traffic; Security; Social computing; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017369863

Maxima in the sulfate reduction rate (12.6 nmol cm−3 d−1), CO concentration (83 μM), and gene abundances of dsrA (9.1 × 106 copies cm−3) and mcrA (11.6 × 106 copies cm−3) occurred in the SMTZ. The peaks of CO consistently found in the SMTZ suggested that CO is an intermediate metabolic product related to methane oxidation. Candidate division JS1, the predominant bacterial group that comprised 59.0–63.7% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, was recognized as an important organic carbon oxidizer. Both Marine Benthic Group D (MBGD) and Marine Benthic Group B (MBGB), which constituted 40.8–52.9 and 10.3–43.9% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, respectively, were the dominant archaeal groups. Analysis of functional gene diversity revealed that anaerobic methanotroph-1-related phylotypes appeared to be the major CH4 oxidizer, whereas Firmicutes-like group was a predominant sulfate reducer in the 0.8 mbsf in SMTZ with low SO4 2− concentration.

The PM emission could be reduced significantly along with thermal efficiency improvement using hydrogen in the engines under dual fuel mode (diesel-hydrogen). In hydrogen dual fuel engines, other emissions including hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke decrease to near zero level whereas greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) from CI engines decrease substantially. However, the literature review indicates the maximum hydrogen energy share in the dual fuel engines at rated load is limited from 6% to 25%. This is mainly due to higher in-cylinder peak pressure and rate of pressure rise, knocking and autoignition of hydrogen-air charge.

Recent advances in peatland restoration in NA have expanded the original concepts and methodology. Restoration efforts in NA now include restoring peatlands from many diverse types of disturbances (e.g. roads, agriculture, grazing, erosion, forestry, and petrol industry infrastructure impacts) and occur in a greater array of peatland types (e.g. fens and swamps). Because fens are groundwater and surface flow driven, techniques to restore the hydrology of fens are generally more complicated than bogs. Restoring a greater variety of peatland types on a large-scale basis (>10 ha) commands new techniques for reestablishing a broader array of plants other than Sphagnum spp., including non-Sphagnum mosses, sedges, nonericaceous shrubs, and trees. The rationale for restoring peatlands has expanded to include legal requirements, wetland mitigation and banking, climate mitigation, water quality, and as part of responsible ecosystem management for industry or society. In the past 25 years, peatland restoration in NA has evolved from (1) trial and error to a more empirically based scientific approach, (2) small site-specific experiments to landscape-scale restoration (e.g. hydrological connectivity, ecological fragmentation), and (3) individual stakeholder (academic) to multiple stakeholders across jurisdictional boundaries (private, local, and regional governmental agencies, NGOs, and so on). However, many research gaps still exist that must be addressed to enhance our ability to restore peatlands successfully. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration","ditches; grazing; gullies; rehabilitation; revegetation; rewetting","biodiversity; ecosystem management; environmental disturbance; grazing; gully; peatland; restoration ecology; revegetation; rewetting; stakeholder; North America; Bryophyta; Carex; Sphagnum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988892031

The cold phase of this cycle is heavily weighted and mitigation of emissions during this phase is crucial to meet the low tail pipe emission targets [3, 4]. In this work, a novel aftertreatment architecture and controls to improve Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Hydrocarbon (HC) or Non Methane Organic gases (NMOG) conversion efficiencies at low temperatures is proposed. This includes a passive NOx &amp; HC adsorber, termed the diesel Cold Start Concept (dCSC™) catalyst, followed by a Selective Catalytic Reduction catalyst on Filter (SCRF®) and an under-floor Selective Catalytic Reduction catalyst (SCR). The system utilizes a gaseous ammonia delivery system capable of dosing at two locations to maximize NOx conversion and minimize parasitic ammonia oxidation and ammonia slip. This aftertreatment system was evaluated on the chassis dynamometer and demonstrated the potential to achieve Tier 3 Bin 30 (T3B30) or SULEV30 emissions on the FTP-75 (Federal Test Procedure) cycle and HWFET (highway fuel economy) test cycles. A similar aftertreatment architecture, consisting of a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) instead of a diesel cold start concept catalyst, was also evaluated. This system demonstrated the potential to achieve Tier 3 Bin 125 or ULEV125 emissions on the FTP-75 cycle. The aftertreatment architecture with the diesel cold start concept catalyst in place of the DOC was a key enabler to improve the low temperature NOx and HC conversions to demonstrate the potential to meet Tier 3 Bin 30 or SULEV30 regulations. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Ammonia; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Dynamometers; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel economy; Internet protocols; Light electric vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Temperature; Testing; Aftertreatment systems; Ammonia oxidation; Chassis dynamometers; Control methodology; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Federal test procedures; Light duty vehicles; Selective catalytic reduction catalysts; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018361510

A change in the mixed methanotrophic community structure in response has implications for landfill CH4 bio-filter remediation and possible bio-product outcomes (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content and profiles and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) contents). Therefore the study aimed to evaluate the effect of variable CH4 to oxygen ratios (10–50% CH4 in air) on mixed methanotrophic community structures enriched from landfill top cover (LB) and compost soils (CB) and to quantify flow on impacts on MOC, total FAME contents and profiles, and PHB accumulation.

This chapter studies the multi-tiered nature of environmental pollution in China through case studies in air pollution and industrial pollution. Then, it studies some recent work by environmental NGOs to try to achieve a breakthrough to cope with the politically and economically multi-tiered nature of environmental pollution. Work by environmental NGOs will have a positive effect on alleviating public discontent concerning environmental pollution. They will also help the government work as an intermediary between the public and polluting companies.

The paper uses statistical data from 30 Chinese provinces from 1997 to 2014 and empirically tests the effects of different types of environmental policies and regulations on emissions reduction and technical progress by using dynamic spatial panel models. The results of spatial autocorrelation tests show that there are both significant positive global autocorrelation and local spatial agglomeration effects relating to pollutant emissions and technical progress. Dynamic spatial panel models indicate that command and control regulations (CCR) are conducive to emissions reduction, but their effects on technical progress are not significant. Market based regulations (MBR) are conducive to technical progress, but their effects on the reduction of emissions are relatively weak. There is a significant inverted-U relationship between economic development level and carbon emissions, validating the EKC hypothesis in China, but the effects of foreign direct investment on carbon reduction and technical progress are not significant.

Here we show that atmospheric deposition is the most likely origin of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the diets of captive and wild Qinling pandas. Average atmospheric deposition was 199, 115, and 49 g·m-2·yr-1 in the center of Xi'an City, at China's Shaanxi Wild Animal Research Center (SWARC), and at Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR), respectively.

Soil concentrations of the aforementioned heavy metals other than As and Zn also were significantly higher at SWARC than at FNNR.

Efforts have been made to substitute low-grade thermal energy for fossil fuel to achieve thermal comfort in buildings in order to save energy and reduce air pollution. Generally, these efforts are either an incentive policy from the government or the specific technology on how to use one certain low-grade energy. However, the energy planning for a regional architectural complex or how to evaluate the applications of different forms of energy in advance is less published. For this reason, a comprehensive energy planning method for regional architecture complex using low-grade energy, named surface-line-point, is proposed in this article. The important indexes of the energy level gap and exergy price are adopted for surface planning. Exergy analysis can be used to realize the line planning. Hourly load simulation can be used to optimize the operation performance of machine and complete the point planning. The correctness and feasibility of this method is validated through a case study of eco-agricultural park in Tianjin. The surface-line-point planning can be further applied to other building groups to help the engineer select the most appropriate ways of energy supply.

The basic hypothesis of process-based phenology models is that spring tree phenology is regulated by temperature and triggered by chilling temperatures during the dormancy period, followed by forcing temperatures during the growth period. That is, trees require cool temperatures during a chilling period to break endodormancy, and then enter the phase of ecodormancy during which the rate of ontogenetic development increases with increasing air temperature. Therefore, insufficient chilling requirements may slow bud growth and consequently delay budburst. Many studies have shown that chilling requirement is at present sufficient to release bud dormancy fully in temperate regions, and thus forcing temperatures play a dominant role in triggering spring tree phenology. To identify differences in mechanisms of spring tree phenology responses to air temperature between the subtropics/tropics and the temperate zone, and their possible effects on future phenological trends under global warming, we used leaf unfolding and flowering data from a tree species of tropical origin, Melia azedarach, and output daily mean air temperature data from a regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) for the period 1981–2005 at 42 stations in southeastern China to fit unified forcing and chilling phenology models. Then, we selected optimum models for each phenophase at each station. Moreover, we predicted leafing and flowering dates across the research region over 2021–2100 under global climate warming scenarios. The results show a previously unreported phenological phenomenon: chilling will often be insufficient to break bud dormancy in the northern tropical zone and may become a crucial factor limiting leafing and flowering responses to spring warming. However, chilling will still be sufficient to break bud dormancy in the warm temperate zone, and thus may not limit leafing and flowering responses to spring warming there. Consequently, predicted leafing and flowering dates both will be delayed in the northern tropical zone but will advance in the warm temperate zone from 2021 to 2100. In the subtropical zone, the effect of chilling temperature on spring phenology will be reduced gradually from earlier to later phenophases. Thus, predicted leafing and flowering dates show decreased delaying trends and increased advancing trends from earlier to later phenophases in the subtropical zone. Our findings suggest that insufficient chilling temperature accumulation during the dormancy period may counteract the forcing temperature accumulation during the growth period in the northern tropical zone and parts of the subtropical zone, resulting in delayed leafing and flowering dates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chilling and forcing requirement; Global warming; Leafing and flowering; Process-based phenology model; Spatiotemporal prediction","behavioral response; carbon balance; climate change; dormancy; ecological modeling; flowering; global warming; growth; phenology; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; temperature effect; tropical environment; vegetation dynamics; China; Melia azedarach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009063877

Methods Colitis was induced by the administration of 3% DSS to wild-type C57BL/6J mice for 7 days. 6-formylindolo(3, 2-b)carbazole (FICZ), an endogenous agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), was given intraperitoneally on a daily basis beginning 2 days after the start of DSS administration. The mice were weighed and assessed, and colon tissues were measured. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were isolated from the colon and examined by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. Results FICZ ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, resulting in a reduced disease activity index and improvement in the histology and length of the colon. Colitis reduced the percentage and number of CD8αα+TCRαβ+ IELs. FICZ prevented the reduction in the numbers of CD8αα+TCRαβ+ IELs by upregulating the expression of the IL-15 receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and attenuating the apoptotic rate of CD8αα+TCRαβ+ IELs. Finally, IL-10 was increased and IFN-γ was decreased in CD8αα+TCRαβ+ IELs by FICZ administration in DSS-induced colitis. Conclusions The results suggest that AhR activation ameliorated DSS-induced acute colitis, in a manner that is associated with the local expansion and functions of CD8αα+TCRαβ+ IELs in acute colitis. The findings indicate that AhR-related ligands might be targeted as novel drug targets for IBD. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; CD8αα+TCRαβ+; Cytokine; Intraepithelial; Lymphocytes; Receptor","6 formylindolo (3,2 b)carbazole; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; beta actin; carbazole derivative; CD8 antigen; CD8alpha alpha antigen; cytochrome P450 1A1; dextran sulfate; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 15 receptor; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; T lymphocyte receptor; T lymphocyte receptor alpha beta; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; CD8 antigen; CD8 antigen, alpha chain; lymphocyte antigen receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cell isolation; cell survival; colitis; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease activity; disease severity; flow cytometry; histopathology; lymphocyte; mouse; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; weight reduction; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; colitis; male; metabolism; pathology; physiology; randomization; Animals; Antigens, CD8; Cells, Cultured; Colitis; Lymphocytes; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Random Allocation; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007426118

This constraint is implemented using prior CO2 fluxes estimated with a terrestrial ecosystem model and an ocean model. These models simulate 13CO2 discrimination rates of terrestrial photosynthesis and ocean-atmosphere diffusion processes. In both models, the 13CO2 disequilibrium between fluxes to and from the atmosphere is considered due to the historical change in atmospheric 13CO2 concentration. This joint inversion system using both13CO2 and CO2 observations is effectively a double deconvolution system with consideration of the spatial variations of isotopic discrimination and disequilibrium. Compared to the CO2-only inversion, this 13CO2 constraint on the inversion considerably reduces the total land carbon sink from 3.40 ± 0.84 to 2.53 ± 0.93 Pg C year-1 but increases the total oceanic carbon sink from 1.48 ± 0.40 to 2.36 ± 0.49 Pg C year-1. This constraint also changes the spatial distribution of the carbon sink. The largest sink increase occurs in the Amazon, while the largest source increases are in southern Africa, and Asia, where CO2 data are sparse. Through a case study, in which the spatial distribution of the annual 13CO2 discrimination rate over land is ignored by treating it as a constant at the global average of -14. 1 ‰, the spatial distribution of the inverted CO2 flux over land was found to be significantly modified (up to 15 % for some regions). The uncertainties in our disequilibrium flux estimation are 8.0 and 12.7 Pg C year-1 ‰ for land and ocean, respectively. These uncertainties induced the unpredictability of 0.47 and 0.54 Pg C year-1 in the inverted CO2 fluxes for land and ocean, respectively. Our joint inversion system is therefore useful for improving the partitioning between ocean and land sinks and the spatial distribution of the inverted carbon flux. © Author(s) 2017.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; concentration (composition); database; deconvolution; disequilibrium; global change; photosynthesis; spatial distribution; terrestrial ecosystem; Amazonia; Asia; Southern Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015636339

Chronic warming will likely impact both ecosystem C fluxes and the abundance and distribution of plant functional types (PFTs) within systems, potentially interacting to create novel patterns of C exchange. Here, we report results from a 3-year warming experiment using open top chambers (OTC) on the Tibetan Plateau meadow grassland. Warming significantly increased C uptake through gross primary productivity (GPP) but not ecosystem respiration (ER), resulting in a 31.0% reduction in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in warmed plots. The OTC-induced changes in ecosystem C fluxes were not fully explained by the corresponding changes in soil temperature and moisture. Warming treatments significantly increased the biomass of graminoids and legumes by 12.9 and 27.6%. These functional shifts were correlated with enhanced local GPP, but not ER, resulting in more negative NEE in plots with larger increases in graminoid and legume biomass. This may be due to a link between greater legume abundance and higher levels of total inorganic nitrogen, which can potentially drive higher GPP, but not higher ER. Overall, our results indicate that C-climate feedbacks might be closely mediated by climate-induced changes in PFTs. This highlights the need to consider the impacts of changes in PFTs when predicting future responses of C pools under altered climate scenarios. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","aboveground biomass; climate change; ecosystem carbon fluxes; experimental warming; net ecosystem exchange; plant functional types; soil inorganic nitrogen; Tibetan plateau","aboveground biomass; abundance; carbon flux; climate change; inorganic nitrogen; legume; meadow; net ecosystem exchange; open-top chamber; soil temperature; warming; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988681779

This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of maternal exposure to ambient levels of PM2.5 on filial cardiovascular maldevelopment induced by homocysteine. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, rats were randomized into four groups and were exposed to ambient PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) throughout the pregnancy and lactation periods coupled with the administration of either homocysteine (HCY) or normal saline (NS) daily from gestation days 8–10. Morphological changes in the heart, myocardial apoptosis, expressions of cardiac progenitor transcriptional factors, and levels of cytokines were investigated in the offspring. The apoptosis-like changes in the myocardium were seen in the FA plus HCY-treated group and more obviously in the PM2.5 plus HCY-treated group, which was in accordance with an increased myocardial apoptosis rate in the two groups. PM2.5 exposure resulted in significantly decreased Nkx2-5 protein level and GATA4 and Nkx2-5 mRNA expressions, and significantly increased TNF-α and IL-1β levels. There were significant interactions between PM2.5 exposure and HCY-treatment that PM2.5 exposure reduced Nkx2-5 protein levels and GATA4 and Nkx2-5 mRNA expressions in the HCY-treated groups. These results suggest that maternal exposure to PM2.5, even at the ambient levels in urban regions in China, exaggerates filial cardiovascular maldevelopment induced by HCY in a murine model, exacerbating structural abnormalities in the filial cardiac tissue, which is possibly associated with oxidative stress and reduced GATA4 and Nkx2-5 transcription factor expressions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Guangdong Province faces major challenges to address the regional air pollution problem due to the lack of an emissions inventory. To fill this gap, an emissions inventory of primary fine particles (PM2.5) is compiled for the year 2012, and the key precursors (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides) are identified. Furthermore, policy packages are simulated during the period of 2012‒2030 to investigate the potential mitigation effect. The results show that in 2012, SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions in Guangdong Province were as high as (951.7, 1363.6, and 294.9) kt, respectively. Industrial production processes are the largest source of SO2 and PM2.5 emissions, and transport is the top contributor of NOx emissions. Both the baseline scenario and policy scenario are constructed based on projected energy growth and policy designs. Under the baseline scenario, SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions will almost double in 2030 without proper emissions control policies. The suggested policies are categorized into end-of- pipe control in power plants (ECP), end-of-pipe control in industrial processes (ECI), fuel improvement (FI), energy efficiency improvement (EEI), substitution-pattern development (SPD), and energy saving options (ESO). With the implementation of all these policies, SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions are projected to drop to (303.1, 585.4, and 102.4) kt, respectively, in 2030. This inventory and simulated results will provide deeper insights for policy makers to understand the present situation and the evolution of key emissions in Guangdong Province. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","emissions inventory; Guangdong Province; NOx; PM2.5; scenario analyses; SO2","atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; policy implementation; scenario analysis; sulfur dioxide; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961572824

The CCSI Toolset provides state-of-the-art computational modeling and simulation tools to accelerate the commercialization of carbon capture technologies from discovery to development, demonstration, and ultimately the widespread deployment to hundreds of power plants. Carbon capture technologies have the potential to dramatically reduce the carbon emissions from power plants. The CCSI Toolset provides end users in industry with a comprehensive, integrated suite of leading-edge, scientifically validated models with simulation, uncertainty quantification, optimization, risk analysis and decision making support. The CCSI Toolset has at its core an integrated framework that enables execution of simulations and workflows including optimization and uncertainty parameter sweeps using a wide variety of computing platforms including desktops, clusters, Clouds, and HPC systems. The integration framework enables the running of a variety of commercial process simulation packages as well as custom simulators. Moreover, the framework enables scientists to run and manage thousands of concurrent simulations to perform optimizations and uncertainty quantification. Components of the CCSI Toolset are connected through the use of a data management system that stores data to a repository and enables the tracking of provenance for each simulation as well as its associated components. The data management system tracks all the configurations, models, simulations, and results created during the design of a carbon capture system and supports the design life-cycle as well as decision making. The primary contribution of this paper is thus the design and implementation of the integration framework within the CCSI Toolset, which provides both data management and simulation support for CCSI.

This unique plane heterostructural carbon ring (Cring)-C3N4 nanosheet can synchronously expedite electron-hole pair separation and promote photoelectron transport through the local in-plane π-conjugated electric field, synergistically elongating the photocarrier diffusion length and lifetime by 10 times relative to those achieved with pristine g-C3N4.

This article investigates mitigation policies for transportation emissions in the two most prosperous cities, Wellington and Auckland. Analysing local government policy documents, we dissect commitments and examine the gap between aspirations and outcomes. Neither city’s emissions are falling significantly despite trends towards housing intensification, which can cut emissions via shorter journeys. The mode share of motor vehicles in total commuting trips is only gradually diminishing, while the share of walking and cycling is only marginally increasing. We explore possible explanations for the slow progress in achieving aspirations. Our main findings are: first, there is a significant ambition gap between councils’ stated goals, on the one hand, and measures adopted by councils, on the other; and second, ‘business as usual’ policies of central government are dampening these cities’ will and ability to adopt more sustainable policies. We conclude that city mitigation performance will likely be modest until the central government’s stance changes, but there is nevertheless a strong case, and clear opportunities, for Auckland and Wellington to strengthen their emission reductions. © 2017 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.","Climate policy; emissions; land use; mitigation; multi-level governance; transport","carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; land use; traffic emission; urban policy; urban transport; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island; Wellington [North Island]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019019375

However, afforestation in grassland soils may have the opposite effect by promoting the loss of native carbon. Potential effects of this land use change on the flow of organic carbon to and from the soil can be described through bulk density (Db). Nowadays the suitability of Db for this purpose is being questioned. In order to bring new elements to the discussion, we carried out a comparative study of soil in the western region of Uruguay. Based on the background information and our own data, collected for over a decade, we evaluated the fitness of Db as proxy soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in grassland converted to tree afforestation. These data were also related to soil pH values. The sampling consisted of five plots afforested with Eucalyptus grandis paired with control plots under grassland. All samples were taken at depth (0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) except for Db samples (0–10 cm). In afforested sites, Db increased (1.62 vs 1.53 g/cm3; p ≤ 0.01) and SOC decreased (0–10 cm: 0.90 vs. 1.22%; p ≤ 0.08). Db values were not significantly correlated with SOC content. As with SOC, pH values decreased after afforestation at both depths (0–10 cm: 4.92 vs. 5.62; p ≤ 0.01; 10–20 cm: 4.76 vs. 5.54; p ≤ 0.01). The high acidity generated in soils following afforestation, is enough to affect the interaction between mineral and organic fractions and, with them, the original Db values. According to a previous study in the same location, there is a change in the predominance of different clay minerals in the topsoil (0–20 cm). This qualitative change in the mineral fraction can affect the ability of the soil to retain organic carbon, and not be reflected in the recorded Db values. The non-reciprocity recorded between Db and SOC values warns about the need for restriction of the generic use of Db in calculation of SOC stocks estimation. In view of these results, we present a discussion of possible causes that explain the disparity between Db values and SOC measurements.

While the existence of a FMP is often used as evidence of sustainable forest management (SFM), State officials mandated to monitor and verify FMPs’ implementation often lack the technical knowledge and political incentives to assess the changes that have been introduced, notably in terms of harvested volumes and species. Among tropical timber producers, Cameroon is considered to be exemplary for its progressive forest regulatory framework. Here we aim to estimate for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa the causal impact of the implementation of FMPs on harvested volumes, species and carbon stocks. We do so by using a 12-year (1998–2009) unbalanced longitudinal data set of a detailed, official harvesting inventory of 81 concessions in Cameroon. Results provide evidence to the theoretical expectations that for many years many practitioners have had on the implementation of SFM, i.e. that FMPs show a substantial opportunity to reduce carbon emissions from forest while presenting logging companies with acceptable financial trade-offs. We explore the technical and political reasons for our findings and conclude that these analyses are important for countries that are underwriting carbon-related schemes in which they propose to reduce their emissions through the effective implementation of SFM. We also demonstrate that producer countries do record useful information that, when effectively used, can help them to inform their policies and improve their sustainable development strategies. © 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå","Cameroon; Carbon stocks; Forest inventory; Forest management plans; Forest policy; Sustainable forest management","Economic and social effects; Harvesting; Planning; Timber; Cameroon; Carbon stocks; Forest inventory; Forest management plans; Forest policy; Sustainable forest management; Forestry; carbon sequestration; emission control; forest inventory; forest management; policy approach; policy implementation; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; Emission; Forest Management; Planning; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014494219

Due to the large volume, the global deep Ocean plays a central role in the regulation of climate, possibly buffering the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide if processes of CO2 fixation compensate for respiration. We investigated the rates of several prokaryotic activities (dissolved and particulate primary production, heterotrophic carbon production and respiration) in meso- and bathypelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea, covering all sub-basins. Chemosynthesis was the main process for C uptake. The rates of organic C (OC) excretion (or viral-induced cell lysis) inferred from the dissolved primary production measurements were noteworthy, being comparable to particulate primary production, and possibly contributing to the formation of non-sinking particulate organic matter. Inorganic C fixation rates were significantly higher than those reported for other deep-sea systems, probably as a consequence of the persistently higher temperature of dark Mediterranean waters or to phylogenetically diverse communities involved in the process. Primary production was negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration and showed an inverse pattern to heterotrophic carbon production, indicating a niche partitioning between heterotrophs and autotrophs. In sum, the deep Mediterranean Sea harbors active autotrophic communities able to fix inorganic carbon faster than the heterotrophic carbon production rates. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; sea water; autotrophy; classification; climate; ecosystem; genetics; heterotrophy; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; phylogeny; plankton; prokaryotic cell; Autotrophic Processes; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Heterotrophic Processes; Mediterranean Sea; Phylogeny; Plankton; Prokaryotic Cells; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012912083

The number of structures lost per year has increased significantly, due in part to increased development in rural areas, fuel management policies, and climate change, all of which are projected to increase in the future. This two-part review presents an overview of research on the pathways for fire spread in the WUI. Recent involvement of the fire science community in WUI fire research has led to some great advances in knowledge; however, much work is left to be done. While the general pathways for fire spread in the WUI (radiative, flame, and ember exposure) are known, the exposure conditions generated by surrounding wildland fuels, nearby structures or other system-wide factors, and the subsequent response of WUI structures and communities are not well known or well understood. This first part of the review covers the current state of the WUI and existing knowledge on exposure conditions.

This article uses the Nitrogen Footprint Tool (NFT) to determine the amount of nitrogen (N) released as a result of institutional consumption. The sectors accounted for include food (consumption and upstream production), energy, transportation, fertilizer, research animals, and agricultural research. The NFT is then used for scenario analysis to manage and track reductions, which are driven by the consumption behaviors of both the institution itself and its constituent individuals. In this article, the first seven completed institution nitrogen footprint results are presented. The Nitrogen Footprint Tool Network aims to develop footprints for many institutions to encourage widespread upper-level management strategies that will create significant reductions in reactive nitrogen released to the environment. Energy use and food purchases are the two largest sectors contributing to institution nitrogen footprints. Ongoing efforts by institutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also help to reduce the nitrogen footprint, but the impact of food production on nitrogen pollution has not been directly addressed by the higher education sustainability community. The Nitrogen Footprint Tool Network found that institutions could reduce their nitrogen footprints by optimizing food purchasing to reduce consumption of animal products and minimize food waste, as well as by reducing dependence on fossil fuels for energy. © 2017; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","energy; environmental impact; food; nitrogen footprint; sustainability","agricultural reform; air quality; anthropogenic source; ecosystem health; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; food production; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; higher education; management practice; public health; scenario analysis; sustainability; water quality; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018608547

The purpose of this article is to present an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of biodiesel produced in Portugal from palm oil (PO) imported from Colombia, addressing the direct effects of land-use change (LUC), different fertilization schemes, and biogas management options at the extraction mill. Methods: An LC inventory and model of PO biodiesel was implemented based on data collected in five Portuguese biodiesel plants and in a palm plantation and extraction mill in the Orinoquía Region of Colombia. The emissions due to carbon stock changes associated with LUC were calculated based on the Colombian oil palm area expansion from 1990 to 2010 and on historical data of vegetation cleared for planting new palm trees. Five impact categories were assessed based on ReCiPe and CML-IA methods: GHG intensity, freshwater and marine eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial acidification. A sensitivity analysis of alternative allocation approaches was performed. Results and discussion: Palm plantation was the LC phase which contributed the most to eutrophication and acidification impacts, whereas transportation and oil extraction contributed the most to photochemical oxidation. An increase in carbon stock due to LUC associated with the expansion of Colombian oil palm was calculated (palm is a perennial crop with higher carbon stock than most previous land-uses). The choice of the fertilization scheme that leads to the lowest environmental impacts is contradictory among various categories. The use of calcium ammonium nitrate (followed by ammonium sulfate) leads to the lowest acidification and eutrophication impacts. The highest GHG intensity was calculated for calcium ammonium nitrate, while the lowest was for ammonium sulfate and poultry manure. Biogas captured and flared at the oil extraction mill instead of being released into the atmosphere had the lowest impacts in all categories (GHG intensity reduced by more than 60 % when biogas is flared instead of released). Conclusions: Recommendation on the selection of the fertilization scheme depends on the environmental priority. ReCiPe and CML showed contradictory results for eutrophication and photochemical oxidation; however, uncertainty may impair strong recommendations. GHG intensity and photochemical oxidation impacts can be significantly reduced if biogas is flared instead of being released. However, more efficient biogas management should be implemented in order to reduce the impacts further. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Allocation; Biogas; CML; Fertilization; Land-use change (LUC); Palm oil biodiesel; ReCiPe","ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; biodiesel; biogas; fresh water; palm oil; Arecaceae; Article; Colombia; environmental exposure; environmental impact; eutrophication; fertilization; historical research; land biome; land use; life cycle assessment; manure; marine environment; nonhuman; photochemical smog; Portugal; poultry farming; sensitivity analysis; vegetation history",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961858347

The economic and technical suitability of this technology strongly depends on the thermal and hydrogeological properties of the ground at the installation site, which need to be assessed in detail. A common indicator adopted to define such suitability is the geothermal potential, i.e. the thermal power that can be exchanged with the ground through a GSHP with a certain setup. In this paper, we present the assessment and mapping of the shallow geothermal potential in the province of Cuneo, a 6900 km2 wide county in NW Italy. Geological, hydrogeological and climatic information are collected and processed to estimate the relevant ground properties.

These locomotives emit several pollutants into the atmosphere and because of that, the railroads seek to reduce emissions and achieve global emission standards. Thus, it is important to analyze the environmental impact of the use of diesel and alternative fuels to reach environmental standards. This paper makes use of a method based upon the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) metrics to evaluate the locomotives’ eco-efficiency. The method was applied to Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM). Different scenarios representing the exchange of fuel sources and technologies were developed, tested and analyzed. The impacts were evaluated by seven eco-efficiency performance indicators and compared with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The results offered cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Greenhouse gas emissions; LNG; Locomotive; Railroad's eco-efficiency","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Diesel locomotives; Efficiency; Electric railroads; Emission control; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied natural gas; Locomotives; Machinery; Railroads; Standards; Sustainable development; Cost saving; Eco-efficiency; Emissions reduction; Environmental standards; Global emissions; Performance indicators; United states environmental protection agencies; World business council for sustainable development; Environmental Protection Agency; biofuel; diesel engine; emission; greenhouse gas; liquefied natural gas; measurement method; railway transport; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008397783

Species colonising these locations tend to be a non-random subset from source communities, which is thought to reflect dispersal limitation. However, non-random colonisation could also result from habitat filtering, whereby only a few continental species can become established. We evaluate the imprints of these processes on the Galápagos flora by analysing a comprehensive regional phylogeny for ~ 39 000 species alongside information on dispersal strategies and climatic suitability. We found that habitat filtering was more important than dispersal limitation in determining species composition. This finding may help explain why adaptive radiation is common on oceanic archipelagoes – because colonising species can be relatively poor dispersers with specific niche requirements. We suggest that the standard assumption that plant communities in remote locations are primarily shaped by dispersal limitation deserves reconsideration. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Dispersal; flora; Galápagos; habitat filtering; oceanic islands; phylogenetic structure; species assembly","biota; ecosystem; Ecuador; island (geological); phylogeny; plant; plant dispersal; Biota; Ecosystem; Ecuador; Islands; Phylogeny; Plant Dispersal; Plants",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015203032

Shifts in plant phenology in response to extreme years can influence plant survival, productivity, and synchrony with pollinators/herbivores. Despite extensive work on plant phenological responses to climate change, little is known about responses to extreme warm years, particularly at the intraspecific level. Here we investigate 43 populations of white ash trees (Fraxinus americana) from throughout the species range that were all grown in a common garden. We compared the timing of leaf emergence during the warmest year in U.S. history (2012) with relatively non-extreme years. We show that (a) leaf emergence among white ash populations was accelerated by 21 days on average during the extreme warm year of 2012 relative to non-extreme years; (b) rank order for the timing of leaf emergence was maintained among populations across extreme and non-extreme years, with southern populations emerging earlier than northern populations; (c) greater amounts of warming units accumulated prior to leaf emergence during the extreme warm year relative to non-extreme years, and this constrained the potential for even earlier leaf emergence by an average of 9 days among populations; and (d) the extreme warm year reduced the reliability of a relevant phenological model for white ash by producing a consistent bias toward earlier predicted leaf emergence relative to observations. These results demonstrate a critical need to better understand how extreme warm years will impact tree phenology, particularly at the intraspecific level. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bud break; Climate change; Extreme years; Fraxinus; Global change; Leaf emergence; Phenology; Thermal models; White ash","budburst; climate change; deciduous tree; emergence; extreme event; intraspecific variation; leaf; model test; phenology; thermoregulation; warming; United States; Fraxinus; Fraxinus americana; climate change; plant leaf; reproducibility; season; temperature; tree; Climate Change; Plant Leaves; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013399416

In competitive retail and transportation markets, such tax can be expected to lower the demand and thereby reduce CO2 emissions of road transports. However, as we show in this paper, such tax might also slow down the transition towards e-tailing. Considering that previous research indicates that a consumer switching from brick-and-mortar shopping to e-tailing reduces her CO2 emissions substantially, the direction and magnitude of the environmental net effect of the tax is unclear. In this paper, we assess the net effect in a Swedish regional retail market where the tax not yet is in place. We predict the net effect on CO2 emissions to be positive, but off-set by about 50% because of a slower transition to e-tailing. © 2017","Carbon footprint; CO2 emissions measurement; Environmental taxes; Online retailing; Road network; Spatial distribution of e-tailing and consumers","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Commerce; Roads and streets; Sales; Trucks; CO2 emissions; E-tailing; Environmental taxes; Online retailing; Road network; Taxation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electronic commerce; environmental economics; financial system; pollution tax; retailing; spatial distribution; transportation infrastructure; trucking; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010301138

While the emission of isoprenoids has been largely characterized, forests also exchange many oxygenated VOCs (oVOCs), including methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and acetaldehyde, which are less well understood. We monitored total branch-level exchange of VOCs of a strong isoprene emitter (<i>Quercus rubra L.) in a mixed forest in New England, where canopy-level fluxes of VOCs had been previously measured. We report daily exchange of several oVOCs and investigated unknown sources and sinks, finding several novel insights. In particular, we found that emission of MEK is linked to uptake of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), a product of isoprene oxidation. The link was confirmed by corollary experiments proving in vivo detoxification of MVK, which is harmful to plants. Comparison of MEK, MVK, and isoprene fluxes provided an indirect indication of within-plant isoprene oxidation. Furthermore, besides confirming bidirectional exchange of acetaldehyde, we also report for the first time direct evidence of benzaldehyde bidirectional exchange in forest plants. Net emission or deposition of benzaldehyde was found in different periods of measurements, indicating an unknown foliar sink that may influence atmospheric concentrations. Other VOCs, including methanol, acetone, and monoterpenes, showed clear daily emission trends but no deposition. Measured VOC emission and deposition rates were generally consistent with their ecosystem-scale flux measurements at a nearby site. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"atmospheric chemistry; chemical composition; detoxification; isoprene; oxidation; tree; volatile organic compound; New England; United States; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016590678

The objective of this investigation was to figure out the influence of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs) on AM fungal community, the underlying mechanisms, and the possible consequences of AM fungi-plant involved soil ecosystem. Materials and methods: A greenhouse pot experiment was established to investigate the responses of maize (Zea may L.) growth and AM fungal community to differential application levels (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg kg−1) of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs) or microscale magnetic iron oxide (bulk Fe3O4). The AM fungal community composition and diversity were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The plant biomass, phosphorus (P) acquisitions, Fe concentration in plant shoots, catalase (CAT) activity, root mycorrhizal colonization rate, and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) contents were determined. In the meantime, the soil P supply efficiency, soil pH, and dissolved organic carbon contents (DOC) were analyzed as well as soil-soluble Fe content. Results and discussion: Fe3O4NPs at 10.0 mg kg−1 (the high concentration) could be toxic to AM fungi by directly decreasing their diversity significantly (p &lt; 0.05) and shifting their community structure, compared to the control and bulk Fe3O4. The similar toxicity was observed for host plant by the significant increases (p &lt; 0.05) in Fe concentration in plant shoots and CAT activity. Consequently, the biomass of the host plant and the photosynthetic carbon left for AM fungi were obviously decreased (p &lt; 0.05). The direct and indirect influences of Fe3O4NPs at high concentration result in the reduction of AM fungal ecological function, such as the significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) root mycorrhizal colonization, soil GRSP content, and alkaline phosphatase activity. This process, in return, could deteriorate the nutrient provision of AM fungi for plant. As evidence, soil available P content and P nutrition in plants were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The Fe3O4NPs at high concentration would destroy the mutual interaction of AM fungi-plant and negatively influence the soil carbon accumulation and P cycling, both of which go against crop yield and soil fertility. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal community; Dissolved organic carbon; Mycorrhizal colonization; Plant biomass; Soil alkaline phosphatase activity","arbuscular mycorrhiza; community structure; crop yield; dissolved organic carbon; enzyme activity; experimental study; fungus; host plant; iron oxide; magnetic property; maize; microbial community; mutualism; nanoparticle; phytomass; root colonization; soil ecosystem; species diversity; Fungi; Zea; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990944579

In order to increase methane production, this work proposes to separate the soluble substances from OFMSW and analyse methane production from extracts and OFMSW. Using water as solvent, four extraction parameters were proposed: (1) Number of consecutive extractions, (2) Duration of mixing for every consecutive extraction, (3) OFMSW to water mass ratios 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 and, (4) The influence of temperature on the extraction process. Results indicated that is possible to separate 40% of VS from OFMSW with only three consecutive extraction with mixing of 30 min in every extraction using ambient temperature water. For every OFMSW to water combination, the first three consecutive extracts were analysed for biochemical methane potential test during 21 days at 35 °C; OFMSW was also tested as reference. Methane production from all substrates is highest during the first day and then it slowly decreases to increase again during a second stage. This was identified as diauxic behaviour. Specific methane production at day 21 increased with increasing water content of the extracts where OFMSW methane production was the lowest of all with 535 NL/kgVS.

Given the local and context-specific nature of climate impacts, the involvement of municipalities is key for effective mitigation and adaptation solutions. Due to its vulnerability and low level of adaptive capacity, Portugal offers insights into adaptation research and practice in Europe. This article hypothesizes that National and European climate change adaptation strategies are not effectively involving municipalities, and are thus losing out on the opportunity to take stock of local responses for climate change mitigation and adaptation. To address this issue, a survey by questionnaire was done to Portuguese municipalities, and data was collected regarding the following: the importance attributed to climate change; the mitigation and adaptation measures planned and implemented; the main drivers, concerns, and triggers promoting climate policy and actions; and access to information and knowledge. 109 valid responses were collected across the country from a universe of 308 municipalities. Results show climate change in planning agendas is still ‘little’ or ‘not important’. There is also a clear difference in the drivers and concerns motivating climate policy, and action between Littoral and Inland regions. Overall, there is a greater focus on mitigation than adaptation. The discussion highlights the need for capacity building, the issue of equity, the role of European networks, and the relevance of cultural differences between Littoral and Inland regions.

It was found that most of the previous studies conducted on this process assume that the conditions of the facilities are always appropriate. The control of the variables associated with air circulating inside the drying hood is essential to obtain a paper with adequate quality and obtain low ratios of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This article proposes a new indirect method based on the study of the enthalpy of the airflows inside the production hall and thermographic images that helps to analyze the maintenance state of the enclosure hood drying section in a general process, whereby it can also estimate the emissions and energy losses. The combined use of sensors and equipment has helped to identify energy losses and potential savings in CO2 emissions. The developed method is applied to a paper manufacturing plant that has ratios of energy consumption and CO2 emissions very close to the product benchmark set by the European Authorities. The study corroborates that it can be identified as a significant energy loss in paper making drying process. Analyzing facilities that are in apparently good maintenance conditions, leaks are evident. These energy losses are very significant compared with the theoretical energy consumption, and it can affect the paper moisture profile. © 2017 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Indicator; Industrial process; Maintenance; Papermaking; Sensor","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; enthalpy; equipment; manufacturing; sensor; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017402199

Among the available tools for evaluating the aeration efficiency, the off-gas method is one of the most useful. Increasing interest towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biological processes has resulted in researchers using this method to quantify N2O and CO2concentrations in the off-gas. Experimental measurements of direct GHG emissions from aerobic digesters (AeDs) are not available in literature yet. In this study, the floating hood technique was used for the first time to monitor AeDs. The floating hood technique was used to evaluate oxygen transfer rates in an activated sludge (AS) tank of a medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Italy. Very low values of oxygen transfer efficiency were found, confirming that small-to-medium-sized plants are often scarcely monitored and wrongly managed. Average CO2and N2O emissions from the AS tank were 0.14 kgCO2/kgbCODand 0.007 kgCO2,eq/kgbCOD, respectively. For an AeD, 3 × 10−10kgCO2/kgbCODdirect CO2emissions were measured, while CO2,eqemissions from N2O were 4 × 10−9kgCO2,eq/kgbCOD. The results for the AS tank and the AeD were used to estimate the net carbon and energy footprint of the entire plant. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aeration efficiency; aerobic digestion; carbon and energy footprint; greenhouse gases; off-gas method","Activated sludge process; Bioactivity; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Oxygen; Sewage treatment plants; Tanks (containers); Wastewater treatment; Aeration efficiencies; Aerobic digesters; Aerobic digestions; Biological process; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Off-gas method; Oxygen transfer efficiency; Oxygen transfer rate; Carbon footprint; organic carbon; oxygen; air pollutant; ammonium derivative; carbon dioxide; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; nitrous oxide; water pollutant; activated sludge; aeration; anaerobic digestion; biofiltration; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; concentration (composition); experimental study; greenhouse gas; nitric oxide; oxygen; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; aeration; air pollution; anaerobic digestion; Article; atmospheric pressure; carbon footprint; controlled study; dewatering; gas; nutrient; oxidation; oxygen concentration; sedimentation; sludge treatment; surface property; waste water treatment plant; air pollutant; analysis; biochemical oxygen demand; bioreactor; environmental monitoring; Italy; oxidation reduction reaction; procedures; sewage; water pollutant; Italy; Air Pollutants; Ammonium Compounds; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Nitrates; Nitrites; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978039485

Using the city of Leipzig as a case study, we assess the effect of urban gardening type and intensity of management on ecosystem services and biodiversity by comparing allotment and community gardens. Employing a stratified sampling design, we assessed 30 allotment plots of different management intensity, including vacant plots, and six adjacent community gardens along a gradient of urbanity, using in-depth field surveys, remote sensing analyses and interviews. Our results show a bimodal relationship of overall vascular plant species richness with management intensity with highest species richness in medium intensively-managed plots, as they provide space for both cultivated edible and ornamental species as well as native, spontaneous species. In comparison to allotment gardens, community gardens provide a higher ratio of permeable soil surface and a slightly higher microbial soil activity, implying important differences in water regulation and nutrient cycling properties. With regard to climate regulation, old mature trees make a considerable contribution to above ground carbon storage, but are largely restricted to communal areas of the allotment estates due to code regulation. Based on our results, we discuss the impact of allotment gardening association codes and garden type and ways forward for gardeners and urban planners to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Allotment gardens; Biodiversity; Community gardens; Ecosystem services","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; greenspace; nutrient cycling; ornamental species; remote sensing; soil microorganism; soil surface; species richness; water resource; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014500460

Plant communities in the southwestern U.S. may be particularly vulnerable to climate change as the productivity of many plant species is strongly water-limited. This study examines the relationship between climate and vegetation condition using a time-series of Landsat imagery across grassland, shrubland, and woodland communities on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We improve on poorly understood inter-annual climate-vegetation relationships by exploring how the responses of different plant communities depend on climate legacies (>12 months) and lag behind shorter-term (3–12 month) changes in water availability. Our results show a prolonged drying trend on the Colorado Plateau since the early 1990s that was punctuated in several years by intense droughts. In areas that experienced sustained dry conditions or a drying trend, vegetation greenness (a proxy for production) increased linearly when conditions were interrupted by wetting events. In contrast, in areas that experienced sustained wet conditions or a wetting trend, vegetation greenness was weakly or not related to wetting events, indicating that production may saturate if vegetation experiences sufficient water availability. Shrubland and woodland communities had stronger relationships with climate at long lags (6–12 months) and many maintained greenness under sustained water deficit, whereas grassland communities had stronger relationships at short lags (3–6 months) and lost greenness even in periods of short-term drought. The results of our study show the importance of identifying climate legacies and lags when assessing indicators of ecological drought, which can be used to improve forecasts of which plant communities will be vulnerable under future climate change. © 2016","Climate change effects; Colorado Plateau; Ecological drought; Landsat imagery; Remote sensing; Southwestern United States; Vegetation","Drought; Ecology; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Wetting; Colorado Plateau; Future climate; Landsat imagery; Plant communities; Southwestern United States; Vegetation condition; Vegetation greenness; Water availability; Climate change; arid region; climate change; drought stress; grassland; Landsat; net ecosystem production; plant community; precipitation assessment; remote sensing; satellite imagery; vegetation dynamics; Colorado Plateau; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998673807

The ability to uncover this neglected biodiversity mainly derives from technical improvements, and the term ""microbial dark matter"" was used to group taxa poorly investigated and not necessarily monophyletic. We focused on such under-investigated microbial dark matter of drinking water treatment plant from groundwater, across carbon filters, to post-chlorination. We tackled this topic using an integrated approach where the efficacy of stringent water filtration (10000 MWCO) in recovering even the smallest environmental microorganisms was coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing to depict an informative spectrum of the neglected microbial diversity. Our results revealed that the composition of bacterial communities varies across the plant system: Parcubacteria (OD1) superphylum is found mainly in treated water, while groundwater has the highest heterogeneity, encompassing non-OD1 candidate phyla (Microgenomates, Saccharibacteria, Dependentiae, OP3, OP1, BRC1, WS3). Carbon filters probably act as substrate for microorganism growth and contribute to seeding water downstream, since chlorination does not modify the incoming bacterial community. New questions arise about the role of microbial dark matter in drinking water. Indeed, our results suggest that these bacteria might play a central role in the microbial dynamics of drinking water. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"carbon; charcoal; drinking water; ground water; RNA 16S; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; devices; filtration; genetics; human; isolation and purification; Italy; microbiology; phylogeny; procedures; water management; water quality; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon; Charcoal; Drinking Water; Filtration; Groundwater; Humans; Italy; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015330374

Among several possible sources we investigate mineral reactions able to take place within bottom sediments of particularly deep and hot sedimentary basins, i.e. at conditions of low-grade metamorphism (up to 500 °C and 2500 bar). These reactions involve lithologies where carbonate and alumino-silicate minerals are combined to form a « mixed composition ». For appraising decarbonation quantitatively we propose a method founded on thermodynamic calculations, that follows a modelling approach commonly used in metamorphic petrology. At given bulk composition and temperature-pressure (T-P) conditions, the composition and proportions of solid and fluid phases that coexist at equilibrium are computed using a Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) algorithm. On the basis of R.G. Berman's database we incorporate thermodynamic parameters for a variety of solid solutions including clay minerals, and for a CH4–CO2–H2O fluid mixture represented by the CPA-Electrolyte equation of state. A large range of decarbonation reactions is explored through a systematics involving 85 model compositions, and a unique T-P path typical of the targeted basins. We confirm that pure carbonate lithologies do not behave as CO2 source in the conditions explored. In contrast, we demonstrate that mixed compositions are likely to yield CO2 from successive mineral reactions, in which clay minerals play a prominent role. We also show that the temperature of incipient decarbonation, staggered over 325–425 °C, depends on the Ca/Mg/Fe composition ratio of the bulk sediment. CO2-prone reactions occurring from a selection of natural sediments are then presented. The CO2-prolific character of particular facies associated to the rift phase of a basin evolution is illustrated, notably in the case of lacustrine oil shales. Finally, we indicate a protocol that integrates the decarbonation scheme derived from thermodynamics into a CO2-generation formalism compatible with the usual formalism of a basin model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Basin modelling; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonation; Deep sedimentary basin; Low-grade metamorphism; Water-rock interaction","Clay minerals; Electrolytes; Equations of state; Gibbs free energy; Natural gas fields; Petroleum prospecting; Risk assessment; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Sediments; Settling tanks; Silicates; Basin modelling; Decarbonation; Low-grade metamorphism; Sedimentary basin; Water rock interactions; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; gas field; geochemistry; low grade metamorphism; P-T conditions; sedimentary basin; water-rock interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009804081

Pollen data suggest that in most cases plants kept pace with climate change. The steep costal-to-inland precipitation gradient resulted in asynchronous responses to climate change with coastal forests responding before inland sites. This was likely due to the proximity to oceans, warm valleys, and the differential responses to changes in ocean upwelling. Plants growing on soils with heavy metals showed little response to Holocene climate variability, suggesting that they experienced stability during the Holocene, which helps explain the localized plant diversity on the harsh soils. Plant communities on soils without heavy metals adjusted their ranges along elevational gradients in response to climate change, however. Fires were a common occurrence at all sites and tracked climate; however, sites that were more coastal experienced fewer fires than inland sites. Fire severity remained similar through the Holocene at individual sites; however, it was low to moderate at southern locations and higher at more northern locations. The article highlights historical factors that help explain the diversity of plant species in the forests of Northern California and provides insights for managing these complex ecosystems. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.","biodiversity; fire; mountains; paleoecology; plants","biodiversity; climate change; coniferous forest; forest fire; Holocene; mountain; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; plant; California; Coast Ranges; Klamath Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992503544

Here, we perform in-situ high-temperature ellipsometry to quantify the permittivity of TiN films from room temperature to 1258 °C. We find that the material becomes more absorptive at higher temperatures but maintains its metallic character throughout visible and near infrared frequencies. X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm that TiN retains its bulk crystal quality and that thermal cycling increases the surface roughness, reduces the lattice constant, and reduces the carbon and oxygen contaminant concentrations. The changes in the optical properties of the material are highly reproducible upon repeated heating and cooling, and the room-temperature properties are fully recoverable after cooling. Using the measured high-temperature permittivity, we compute the emissivity, surface plasmon polariton propagation length, and two localized surface plasmon resonance figures of merit as functions of temperature. Our results indicate that titanium nitride is a viable plasmonic material throughout the full temperature range explored. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Atomic force microscopy; Carbon; Electromagnetic wave polarization; High temperature applications; Infrared devices; Mass spectrometry; Nitrides; Optical properties; Permittivity; Plasmons; Refractory metals; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface roughness; Titanium; Titanium compounds; X ray diffraction; Contaminant concentrations; Heating and cooling; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Propagation lengths; Room temperature properties; Surface plasmon polaritons; Temperature dependent; Visible and near infrared; Titanium nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014573581

This objective has to be reached by all cities and governments worldwide. This paper focuses on the field of transportation, which is greatly responsible for air pollution, mainly in cities and urban areas such as towns, airports and seaports. The diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) enables a significant reduction of air pollutants emitted by combustion engines; however, their recharge can affect the total pollution by their increasing energy demand. A solution is the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to charge EVs. This paper analyzes the feasibility of integrating EVs and RES, focusing on the air pollution reduction benefits. This study uses data collected in Italy. After an analysis of the energy production by RES and the size of the vehicle fleet over time in Italy, an evaluation of the number of EVs as a function of the State Of Charge (SOC) and energy is introduced. Finally, the expected emissions reduction derived from the change of vehicle fleet is calculated. © 2016 IEEE.","Air pollution; Citizen; Electric vehicles; Environmental; Renewable energy sources","Air engines; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Natural resources; Pollution; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Citizen; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Emissions reduction; Energy productions; Environmental; Pollution reduction; Renewable energy source; Use of renewable energies; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017269564

In this work the excitation source of the Balmer lines is investigated by means of optical emission spectroscopy in the plasma device PSI-2. Neutral fast non-Maxwellian hydrogen atoms are produced by acceleration of hydrogen ions towards an electrode immersed into the plasma. By variation of the electrode potential the energy of ions and in turn of reflected fast atoms can be varied in the range of 40-300 eV. The fast atoms in front of the electrode are observed simultaneously by an Echelle spectrometer (0.001 nm/channel) and by an imaging spectrometer (0.01 nm/channel) up to few cm in the plasma. Intense excitation channels of the Balmer lines are observed when hydrogen is mixed with argon or with krypton. Especially in Ar-H and Ar-D mixed plasmas the emission of fast hydrogen atoms is very strong. Intermixing hydrogen with other noble gases (He, Ne or Xe) one observes the same effect however the emission is one order of magnitude less compared to Kr-H or Kr-D plasmas. It is shown, that the key process, impacting this emission, is the binary collision between the fast neutral hydrogen atom and the noble gas atom. Two possible sources of excitation are discussed in details: one is the excitation of hydrogen atoms by argon atoms in the ground state and the second one is the process of the so-called excitation transfer between the metastable states of noble gases and hydrogen. In the latter case the atomic data for excitation of Balmer lines are still not available in literature. Further experimental investigations are required to conclude on the source process of fast atom emission. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016927763

However, in order to test these concerns on a national scale, there is a conceptual and methodological gap in relation to calculating a national-level EROI and analysing its policy implications. We address this by developing a novel application of an Input-Output methodology to calculate a national-level indirect energy investment, one of the components needed for calculating a national-level EROI. This is a mixed physical and monetary approach using Multi-Regional Input-Output data and an energy extension. We discuss some conceptual and methodological issues relating to defining EROI for a national economy, and describe in detail the methodology and data requirements for the approach. We obtain initial results for the UK for the period 1997-2012, which show that the country's EROI has been declining since the beginning of the 21st Century. We discuss the policy relevance of measuring national-level EROI and propose avenues for future research. © 2017 by the authors.

This study explores the forms of stakeholder participation in the implementation of three pilot projects in Laos, with a focus on who actually makes decisions on project activities. We found that stakeholder roles in making decisions were imbalanced. The central government and development partner organizations were the ones who actually fulfill the roles of decision-makers in most project activities. Although local communities were not the key stakeholders in decision making in most activities, their roles seem to have increased in the activities where participatory approaches were applied. Participation of the private sector, non-governmental organizations, academic and research institutes and mass organizations was limited. Opportunities to reach decision-makers regarding project activities came through service contract agreements. Our findings suggest that an understanding of who fulfills the key roles will support a decentralization of decision making by balancing power and redistributing the roles from dominant to weaker stakeholders. In addition, the private sector's participation may enhance opportunities to harmonize their investments for supporting REDD+ development and reduce the negative impacts on the forests and the environment. © 2017 by the authors.","Clipad; Collaborative project; Decision-making power; Laos; Paredd; Redd+; Stakeholder participation; Suford-su","Contracts; Deforestation; Developing countries; Forestry; Societies and institutions; Clipad; Collaborative projects; Laos; Paredd; Redd; Stakeholder participation; Suford-su; Decision making; decentralization; decision making; deforestation; developing world; emission control; environmental degradation; participatory approach; stakeholder; Decision Making; Degradation; Forests; Laos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018241016

Previous research indicates that rule bending is influenced by organizational structure and personal characteristics (DeHart-Davis 2007). This present study considers the influence of organizational norms on rule bending by exploring the impact of ethical climate, which signals to employees the best course of action when faced with situations that are ethical in nature (Victor and Cullen 1987, 1988). To investigate this relationship, survey data from employees of a large American local government are analysed. Results from a structural equation model show that three ethical climates – ‘organization interest’, ‘team interest’, and ‘rules/SOP’ – significantly influence rule bending. Findings suggest that organizational norms play a critical role for employee behaviour and public managers can consider rule bending and ethical climate as impetuses for organizational change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"ethics; governance approach; local government; organizational change; organizational framework; public administration; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013481701

The resistance capacity of marine bacteria is well known, but their possible responses and their ability to recover after a CO2 release has not been investigated. Therefore, this work evaluated the responses of a marine bacterial community after 96 h of CO2 exposure under diverse pH treatments (7.8 as control without CO2, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) and 24 h after CO2 exposure. Results showed that the respiration activity and the diversity of the community were affected in all pH treatments. However, after 24 h without CO2 enrichment, the respiration activity and diversity increased, showing a partial recovery. Consequently, bacterial responses have the potential to be used as a monitoring tool for risk assessment related to carbon capture and storage techniques or in any similar CO2 enrichment situations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; CO2 enrichment; Diversity; Marine bacteria; pH; Recovery","Bacteria; Carbon capture; pH; Recovery; Risk assessment; Bacterial community; CO2 enrichment; Diversity; Marine bacterium; Microbial communities; Partial recovery; Resistance capacity; Respiration activity; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; sea water; carbon; bacterium; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sequestration; community response; microbial community; pH; respiration; species diversity; acidification; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Betaproteobacteria; carbon footprint; controlled study; Cytophaga; Desulfovibrionales; Flavobacterium; Gammaproteobacteria; marine bacterium; microbial diversity; microbial respiration; nonhuman; population abundance; population recovery; sediment; bacterium; chemistry; environmental monitoring; microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Seawater; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011999831

For instance, the municipal solid waste in Malaysia is expected to exceed 9 Mt/y by 2020 based on the current production rate of 1 kg−1 person−1. Approximately 90% of the waste is channelled into the landfill that can release a significant amount of greenhouse gases, mainly the methane gas and nitrous oxide gases, due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Composting is a cleaner alternative to landfilling for managing organic waste. Its main advantage lies in its capability to recycle nutrients through compost utilisation. The life cycle assessment has been widely used as a mean of comparison for impact assessment, such as global warming potential, among different waste management technologies. The common inventories accounted for composting include transportation, operational machineries, fugitive emissions during maturation and curing as well as the end production utilisation. There is inconsistency in the methodology adopted to assess its environmental impact. This study discusses on the variations of life cycle assessment that contributed to the different global warming potential of composting. It also discusses on the mitigation strategies to reduce the global warming potential for composting. The highlight of the study is to examine the variation in the inventory analysis for composting, and its underlying mechanism and the critical inventory for a more representative assessment. The second part of the paper reviews the mitigation strategies for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. the use of the bulking agent, aeration system, chemical additives and use of the cover material. This study found that the direct greenhouse gas emissions during composting contribute more significantly to the global warming potential than other direct emissions. The use of bulking agent is desirable to reduce the global warming potential. This study concludes that the assessment of the global warming potential for composting is dependent on the system boundary and the defined functional unit. The environmental impact should be assessed based on the operational mode and the input feedstock to generate a basis with minimised discrepancies among studies. Continuous effort is needed to quantify the long-term benefits of composting on environment, health and soil to further assess its impact as a cleaner process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner composting; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases mitigation; Inventory analysis","Composting; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Machinery; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Waste management; Anaerobic decomposition; Global warming potential; Industrial development; Inventory analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management technologies; Mitigation strategy; Rapid population growth; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996565633

Dry plasma texturing of Sub-μGWs by graphene 'nano-flaps' which adjust the tilt and density upon controlled liquid evaporation leads to controlled and stable sub-micrometer-scale surface modification and variable wettability in a wide range. This effect helps capture Au nanoparticles on the Sub-μGW surfaces as a proof-of-principle water purification platform and tune the charge-storage capacity and frequency response of Sub-μGW-based supercapacitors without altering the Sub-μGW backbones.

The no-lag hypothesis is the foundation of many ecophysiological models, correlative species distribution modelling and climate reconstruction approaches. Simple lag hypotheses have become prominent in disequilibrium ecology, proposing that communities track climate change following a fixed function or with a time delay. However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models. The overall implications are that (1) complex community dynamics may be common and (2) detailed knowledge of past climate change and community states will often be necessary yet sometimes insufficient to make predictions of a community's future state. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Alternate states; chaos; climate change; community assembly; community climate; community response diagram; disequilibrium; hysteresis; lag; memory effects","analytical method; chaotic dynamics; climate change; community composition; community response; diagram; disequilibrium; ecophysiology; hysteresis; population distribution; reconstruction; biological model; biota; climate change; ecology; population dynamics; procedures; Biota; Climate Change; Ecology; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011332603

The work in this study demonstrates a generic guideline for minimising CO2 emissions at traffic lights. This was done using an adaptive control, which uses a cost function for optimisation, rather than network-specific control parameters. A new version of the emission model PHEMlight was used, which added of a fuel cut-off mode during coasting and other improvements compared with the previous version. Using this model, it could be determined that the emission optimal ratio between delay time and stops for the cost function of an adaptive control should be 1:165 at 50 km/h. When the speed limit increases the ratio also increases with 1:296 for 70 km/h. However, it was also found that the optimal free flow travel speed was around 70 km/h. Therefore, with long distances between intersections and a low amount of average stops, the maximum speed should be higher than 50 km/h for emission optimality. Application of the ratio for 50 km/h to the adaptive control algorithm ImFlow resulted in a CO2 emission reduction of 6.3% compared with a vehicle actuated control. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost functions; Emission control; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Street traffic control; Traffic control; Adaptive Control; Adaptive control algorithms; Contributing factor; Control parameters; Emission reduction; Isolated intersection; Urban environments; Vehicular emission; Adaptive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019114722

The aim of this study is to compare indoor and outdoor concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) and 15 individual PAHs, as well as contribution of the analyzed PAHs to mutagenic and carcinogenic activity. Samples were collected during spring season in two sites in southern Poland (Silesia) representing urban and rural areas. Indoor samples of PM2.5 were sampled in kindergartens. At the same time, in the vicinity of the kindergarten buildings, the collection of the outdoor PM2.5 samples was carried out. Mutagenic (MEQ) and carcinogenic (TEQ) equivalents related to BaP and the percentage share expressed as mutagenic (MP) and carcinogenic (CP) potential of each individual compound to the total mutagenic/carcinogenic potential of the PAH mixture were calculated. The obtained results show that high concentrations of PM2.5 (above 25 μg/m3) and 15 PM2.5-bound PAHs in outdoor and indoor air were similar in the two studied areas. In overall PAHs mutagenic and carcinogenic potential, the percentage share of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was dominant and varied from 49.0–54.5% to 62.5–70.0%, respectively. The carried out study indicates the necessity of reducing PAH emission from solid fuel combustion, which is reflected in PM2.5-bound PAHs concentrations and their diagnostic ratios.

Accordingly, infrared absorption and Raman scattering spectroscopy have provided valuable information on both distributions and ensemble-average values of molecular vibrational frequencies, and these frequencies are now routinely used to investigate structure, conformation, and even absolute configuration of chemical and biological molecules of interest. Recent advancements in coherent time-domain nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy have allowed the study of heterogeneous distributions of local structures and thermally driven ultrafast fluctuations of vibrational frequencies. To fully utilize IR probe functional groups for quantitative bioassays, a variety of biological and chemical techniques have been developed to site-specifically introduce vibrational probe groups into proteins and nucleic acids. These IR-probe-labeled biomolecules and chemically reactive systems are subject to linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic investigations and provide information on the local electric field, conformational changes, site-site protein contacts, and/or function-defining features of biomolecules. A rapidly expanding library of data from such experiments requires an interpretive method with atom-level chemical accuracy. However, despite prolonged efforts to develop an all-encompassing theory for describing vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism as well as dynamic fluctuations of instantaneous vibrational frequencies, purely empirical and highly approximate theoretical models have often been used to interpret experimental results. They are, in many cases, based on the simple assumption that the vibrational frequency of an IR reporter is solely dictated by electric potential or field distribution around the vibrational chromophore. Such simplified description of vibrational solvatochromism generally referred to as vibrational Stark effect theory has been considered to be quite appealing and, even in some cases, e.g., carbonyl stretch modes in amide, ester, ketone, and carbonate compounds or proteins, it works quantitatively well, which makes it highly useful in determining the strength of local electric field around the IR chromophore. However, noting that the vibrational frequency shift results from changes of solute-solvent intermolecular interaction potential along its normal coordinate, Pauli exclusion repulsion, polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion interactions, in addition to the electrostatic interaction between distributed charges of both vibrational chromophore and solvent molecules, are to be properly included in the theoretical description of vibrational solvatochromism. Since the electrostatic and nonelectrostatic intermolecular interaction components have distinctively different distance and orientation dependences, they affect the solvatochromic vibrational properties in a completely different manner. Over the past few years, we have developed a systematic approach to simulating vibrational solvatochromic data based on the effective fragment potential approach, one of the most accurate and rigorous theories on intermolecular interactions. We have further elucidated the interplay of local electric field with the general vibrational solvatochromism of small IR probes in either solvents or complicated biological systems, with emphasis on contributions from non-Coulombic intermolecular interactions to vibrational frequency shifts and fluctuations. With its rigorous foundation and close relation to quantitative interpretation of experimental data, this and related theoretical approaches and experiments will be of use in studying and quantifying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules with unprecedented time and spatial resolution when combined with time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and chemically sensitive vibrational imaging techniques. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018468623

This has become an important area of research since it was first described, attracting different research groups worldwide. Basics of the process such as microorganisms involved and main reactions are now much better understood, and recent advances in BES configuration and electrode materials in lab-scale enhance the interest in this technology. However, there are still some gaps that need to be filled to move towards its application. Side reactions or scaling-up issues are clearly among the main challenges that need to be overcome to its further development.

To explore how plant-pollinator interactions are modified by extreme weather, we exposed faba bean (Vicia faba) plants to elevated temperature for 5 d during flowering, simulating a heatwave. We then moved the plants to flight cages with either bumblebees or no pollinators, or to two field sites, where plants were enclosed in mesh bags or pollinated by wild insect communities. We used a morphological marker to quantify pollen movement between experimental plants. There was a substantial increase in the level of outcrossing by insect pollinators following heat stress. Proportion outcrossed seed increased from 17 % at control temperature, to 33 % following heat stress in the flight cages, and from 31 % to 80 % at one field site, but not at the other (33 % to 32 %). Abiotic stress can dramatically shift the relative contributions of cross-and self-pollination to reproduction in an insect pollinated plant. The resulting increases in gene flow have broad implications for genetic diversity and functioning of ecosystems, and may increase resilience by accelerating the selection of more stress-tolerant genotypes. © 2016 The Author.","Allogamy; Autogamy; Climate change; Extreme weather; Heat stress; Insect pollination; Plant-climate interactions; Plant-pollinator interactions; Vicia faba","animal; climate change; crop; heat; insect; physiology; pollination; reproduction; Vicia faba; Animals; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Hot Temperature; Insecta; Pollination; Reproduction; Vicia faba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020306902

We use high-resolution (R ≈ 100,000), 3.2 μm spectra taken with CRIRES/VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in the planet?s day side atmosphere during 4 hr of its 4.23 day orbit after superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular absorption by water at a significance of 5.6s at a systemic velocity of Vsys = -33 ± 2 km s-1, coincident with the 51 Peg host star, with a corresponding orbital velocity = Kp=133+4.3-3.5km s-1This translates directly to a planet mass of Mp=0.476+0.032-0.031Mj, placing it at the transition boundary between Jovian and Neptunian worlds.

We also provide an updated orbital solution for 51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639 stellar radial velocities measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no significant evidence of an eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of significant absorption or emission from other major carbon-bearing molecules of the planet, including methane and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is non-inverted in the temperature-pressure region probed by these observations. The deepest absorption lines reach an observed relative contrast of 0.9×10-3 with respect to the host star continuum flux at an angular separation of 3 milliarcseconds.

One challenge in these applications is overcoming the inherent chemical incompatibility between carbon and metals that limits adhesion. Recently, we explored a new technique for electroplating carbon fibers with nickel. Electroplated carbon fiber tows were soldered to nickel metal tabs using SAC 305 (Sn3Ag0.5Cu). The electroplated nickel was found to be free of microvoids with (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 forming as intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in an annular region presumed to be Ni3Sn4 at the SAC 305-Ni interface. Mechanical characterization of the carbon fiber-nickel interface revealed bond strengths up to 434 N, which is similar to a 22 gauge high strength copper clad steel. Electrical resistances were found to be as low as 1.1 Ω for a 38.1 mm long connection. Carbon-metal connections prepared using silver epoxy were found to have 80% lower load bearing capacity and 10-20% higher electrical resistance. Battery discharge tests indicated that the carbon connections reduced performance by only 4% compared to conventional copper. The performance drop increased to 7% when the discharge time was increased by 50%, indicating some thermal dependence. The electroplating technique is a fairly simple and inexpensive means of enhancing the wettability of carbon fiber to create scalable carbon-based conductors for low current systems.

Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC = 13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1.

These models can both be employed for online catalyst control as well as model-based development of control and on-board diagnosis (OBD) strategies. In this paper we present such a model that aims at capturing transient TWC dynamics of fresh catalysts at elevated temperatures. Applying a parameter subset selection strategy, we demonstrate that solely taking into account the dynamics of oxygen storage and release is sufficient for this purpose and reactions associated with processes taking place on the platinum-group metals do not have to be modeled explicitly. The one-dimensional single channel model lumps the exhaust gas species into two pseudo components, one being able to oxidize and one being able to reduce the oxygen storage material. The respective reaction kinetics are considered reversible with non-linear functions depending on the oxidation state of the material being put in the center of focus. Model validation is carried out using experimental data from an isothermal synthetic gas test bench. The applied feed gas composition closely resembles real exhaust conditions under dynamic operation. By employing local parameter sensitivity and identifiability analysis and investigating the differences between a total of five fresh catalysts from different commercial suppliers, we propose a set of only five parameters that can be used to accurately model oxygen storage and release dynamics under isothermal conditions. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for oxygen storage from water as well as the need of using a spatially distributed model. Apart from the above mentioned applications, the model is shown to be suitable for fast catalyst screening and characterization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Control-oriented model; Isotopic exchange experiment; Oxygen storage; Parameter subset selection; Sensitivity analysis; Three-way catalyst","Catalysis; Characterization; Digital storage; Dynamics; Exhaust gases; Functions; Isotherms; Oxygen; Reaction kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; Storage (materials); Control oriented models; Isotopic exchange; Oxygen storage; Parameter subsets; Three way catalysts; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998636468

The objective is to evaluate the LCCs for an all-electric bus system utilizing either plug-in or wireless charging and also compare these costs to both conventional pure diesel and hybrid bus systems. Despite a higher initial infrastructure investment for off-board wireless chargers deployed across the service region, the wireless charging bus system has the lowest LCC of US$0.99 per bus-kilometer among the four systems and has the potential to reduce use-phase carbon emissions attributable to the lightweighting benefits of on-board battery downsizing compared to plug-in charging. Further uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis indicate that the unit price of battery pack and day or night electricity price are key parameters in differentiating the LCCs between plug-in and wireless charging.

This research investigates future corn and soybean yields in the Raccoon watershed, in the US Corn Belt, using projected climate data. We used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate the impact of climate change for 2015–2099 with data downscaled from eight atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) with three emissions pathways reflecting low, medium and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Soil properties were gathered from the Soil Survey Geographic Database and data on crop rotations was derived from CropScape, a geospatial cropland data layer product of the US National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Our findings indicate that 20-year mean yields of both corn and soybean for 2080–2099 simulated in EPIC using all eight AOGCMs under low and medium carbon scenarios will increase in comparison to the 20-year mean yields for 2015–2034. However, under the high carbon scenario, 20-year means of both corn and soybean yields for 2080–2099 will decline in comparison to the 20-year mean yields for 2015–2034, pointing to the effects of climate change. We also examined the possible impact of carbon fertilization on yields.

These two coalitions differ in the type of coalition sought, the strategies deployed thus far, and the type of support they have received, including the role of non-state actors. The framework helps identify significant gaps in the efforts of the two coalitions, including capturing the most salient link between climate change and mountains, translating technical input into negotiating positions, and identifying the most appropriate form of the coalition and forum to pursue these interests.

Their negative impacts on ecosystems and the provisioning of ecosystem services have been widely documented. South Africa faces one of the most significant challenges from invasive species globally, and the South African government spent an estimated US $100 million to mitigate impacts of non-native species between 1995 and 2000 alone. Here, we modeled the current climatic niche of 162 non-native trees and shrubs within South Africa and explored potential shifts in their distribution with projected climate change. Our results indicate that over half of these species will experience a decrease in their suitable climate over the next decades, although not uniformly so and ranges are predicted to expand into some regions. We also compared recent vs. historical introductions and showed similar patterns, indicating that possible violation of equilibrium assumptions in our distribution models likely does not strongly influence our findings. We suggest that climate change may therefore provide a window of opportunity for more effective invasive species control within South Africa, but that large range shifts are likely for many nonnatives in the future, and new invasive threats might emerge. © 2017 Bezeng et al.","Non-native species; Range shifts; Species distribution models; Trees and shrubs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016157201

The compositions of syngenetic garnet inclusions can potential yield information on both the depth and mantle lithology in which the diamonds formed. Pressure dependent changes in garnet compositions have been calibrated using the results of experiments conducted in a multi-anvil apparatus at pressures between 6 and 16 GPa and temperatures of 1000 to 1400 °C. Using the results of these experiments a barometer was formulated based on an empirical parameterisation of the two major majoritic substitutions, referred to as majorite (Maj; Al3+=Mg2++Si4+), and Na-majorite (Na-Maj; Mg2++Al3+=Na++Si4+). Moreover, previously published experimental garnet compositions from basaltic, kimberlite, komatiite and peridotite bulk compositions were included in the calibration, which consequently covers pressures from 6 to 20 GPa and temperatures from 900 to 2100 °C. Experimental pressures are reproduced over these conditions with a standard deviation of 0.86 GPa. The barometer is used to determine equilibration pressures of approximately 500 reported garnet inclusions in diamonds from a range of localities. As the majority of these inclusions are proposed to be syngenetic this allows a detailed picture of diamond formation depths and associated source rocks to be established using inclusion chemistry. Geographic differences in diamond source rocks are mapped within the sub-lithospheric mantle to over 500 km depth. Continuous diamond formation occurs over this depth range within lithologies with eclogitic affinities but also in lithologies that appear transitional between eclogitic and peridotitic bulk compositions, with an affinity to pyroxenites. The geographic differences between eclogitic and pyroxenitic diamond source rocks are rationalised in terms of diamond formation within downwelling and upwelling regimes respectively. Macroscopic diamond formation in rocks with pyroxenite compositions are likely facilitated in the deep mantle by higher average oxidation states and low mineral H2O solubility compared to the surrounding mantle, which aid the mobility of C–O–H volatile species. The apparent lack of inclusions with a peridotite affinity may result from generally low oxygen fugacities in such lithologies, which reduces carbon mobility, and the lack of a suitable oxidising agent to allow diamonds to form from CH4. This glimpse of deep carbon cycle processes implies that heterogeneities in the carbon content, redox state and chemical composition of the mantle may be strongly coupled. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","garnet; geobarometry; majorite; mantle; sub-lithospheric","Aluminum; Barometers; Calibration; Diamonds; Garnets; Geochemistry; Lithology; Minerals; Rocks; Silicon; Sodium; Chemical compositions; Geobarometry; Geographic difference; Inclusions in diamond; Lithospheric; Majorite; mantle; Multi-anvil apparatus; Diamond deposits; carbon; chemical composition; diamond; geobarometry; lithology; lithospheric structure; majorite; mantle structure; redox conditions; source rock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008331174

Here, we interrogated specific interactions between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic members of a model consortium to infer mechanisms that mediate metabolic coupling and acclimation to partnership. This binary consortium was composed of a cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, which supported growth of an obligate aerobic heterotroph, Meiothermus ruber strain A, by providing organic carbon, O2, and reduced nitrogen. Species-resolved transcriptomic analyses were used in combination with growth and photosynthesis kinetics to infer interactions and the environmental context under which they occur. We found that the efficiency of biomass production and resistance to stress induced by high levels of dissolved O2 increased, beyond axenic performance, as a result of heterotrophic partnership. Coordinated transcriptional responses transcending both species were observed and used to infer specific interactions resulting from the synthesis and exchange of resources. The cyanobacterium responded to heterotrophic partnership by altering expression of core genes involved with photosynthesis, carbon uptake/fixation, vitamin synthesis, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Apart from its acknowledged social benefits, urban farming is also widely viewed as a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional remote farming. Especially indoor, soilless cultivation in urban areas is being portrayed as a particularly sustainable solution. However, as this technique relies on controlled environments, its ongoing operation can be quite energy-intensive and related carbon emissions should be carefully weighed against reduced emissions, such as those from transportation. To further this goal, this article presents a simulation-based environmental analysis workflow for Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) in urban contexts, that includes detailed solar radiation, water and energy specific models. The aim of the workflow is to guide the user through decision-making on the potentialities of implementing BIA in a given neighborhood while maximizing crop yields and minimizing water and energy consumption. The workflow was applied to three hi-tech urban farming scenarios in Lisbon, Portugal: a polycarbonate Rooftop Greenhouse (RG), a Vertical Farm (VF) with windows and skylights on the top floor of a reinforced-concrete building as well as a completely opaque VF with no penetration of natural light on the ground floor of a reinforced-concrete building. Global Warming Potential (GWP) related to water, transportation and operational energy of these three case studies were compared to GWP of (i) the currently existing supply chain for tomato, and (ii) a hypothetical low-tech unconditioned rooftop urban farm. Results show that the RG and the top floor VF had the best overall environmental performance, respectively cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half and in three in comparison with the existing supply chain for tomato. By allowing this preliminary assessment of alternative farm locations and properties, the workflow provides the user with actionable information for early-stage holistic assessment of BIA projects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA); Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA); Global Warming Potential (GWP); Parametric simulation; Performance-based design; Resource efficiency","Agriculture; Buildings; Carbon; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Floors; Fruits; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Reinforced concrete; Structural design; Supply chains; Building integrated; Controlled environment agricultures; Global warming potential; Parametric simulations; Performance based design; Resource efficiencies; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013837289

This threat is expected to be most acute for small-ranged endemic species, which could see novel climatic conditions develop rapidly across the entirety of their limited geographic ranges. To avoid extinctions, some conservationists have proposed that climateimperiled species might be candidates for ""assisted colonization"" or ""managed relocation"" to new regions, outside their historical ranges. One major concern related to managed relocation is the possibility that some relocated species could later become problematic invasives where they are introduced. In this review, we consider how these emerging conservation challenges might unfold for the flora of New England. A range of evidence suggests that most plant species native to New England might be resilient to immediate extinction risk from climate change, as these species typically have broad geographic ranges and have migrated long distances in response to past climate change. In contrast, regions to the south, particularly hotspots of plant endemism in the southeastern US, harbor numerous small-ranged species whose current climatic niches could rapidly shift beyond their native ranges, leaving them vulnerable to extinction unless they colonize new regions to the north. Consequently, debates surrounding managed relocation in New England are likely to be focused primarily on the ecological risks versus conservation benefits of accepting climate-Threatened endemic plant species from the southeastern US, and to hinge on concerns about the invasive potential of these species. To provide an empirically-grounded estimate of invasion risk from the introduction of US native plant species to New England, we reviewed invasive species lists for New England and tallied those species that are native to other parts of the contiguous US (versus other regions and continents). Between four and ten ""invasive"" or ""potentially invasive"" plant species reported from New England are from other regions of the contiguous US, depending in part on how issues of native versus exotic genotypes within taxa are resolved. A review of current floristic data from New England shows that these 4-10 problematic species are drawn from a larger pool of ~374 US native plant species reported as exotic in the region, suggesting that only 1.1-2.7% of species appearing spontaneously as adventives in the region are viewed as invasive. In light of this analysis, we suggest that managed relocation is not likely to spawn large numbers of new invasives, and might therefore be judiciously evaluated alongside other conservation options for climate-Threatened plant species. We propose a collaborative effort among field botanists, land managers, conservationists, and academics in New England, partnering with botanists in the southeastern US, to initiate fundamental research to experimentally test the viability and ecological effects of climate-Threatened endemic plant species from the southeastern US in the New England region. © Copyright 2017 by the New England Botanical Club.","Assisted colonization; Climate change; Conservation; Dispersal; Endemic plants; Exotic plants; Extinction; Invasions; Managed relocation; Migration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026912524

The water level of this lake has been reported to dramatically rise without falling back to the original level. The cause of this rise is not yet sufficiently investigated and subjected to this study. This study argues that the general variability in the lake level and its resultant rise has significant linkage to the temperature variability at the Pacific Ocean. The linkage between water level dynamics and climate variability was analyzed through the application of diverse statistical techniques. It comprises the Mann-Kendall trend analysis to test monotonic variations over time; sequential regime shift index (RSI) to detect significant shifts in the mean values of time-series records of lake level; and coherence analysis to investigate the linear relationship between ENSO index and records of local hydrology. Despite the multiple rises and falls, the results of the trend analysis revealed that the lake level experienced a significant resultant upward trend with Mann-Kendall τ values of 0.558, 0.629, and 0.545 (at α = 0.05 and p < 0.01%) for monthly maximum, average and minimum values respectively. The sequential regime shift evidenced that most of the significant shifts coincide with the occurrences of ENSO events. Generally, the lake level tends to be high during El Niño and low during La Niña episodes. The typical examples are the coincidence of extreme historical maximum lake level to the strongest El Niño event of the century that occurred in 1997/98 and the lowest lake level record in the year 1975 with a strong La Niña year. The coincidence of climate regime shift in the Pacific Ocean in 1976/77 with an equivalent regime shift in the lake level is an additional confirmation for the possible climate-hydrology linkage. The likely involvement of anthropogenic factors (at least in modifying the effect of climate) is justified by the interplay between the non-trending rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and trending streamflow. The coherence analysis between 492 pairs of monthly step datasets of 3.4ENSO index and lake level changes is also found to have a significant linear relationship over frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.14 cycles/month or 1.56 to 1.68 cycles/year. This corresponds to a dominant average periodicity (coincident cycle) of about 7.4 months which is thought to be related to the time span of the two rainy season in the locality. © 2017 by the authors.","3.4ENSO index; Coherence analysis; El Niño; La Niña; Lake Hawassa; Regime shift; Trend analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027379302

This study investigated how smallholder farmers perceive climate change, what adaptation strategies they practice, and factors that influence their adaptation decisions. Both primary and secondary data were used for the study, and a multinomial logit model was employed to identify the factors that shape smallholder farmers' adaptation strategies. Results: The results show that 90% of farmers have already perceived climate variability, and 85% made attempts to adapt using practices like crop diversification, planting date adjustment, soil and water conservation and management, increasing the intensity of input use, integrating crop with livestock, and tree planting. The econometric model indicated that education, family size, gender, age, livestock ownership, farming experience, frequency of contact with extension agents, farm size, access to market, access to climate information and income were the key factors determining farmers' choice of adaptation practice. Conclusion: In the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia, climate change is a pressing problem, which is beyond the capacity of smallholders to respond to autonomously. Farmers' capacity to choose effective adaptation options is influenced by household demography, as well as positively by farm size, income, access to markets, access to climate information and extension, and livestock production. This implies the need to support the indigenous adaptation strategies of the smallholder farmers with a wide range of institutional, policy, and technology support; some of it targeted on smaller, poorer or female-headed households. Moreover, creating opportunities for non-farm income sources is important as this helps farmers to engage in those activities that are less sensitive to climate change. Furthermore, providing climate change information, extension services, and creating access to markets are crucial. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Diversification; Livelihoods; Multinomial logit model; Smallholder farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014512622

Extreme TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, means of 1624.8, 433.4 and 320.8 µgm−3, respectively, were recorded in the Zabol sampling site, while the examined water-soluble ions and trace metals constitute small fractions (∼4.1%–17.7%) of the particulate masses. Intense winds on the dust-storm days result in weathering of soil crust and deflation of evaporate minerals from the dried Hamoun lake beds in the Sistan basin. The soil samples are rich in Ca2+, SO42−, Na+ and Cl− revealing the existence of non-sea salts, as well as in Al, Fe and Mg, while the similarity in the chemical composition between soil and airborne samples indicates that the dust events over Sistan are local in origin. In contrast, low concentrations of secondary ions (i.e., nitrate) and heavy metals (i.e., Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu) indicate less anthropogenic and industrial emissions.

Offset projects sequestering carbon earn credits that can be traded on the Cap-and-Trade market to compensate for carbon emissions. The carbon stock embodied in harvested wood products can make up a substantial portion of the sequestered carbon in forest offset projects. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of the calculations for the number of credits allocated to a forest offset project in the California system. We also examine how alternative models for the decay of harvested wood products might better reflect the dynamics of both the lifetime and cascade chain progression of the products and how this might change the amount of credits earned. The results suggest improved data collection and refinement in methodology would help to improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in a large and important carbon stock. We conclude with offering suggestions on how an understanding of the dependence of harvested wood product stocks on life cycle parameters might affect the economics of offset programs and assist targeted mitigation efforts. © 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå","Carbon accounting; Decay distribution; Forest offset protocol; Sensitivity","Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Forestry; Harvesting; Wood; Wood products; California Air Resources Board; Carbon accounting; Climate change mitigation; Decay distribution; Forest offsets; Harvested wood products; Sensitivity; Sequestering carbon; Life cycle; carbon sequestration; environmental economics; forestry production; harvesting; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis; California; Forests; Market Research; Wood Products; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016146914

This can be challenging in experiments and simulations when double peaks are present because they can have different origins. Fermi dyads are a common class of such doublets, stemming from the resonance of the fundamental excitation of a mode with the overtone of another. We present a new, efficient approach to unambiguously characterize Fermi resonances in density functional theory (DFT) based simulations of condensed phase systems. With it, the spectral features can be assigned and the two resonating modes identified. We also show how data from DFT simulations employing classical nuclear dynamics can be post-processed and combined with a perturbative quantum treatment at a finite temperature to include analytically thermal quantum nuclear effects. The inclusion of these effects is crucial to correct some of the qualitative failures of the Newtonian dynamics simulations at a low temperature such as, in particular, the behavior of the frequency splitting of the Fermi dyad. We show, by comparing with experimental data for the paradigmatic case of supercritical CO2, that these thermal quantum effects can be substantial even at ambient conditions and that our scheme provides an accurate and computationally convenient approach to account for them. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Molecular dynamics; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Temperature; Ambient conditions; Atomic arrangement; Different origins; Finite temperatures; First principles molecular dynamics; Frequency splittings; Newtonian dynamics; Quantum treatment; Resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016765650

To provide such a route, this study is dedicated to apply information form interfacial atomic interactions in modified continuum models implemented to analyze the mechanical behavior of these nanocomposites. In the proposed methodology, the metal matrix is considered as a continuous medium. Meanwhile, to capture the atomic-scale phenomena governing the problem, the carbon nanofiller, local metal atoms neighboring it, and the nanofiller/metal interface are analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Subsequently, employing the equivalent continuum modeling (ECM) concept, geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the equivalent nanofiller is obtained in each case and introduced in a finite element analysis (FEA). It is demonstrated that the atomistically informed FEA can successfully reproduce the results of full atomistic MD simulations with ignorable run-time compared to that of this method. Finally, constructing several computational cells with different metal matrices and reinforcing agents, the developed MD/FE multiscale approach is utilized to capture the influences of temperature, nanofiller geometry and orientation, its volume fraction and interfacial interactions on the axial elastic constants of these nanocomposites. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Axial elastic constant; Equivalent continuum modeling; Equivalent nanofiller; Finite element analysis; Metal matrix nanocomposite (MMNC); Molecular dynamics simulation","Atoms; Computational geometry; Continuum mechanics; Elastic constants; Finite element method; Metal analysis; Metals; Molecular dynamics; Nanocomposites; Reinforcement; Atomic scale phenomena; Equivalent-continuum models; Interfacial interaction; Mechanical characteristics; Metal matrix nano composites; Molecular dynamics simulations; Multi-scale approaches; Nanofiller; Metallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007085722

The adverse effect of transient increases in air pollution is greater on individuals with poor health status.

We focus on the long-term nature of infrastructure decisions, specifically local roadways, which can lock in greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. The location and interconnectedness of local roadways form a near-permanent backbone for the future layout of land parcels, buildings, and transportation options. We provide new estimates of the environmental impact of low-connectivity roads, characterized by cul-de-sacs and T-intersections, which we dub street-network sprawl. We find an elasticity of vehicle ownership with respect to street connectivity of -0.15 - larger than suggested by previous research. We then apply this estimate to quantify the long-term emissions implications of alternative scenarios for street-network sprawl. On current trends alone, we project vehicle travel and emissions to fall by ∼3.2% over the 2015-2050 period, compared to a scenario where sprawl plateaus at its 1994 peak. Concerted policy efforts to increase street connectivity could more than triple these reductions to ∼8.8% by 2050. Longer-term reductions over the 2050-2100 period are more speculative, but could be more than 50% greater than those achieved by 2050.

Both schools recently completed their baseline N footprints as part of the beta-test phase of the Nitrogen Footprint Tool. The schools have very different geographies, student bod-ies, and history of sustainability efforts. On both campuses, the N footprint is dominated by food purchases (59.7% and 78.3% for Colorado College and the University of New Hampshire, respectively). Therefore, changes in dining policy and food purchasing have the potential to reduce campus nitrogen and carbon (CO2e) footprints, as well as to increase significantly an institutions Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AAS-HE) STARS score.

Because greater than 50% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from small, distributed sectors such as homes, offices, and transportation sources, most renewable energy systems and on-site carbon capture technologies for reducing future CO2 emissions cannot be effectively utilized. This problem might be mediated by considering novel materials and technologies for directly capturing/removing CO2 from air. However, compared to materials for capturing CO2 at on-site emission sources, materials for capturing CO2 directly from air must be more selective to CO2, and should operate and be stable at near ambient conditions. In this review article, we briefly summarize the recent developments in materials for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air. We discuss the challenges in this field and offer a perspective for developing the current state-of-art and also highlight the potential of a few recent discoveries in materials science that show potential for advanced application of air capture technology. © 2016","Direct air capture; Experimental-theory approach; Independent of emitting source; Negative emissions; Optimized properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007258173

To further develop remote sensing-based measurements of peatland moisture characteristics, we employed coincident surface reflectance and moisture measurements in two Sphagnum moss-dominated peatland sites. We applied the Mexican hat continuous wavelet transform to the measured spectra to generate wavelet features and coefficients across a range of scales. Overall, wavelet analysis was an improvement over the previously tested spectral indices at both the study sites. Linear mixed effect models for WT height using wavelet features accounted for more of the variance with both an improved marginal R^{\mathrm { {2}}} (29% greater) and a larger conditional R^{\mathrm { {2}}} (21% greater) compared to the best performing spectral index. While spectral indices performed similarly with wavelet coefficients for moisture content measured at 3 cm depth, they performed poorly for volumetric moisture content measured at 7 cm depth. The current study also revealed the advantage of selecting the best subsets of wavelet features based upon genetic algorithm over a more widely used technique that selects features based on correlation scalograms. It also provided new insights into the significance of various spectral regions to detect WT alteration-induced vegetation change. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm (GA); hyperspectral; peat moisture; vegetation indices; wavelet transform","Carbon; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Groundwater; Moisture; Optical waveguides; Remote sensing; Spectroscopic analysis; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Wetlands; Continuous wavelet analysis; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Moisture Measurement; Near-surface moisture conditions; Spectroscopic determinations; Surface reflectance; Volumetric moisture content; Wavelet coefficients; Moisture determination; carbon sink; climate change; correlation; ecosystem approach; genetic algorithm; height; moisture content; moss; peatland; remote sensing; spectral resolution; spectroscopy; vegetation dynamics; vegetation index; water table; wavelet analysis; Bryophyta; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007109758

It addresses the aggregate phenomenon in terms of geographical distribution, central players, mitigation ambition and monitoring provisions. Examining thirteen networks, it finds that membership in TMNs is skewed toward Europe and North America while countries from the Global South are underrepresented; that only a minority of networks commit to quantified emission reductions and that these are not more ambitious than Parties to the UNFCCC; and finally that the monitoring provisions are fairly limited. In sum, the article shows that transnational municipal networks are not (yet) the representative, ambitious and transparent player they are thought to be. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cities and regions; Climate change; Transnational networks; Urban politics","advocacy; climate change; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental policy; global change; governance approach; international relations; regional planning; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; urban politics; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962190510

To evaluate the magnitude of these contributions, emission avoidance contributions for field and farmstead windbreak designs in regions across the United States were estimated, along with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission budgets for corn, soybean, winter wheat, and potato operations. We looked at farming scenarios with large (600 ha), mid (300 ha), and small-size (60 ha) farms containing farmsteads built before and after 2000, and growing different cropping systems. Windbreak scenarios were assumed to be up to 5% of the crop area for field windbreaks, while emission avoidance for farmstead windbreaks were assumed to provide a 10% and 25% reduction in energy usage for space conditioning and heating, respectively. Total reduction of C equivalent (CE) emissions by windbreaks on farm systems ranged from a low of 0.9 Mg CE year-1 for a 60-ha farm with a home built before 2000 to 39.1 Mg CE year-1 for a 600-ha farm with a home built after 2000. By reducing fossil fuel usage from farm operations, windbreaks provide a promising strategy for reducing GHG emissions from agriculture in the USA. © 2017 by the authors.

Yet, the lack of reliable data on past events renders the implementation of appropriate adaptation policies a difficult task, and therefore also hampers the mitigation of future disasters. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, we combine reconstructed paleoflood events based on tree-ring analyses with existing systematic records, so as to derive a regional flood frequency. Analysis was realized with tree-ring records and through the dating of growth disturbances in riparian trees of major rivers in Kullu district (Himachal Pradesh, Indian Himalayas). To this end, we combined field-based observations, tree-ring analyses, hydraulic modelling and statistical approaches. Results suggest that the occurrence of floods in Kullu district is recurrent, with a marked seasonality and a cyclic natural variability in flood frequency at multi-decadal scales, as well as distinct spatial representativeness. The inclusion of peak discharge data of past, previously ungauged, flood events derived from tree-ring records has a significant and positive impact on the flood frequency assessment. Flood hazards and associated risks have been clearly underestimated in the region and based on the systematic records alone. We also demonstrate that a regional flood frequency approach is suitable to optimize the information gathered from tree rings and that flood frequency can thus be analyzed for larger regions. The approach used in this paper can be implemented in the other, poorly gauged region and thus contribute to climate change adaptation policies in undocumented environments such as the Indian Himalayan Region. © 2016","Flood frequency; Hazard; Indian Himalayas; Kullu district; Past food; Tree rings","Climate change; Forestry; Hazards; Trees (mathematics); Adaptation policies; Climate change adaptation; Flood frequency; Himalayas; Kullu district; Regional flood frequencies; Statistical approach; Tree rings; Floods; adaptive management; climate change; flood frequency; hazard assessment; hydraulic conductivity; paleoflood; peak discharge; riparian vegetation; tree ring; Himachal Pradesh; Himalayas; India; Kullu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009431547

To demonstrate and obtain the optimal condition, the unit was simulated by using a steady-state flowsheet simulator, i.e. Aspen Plus, under different operational conditions. According to the simulation results, the unit was not operational under its optimal conditions due to some defects in the cooling system at top stage of the debutanizer tower (DBT) during hot and humid seasons. Additionally, the vapor pressure of produced LPG and accordingly the amount of its flaring were decreased by reducing the temperature of debutanizer tower at top stages. In the optimization section, the DBT condenser and reboiler heat duty, temperature, and pressure were regulated as adjustable parameters. The simulation results demonstrated that by applying the optimum suggestion in the hot months, the reflux stream temperature was reached about 55 °C which caused an efficient increment in LPG production (about 4%) with adjusting the propane component in LPG, based on the standard range as the plant criteria. Moreover, after applying modifications, about 750 t of LPG product was saved from flaring during five hot months of the year, which resulted in 360000USD extra annual income for the company. Finally, from environmental point of view, this optimization caused to reduce 81 t of CO2 emission to the environment. Therefore, the current investigation must be introduced as a friendly environmentally process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emission; LPG; NGL; Optimization; Simulation","Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Industrial emissions; Liquefied petroleum gas; Optimization; Adjustable parameters; CO2 emissions; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Natural gas liquids; Operational conditions; Simulation; Simulation and optimization; Special economic zones; Gas condensates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005808086

To reduce its contribution without limiting the quantity of goods distributed, the technological improvement of vehicles and alternative fuels is only a partial solution. Indeed, it should be flanked by other integrative push- and pull-measures implemented at the policy level. Among them, eco-driving represents an option that covers strategic, tactical and operational decisions and provides suggestions to drivers, as well as real-time monitoring of their performance. This paper brings some evidence to such assertion, first providing a summary of the literature assessing the impacts of eco-driving, and then highlighting the limited amount of studies regarding freight transport. The results of an eco-driving field trial conducted in the Chinese province of Jiangsu, whose data were gathered using a method based on real-time normalized indicators specifically developed by Deutsche Telekom AG, are then presented. 15 heavy-duty and 10 light commercial vehicles were monitored over a period of four months, and information was collected on more than 5200 trips, covering a total distance of 439,000 km. A comparison between the driving styles before and after the training revealed a reduction of unitary fuel consumption for heavy-duty vehicles (−5.5%), while no significant variations were visible for light commercial vehicles. The application of this research method also yielded useful information about braking, acceleration and standstill, which are normally not considered in these types of evaluations, but can be highly valuable to drivers who wish to modify their behaviour towards a more efficient style of driving. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emissions; Eco-driving; Field trial; Freight transport","Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Behavioral research; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Digital storage; Freight transportation; Fuels; Ground vehicles; Light weight vehicles; Vehicles; China; Eco-driving; Field trial; Freight transport; Light commercial vehicles; Operational decisions; Real time monitoring; Technological improvements; Commercial vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013192455

Due to the large difference in the physical properties of hydrogen compared to other fuels such as natural gas, well established gas turbine combustion systems cannot be directly applied for dry-low-NOx (DLN) hydrogen combustion. Thus, the development of DLN combustion technologies is an essential and challenging task for the future of hydrogen fuelled gas turbines. The DLN micromix combustion principle for hydrogen fuel has been developed to significantly reduce NOx-emissions. This combustion principle is based on cross-flow mixing of air and gaseous hydrogen which reacts in multiple miniaturized diffusion-type flames. The major advantages of this combustion principle are the inherent safety against flash-back and the low NOx-emissions due to a very short residence time of reactants in the flame region of the micro-flames. The micromix combustion technology has been already proven experimentally and numerically for pure hydrogen fuel operation at different energy density levels. The aim of the present study is to analyze the influence of different geometry parameter variations on the flame structure and the NOx emission and to identify the most relevant design parameters, aiming to provide a physical understanding of the micromix flame sensitivity to the burner design and identify further optimization potential of this innovative combustion technology while increasing its energy density and making it mature enough for real gas turbine application. The study reveals great optimization potential of the micromix combustion technology with respect to the DLN characteristics and gives insight into the impact of geometry modifications on flame structure and NOx emission. This allows to further increase the energy density of the micromix burners and to integrate this technology in industrial gas turbines. © 2017 National Laboratory for Aeronautics and Astronautics","Dry-low-NOx (DLN) combustion; High hydrogen combustion; Hydrogen combustion; Hydrogen gas turbine; Micromix combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018656844

We use ethnographic analysis, combined with Cumulative Departure Index (CDI), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) analysis, and correlation analysis to compare farmers’ perceptions in Southwestern Nigeria with historical meteorological data, in order to assess the way farmers’ observations mirror the climatic trends. The results show that about 67% of farmers who participated had observed recent changes in climate. Perceptions of rural farmers on climate change and variability are consistent with the climatic trend analysis. RAI and CDI results illustrate that not less than 11 out of 30 years in each study site experienced lower-than-normal rainfall. Climatic trends show fluctuations in both early growing season (EGS) and late growing season (LGS) rainfall and the 5-year moving average suggests a reduction in rainfall over the 30 years. Climatic trends confirmed farmers’ perceptions that EGS and LGS precipitations are oscillating, that rainfall onset is becoming later, and EGS rainfall is reducing. Overall impacts of climate change on both crops and livestock appear to be highly negative, much more on maize (62.8%), yam (52.2%), poultry (67%) and cattle (63.2%). Years of farming experiences and level of income of farmers appear to have a significant relationship with farmers’ choice of adaptation strategies, with r≥0.60@ p<0.05 and r≥0.520@ p<0.05 respectively. The study concluded that farmers’ perceptions of climate change mirror meteorological analysis, though their perceptions were based on local climate parameters. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to climate change since the majority of them do not have enough resources to cope. © 2016 The Authors","Climate change; Nigeria; Perception analysis; Smallholder farmers","climate change; crop plant; ethnography; index method; livestock; perception; rainfall; resource use; smallholder; Nigeria; Bos; Dioscorea alata; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009358047

The work was carried out as part of the EC Horizon 2020 co-funded REWARD (Real World Advanced technologies foR Diesel engines) project. Owing to the wide variation in feed-gas properties expected over an RDE cycle, the results seen for current production system architectures such as Lean NOX traps (LNT) or actively dosed Selective Catalytic Reduction (aSCR) systems highlight the challenge to adhere to emissions limitations for RDE legislation whilst fulfilling stringent CO2 targets. Optimisation of both the after-treatment system configuration and control strategies are required. Vehicle simulation has been performed with a range of after-treatment system specifications and engine-out feed-gas properties. The work includes an assessment of exhaust thermal management with regards to catalyst performance. The results are evaluated considering a range of criteria including; emissions control capability, estimated system on-cost, packaging limitations, fuel consumption penalty and additional fluid consumption.

This conceptual understanding is examined by performing climatological and case analyses of 185 objectively identified lower-stratospheric fronts that occurred over North America during the winter seasons (December, January and February) of 2004–2012 in the 1.0°×1.0°NCEP/NCAR Global Forecast System analysis. The climatological analysis shows a preference for strong southwesterly flow lower-stratospheric fronts to occur over the Intermountain West region and relatively weaker southwesterly flow lower-stratospheric fronts to occur over eastern North America. The southwesterly flow lower-stratospheric fronts were composited according to their geographical location and the analysis shows that the composite lower-stratospheric and tropospheric structures in these two locations have statistical differences. The case-study analyses of southwesterly flow lower-stratospheric fronts in these two regions highlight different, geographically dependent, frontal evolutions. The strong lower-stratospheric front identified in the Intermountain West region interacted with an orographic gravity wave and associated lower-stratospheric ascent that rearranged the local thermal field. The lower-stratospheric front in eastern North America developed parallel to a surface front and was associated with diabatically reduced static stability in the upper troposphere, geostrophic warm air advection, and enhanced ascent. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","climatology; frontal zones; gravity waves; lower stratosphere; tropopause jet streaks","Advection; Climatology; Clouds; Gravity waves; Troposphere; Climatological analysis; Conceptual understanding; Frontal zones; Global forecast systems; Jet streaks; Lower stratosphere; Orographic gravity waves; Statistical differences; Fighter aircraft; advection; climatology; conceptual framework; gravity wave; jet stream; stratosphere; tropopause; westerly; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018534112

In particular it has been shown that the linear optical response of carbon nanotubes [F. Wang, Science 308, 838 (2005)SCIEAS0036-807510.1126/science.1110265] and graphene nanoribbons [Nat.

However, the knowledge on corresponding biogeochemical responses is limited. In this study, glycerol was injected in an aquifer contaminated with cis-dichloroethene (cDCE), and geochemical and microbial shifts were followed for 265 days. Consistent with anoxic conditions and sulfate reduction after biostimulation, MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed temporarily increased relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes and sulfate reducing Deltaproteobacteria. In line with 13C cDCE enrichment and increased Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dcm) numbers, dechlorination was observed toward the end of the field experiment, albeit being incomplete with accumulation of vinyl chloride. This was concurrent with (i) decreased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), reduced relative abundances of fermenting and sulfate reducing bacteria that have been suggested to promote Dcm growth by providing electron donor (H2) and essential corrinoid cofactors, (ii) increased sulfate concentration and increased relative abundance of Epsilonproteobacteria and Deferribacteres as putative oxidizers of reduced sulfur compounds. Strong correlations of DOC, relative abundance of fermenters and sulfate reducers, and dechlorination imply the importance of syntrophic interactions to sustain robust dechlorination.

The new political conjuncture is comprised on three inter-related elements: a Constitutional Court decision to recognise Indigenous land claims; the development of the Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation Plus (REDD+) forest carbon programme; and a national initiative known as One-map. Drawing on concepts of governmentality, assemblage and territoriality we trace how the Indigenous People’s Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) are using this moment to assemble a land claim in Bahanei. We find that the conjuncture is providing opportunities for Indigenous communities to engage with a new assemblage of interests normally associated with green grabs to claim land back from state and private interests. However, the romantic green Indigenous subjectivities the new political conjuncture requires to attract carbon investment rarely fit the heterogeneous make up of village life. This is leading to intimate exclusions based on ethnicity and class, raising troubling questions about the extent of overlap between land claims and green grabs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assemblage; governmentality; green grabs; Indigenous land claims; Indonesia; REDD+","carbon emission; deforestation; governance approach; indigenous population; land use conflict; landownership; participatory approach; political conflict; territoriality; Central Kalimantan; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979995387

We do so by examining two of Cambodia's largest carbon emitting sectors: energy and transportation. We argue that Cambodia has a unique window of opportunity to pursue a low carbon pathway given that, despite significant economic growth, the country is currently producing less CO2 per capita compared to most other countries across Asia. Cambodia could benefit greatly (in economic, social, and environmental terms) from adopting a low carbon pathway. Promising harbingers are present, such as recent shifts to hydropower, adoption of urban master plans, and citizen frustration with traffic congestion and poor air quality that may enable public buy-in for innovative low-carbon solutions. Achieving this will require sharpened and harmonized policy, approaching all planning activities from a low-carbon perspective, and support (both institutional and financial) from regional bodies and multilateral organizations. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Traffic congestion; Cambodia; Economic growths; Energy and transportation; Low carbon; Low-carbon futures; Master plan; Multilateral organizations; Per capita; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017242796

However, the realized effectiveness of these programs has not yet been estimated on a large scale. Here we take advantage of a large sample of monthly electricity consumption data for 178,777 commercial buildings in Los Angeles to analyse energy savings and emissions reductions from three major programs designed to encourage efficiency: the US Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge, the US Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program and the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. Using matching techniques, we find energy savings that range from 18% to 30%, depending on the program. These savings represent a reduction of 210 million kilowatt-hours or 145 kilotons of CO 2 equivalent emissions per year. However, we also find that these programs do not substantially reduce emissions in small and medium sized buildings, which represent about two-thirds of commercial sector building emissions. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Scientists propose in particular initiating field trials of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). This paper examines how the meanings of geoengineering experimentation, specifically SAI field trials, are reconfigured in the deliberation of the lay public. To this end, we conducted focus groups with Japanese citizens in June 2015 on the geoengineering concept and SAI field trials. Our main findings are as follows: the ‘climate emergency’ framing compelled the lay public to accept, either willingly or reluctantly, the need for ‘geoengineering research’ however, public discourse on SAI field trials was ambiguous and ambivalent, involving both tensions and dilemmas in understanding what the SAI field trial is for and about. Our results exhibit how the lay public wrestles with understanding the social, political, and ethical implications of SAI field trials in multiple dimensions, namely, accountability, controllability, predictability, and desirability. The paper argues that more clarity in the term ‘geoengineering research’ is needed to facilitate inclusive and pluralistic debates on geoengineering experimentation and not to preemptively arrive at a consensus that ‘we need more research.’ We conclude that ambivalence about both the pros and cons of geoengineering experimentation seems to be enduring; thus, instead of ignoring or repressing it, embracing ambivalence is required to keep the geoengineering debate democratic and inclusive. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ambivalence; Climate engineering; Geoengineering; Public engagement; Social experiment; Stratospheric aerosol injection","aerosol; climate change; climate modeling; experimental study; local participation; participatory approach; research work; stratosphere; uncertainty analysis; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011266735

Since the 1960's the in-cylinder pressure signal was employed to investigate the combustion process of the internal combustion engines for research purposes. Currently, the sensors cost reduction in addition to the need to comply with the strict emissions legislation has promoted a large-scale diffusion on production engines equipment. The in-cylinder pressure signal offers the opportunity to estimate with high dynamic response almost all the variables of interest for an effective engine combustion control even in case of non-conventional combustion processes (e.g. PCCI, HCCI, LTC). Furthermore, the accuracy of feed-forward control methodologies along real-life operation is affected by engine aging and production tolerances as well as environmental and driving conditions. Consequently, the control adaption through the feedback based on the in-cylinder pressure allows overcoming these issues. In this paper the features of two methodologies based on the in-cylinder pressure signal for the estimation of the Air-Fuel ratio and the in-cylinder trapped mass have been exploited in transient and steady-state conditions, respectively. Suitable post-processing of in-cylinder data has been carried out to handle the time delay with the sensors measurement and improve the estimation accuracy along the identification process. The techniques have been experimentally tested at the engine test stand on a Common-Rail turbocharged Diesel engine. The results exhibit good accuracy and a computational burden suitable with current EMS features.

In this direction, consolidation is proposed as a novel technique for energy saving in Cloud data centers. One of the major drawbacks of current studies on consolidation solution is that they focus only on one criterion and ignore other ones.

Recently, version 5.1 of the CMAQ model (v5.1) was released to the public, incorporating a large number of science updates and extended capabilities over the previous release version of the model (v5.0.2). These updates include the following: improvements in the meteorological calculations in both CMAQ and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model used to provide meteorological fields to CMAQ, updates to the gas and aerosol chemistry, revisions to the calculations of clouds and photolysis, and improvements to the dry and wet deposition in the model. Sensitivity simulations isolating several of the major updates to the modeling system show that changes to the meteorological calculations result in enhanced afternoon and early evening mixing in the model, periods when the model historically underestimates mixing. This enhanced mixing results in higher ozone (O3) mixing ratios on average due to reduced NO titration, and lower fine particulate matter (PM2. 5) concentrations due to greater dilution of primary pollutants (e.g., elemental and organic carbon). Updates to the clouds and photolysis calculations greatly improve consistency between the WRF and CMAQ models and result in generally higher O3 mixing ratios, primarily due to reduced cloudiness and attenuation of photolysis in the model. Updates to the aerosol chemistry result in higher secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations in the summer, thereby reducing summertime PM2. 5 bias (PM2. 5 is typically underestimated by CMAQ in the summer), while updates to the gas chemistry result in slightly higher O3 and PM2. 5 on average in January and July. Overall, the seasonal variation in simulated PM2. 5 generally improves in CMAQv5.1 (when considering all model updates), as simulated PM2. 5 concentrations decrease in the winter (when PM2. 5 is generally overestimated by CMAQ) and increase in the summer (when PM2. 5 is generally underestimated by CMAQ). Ozone mixing ratios are higher on average with v5.1 vs. v5.0.2, resulting in higher O3 mean bias, as O3 tends to be overestimated by CMAQ throughout most of the year (especially at locations where the observed O3 is low); however, O3 correlation is largely improved with v5.1. Sensitivity simulations for several hypothetical emission reduction scenarios show that v5.1 tends to be slightly more responsive to reductions in NOx(NO+NO2), VOC and SOx (SO2+SO4) emissions than v5.0.2, representing an improvement as previous studies have shown CMAQ to underestimate the observed reduction in O3 due to large, widespread reductions in observed emissions. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; cloud cover; concentration (composition); mixing ratio; ozone; particulate matter; photolysis; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; volatile organic compound; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018652965

Several European Member States rely heavily on Russian supplies, which shows that the EU gas supply security needs to be examined both from an internal and international perspective. Since the 2009 crisis between Russia and Ukraine, the EU has adopted several legislative tools to strengthen EU gas security of supply. The third legislative package, the security of supply Regulation (EU) 994/2010 and the Energy Infrastructure package identifying Projects of Common Interest have significantly improved the ability of the EU to face import disruptions. However, several countries remain particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of disruption.

The severe energy crises in Pakistan during the last decade has decreased the interest in drying of farm produce which is resulting huge postharvest losses due to product spoilage and nonavailability of storage facilities. This study has been carried out for the performance evaluation of newly developed hybrid solar dryer for the drying of onion, ginger and cabbage under local climatic conditions. The hybrid solar dryer has a total cross-sectional area of 0.122 m2 out of which 34% is the collector while 64% is drying section. The dryer uses solar energy for drying during daytime while assisted with backup source during night for continuous product drying. The average initial moisture content of ginger, onion and cabbage batches was measured to be 88.45, 55.76 and 72.51%, respectively, while the final moisture content after drying was 10.27, 15.69 and 15.02%, respectively. The result also shows that the initial high moisture content of the products was removed in early hours of sunshine without any expense of primary energy cost. However, the remaining small amount of hygroscopic moisture was removed using backup energy source but with lower costs as compared with conventional drying. The final moisture content was achieved between 10 and 16 h for all batches of the onion, ginger and cabbage. On an average, greater than 70% moisture of the products was removed on the expense of solar energy. The overall average efficiency of the dryer was found to be 42.79%. Practical Applications: The agro-climatic conditions of Pakistan are ranging from tropical to temperate, thus, allowing to grow 40 different kind of vegetables and 21 type of fruits. Due to lack of processing facilities, the farmers have to sell their products at very low prices. Moreover, nearly 40–50% amount of perishable products are spoiled all over the world due to lack of farm gate processing facilities. In this research, the experiments have been conducted on onion, ginger and cabbage and successful results were obtained for all the products. In the conventional solar dryer, the major problem faced was to maintain the drying rate at uniform level but these types of dryer gave unsatisfactory results during the adverse weather conditions when the solar radiation are not in the limit to dry the products. Additionally, in winter, when the day time duration is comparatively shorter and solar dryer were not capable to dry the product in a single day. The objective of the hybrid solar dryer was to use the solar energy as a primary heat source during the favorable environmental conditions and the backup system is only taken into circuit when the solar system is not capable to maintain the desired drying rate. So, this type of dryer, not only maintain the drying rate but also vanishes the inversion rate of the perishables and hence ensures the quality of the dried products. So this hybrid feature built in the dryer is more attractive option for the farming community to dry their products without any harmful effects on the products. The hybrid solar dryer is demand base technology and will find a place in the manufacturing circle to transfer this technology to the end users, stakeholders and farming community for on-farm processing of variety of perishable products for value addition. Furthermore, using hybrid solar dryer does not cause any kind of environmental pollution. On the contrary, solar dryers can help the rural and farming community to improve their living standard by earning profit through drying their on-farm perishable and agro-products while, at the same time, protecting their environment. At the same time the use of solar dryers on a large scale could be beneficial to reduce carbon emissions and the associated global warming issues. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",,"Agriculture; Carbon; Costs; Dryers (equipment); Energy policy; Environmental impact; Food additives; Global warming; Moisture; Moisture determination; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Average efficiencies; Backup energy sources; Environmental conditions; Environmental pollutions; Final moisture content; High moisture contents; Initial Moisture Content; Processing facilities; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014622823

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have the potential to be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal of this study was to select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains. Methods: Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i.e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i.e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i.e., shared laundry, supply to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e.g., CO2eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology. Results and discussion: According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank. Among roof tanks and depending on the height, a distribution strategy that concentrates demand in a laundry room was the preferable option, resulting in reductions from 25 to 54 % in most of the selected impact categories compared to distribution throughout the building. Conclusions: These results may set new urban planning standards for the design and construction of buildings from the perspective of sustainable water management. In this sense, a behavioral change regarding demand should be promoted in compact, dense urban settlements. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Environmental impact; Laundry demand; LCA; Sustainable buildings; Urban planning; Water management","rain; adaptive environmental management; Article; building; carbon footprint; catchment; controlled study; energy conservation; environmental impact assessment; life cycle assessment; Southern Europe; urban area; urbanization; water availability; water management; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982840438

CH4 fluxes were measured in situ during peak growing season for the dominant aquatic emergent plants in the Alaskan arctic coastal plain, Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva, to assess the magnitude and species-specific controls on CH4 flux. Plant biomass was a strong predictor of A. fulva CH4 flux while water depth and thaw depth were copredictors for C. aquatilis CH4 flux. We used plant and environmental data from 1971 to 1972 from the historic International Biological Program (IBP) research site near Barrow, Alaska, which we resampled in 2010–2013, to quantify changes in plant biomass and thaw depth, and used these to estimate species-specific decadal-scale changes in CH4 fluxes. A ~60% increase in CH4 flux was estimated from the observed plant biomass and thaw depth increases in tundra ponds over the past 40 years. Despite covering only ~5% of the landscape, we estimate that aquatic C. aquatilis and A. fulva account for two-thirds of the total regional CH4 flux of the Barrow Peninsula. The regionally observed increases in plant biomass and active layer thickening over the past 40 years not only have major implications for energy and water balance, but also have significantly altered land–atmosphere CH4 emissions for this region, potentially acting as a positive feedback to climate warming. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arctic; biomass; carbon; climate change; methane; permafrost; tundra; wetlands","arctic environment; biomarker; biomass; carbon cycle; climate change; grass; methane; permafrost; tundra; wetland; Alaska; Barrow; United States; Arctophila fulva; Carex aquatilis; methane; Alaska; Arctic; biomass; climate change; environmental monitoring; plant; wetland; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Biomass; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Plants; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987596942

However, the potential costs of commercial-scale CO2 storage are not well constrained, stemming from the inherent uncertainty in storage resource estimates coupled with a lack of detailed estimates of the infrastructure needed to access those resources. Storage resource estimates are highly dependent on storage efficiency values or storage coefficients, which are calculated based on ranges of uncertain geological and physical reservoir parameters. If dynamic factors (such as variability in storage efficiencies, pressure interference, and acceptable injection rates over time), reservoir pressure limitations, boundaries on migration of CO2, consideration of closed or semi-closed saline reservoir systems, and other possible constraints on the technically accessible CO2 storage resource (TASR) are accounted for, it is likely that only a fraction of the TASR could be available without incurring significant additional costs. Although storage resource estimates typically assume that any issues with pressure buildup due to CO2 injection will be mitigated by reservoir pressure management, estimates of the costs of CO2 storage generally do not include the costs of active pressure management. Production of saline waters (brines) could be essential to increasing the dynamic storage capacity of most reservoirs, but including the costs of this critical method of reservoir pressure management could increase current estimates of the costs of CO2 storage by two times, or more. Even without considering the implications for reservoir pressure management, geologic uncertainty can significantly impact CO2 storage capacities and costs, and contribute to uncertainty in carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems. Given the current state of available information and the scarcity of (data from) long-term commercial-scale CO2 storage projects, decision makers may experience considerable difficulty in ascertaining the realistic potential, the likely costs, and the most beneficial pattern of deployment of CCS as an option to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cost uncertainty; Dynamic storage capacity; Geologic CO2 storage resources; Storage efficiency",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984791555

HFC-152a and HFO-1234yf are approved for use by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and satisfy the requirements of the European Union (EU) F-Gas Regulations. HFC-152a is inherently more energy efficient than HFC-134a and HFO-1234yf and in SL-MAC systems can generate cooling during deceleration, prolong comfort during idle stop (stop/start), and allow powered cooling at times when the engine can supply additional power with the lowest incremental fuel use. SL-MAC systems can also reduce the refrigerant charge, emissions, and service costs of HFO-1234yf. The paper is informed by previous studies of secondary loop systems and an ongoing demonstration of SL-MACs designed for India where there are long hot and humid cooling seasons, relatively expensive fuel, and highly congested driving as well as uncrowded open-road driving. That demonstration determines a baseline for the cooling performance and energy efficiency of HFC-134a and tests the same parameters for HFO-1234yf and HFC-152a.

Because this cost may be alleviated by appropriate restoration measures, money is being invested in peatland restoration projects around the world. Here, we review over 25 years of restoration in Western Europe. First, we provide an overview of techniques used in different contexts and evaluate the status of the evidence base for restoration outcomes. Between 1993 and 2015, the EU-LIFE nature programme alone invested 167.6M € in 80 projects, which aim to restore over 913 km2 of peatland habitats in Western European countries, mostly in protected sites part of the Natura 2000 EU network. This represents less than 2% of the total remaining area of peatlands in these countries, most of which have been impacted to some degree by anthropogenic disturbances. Potential for restoration should be considered in nondesignated sites. We reviewed a number of case studies covering a range of restoration approaches used in different parts of Western Europe. We found that published evidence of restoration progress was limited to specific sites/areas, and in many cases lacked baseline measurements and clear goals, that is, measurable target or contemporary reference(s). We discuss barriers and opportunities to turn the tide for peatland restoration in Western Europe and promote the establishment of robust, standardized monitoring schemes. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration","biodiversity; bogs; carbon; ecosystem services; forestry; monitoring","biodiversity; bog; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; European Union; forestry practice; peatland; regional planning; restoration ecology; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014418294

Although Algeria is an oil producer and exporter, the development of renewable energies is a strategic goal for public authorities, which are giving new impetus to this sector to replace the fossil energy resources of which are becoming increasingly scarce. In this context, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a second-generation biodiesel derived from Ricinus communis feedstock is undertaken. LCA is a tool that can be used effectively in evaluating various renewable energy sources for their sustainability and can help policy makers to choose the optimal energy source for specific purpose. The life cycle of Castor bean-based biodiesel production includes the stages of cultivation, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The impact categories studied were global warming, Energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI), human health, and ecosystem. We have used the impact 2002 + evaluation method which is implemented in the SimaPro© software package. Moreover, it is the most useful method for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. Results show that among all the production stages, the cultivation process of Ricinus communis and the conversion of oil to biodiesel are the largest contributors to most of environmental impact categories. Life-cycle analysis revealed that the use of castor for biodiesel production could have many advantages like an energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI) of 2.60 and a positive contribution to climate-change reduction as revealed by a positive carbon balance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon Balance; EROEI; Impact 2002+; Life-cycle analysis; Ricinus communis biodiesel","Biodiesel; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Carbon balance; EROEI; Impact 2002; Life cycle analysis; Ricinus communis; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982179824

An approved medical waste treatment facility is the incinerator located at the northern region of Jordan which serves the four northern governorates. Two trucks are used to pickup waste from the hospitals in these governorates to be treated at the incinerator. In this paper, a route scheduling model is proposed to minimize the total travel distance which in turn minimizes transportation cost and reduces emissions. The proposed model takes into account the capacity of trucks, number of visits per week, timing between visits along with the service level required by the hospitals.

A wide range of these upsets cannot be managed by standalone control systems; plant personnel intervention is necessary sometimes. The methods needed to assist plant personnel to control and prevent abnormal process operations are gathered under abnormal situation management. Abnormal operations that lead to flare have significant economic, environmental, and safety impacts. Flaring is necessary for managing process upsets, however, it leads to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), causing negative social impacts and local transient air pollution. In addition, excessive flaring results in energy and raw material losses. These are valuable commodities that must be sustained. Therefore, flare minimization during normal and abnormal operational situations has great environmental, industrial, and societal benefits. It is not possible to quantify the impacts without understanding the properties and magnitude of these upsets. Such analysis requires extensive amount of historical data. There are large sets of design, operational, and flaring data readily available; however, the challenge when it comes to flare mitigation is in using them effectively and in a timely manner. In this Article, a systematic approach to collect, analyze and utilize historical flaring data based on current industrial practices is presented. An ethylene base case study along with its historical process and flaring incidents data is used to demonstrate the significance of using and integrating data within developed flare management strategies. In the presented case, design and historical process data are used to assess the environmental impacts of abnormal incidents and to identify underlying causes and indicators that lead to process upset, that is, abnormal situations. The data sets are utilized within an optimization algorithm to identify design alternatives to mitigate process incidents and reduce its root causes. The paper highlights the challenges that are faced by environmental agencies in terms of data utilization and documentation.

Multiple epidemiological studies have now linked components of air pollution to diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a linkage with plausibility based on the shared mechanisms of inflammation. Additional plausibility appears to be provided by findings from our studies in mice of exposures from postnatal day (PND) 4–7 and 10–13 (human 3rd trimester equivalent), to concentrated ambient ultrafine (UFP) particles, considered the most reactive component of air pollution, at levels consistent with high traffic areas of major U.S. cities and thus highly relevant to human exposures. These exposures, occurring during a period of marked neuro- and gliogenesis, unexpectedly produced a pattern of developmental neurotoxicity notably similar to multiple hypothesized mechanistic underpinnings of ASD, including its greater impact in males.

The relationship between dengue fever cases and climatic factors such as relative humidity and temperature was investigated during 2006–2009 to determine whether there is any relationship between dengue fever cases and climatic parameters in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. A generalised linear model (GLM) with a break-point was used to determine how different levels of temperature and relative humidity affected the distribution of the number of cases of dengue fever. Break-point analysis was performed to modelled the effect before and after a break-point (change point) in the explanatory parameters under various scenarios. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and cross validation (CV) were used to assess the performance of the models. The results showed that maximum temperature and mean relative humidity are most probably the better predictors of the number of dengue fever cases in Jeddah. In this study three scenarios were modelled: no time lag, 1-week lag and 2-weeks lag. Among these scenarios, the 1-week lag model using mean relative humidity as an explanatory variable showed better performance. This study showed a clear relationship between the meteorological variables and the number of dengue fever cases in Jeddah. The results also demonstrated that meteorological variables can be successfully used to estimate the number of dengue fever cases for a given period of time. Break-point analysis provides further insight into the association between meteorological parameters and dengue fever cases by dividing the meteorological parameters into certain break-points. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","A. aegypti; Break-point; Dengue fever; GLM; Jeddah; Relative humidity; Temperature","dengue fever; environmental factor; linearity; mosquito; relative humidity; temperature anomaly; Akaike information criterion; Article; break-point analysis; city; controlled study; dengue; disease association; environmental factor; environmental temperature; human; humidity; meteorological parameters; meteorology; performance; prediction; Saudi Arabia; statistical model; temporal distribution; validation study; climate; dengue; incidence; season; statistical model; temperature; Jeddah; Makkah [Saudi Arabia]; Saudi Arabia; Cities; Climate; Dengue; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Linear Models; Saudi Arabia; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008978654

Nevertheless, the accumulation of the water in the anode and cathode channels can lead to a local fuel starvation deteriorating the performance and the durability of PEMFCs. In this study, a novel design for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel-cell stack was presented which could achieve higher fuel utilization without using hydrogen and oxygen recirculation devices such as hydrogen pumps or ejectors that consume parasitic power and require additional control schemes. The basic concept of the innovatively proposed design was to divide the cells of a stack into several stages by conducting the outlet gas of each stage to a separator and reentering it into the next stage; thereby, a multistage anode and cathode system was prepared. In this relatively ingenious design, a higher gaseous flow rate was maintained at the cell outlet, even under dead-end conditions resulted in a reduced purge-gas emission by avoiding the accumulation of liquid water in the cells. The results revealed that proposed design had the same polarization curve as the open-end mode, leading to an enhanced PEMFC performance. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Cascade type stack; Dead-end operation; PEM fuel cell; Purge time","Anodes; Cathodes; Ejectors (pumps); Electrodes; Electrolytes; Fuel cells; Polyelectrolytes; Dead-end operation; Experimental analysis; Oxygen recirculation; PEM fuel cell; Polarization curves; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Purge time; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017348973

Energy flow and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of soybean production were analyzed based on four major production scenarios in this region. The study aimed to evaluate fuel and energy consumption and GHG emissions in order to identify and introduce the most efficient and environmentally friendly scenarios in the region. Four scenarios were included: Scenarios I, II, III and IV. The first two scenarios are known as mechanized scenarios and constitute the production systems adopted by the practices of local farmers in recent years. Scenario I included modern equipment, e.g. no-till, gun-sprinklers system, and high amount of chemical use. Scenario II, encompassed combination machine, center pivot-sprinklers system, and high consumption of fertilizers and chemicals applied by most of the farmers. Scenarios III and IV are known as conventional scenarios: where all operations (i.e. tillage, sowing and spraying) were done with less powerful tractors (60–75 hp) with manually performed fertilizer treatments. These scenarios were different only in terms of tillage operation. In this research, data were collected from 26 farmers using a face-to-face questionnaire-based survey, in 2015. Results revealed that the highest (3.18) energy use efficiency was obtained in Scenario IV (conventional scenario). Water consumption in Scenario II was less than other scenarios. Also, the lowest amount of GHG emissions was 1265.1 kg eq-CO2 ha−1 in Scenario IV and the highest amount belonged to Scenario II (2969.2 kg eq-CO2 ha−1). These results demonstrate that electricity accounted for the highest energy use in Scenarios I (78%) and II (48%), while fuel was the predominant energy consumed in Scenarios III (44%) and IV (37%). In general, conventional scenarios were found to be more environmentally friendly in Gorgan. These results revealed that there is a huge potential for improving energy efficiency in studied scenarios, especially in mechanized scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conventional scenarios; Energy ratio; Mechanized scenarios; Sprinkler irrigation systems","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Chemical equipment; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hose; Iodine; Nitrogen fixation; Soybean oil; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Surveys; Combination machines; Conventional scenarios; Energy flow analysis; Energy ratio; Energy-use efficiency; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mechanized scenarios; Sprinkler irrigation; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015789144

However, studies of SLA variation across relevant spatial and temporal scales are lacking. While remote sensing is a fast and efficient approach to quantify vegetation parameters, there are insufficient studies estimating SLA from remotely sensed data. This article aims at finding efficient hyperspectral indices for fast and accurate estimation of SLA from leaf and canopy spectral measurements. Validation of our results with data measured at leaf and canopy scale as well as with experimental datasets simulated using PROSPECT (at leaf level) and INFORM (at canopy level) revealed SLA was predicted accurately by several indices, such as simple ratio and normalized index types. Most of the bands sensitive to SLA selected using these indices were in the 1300–1800 nm spectral region. At leaf level, a ratio index at bands1370 nm, 1615 nm performed strongly (R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 13.66 cm2/g) during cross-validation. The multiband indices with 920 nm, 1675 nm, 1335 nm and 1345 nm, 1675 nm, 1850 nm central wavelengths were also among the top performing indices, with R2 &gt; 0.90 for both measured and simulated leaf level data. At canopy level, the soil adjusted ratio vegetation index (with a band setting of 1537 nm, 1543 nm) showed that the hyperspectral data from HySpex airborne imagery accurately estimated SLA (R2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 13.30 cm2/g). Generally at canopy level the potential indices for accurate retrieval of SLA from HySpex imagery were two-band indices with soil line information. The discrepancy observed in the performance and band combinations of vegetation indices at leaf and canopy scales can be explained by external factors such as canopy structure, soil background, illumination and sensor configuration which affect the signal when moving from leaf to canopy level. Our findings suggest the availability and suitability of a wide range of existing vegetation indices for assessing SLA accurately and rapidly from remotely sensed data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy; HySpex; Indices; INFORM; Leaf; PROSPECT; Specific leaf area (SLA)","airborne sensing; canopy; canopy reflectance; ecosystem modeling; estimation method; image analysis; model validation; multispectral image; optimization; performance assessment; physiological response; remote sensing; vegetation index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010960632

One way to address these concerns is by implementing ecological principles to manage agroecosystems for environmental and economic benefits. This chapter examines diverse crop rotations, cover crops, and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems as examples of sustainable intensification. Long-term diverse crop rotations, cover crops, no-tillage systems, and ICL systems alter SOC dynamics, microbial activity, and impact ecological services such as nutrient cycling and water quality. Research has shown that effects of sustainable intensification on increasing soil carbon content and improving ecological services such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved nutrient cycling often require long-term sustained management. Short-term effects have been observed but less frequently. The observed impacts of sustainable intensification are location-dependent, being sensitive to the local climate, soil, and details of management practice implementation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The technique of repeated digital photographs to monitor plant phenology (phenocams) has increased due to its low-cost investment, reduced size, easy set up installation, and the possibility of handling high-resolution near-remote data. Considering the widespread use of phenocams worldwide, our main goals here are: (i) to provide a step-by-step guide for phenocam set up in the tropics, reinforce its appliance as an efficient tool for monitoring tropical phenology and foster networking, (ii) to discuss phenocam applications for biological conservation, management, and ecological restoration. We provide the concepts and properties for image analysis which allow representing the phenological status of the vegetation. The association of a long-term imagery data with local sensors (e.g., meteorological stations and surface-atmosphere flux towers) allows a wide range of studies, especially linking phenological patterns to climatic drivers; and the impact of climate changes on plant responses. We show phenocams applications for conservation as to document disturbances and changes on vegetation structure, such as deforestation, fire events, and flooding and the vegetation recovery. Networks of phenocams are growing globally and represent an important tool for conservation and restoration, as it provides hourly to daily information of monitored systems spread over several sites, ecosystems, and climatic zones.

Human trials conducted so far by several manufactures in a variety of clinical indications, including trauma, and elective surgeries have failed and no product has gained the Food and Drug Administration approval for human use. Safety concerns due to frequent incidences of hemodynamic, cardiac events, and even death led to the termination of some of these trials. Several second generation HBOC products that have been chemically and/or genetically modified (or in some cases ligated with carbon monoxide (CO)) found a new clinical application in conditions as complex as sickle cell disease (SCD). By virtue of higher oxygen affinity (P50) (R-state), and smaller size, HBOCs may be able to reach the microvasculature unload of oxygen to reverse the cycles of sickling/unsickling of the deoxy-sickle cell Hb (HbS) (T-state), thus preventing vaso-occlusion, a central event in SCD pathophysiology. However, biochemically, it is thought that outside the red blood cell (due to frequent hemolysis), free HbS or infused HBOCs are capable of interfering with a number of oxidative and signaling pathways and may, thus, negate any benefit that HBOCs may provide. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using HBOCs in SCD. © 2017 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Blood substitutes; Heme oxidation; Hemoglobin; Sickle cell disease","blood substitute; carbon monoxide; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; heme oxygenase; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A; hemospan; hrc 101; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; macrogol; methemoglobin; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; polymerized hemoglobin; reactive oxygen metabolite; sanguinate; toll like receptor 4; unclassified drug; blood substitute; DNA methylation; enzyme activity; human; hypoxia; inflammation; oxidation; oxidative stress; oxygen affinity; oxygen transport; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Presbyterian; protein expression; Review; sickle cell anemia; signal transduction; survival; Anemia, Sickle Cell; clinical trial (topic); drug approval; drug effects; Anemia, Sickle Cell; Blood Substitutes; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Approval; Humans; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009754849

Thousands of mountains and hills, both on land and under the sea, are a geological consequence of being located on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire."" Being situated here has meant that different parts of the country are periodically subjected to disasters, including earthquakes and tsunamis. As a result, the more than 200 million people now inhabiting both the large and very small islands in the region have developed strategies to survive by anticipating and adapting to changing local conditions. Throughout its history Indonesia has lived with environmental hazards and disasters-great losses were suffered not only by the poor and those living in remote areas but also by the relatively wealthy who live in major cities. Since the 1980s, development policies of the country began to incorporate environmental issues, and the environmental impact of infrastructural development programs began to be examined carefully before implementation. Development considerations should include anticipation of the impacts of both tsunamis as well as climate change. In the past, planning for environmental impacts was separate from development planning. Recently, however, Indonesia's National Development Planning Institution started integrating all sectors into a single National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation. This paper elaborates the changing awareness of environmental issues, outlines development problems, and recommends further improvements to reflect the complex changes already occurring in ocean-island settlements in this archipelagic region. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054939163

The sales of BEVs have shown a strong growth trend in the U.S., but continued use depends on effective ICT based enabling technologies to link BEVs with its environment to provide information such as real-Time battery charge levels, location of nearest charging infrastructure, route options to optimize battery performance and energy price in a given area within the BEVs vehicle grid communication (VGC) infrastructure. In an effort to build BEV charging infrastructure aided by ICT enabling technologies to promote and deploy BEV, a case study is presented in which 24 BEVs and 35 Chargepoint charging stations are deployed across communities in Nebraska. Data analysis is used to gain insight into charging times, user charging habits, economic and environmental saving, information that can be used by ICT enabling technologies to optimize the user experience, smart grid operation and wide spread adoption of BEVs. © 2016 IEEE.","Battery electric vehicle; Environmental benefits; ICT; smart grid; VGC","Battery electric vehicles; Charging time; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery performance; Charging infrastructures; Economic and environmental benefits; Enabling technologies; Environmental benefits; Information and Communication Technologies; Smart grid; Vehicle penetration; Vehicle to vehicle communications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017600332

Fuel analysis revealed that the ULSDs differed based on the ratio of low to high molecular weight (LMW/HMW) n-alkanes. Desulfoglaeba alkanexedens, a sulfate-reducing bacterium capable of degrading LMW n-alkanes, was used as a positive control and to explore the impact of bioaugmentation. Metagenomic analysis was conducted to determine the genetic potential for anaerobic biodegradation of a range of hydrocarbons. Initial sulfate reduction rates were faster in incubations amended with ULSDs containing a higher ratio of LMW/HMW n-alkanes, but total sulfate loss was similar for all fuels. Sulfate removal in bioaugmented incubations exceeded stoichiometric expectations calculated for the mineralization of all paraffins. In combination with metagenomic analysis, these data confirmed that other microorganisms utilized hydrocarbons beyond the range exhibited by D. alkanexedens. A positive correlation between coupon weight loss and sulfate loss was observed, and pitting corrosion was more extensive in non-sterile incubations compared to sterile controls. This study demonstrates that while ULSDs vary in their susceptibility to early stage biodegradation, compositional differences were less important for overall fuel deterioration and steel biocorrosion patterns. Further, bioaugmentation stimulated other hydrocarbonclastic marine microorganisms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioaugmentation; Biocorrosion; Fuel biodegradation; Metagenomics; qPCR; Ultra low sulfur diesel","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon steel; Corrosion; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Microorganisms; Paraffins; Pitting; Polymerase chain reaction; Reduction; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Bio-augmentation; Biocorrosion; Metagenomics; qPCR; Ultra-low sulfur diesel; Biodegradation; anoxic conditions; biodegradation; bioremediation; corrosion; hydrocarbon; marine environment; metabolism; microbial community; molecular analysis; pollutant removal; polymerase chain reaction; steel; sulfate-reducing bacterium; sulfur; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009154384

Focusing on household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case study was carried out in a poor area in Bangladesh that is prone to natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in southwestern coastal Bangladesh, in the Koyra sub-district, in late 2009. We asked 360 households affected by the May 2009 tropical Cyclone Aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges, and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average economic damage of USD 144 for each household in the first year after Aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages, asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households’ degree of information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more resilient to hazard shocks. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climatic hazard risk; Coastal Bangladesh; Coping mechanism; Cyclone Aila","coastal zone; coping strategy; disaster management; hazard management; perception; socioeconomic conditions; tropical cyclone; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016785250

One of the most cost-effective measures to meet energy reduction targets, as clearly specified in the ""European Economic Recovery Plan"", is to address performance of existing building stock. Buildings account for about 40% of the EUenergy consumption and one third of the GHG emissions. In particular, the state of the European building stock contains a high improvement potential. REtrofitting Solutions and Services for the enhancement of Energy Efficiency in Public Edification (RESSEEPE) is an EU funded project that focuses on the refurbishment of existing public buildings in three European cities: Coventry (UK), Barcelona (SP) and Skelleftea (SW). The aim of the project is to bring together design and decision making tools and innovative building fabric manufacturers to collaborate and improve building performance through low impact retrofitting interventions to achieve energy reduction in the region of 50%. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the process of low-energy retrofit and the selection and evaluation of low-energy technologies for retrofit. Specifically the paper looks at the decision making procedure to select advanced building technologies for high energy performance retrofitting, using Coventry University estates as a case study. The paper reviews innovative technologies and using analytical methods investigates the benefits of these potential technologies as applied to existing case study buildings within Coventry University.

The RESSEEPE framework is being validated by a strong demonstration programme, envisaging the renovation of 102,000 square metres of public buildings. The core idea of the project is to technologically advance, adapt, demonstrate and assess a number of innovative retrofit technologies implemented on several pilot cases with different climate conditions across Europe (Coventry-UK, Barcelona-Spain and Skellefteå-Sweden) to ensure a high potential replication of the retrofit solutions. The three demonstration sites are involved as the main promoters of a very ambitious district level renovation, demonstrating a systemic approach to technology installation and evaluation, taking into account the benefits of a set of technologies, which properly combined in terms of cost effectiveness and energy performance could achieve reductions around 50% in terms of energy consumption. Coventry University is acting as a Living Lab in order to test some advanced technologies already in the market and others developed specifically within the RESSEEPE project. Those innovative technologies implemented in the pilot case are: Vacuum Insulated Panels, PCM tubes, Ventilated façade with Photovoltaic Panels, Electrochromic windows and Aerogel Mortar. The main feature of this installation is that it acts as a testing bed for where to install different advanced technologies covering specific areas of the building, rather than refurbishing it as a whole. This paper documents the testing of prototype technologies in a pilot case in Coventry University, analysing the process of selection of the different technologies and showing all the challenges faced during installation and coordination of installation activities. The installation process is shown and discussed, highlighting the difficulties, setbacks and challenges faced during the low carbon refurbishment. The key issues are related to technical and health and safety risks. Also, to financial, coordination, planning and legislation barriers etc. It will also show ways forward and solutions adopted. The study also analyses the process of monitoring the energy performance of the spaces retrofitted and the data obtained through the monitoring of the building before and after the installation of the different technologies. The idea behind the Living Lab pilot case is to monitor the performance of those installations in isolation in order to obtain results which allow us to make conclusions about the replicability of the technologies selected in other locations. Ultimately, what is discussed is the overall process followed. This discussion seeks to show the lessons learnt throughout the process and to obtain conclusions from the barriers and engagement issues faced during the installation when retrofitting a public building. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Living lab; Low-energy retrofit; Performance modelling and monitoring; Public buildings; Stakeholder engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016094597

A new customized LCA tool is developed for the comparison of conventional gasoline and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), which utilizes a dynamic vehicle simulation approach to calculate realistic, fundamental science based fuel economy data from actual drive cycles, vehicle specifications, road grade, engine performance, fuel cell degradation effects, and regenerative braking. The total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and life cycle cost of the vehicles are compared for the case of hydrogen production by electrolysis in British Columbia, Canada. A 72% reduction in total GHG emission is obtained for switching from gasoline vehicles to FCVs. While fuel cell performance degradation causes 7% and 3% increases in lifetime fuel consumption and GHG emission, respectively, regenerative braking improves the fuel economy by 23% and reduces the total GHG emission by 10%. The cost assessment results indicate that the current FCV technology is approximately $2,100 more costly than the equivalent gasoline vehicle based on the total lifetime cost including purchase and fuel cost. However, prospective enhancements in fuel cell durability could potentially reduce the FCV lifetime cost below that of gasoline vehicles. Overall, the present results indicate that fuel cell vehicles are becoming both technologically and economically viable compared with incumbent vehicles, and provide a realistic option for deep reductions in emissions from transportation.

Sedum species, which are succulent perennials, are commonly used in extensive green roofs due to their shallow root system and ability to withstand long water deficiencies. Here we examined CO2 fixation and emission rates for Mediterranean Sedum sediforme on green-roof experimental plots. During late winter to early spring, we monitored CO2 concentrations inside transparent tents placed over 1 m2 plots and followed gas exchange at the leaf level using a portable gas-exchange system. We found high rates of CO2 emission at daytime, which is when CO2 concentration in the city is the highest. Both plot- and leaf-scale measurements showed that these CO2 emissions were not fully compensated by the nighttime uptake. We conclude that although carbon sequestration may only be a secondary benefit of green roofs, for improving this ecosystem service, other plant species than Sedum should also be considered for use in green roofs, especially in Mediterranean and other semi-arid climates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; CO2 domes; Ecosystem services; Living roofs","Atmospheric composition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Roofs; Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; Concentration levels; Ecosystem services; Experimental plots; Extensive green roofs; Semi-arid climate; Shallow root system; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; angiosperm; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); dry season; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; gas exchange; roof; semiarid region; air pollution; Article; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; concentration (parameters); daytime; ecosystem; environmental parameters; gas exchange; greenhouse; greenhouse gas; seasonal variation; Sedum; semiarid climate; spring; winter; carbon sequestration; city; growth, development and aging; Israel; season; Sedum; Mediterranean Region; Sedum; Sedum sediforme; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Cities; Ecosystem; Israel; Seasons; Sedum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028274750

The methodology of the study permits a comprehensive and comparative analysis of existing studies on (renewable and non-renewable) energy-growth-emission nexus in order to draw some implications for policy and research. The survey revealed the extent of the spread of studies across issues, time and geographical space (countries and regions). It also disclosed the range of methodological approaches adopted to analyse the issues over time and the frequency of their use. It unravelled the varied findings across countries and regions given the diverse methods employed and specific features of the economies analysed. Arising from the literature survey, this study highlights the existing gaps in the literature and new direction for policy and research. The general policy implication of the findings of this study is that pollution effect of energy-growth nexus should be taken into consideration in policy formulation for sustainable development. Further, the design of regional and global policies should recognise the fact that energy-growth-emission linkages varied across countries even in the same region. Some new direction for research on renewable and non-renewable energy-growth-emission linkages pointed out in this survey includes the following.

Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) is an important tool to screen out plants based on their tolerance or sensitivity level to different air pollutants. The present study was aimed to identify the sensitive and tolerant plant species in the vicinity of brick kilns in the Rawalpindi city. To determine the susceptibility level of the selected plant species, four biochemical parameters, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll content, relative water content and pH of leaf extract, were assessed and APTI was calculated. Plant sampling was carried out with increasing distance of 100, 300 and 500 m around three brick kiln sites and APTI values were calculated by following the standard methods. The results of the study revealed that among nine studied plant species, Calotropis procera (APTI = 20.05) and Althernanthera pungens (APTI = 17.13) were found to be the most tolerant species, whereas Malva neglecta (APTI = 8.83) was found to be the most sensitive species. Inconsistent trend of variations was seen in the APTI values at each site. The present study suggested that the most tolerant species, C. procera and A. pungens, could be grown in the vicinity of such pollution sources as a remedial measure of brick kiln pollution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution tolerance index; Ascorbic acid; Bio-indicator; Brick kilns; Chlorophyll contents","ascorbic acid; chlorophyll; air pollutant; industrial waste; ascorbic acid; atmospheric pollution; biochemical composition; bioindicator; chlorophyll; industrial location; pH; plant extract; pollution tolerance; source-sink dynamics; water content; air pollution; air pollution tolerance index; Alternanthera; Althernanthera pungens; Article; biochemical analysis; Calotropis procera; chlorophyll content; clinical assessment; controlled study; Croton; Croton bonplandianum; Datura innoxia; Datura prospera; environmental parameters; Euphorbia; Euphorbia helioscopia; Malva; Malva neglecta; nonhuman; oilseed turnip; Pakistan; Parthenium hysterophorus; pH; plant; plant ecology; plant growth; plant leaf; sensitivity analysis; Triticum aestivium; Triticum aestivum; water content; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; industrial waste; metabolism; plant; prevention and control; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Rawalpindi; Calotropis procera; Malva neglecta; Mimosa; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Industrial Waste; Pakistan; Plant Leaves; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007559177

This study explores the potential energy generation from olive cake (OC) in the Palestinian territories. The findings of the study confirmed that there is a high-energy potential to be derived from OC and that powering olive mills by small-scale generators using OC is feasible. It was found that the amount of electricity that can be produced by OC combustion constitutes about 1.3% of all electricity consumption in 2009. Furthermore, numerous environmental benefits can be derived from using OC as biomass, notably the reduction of hazardous emission and the reduction of untreated OC. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","biomass; electricity generation; olive cake; Palestine","Biohazards; Biomass; Potential energy; Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Environmental benefits; Hazardous emissions; Olive cake; Palestine; Palestinian territories; Small-scale generators; Electric power generation; alternative energy; biomass power; electricity generation; electricity supply; power generation; Palestine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923902683

A large penetration of EVs threatens the stability of the electric grid but also provides a potential for grid ancillary services, which strengthens the grid, if well managed. This paper incorporates grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) options in the travel path of logistics sector EVs. The paper offers a complete solution methodology to the multivariant EV routing problem rather than considering only one or two variants of the problem like in previous research. The variants considered include a stochastic environment, multiple dispatchers, time window constraints, simultaneous and nonsimultaneous pickup and delivery, and G2V and V2G service options. Stochastic demand forecasts of the G2V and V2G services at charging stations are modeled using hidden Markov model. The developed solver is based on a modified custom genetic algorithm incorporated with embedded Markov decision process and trust region optimization methods. An agent-based communication architecture is adopted to ensure peer-to-peer correspondence capability of the EV, customer, charging station, and dispatcher entities. The results indicate that optimal route for EVs can be achieved while satisfying all constraints and providing V2G ancillary grid service. © 2015 IEEE.","Electric vehicle (EV); genetic algorithm (GA); hidden Markov models (HMMs); Markov decision process (MDP); vehicle routing problem (VRP); vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Hidden Markov models; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Trellis codes; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Agent-based communication; Hidden markov models (HMMs); Markov Decision Processes; Stochastic environment; Time window constraint; Trust-region optimization method; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034648856

However, there is a need to develop a framework to guide industrial site planners to most efficiently exploit and benefit from the suite of Pinch Analysis tools in an integrated manner towards systematically planning a low CO2 emissions, while strongly promoting cleaner production alternatives. This work presents an attempt to develop a systematic framework for low CO2 industrial site planning, using an integrated set of Pinch Analysis related tools with algebraic algorithms established to complement the graphical representation. The proposed framework consists of four main stages. The first stage involves the baseline study of resources. The second stage involves Total Site Heat Integration to maximise heat recovery among multiple units, while simultaneously targeting for cogeneration potential. The third stage involves application of Power Pinch Analysis to optimise power allocation and integration of hybrid renewable energy system. CO2 Emissions Pinch Analysis is applied in the final stage to achieve the minimum CO2 targets via implementation of a CO2 emissions management hierarchy (CMH) to systematically explore options to maximise CO2 reductions. Application of this systematic framework to an illustrative industrial site case study resulted in an overall reduction of 56.7% in heat, 74.3% in power, and 99.8% in CO2 emissions. This proposed tool for low CO2 industrial site planning is available for designers, planners and industrial site owners to optimise integrated energy and CO2 emissions for Total Sites, starting from the individual process units, and ready to be extended to Locally Integrated Energy Systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 Emissions Pinch Analysis (CEPA); Industrial planning; Low CO2; Pinch Analysis; Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA); Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI)","Industrial emissions; Planning; Pollution control; Renewable energy resources; Waste heat; Cogeneration potential; Graphical representations; Heat integration; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Industrial planning; Integrated energy systems; Low CO2; Pinch analysis; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997610552

Global satellite-driven estimates of plant CO2 uptake (gross primary productivity, GPP) have been found to not accurately account for Sahelian conditions, particularly the impact of canopy water stress. Here, we identify the main biophysical limitations that induce canopy water stress in Sahelian vegetation and evaluate the relationships between field data and Earth observation-derived spectral products for up-scaling GPP. We find that plant-available water and vapor pressure deficit together control the GPP of Sahelian vegetation through their impact on the greening and browning phases. Our results show that a multiple linear regression (MLR) GPP model that combines the enhanced vegetation index, land surface temperature, and the short-wave infrared reflectance (Band 7, 2105-2155 nm) of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite sensor was able to explain between 88% and 96% of the variability of eddy covariance flux tower GPP at three Sahelian sites (overall = 89%). The MLR GPP model presented here is potentially scalable at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Given the scarcity of field data on CO2 fluxes in the Sahel, this scalability is important due to the low number of flux towers in the region. © 2017 by the authors.","Browning; Drought; Earth observation; Greening; Gross primary productivity; Plant stress; Plant-available water; Sahel; Soil moisture; Vapor pressure deficit","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Drought; Hydrostatic pressure; Image reconstruction; Infrared radiation; Linear regression; Observatories; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Soil moisture; Available water; Browning; Earth observations; Greening; Gross primary productivity; Plant stress; Sahel; Vapor pressure deficit; Vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019370047

We investigate the impact of key processes that control the dust outflow, i.e., the emission flux, convection schemes and the chemical aging of mineral dust, by using the EMAC model following Abdelkader et al. (2015). To characterize the dust outflow over the Atlantic Ocean, we distinguish two geographic zones: (i) dust interactions within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the dust-ITCZ interaction zone (DIZ), and (ii) the adjacent dust transport over the Atlantic Ocean (DTA) zone. In the latter zone, the dust loading shows a steep and linear gradient westward over the Atlantic Ocean since particle sedimentation is the dominant removal process, whereas in the DIZ zone aerosol-cloud interactions, wet deposition and scavenging processes determine the extent of the dust outflow. Generally, the EMAC simulated dust compares well with CALIPSO observations; however, our reference model configuration tends to overestimate the dust extinction at a lower elevation and underestimates it at a higher elevation. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Caribbean responds to the dust emission flux only when the emitted dust mass is significantly increased over the source region in Africa by a factor of 10. These findings point to the dominant role of dust removal (especially wet deposition) in transatlantic dust transport. Experiments with different convection schemes have indeed revealed that the transatlantic dust transport is more sensitive to the convection scheme than to the dust emission flux parameterization. To study the impact of dust chemical aging, we focus on a major dust outflow in July 2009. We use the calcium cation as a proxy for the overall chemical reactive dust fraction and consider the uptake of major inorganic acids (i.e., H2SO4, HNO3 and HCl) and their anions, i.e., sulfate (SO42-), bisulfate (HSO4-), nitrate (NO3-) and chloride (Cl-), on the surface of mineral particles. The subsequent neutralization reactions with the calcium cation form various salt compounds that cause the uptake of water vapor from the atmosphere, i.e., through the chemical aging of dust particles leading to an increase of 0.15 in the AOD under subsaturated conditions (July 2009 monthly mean). As a result of the radiative feedback on surface winds, dust emissions increased regionally. On the other hand, the aged dust particles, compared to the non-aged particles, are more efficiently removed by both wet and dry deposition due to the increased hygroscopicity and particle size (mainly due to water uptake). The enhanced removal of aged particles decreases the dust burden and lifetime, which indirectly reduces the dust AOD by 0.05 (monthly mean). Both processes can be significant (major dust outflow, July 2009), but the net effect depends on the region and level of dust chemical aging. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; atmospheric convection; calcium; dust; neutralization; optical depth; outflow; scavenging (chemistry); Africa; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015872714

This system of land use distinguishes itself from the other systems, such as sole crop cultivation and afforestation on croplands only through its potential to sequester higher amounts of carbon (in the above- and belowground tree biomass) than the aforementioned two systems. According to Kyoto protocol, agroforestry is recognized as an afforestation activity that, in addition to sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) to soil, conserves biodiversity, protects cropland, works as a windbreak, and provides food and feed to human and livestock, pollen for honey bees, wood for fuel, and timber for shelters construction. Agroforestry is more attractive as a land use practice for the farming community worldwide instead of cropland and forestland management systems. This practice is a win–win situation for the farming community and for the environmental sustainability. This review presents agroforestry potential to counter the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 by sequestering it in above- and belowground biomass. The role of agroforestry in climate change mitigation worldwide might be recognized to its full potential by overcoming various financial, technical, and institutional barriers. Carbon sequestration in soil by various agricultural systems can be simulated by various models but literature lacks reports on validated models to quantify the agroforestry potential for carbon sequestration. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate variability; Environmental sustainability; Forest; Land use management; Model; Soil","aboveground biomass; afforestation; agroforestry; belowground biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; cultivation; international agreement; land use; mitigation; model validation; Apis mellifera; carbon; soil; agriculture; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental protection; forestry; soil; tree; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014697529
